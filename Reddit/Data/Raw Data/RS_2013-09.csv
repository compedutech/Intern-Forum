Everyone else seems to think this is good news, but I see it as losing an entire year I thought I had to get internship experience and figure out my future.

I am applying to the combined degree (4+1-ish) program at my school, and have essentially been assured that I will get in. However, I need funding, and I don't know if I'll get it here, so I need to apply elsewhere as well. I don't qualify for any kind of need-based financial aid.

The good news is that my GPA is a 3.9 and my verbal and quantitative GRE scores were both 165. My analytical writing score was 4.5, which is not as great as I feel I could have done, but as of now I haven't made plans to retake it.

The bad news is that my resume is completely barren. Hardly any extracurriculars, no internship or research experience, just a bit of on and off waiting tables. My capstone experience in my final semester will be a public service internship in my field, which I definitely plan to casually mention in my application essay, but I obviously can't preemptively put it on my resume when I don't even know what it'll be yet.

Am I kidding myself? I don't know if I can get into these schools, let alone get money out of them. 

So guys, what do I do? Do I apply to the schools on that list, or do I look for state schools with public health programs? Where am I most likely to get funding?

I have a few. Feel free to add more in the comments.

1. Solomon Handcock. This will probably be part of season 3 if they report on Edward Snowden.

2. Trolls and death threats. Are the threats real? Will the people responsible caught? Again, they could connect this with Anonymous in season 3.

3. TMI and Reese. Did they shut down TMI? Did Reese donate any money to a school? I would be fun to see TMI go online only, ala ""Newsweek"", after it's disclosed to Leona that the print version has been losing money for months.

4. Jennifer Johnson. What happened to her after the incident at North Western? Did she have to sign anything to prevent her from suing Will or AWM before she could be an intern? It wouldn't have been a big issue but lawyers don't like loose ends.

5. Did Gary ever take protection money when he worked at TMI? Did he ever witness it directly or was it just office gossip? Not that I want another lawsuit story but it would be interesting to see his character get into trouble for his past indiscretions.

Just a few and all I can think of right now. I've added my own ideas about TMI, North Western and Gary. Add more plot points that are missing endings, make up your own based on season 1 or tell me how I'm wrong and/or an idiot. Either way, post below."

1lja7g,2,2013-09-01,A question for substitute teachers with an interest in science,bookchaser,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1lja7g/a_question_for_substitute_teachers_with_an/,"Sorry, no tl;dr. It's a complex, sad situation...

I'm a parent at a piss-poor Title 1 elementary school toying with a way to improve our science education. 

Imagine a spare classroom refashioned for science instruction.  I'd like someone (likely a substitute teacher) to present hands-on science experiments. This person would work with teachers at each grade level to develop experiments that compliment their existing curriculum.

It's not a full-time position, but would be a full day's work for however many days a week it ends up being (allowing for regular substitute teaching in the remaining days).

In our rural, remote region, substitute teachers come fresh out of a local college and toil away at minimum wage for several years until they can land a career position or give up and leave our area.

I'd be drumming up funding from grants and direct fundraising. We'd be paying just a little more that minimum wage (whatever I can swing), unless we land a nice grant.

THE QUESTION FOR YOU...

Would this teaching scenario be more attractive to you than doing the daily substitute circuit at different schools each day?  

The main draw, I hope, is that we would be providing the teacher a more satisfying experience than substituting provides, and better material for his or her resume, with slightly better compensation.

I understand this position would get vacated as frequently as every year as the science teacher lands a permanent position at another school.  

We'd be compensating the initial science teacher for developing the curriculum that would function as a foundation for future teachers to work/grow from.

And yes, I understand this proposal is insulting/depressing, exploiting the crappy situation that substitute teachers are in. But from my end, my kids attend a school where many staff positions have been lost or dramatically scaled back due to years of budget cuts. Low income parents now cover whatever part of staff salaries they can. School library? Yeah, it would have disappeared last year, same with classroom aides (which we can only fund for 1 hour per class per day, a big boost over our funding only 50 minutes and only in kinder classrooms last year). Our school psychologist is a college intern. The school nurse comes in for a few hours each week only to do legal paperwork. A kid needs medication? The parent comes to school to administer it. And so on.

I'm really pegging this idea on finding pots of money earmarked for science education, of which there seem to be quite a few... and there being substitute teachers who would prefer doing science instruction for a portion of the school year instead of random substituting the entire time."

I will graduate from a UC next December, and will not be able to go on to grad school/PhD program due to low GPA. 

I am a Pharmaceutical Chemistry major, psychology minor. I love and have an extreme passion for lab and structure. I was told by my advisor that there aren't job opportunities in the chemistry industry for people who only have a BS, that I need at least a Masters to do anything.

 Please let me know if you know this to be wrong! I am very stressed out as I love to have a plan for everything. I'm quite worried that I will end up having a job that does not require my degree at all.

I know I'm not stupid (for awhile there I thought I might be), but my GPA is definitely too low to move on to grad school (lower than a 2.5). I'm just not as intelligent as everyone else, and it has definitely been a struggle accepting that.

I don't know why I'm posting this. Honestly, I think I need the catharsis of just pouring it out in a list. I have a wonderful, supportive boyfriend, but talking to just him isn't enough.

So, this week was fucking hell. It seemed like every misogynist in the world had a meeting where they agreed to convene on my life and fuck with me.

A few things happened from Monday through Thursday that weren't a huge deal, but bugged the shit out of me.Most notably, one of my professors won't call on me anymore because I a.) used the word privilege when talking about Durkheim's fucking INTEGRATION THEORY and b.) deigned to agree with Marx about female oppression.

Everything else happened on Friday. It was the last day of my internship with Planned Parenthood, and it was supposed to be such a great day. It wasn't. I'm going to try to list why succinctly.

Here goes:* There's a great smoking spot outside of my work where people from PP, a few restaurants, and an architectural firm congregate. Sometimes, deliveries will be dropped off there (it's basically an alley). Most of the time, that's okay -- I've been hit on by a few of the men who are dropping off or unloading the truck from the restaurant, but yesterday, some asshole thought it'd be a great pick-up line to start singing Blurred Lines to me. I couldn't even muster a response, I just had to create a huge gap between us as I walked past.* My boss took me out to lunch and we sat and talked. Somehow, we got to talking about men who take the door from us when we're holding it open for us. What happens when we're leaving and she holds the door for me and a man behind us? HE LITERALLY WRENCHES IT OUT OF HER HAND. Of course, I couldn't say anything.* On my way home, some shitlord in his car blared whatever misogynistic shit he was listening to and shouted ""I fucked two hoes!"" (one of the lines from the psuedo-rap he was listening to) at me when I pulled up next to him. I didn't say anything.* I took my boyfriend out to dinner to celebrate the end of my internship and being back in school. The waiters were nice, but deferred to him when seating us and when asking us for our order. I could understand that at least a little, because he's more outgoing than me and had engaged them. However, I had my wallet out the whole time, they watched me fish for the tip when we'd finished eating and were waiting on our check, and still put the receipt in front of his seat. He wasn't even there! It was just me at the table, and they slammed it in front of his chair on the table! And, again... I didn't say anything.

I don't know what was up with this week, but it made me feel powerless. I couldn't say or do anything to make myself feel better, I just let people walk all over me for being a woman.

My boyfriend bought me a dress and a new pair of shoes and wrote me a letter saying he had been wanting to get me a gift to celebrate my femininity and womanhood (my cycle synced up with the moon this month and it made me feel ultra-feminine and I made a Pokemon joke about how it felt like I evolved into a woman). It nearly made me cry, it was so great. He picked out the perfect dress, the perfect shoes, literally got what I would have if I'd had a store for my perusal. So that's good.

My last day at PP was fantastic. My boss has a crown with birth control pills glued to it and a wand with an unwrapped condom because her coworkers call her the Contraceptive Queen and one gave them to her as a Christmas present. She made me a wand with a (wrapped) condom taped to it, so I'm the Contraceptive Princess. She also went to Seattle last week for a conference and brought me a copy of The Stranger. She gave me a beautiful card, telling me how proud she is of me and how she'd give me the most glowing reference possible. So that's good.

My sister both listened to a mini-explanation of privilege (a huge fucking step forward!) and asked if I was losing weight, then said, ""I didn't mean you look prettier or anything. I'm not that much of a b**ch, you had an eating disorder -- I don't gauge your beauty through your weight."" That was yesterday night, and that was good.

Still. I feel helpless. I've never felt silenced before.

EDIT: I somehow slipped back into using bitch in my recent SRSDiscussion post, and now I feel even more awful, and I wanted to make it clear that I was directly quoting my sister there, not paraphrasing. Also, I substituted asterisks for a few letters, if that helps.

I've posted here before, and found it really helpful to just let people know how I feel. Thanks for listening. Sorry for the wall of text.

I've had an up and down adventure with mental illness - a general physician diagnosed me with depression, put me on Zoloft, and within a month I was in a full-blown manic episode. I started seeing a psychiatrist, who took me off the anti-depressant, and decided I have generalized anxiety disorder and sent me off with some Xanax. Things were fine for a couple of months, but not great. In February of this year, my boyfriend went back to school, which is 10+ hours from where I go to school. We started fighting, sleeping around, etc. I felt horrible and miserable. Couldn't sleep, didn't want to eat, made a lot of stupid, irrational choices. I went back to my psych, who diagnosed me with Bipolar disorder and put me on Depakote, a mood stabilizer. Again, everything seemed to go back to normal, I made up with my boyfriend, visited him, did well in classes. For another 3 months or so, I was doing great. However, the mood stabilizer had the (un)fortunate effect of stabilizing my mood - I wasn't sad anymore, but I couldn't be happy either. I discussed this with my psychiatrist, and he said we could consider taking me off of it, as he decided I was ""the 1 in 100 bi-polar people who might not need a mood stabilizer."" Unfortunately, due to an exam, I missed my next appointment. Because of this, he refused to see me until September (as in now.) I found a new psychiatrist, explained everything, and he decided to take me off Depakote. 

By now it is summer of 2013, I'm living with boyfriend, working at an internship I love, very low stress life, etc. I slowly taper off the Depakote and I feel better than I ever have in my life. My anxiety was under control, I'm not sad, I felt, for three months at least, like a little kid again. 

But in the past few days that's all gone away. My boyfriend is studying abroad in Europe, so he's not around the time anymore, and I don't get to talk to him as much as I used to. My internship is finished up, so I have no major responsibilities to commit myself to. I'm living in a city that isn't where I grew up or where I went to school, so I know relatively few people. I feel like I'm doing everything I can (trying to eat well, exercise, get enough sleep, work on my thoughts and do meditation) and yet everything is spiraling out of control. Over the summer I took xanax once - at the airport when my flight was delayed and I got very anxious. I've taken it every day for the past three days. 

I've been working with my therapist and my psychiatrist on cognitive behavioral therapy to figure out what exactly is wrong. Growing up, I had a very poor relationship with my Dad and his family. I was frequently neglected by them (I haven't received so much as a birthday card in 10 years, I'm 21.) Since elementary school, no achievement, project, or venture was enough to satisfy them or gain their approval and affection. My dad stopped coming to band concerts, plays, and science fairs. On my 16th birthday, which is very close to my cousin's birthday, my Grandparents threw a party, primarily for my cousin, where they gave him a new car. I got a gift card to Barnes and Noble. I think, because of this, I've become very insecure and am constantly hounded by feelings of inadequacy. 

Now I've whipped myself up into a lather over my boyfriend. Again I feel like I'm hounded persistently by thoughts that he's going to leave me, that I'm not good/cool/attractive enough, etc. I'm excited for him and his time studying abroad, but when he tells me about going clubbing and taking hard drugs I end up worried - worried for his safety, but mostly worried that because I'm in some faceless Midwestern City sitting on my ass eating bonbons and not rolling on e in a cosmopolitan European powerhouse that he'll get tired of me and leave me. I've had some shitty boyfriends in the past, who have cheated on me, broken up via phonecall, and I'm just afraid it's going to happen again. I have really no reason to - my Boyfriend is always excited to talk and makes a huge effort to make time to communicate. 

We've also discussed experimenting with openness, and when we decided on it back in August, I felt really comfortable with it. We set clear boundaries and rules, and it seemed like something I could be comfortable. Now I see that as another locus of inadequacy - what happens if we decide to do that and he's out fucking hot eurodudes and I'm stuck in my small college town staring out the window, drinking wine, and feeling sorry for myself?

I want to tell him all of this, but I'm afraid he'll think I'm nuts. He struggles with mental health issues as well, and has been dealing with those in adjusting to life in a foreign country, and I don't want to give him more to deal with. 

At this point, everything seems wrong. Part of me wants to go out and party and do drugs, and another part of me wants to crawl in bed and cry. Everything feels lose-lose-lose for me and win-win-win-win for everyone else. 

I don't know what I expect out of this post, except to get my thoughts down in the universe and maybe a kind word. Thanks for reading.

TLDR: Shitty dad treated me like crap, feelings of inadequacy, jealousy, and insecurity crippling my relationship and personal life. "

This year I made my mind up, after a year of cultural anthropology, I realized that I should not be going to university if that is not what I love and that I wanted to study graphic design. After applying to art school and finishing my entrance assignments I got admitted. As a plan b I also applied for a study called ""graphic and digital media"" on a normal college. Now the last of these two is a really commercially oriented study with lots of practical information and you get learned a lot of techniques (from databases to printing) i.e. you get a lot of tools to express yourself with. Also they have a really great internship arrangements and 70% of the students of the bat gets hired. Now art school has none of these arrangements and has a less broad spectrum of subjects and is, as it is supposed to, more art oriented. Though I feel that art school will make me develop much further and make me more satisfied with the things will I create, the other one seems, especially when considering the economic climate, the wiser choice. Now what are your views on art schools and their value? And where did you attain your knowledge?

1limsy,6,2013-09-01,Training in a foreign environment,daltontogreen,running,https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1limsy/training_in_a_foreign_environment/,"Hi /r/running,

I was wondering if you all could help me out with an issue I'm struggling with. I'm a student studying computer engineering and I managed to get an internship in Switzerland this semester working on medical devices. I've been in Lausanne for about 1.5 months and it's been an interesting experience so far. 

However, it's been a struggle to get adapted to my new environment. The Swiss have rules/fines/fees for everything. As a student, it feels like I'm being thrust into the real world where I have to worry about housing, health, transportation, food, funds, etc on a daily basis. The hardest part I believe is doing it all alone without any friends or family helping me out.

I'm posting on /r/running because I'm also training for the Lausanne Marathon and after that, the Boston Marathon. The Lausanne marathon is rather flat and is usually something I can handle and run decently well. However, I've been having a hard time training because of the stress of living alone in a strange new place. So I have two questions:

1) Is running after college going to be like this? Or is Switzerland just making my life difficult? There's a language barrier at times and everything is so expensive here. I sometimes feel overwhelmed by all the responsibilities I have. I'm wondering if this is what it is going to be like after I graduate. When I'm at school, I manage to eat well, sleep well, run 50-60 miles a week, and take a full engineering courseload. But, if I'm not able to train well here, will I be able to continue training when I have a 9-5 job?

2) Should I accept that the Lausanne marathon might not be my fastest race and take it easy? This would be my 4th marathon and I always try to PR with each new race. I ran a 2:51 in Philly which qualified me for Boston, so I thought I would run Lausanne to keep me in shape for the biggie in April. Do you think I should focus on getting used to my environment and cut back on the mileage? The marathon is less than 2 months away and my longest run has been a 17.5 miler. My pace is not great and that just makes me want to train harder.

Thanks for reading. I also love everything else about Switzerland, so hope this post doesn't dissuade you from visiting. Running in the Swiss wilderness is actually amazing.

1lih7b,2,2013-09-01,Any advice for someone whose brother has depression.,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1lih7b/any_advice_for_someone_whose_brother_has/,"Hi,  




Mine little brother (24) has recently been diagnosed with depression. 

He always was a introvert type. But he really shut down when he failed his school 8 months ago. 

He started sleep in the mornings and wake up the the evenings. Stopped going outside and gained a lot of weight. 

In the beginning i did not really notice the change (busy with mine own 6 month internship so i was never home and i was busy with mine own problems). I though that he was going though a rough patch and that he would get his act together. 

This did not happen and it only got worse. I tried to talk to him but he did not want to talk to me. Sometimes after a lot of talking i would get fractions of what was troubling him ( him thinking that he is stupid for not getting his degree, thinking he is a bad person).

I understood that simply telling him that he is smart and that he is a good person would not really work. So i had to show him.....

Before this we never really did anything together. We never really bonded as childeren and i am always busy (run/fitness 3 times a week, go to collage, hang out with friends, hobbies). 

I started with trying to get him in a normal sleep and eating pattern, taking him out with mine friends, started doing activities together and trying to have a good time. 

This was very difficult for me. 

An example:

In the beginning i had to litterly wake him up and drag him out of his bed, convince him that he had to have breakfast, cut his nails, shave etc.

It was also a struggle to get hem to do any activities. But after he did those, he seemed happier and openend up a little.

But the next day i had to do it all over again. 

After two months he did show more initiative (proposed going to the cinema's, festivals) but he still needed a lot of coaching. 

But i noticed that this was taking its toll an me. Sporting perfomance and graded got worse and i never did anyting i liked. I understood that i was not the best person to help him and that i had to take a step back, not just for him but also for me.

I suggested that he needed to go to an psychiatrist. He went and was diagnosed with depression. He now has a weekly appointment and gets some antideppression meds. 

His condition improved but then mine parents heared about it.

In mine family it is the misconception that only extreem crazy people go to an psychiatrist, need medication and and up being drug addicted hobo's.  Tried to convince them that this is not the case but this did not work.

They urged mine brother to stop taking his meds. He went for me for advice and i suggested that since his condition was improving that he would continue taking his meds (if necessary in secret) and that maybe the psychiatrist had any advice.

Mine parents were invited to a session to discus the misconceptions. After a long session discussing the importance of the treatment and agreeing that it was importend, they reacted by going home and hiding the meds from mine brother. 

In a week time his condition got back to pre medication level. After talking to him about it he told me that mam and dad are hiding his meds and that is how i learned about it. 

I adviced him to discus this with the psychiatrist and told him that our parents are morons. 

Right now i am very pissed at mine parents and i dont know what more i can do to help mine brother.

I see that i have typed way more that i intended so here is an TLDR.

TLDR:

Little brother has depression--&gt;I tried to help, noticed i was not the guy--&gt;went to the psychiatrist, he got weekly appointments and antidepression medications--&gt;he improved--&gt;parents found out and are a negative factor to his treatment--&gt;he got worse--&gt; i dont know how i can help....

I apologise for the bad spelling/grammatical errors and if this in the wrong subreddid.

Thanks in advance.

Since it's a second degree, I'll have well over 150 hours, but will need 6 more upper-level accounting hours to be CPA eligible. 

My plan is to enroll in my school's MAcc program to get those 2 classes in the spring, and start the exams in April.

At my current internship, they've all but made me an offer after I graduate. Being in industry, I don't foresee any problems going to school in the evening. Plus they pay for exams, test prep materials, and tuition (I may have to have been there a year to take advantage of some of those).

However, my end goal is public accounting (audit). Since I plan to take 6 hours in the spring, it's my understanding that working at a public firm in the spring would not be feasible. When I go to networking events (like an upcoming meet the firms event), should I tell the firms I'm looking for something that starts in the summer/fall? Would I be better off postponing the 6 hours until the summer/fall and looking for a spring internship?

Here's my resume as well...any feedback is appreciated.

I attended culinary school, and I have basically been offered this kids job as soon as he leaves.  I know that culinary school doesn't teach you much when it comes to the pressure of working in a real kitchen.  all it can really teach you is basic knife skills and a few French terms and techniques; but to stereotype every person who attends culinary school as a hack is just plain ignorance.  I respect people who started from the bottom as dishwashers and worked their way up to line cooks and sous-chefs, etc. without ever stepping foot in a classroom but to stereotype every culinary student as a hack,  just pisses me off.  i have been a dishwasher and a fast food worker myself, and I got sick of working those types of shitty jobs because they will hire anyone and pay them as close to nothing as possible, so I went to culinary school and now im working in a fine dining  restaurant as a Lead cook. yes i put myself in debt so I could have an upper hand when it comes to getting hired for higher paying jobs.  Yes I still have a lot to learn, but I am by no means a fucking hack.  If I'm not cooking at work or at home, I am reading or researching about cooking and all types of cuisine.  Just because you are in a higher position then me and you did not go to school does not mean that you have the right to undermine my education and determination.  It is all about the individual and not the path that they take.  He then said that he did not intend for me to take it personal and that I am one of the exceptions but I still take offense to the conversation because 5 out of the 6 cooks that work in our kitchen are all culinary school graduates; and I know that if I mentioned this conversation to any one of them  or all of them he probably would have  had a knifed jammed into his jugular tonight.  Or he probably would have ended up having to attempt to run every station on his own during this holiday weekend.  


TL;DR: I got called a hack for going to culinary school and I needed to vent because the only hack in our kitchen is the guy who never attended culinary school and has this opinion."

I've been in a college setting for over six years. I started as a chemistry major six years ago. Had to change schools because of family problems. I enrolled myself in a community college and did great. A year ago I enrolled into a private art school - Turns out I've been suppressing my love for animals and science for way too long, and I don't want to go to school for design. I've had a lot of internship offers beforehand that I declined because I thought art school was the right choice for me. I sorta regret not taking the paid internship offers.

I've been volunteering at a couple animal shelters this summer. I always liked animals but I never delve into working with them because my mum always told me that I have severe allergies. Turns out that while I do suffer with allergies I can cope with the symptoms using medication.

I decided I am going to take a break for a year or two from schooling in general. I've been doing a lot of thinking and came to the conclusion that my real passion is working with animals. I've recently got two cats that I adore and every time I take them to the vet I try to learn something from the techs and vets there. Pay is not something I am not worried too much as my spouse makes pretty good income. If I can get my degree and certification I would actually want to volunteer my services/knowledge towards rescues.

My goal is to start doing the application process next year. During that year I'd like to start studying before I enroll myself in school again. Do you guys have any suggestions for resources? I do need to brush up on my math (I have taken up to differential equations, if that matters) and I also need to brush up on my physical science facts (especially orgo.)

**TL; DR**
I'm burnt out from being in school for far too long and I'm taking a break. Considering career switching to a vet tech. Would like to know some resources or know what to study before I enroll myself in school next year or two. 

I appreciate it!

I'm here for an internship which was originally supposed to be 12 months but I've recently decided to cut it to 6 months because I feel like I just can't cope with the severe emotional swings I've been having.

We talk to each other over Skype 1-2 times a week and send little messages to each other every day. The main problem is that I feel like I'm beginning to get paranoid - I keep feeling that he is going to lose interest in me and leave me for someone else. He's reassured me that he loves me very much and is coming to visit me in November, which I realise is a massive commitment and shows just how much he loves me.

Despite this I still continue to suffer from occasional paranoia and homesickness. I woke up this morning feeling like I wanted to throw up. I'm trying really hard to keep positive but every day just seems to be harder than the previous, I'm head over heels for him and I just feel like going home to be with him. I really want to stay here to complete my internship as I realise what a fantastic opportunity it is for me, but I feel like I'm going crazy and I just don't know what to do.

I regularly tell him how much I miss him and how I can't wait to see him again, but I feel as if I'm just annoying him and making him lose interest (paranoia again... he insists he likes getting the messages from me). I would really appreciate any advice you guys have for me; at the moment I don't think I'll last much longer."

1li20u,1,2013-09-01,"Studying engineering without summer internships, or My engineering destiny and what I should do with my life",[deleted],EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1li20u/studying_engineering_without_summer_internships/,"Hello /r/EngineeringStudents; I have a somewhat unorthodox (for this subreddit) question for you all. Wall of text approaching.

I'm a Sophomore who just transferred to UW-Madison from UIUC. I'm on course to apply to the MechE program, which is what I was in at UIUC. I did not have an engineering-related internship this summer, however I spent it pursuing another internship with an organization that means a lot to me personally and that I absolutely love doing, but has nothing to do with engineering. Long story short, it's something I could do again next summer, and for the rest of my summers in college and possibly beyond, and I really want to do it. I don't want to do a summer engineering internship, because it means not doing this thing again.

The vibe I get from this subreddit is that internships/co-ops are crucial, and can make or break an engineering education. Frankly, it borders on an obsession with some people. Maybe it's just that I'm not getting the whole picture from reddit posts, but it seems like obtaining career-related internships is the focus of some people's lives while they're in college, and many people do go on to pour their whole beings into career advancement. I firmly believe that this is no way to live.

At my orientation this year, we were told that 75% of UW-Madison engineering students do at least one internship or co-op. I guess my question is, what's it like being that 25%? Would I be better off studying physics instead, my backup non-engineering major?

On another, related note, (don't worry, it all ties together at the end) I'm apprehensive about careers in engineering. One of the reasons I don't want do to an internship (besides not being able to do what I did this summer) is that the world of corporate engineering seems very dull to me. I decided to study engineering because I wanted to learn and use math and physics, and to build things. Office design jobs (a la Dilbert) don't appeal to me at all. I want to be more connected to what I do than that. An ideal engineering job for me would be similar to what [M5 Industries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M5_Industries), the shop run by Jamie Hyneman and Adam Savage (apart from the MythBusters stuff), does. A very small-scale operation developing and building custom systems and machines. Office work for Boeing or John Deere doesn't seem like what I want to do.

My follow-up question, then, is this: Is there a way I can get experience throughout the school year, either through internships/co-ops/clubs/whatever, that pertains to the sort of engineering I want to do and doesn't cut into my summers? Is cordoning off my summers as sacrosanct too unrealistic? The closest thing I can think of that fulfills these requirements would be the SAE clubs, and a student shop maintenance job that I am applying for. UW-Madison has Formula, Formula Electric, Baja, and Clean Snowmobile. Would involvement in these clubs and employment in the student shop be comparable to more traditional summer internships *for the goals that I have,* given the somewhat different focuses of internships and SAE clubs? Going back to the idea of studying physics instead, would a physics major be less expected to have internships, or would that just worsen career opportunities unnecessarily?

Thanks for reading my wall of text; I hope my questions and phrasing aren't too impenetrable. Let me know if you need clarification on anything."

I realize the humor here in helping kids avoid future crimes, then asking fellow redditors to help me get a game where I commit felonies. I have to listen to quite a bit of depressing situations while at work and in the field of psychology self care is a huge aspect of one's career.

1lhxz3,4,2013-08-31,Long-lasting repercussions...,[deleted],raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1lhxz3/longlasting_repercussions/,"I guess I'm dealing with some residual anger over the whole Nmom center of the universe childhood-o-rama.

I have always figured I would get out of it and over it by putting my life together and moving on on my own. But it seems like I ruined my own life so early on that there isn't any fixing it.

I know that probably sounds stupid and melodramatic, so here's the rundown. I left home early, when my parents were splitting up- mom had moved to a foreign country while dad was supporting her financially and otherwise to follow her dreams, she repayed him by cheating on him, and basically considering their marriage ""over"", but of course not actually getting divorced bc her boyfriends arent going to support her, so staying half in. Dad had moved in w us in foreign country, mom was sleeping w her (otherwise engaged) boyfriend while dad slept on the couch. It was time for me to go, went back to home country, finished a high school as a salutatorian, got into college, went when i was 16.

Unfortunately, that is where things got bad for me- with no financial suport or basically even contact w my parents (dad called, but i didnt know how to tell him i was not ok. he wanted me to be ok, and i wanted to be ok for him, he was pretty destroyed from the whole cheating dumping using thing my mom did). Really, support from anyone- I was barely keeping it together. 

Shitty grades my first year, almost flunked out. Was so depressed i didnt even know i was depressed. The next 3 years, got mostly A's and B's, but not solid enough to really pull up my GPA.  Was determined to finish, mostly just because I had no idea what else to do- no money (all on scholarships and loans), no car or license, just had to get that degree, and I did, in Biochemistry (which to this day my mom cant remember). The last year I was there my mom moved back to the country, and nearby-ish enough to take a 6 hr train ride. After 3 years of being homeless between semesters, staying with my friends and giving them whatever work-study money i had saved up, or going to see my dad where he was staying w his relatives, having to ""come home"" from college to sleeping on some distant uncles floor who hated me, staying with my brother and his wife who bullied me constantly for being in college instead of in the real world, never having a home to go to, I was honestly happy my mom lived nearby. 

Then I remember how it is. When she tells me how ungrateful I am for being allowed to sleep in her bosses living room, when she cant fathom how hard it is to not have a home to go to, when no one is on your emergency contact list when you're 17 bc no one in your family has a phone number, when your friends parents give you the ""you're like a daughter to us!"" and it hurts because it is a nice thing to say but it isnt true, really. And you feel like a fucking orphan with 2 living parents. Living for 2 years with a broken infected tooth bc I couldnt afford it taken out until after I worked the next summer, ""why don't you just call your parents?"" 


Ok now I'm just rambling. The point was, college was really isolating time, and my mom showed up the last six months to get in all the graduation pictures and be like so totally excited! Which is fine. THE REAL POINT (its hard to summarize without getting sucked down memory lane) is that I was like this super ""gifted"" kid, who had always known the only way i was going to get somewhere was on my own, and then I fucked up college and I keep trying and trying again, post bac studies, internships, etc. But none of them really seem to build on each other and I end up being still 6 years out of college, no prospects. And the worst part is that I've left one progrm and one job because my boss was someone just like my mom, or at least super manipulative, and I feel like I dont have any tools for dealing with that. 


I don't even know why I wrote this, I guess it just hurts a lot that this could have ended so differently with something as simple as a support system. And believe me when I say that I am taking responsibility for my life, I keep picking myself up by the bootstraps and I just dont seem to be able to get a hold of anything. 


Example: I had a job interview at Columbia after leaving my unfinished masters degree. I thought I had left on good terms, I had worked (and been paid) by my supervisor for a year, when I left he was all oh good luck! and then i got a one line email from him after my interview that just said ""please remove me from your list of professional references"". How the hell do you apply to jobs without a reference for the place you just worked for a year?


Anyway, what cued this all off was my mom screaming the house down and breaking dishes  and trying to break down my bedroom door that ""what the fuck was I talking about, she was there for me every step of the way through college, what,  I get to  hate her because she doesnt own a big house"" and giving examples of things she knew about happening in college- all of which happened in the last 6 months when she moved back. And when I was 20 and when I had friends and a job, not when i was totally isolated and completely broke and 16.



I know it sounds stupid to resent this, but I just feel like I've missed all my chances and everything is over. And Ive been feeling like a loser for the last 10 years, and I thought that was supposed to stop when i got out of her house.


TLDR: Went to college early to escape nmom's abuse/neglect cycle, was a total fucking mess in college, pulled it together the last few years but not enough to get good refs or a good enough GPA. Keep trying to put things together, keep watching them crumble. Personal problems at work- might be too ingratiating?

Sorry for being a big old bummer- you guys are usually pretty good  to talk to when i feel like what i feel is so crazy that no one will understand. Thanks :)"
1lhx9q,2,2013-08-31,I'm not a hardware engineer. Would you hire me as an intern?,bashfulbird,hwstartups,https://www.reddit.com/r/hwstartups/comments/1lhx9q/im_not_a_hardware_engineer_would_you_hire_me_as/,"Hi /r/hwstartups!  I'm a junior in college (an Ivy), double majoring in Physics and Comp Sci.
I've just about completed the physics major (2 classes this semester, one next), so I added the CS major because I'm fascinated by it, I have so much fun writing code, and I have time to fit it in.  With that though, I'm not very far in the CS major.  By the end of this year, I'll be where the average sophomore is.

I did astrophysics research my freshman summer, but I happened to end up with a very hardware based project.  I was doing wiring, orbital welding, building control panels, etc.  It was great, I loved doing that work, but it's really not common in astrophysics.

My sophomore summer, I did sort-of-physics research at a contractor.  They had hired me in part because I was a physics major with some electronics experience, and my work was basically that of an EE intern: I was designing circuits and PCB boards, breadboarding, working with arduinos and a BeagleBone, and doing most of the related programming.  Again, I loved the work.

The contractor was a fantastic company, but it's not where I want to be at this point.  They have a fantastic work-life balance, it's slow paced and low stress, but right now is the time of my life that I don't want low stress.  I want challenges with deadlines, I want to be pressed for time, to take on responsibilities, to have to work through lunch or stay late sometimes.

To that end, I think startups might be a good place for me at this point.  I'm looking into software startups, but I really love that intersection between hardware and software, and I think I'd enjoy being at a hardware startup.

**What I'm asking is whether I could be useful as an intern at a hardware startup.** 

**Obviously there are a lot things I'm missing from the EE curriculum, but I have some hands-on experience with arduinos, microcomputers, breadboarding, 3D printers, etc., and a drive to learn everything I can.**  

**Would you look at a resume like mine?**

**And if so, any tips on how I can present myself to potential employers that would highlight my experiences?**"

I don't know why I'm posting this. Honestly, I think I need the catharsis of just pouring it out in a list. I have a wonderful, supportive boyfriend, but talking to just him isn't enough.

So, this week was fucking hell. It seemed like every misogynist in the world had a meeting where they agreed to convene on my life and fuck with me.

A few things happened from Monday through Thursday that weren't a huge deal, but bugged the shit out of me.Most notably, one of my professors won't call on me anymore because I a.) used the word privilege when talking about Durkheim's fucking INTEGRATION THEORY and b.) deigned to agree with Marx about female oppression.

Everything else happened on Friday. It was the last day of my internship with Planned Parenthood, and it was supposed to be such a great day. It wasn't. I'm going to try to list why succinctly.

Here goes:* There's a great smoking spot outside of my work where people from PP, a few restaurants, and an architectural firm congregate. Sometimes, deliveries will be dropped off there (it's basically an alley). Most of the time, that's okay -- I've been hit on by a few of the men who are dropping off or unloading the truck from the restaurant, but yesterday, some asshole thought it'd be a great pick-up line to start singing Blurred Lines to me. I couldn't even muster a response, I just had to create a huge gap between us as I walked past.* My boss took me out to lunch and we sat and talked. Somehow, we got to talking about men who take the door from us when we're holding it open for us. What happens when we're leaving and she holds the door for me and a man behind us? HE LITERALLY WRENCHES IT OUT OF HER HAND. Of course, I couldn't say anything.* On my way home, some shitlord in his car blared whatever misogynistic shit he was listening to and shouted ""I fucked two hoes!"" (one of the lines from the psuedo-rap he was listening to) at me when I pulled up next to him. I didn't say anything.* I took my boyfriend out to dinner to celebrate the end of my internship and being back in school. The waiters were nice, but deferred to him when seating us and when asking us for our order. I could understand that at least a little, because he's more outgoing than me and had engaged them. However, I had my wallet out the whole time, they watched me fish for the tip when we'd finished eating and were waiting on our check, and still put the receipt in front of his seat. He wasn't even there! It was just me at the table, and they slammed it in front of his chair on the table! And, again... I didn't say anything.

I don't know what was up with this week, but it made me feel powerless. I couldn't say or do anything to make myself feel better, I just let people walk all over me for being a woman.

My boyfriend bought me a dress and a new pair of shoes and wrote me a letter saying he had been wanting to get me a gift to celebrate my femininity and womanhood (my cycle synced up with the moon this month and it made me feel ultra-feminine and I made a Pokemon joke about how it felt like I evolved into a woman). It nearly made me cry, it was so great. He picked out the perfect dress, the perfect shoes, literally got what I would have if I'd had a store for my perusal. So that's good.

My last day at PP was fantastic. My boss has a crown with birth control pills glued to it and a wand with an unwrapped condom because her coworkers call her the Contraceptive Queen and one gave them to her as a Christmas present. She made me a wand with a (wrapped) condom taped to it, so I'm the Contraceptive Princess. She also went to Seattle last week for a conference and brought me a copy of The Stranger. She gave me a beautiful card, telling me how proud she is of me and how she'd give me the most glowing reference possible. So that's good.

My sister both listened to a mini-explanation of privilege (a huge fucking step forward!) and asked if I was losing weight, then said, ""I didn't mean you look prettier or anything. I'm not that much of a b**ch, you had an eating disorder -- I don't gauge your beauty through your weight."" That was yesterday night, and that was good.

Still. I feel helpless. I've never felt silenced before.

EDIT: I somehow slipped back into using bitch in my recent SRSDiscussion post, and now I feel even more awful, and I wanted to make it clear that I was directly quoting my sister there, not paraphrasing. Also, I substituted asterisks for a few letters, if that helps.

I'm qualified to do very technical work, but got hired for less technical work that pays what you would expect from a less technical job (~50k as opposed to ~65k that I could be making). Much of this has to do with the sequester killing a lot of jobs in my field.

I've been working there for roughly 3 months. There are openings on the teams that do the sort of work I want to do in my field. Skilled, technical work that I am quite qualified for and have a 3 year internship in. Now, the job I'm in now has some nice perks...I'll have occasional travel, there's a lot of down time, so if I go back to school, I'll have the opportunity to do school stuff at work, I really like the people on my team, etc. But the pay is, comparatively, bad, and I have others who depend on my income, and there will not be the opportunity to advance and get anything other than a cost of living/yearly raise for quite some time.

Eventually, I'll be trying to get on the more technical, higher paid side anyway...how soon is too soon? I don't want to burn any bridges or make myself a target for any sort of retribution (which, yes, I know is illegal, but let's face it, it happens).

I've always had some success with going up to a girl (whose eye I've caught or something similar) and saying something like ""Hi, my name is Cardgiver, and I think you're gorgeous..."" and then some variation of asking for her number/giving her mine. The asking/giving is the part I need to work on.

I've just started an internship, and received really nice business cards, which occured to me might help a lot in this case. Something along the lines of ""Here's my card if you're interested in going out"". Makes the whole exchange much smoother.

First, two small questions:

1) What's the general opinion on giving a card? Douchey, elegant...?

2) Should I just give my card as in ""Here's my card..."" or ask if she wants it before extending it?

And for the big question:

My internship is at a very large investment bank (think Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse...). I'm sure there are a lot of women who might be turned off by the banker stereotype (even though I'm far from it). What worries me more is, could this come across as me trying to tell you ""I make a lot of money""? I really wouldn't like to give this impression.

TL;DR: Could giving a girl my card, which is from a very large investment bank, make it seem as though I'm trying to impress her with money? Also, general opinion on going up to a girl and offering a card?

Thanks!"

This no success thing has been a perpetual problem all my life.  Mutual (physical) attraction has been elusive for me.  To give you an idea of my dating frequency I've been on one date so far this year and it had nothing to do with okc.

I have been working on improving myself.  I started weightlifting earlier this year and revamped my entire wardrobe.  Online, the girls just don't respond.  IRL I'm shy (shitty excuse but it's me) so I find it difficult to initiate conversations.  I have some friends who don't mind initiating when drunk, so I tagalong with them.  Once the conversation gets going the girls I talk to seem interested and engaged.  They face me, seem relaxed, play with their hair hardcore, contribute to the conversation, and laugh when I say funny things.  More often than not I get their number before I leave(number's real because I call their phone to give them my number).  But they usually don't respond to my text the next day.  DC has a large amount of interns and some of these girls were interns that were leaving at the end of the summer.  This could play into their decision not to respond but since I'm not privy to the reason I default to lack of physical attraction.

I guess a bit of background here would be appropriate. The wall of backstory really ties into the reason she decided to quit, I think.  She and I had been dating for three years this November. We'd been seeing each other on and off up through my junior year of college, at which point we decided to get together (she was in the class below me). The first few months were pretty bumpy (I was massively immature and generally inconsiderate), but things weren't bad. After the summer break, fall semester of senior represented a very strong time in the relationship. I don't know why things went so well that semester, it was like we perfectly understood each other and matched up so well. In the background of all this, she'd been applying to study abroad next semester in South America, which I had reservations about, but I wanted to let her do her thing.


And so I did. That next spring is when things first got dicey.  I guess I was overly attached to her or dependent, maybe, but she really wanted to get away from me there, in my opinion. I think she would agree she was looking to get a bit detached from me. That just led to strings and strings of arguments and fights because I didn't feel like any of my needs were being taken care of. At one point, she asked for a break, but I refused, painting it as tantamount to a breakup, which is something she didn't want. Additionally, at this time, I was trying to decide where to go to grad school - we had discussed a few destinations and schools, but never said I ""had"" to go to a particular location. In the end, I decided to go to the one school, unbeknownst to me, that she was against, mainly because of its location. It made the most sense to me - a combination of where I actually got in, prestinge, and value - but she started dropping hints that she wouldn't be in my future if I chose to go. I don't remember if this was the same time she requested a break, but I decided to enroll at that school in the city she claimed she saw ""no opportunity' in (population of 300k, some very good schools).


Generally, I refer to her time abroad as ""bad."" Perhaps my biggest problem was that I wasn't direct or firm about my positions as much as I needed to be - I generally sought to appease and come down for positions, even if it kind of meant feeling like I'd been left alone.  Anyway, she had been casting an eye towards teaching after graduation and going out for Teach for America. I was cool with this; she could get fairly close and do something she wanted. At the same time, she also floated ideas about moving to my city using another program, but never did more than float the idea.

She got into TFA. That's great and all, and she lands in a city about 2.5 hours away. No big deal, right? We'd both be busy but maybe we could carve out time to see one another after a busy summer (we were both more or less working full-time). Another unfortunate thing happened, but she doesn't refer to it in saying why she broke up with me.


Fast forward to the end of the summer. We talked about me coming down to see her and her new place. I even volunteered to get out of my internship a week early to be able to spend the most time down there right after driving up and down my state to help my siblings move to their place and move into my new place as well. That was hell on earth, haha. But, I get down there, and things just felt weird. I pull up after scrambling to get down there, she's trying to hustle me into bed so she can sleep. That's fine, it was kind of late and she gets tired easily. Over the next 10 days or so, I generally spend time by myself - she's doing training all week, all day. That's fine, but after she comes back, she never took any real interest in me but made of point of asking me to always ask how her day was. Okay, maybe that's stress. We also had a huge fight during the week...I was not dealing with my friend's attitude very well and I was standoffish to her. 
&gt;That standoffishness came from another issue - in a previous discussion, she admitted she'd grown to like her new city and asked me if I would come down. This took me by supreme surprise - we'd talked about a few cities we could move to next year, but hers was never on the list; my job search was not looking in that direction at all, and it was getting too late in the season to do anything about it. When she dropped it on me, I more or less answered with ""I don't know if I even can."" Later, I came back and admitted the question pissed me off - way to let me know so late. I also raged because I didn't feel I was being given much leeway - I felt it was ""I will more or less have a job here if I want it, so I have the power here."" Not cool. Nevertheless, I put in applications with a few corporations down there, trying to reorient myself after spending so much capital moving another way.

After I book out back to my city to finally unpack and organize my apartment, she becomes distant. Part of this is certainly due to working around the clock, but another part of it is that she made little effort to contact me unless I contacted her first. Weekend before last, she lets me know she gets wasted, then flat out stops talking to me before I message her. She lets me know she's watching a movie and cuts out again, not to be heard from again. We catch up the next day.


Things seemed off, but a few days later, I'm asking her what we are going to do for Labor Day weekend - maybe I could come down to see her, but I am travel weary (I had yet to spend a weekend at my place). She suspects she's going to be busy with work through the weekend, and doesn't want to come up to see me (nor had really ever suggested she would because of work, while ""hoping I would be able to visit once a month."").

Right after that, she says she needs to talk (note, this is all text. Couldn't even earn a call). She tells me she wants to take a break, and I ask why and for details of such a break (freedom, duration, etc). I end up calling it an amicable breakup, language that would haunt me. 


I was torn up about the break, but I was putting distance on it. I wheeled around on Saturday (I think, it might have been yesterday), though, and asked what was really going on. And it turns out she really decided to quit because:

* I apparently changed her - she's always been huge on travel, and I had been ho-hum about it; I'd worry about it when I had the resources, so I wouldn't commit to doing anything. However, talk of that never really came up after a year or so ago.
* Less passion (fading spark) - This one, I don't get.
* Less communication - this one, I told her I blamed her because she had been making far less effort to communicate with me.
* I take my anger out on her (not physically, but by expressing it to her). I don't get this one...where else am I supposed to put it? If I'm mad, she is going to be the one person that really sees it because she was the closest.
* My parents? Technically, she'd never met them because of me. I'm foreign and my parents are very narrow-minded. I'd been trying to introduce her to them but it blew up so hard in my face, mainly because I was also taking a trip to see her (her idea) at the same time. Anyway, she'd become committed to the idea my parents already loathed her without knowing her; they might have had apprehensions, sure, but they're not *that* bad (at least my mom, my dad is a whole different story). It was something that didn't bother her at first but had ground on her more and more.
* I never proposed? At one point, I made a lot of talk of proposing to her, but she managed to inject just enough doubt into my head that made me want to hold off (I think she interprets that as in I wasn't really ready to do it). Later on, she didn't quite insist but insisted that I do it, and I held off, wanting things to settle down and more importantly, wanting the right opportunity. I think she regards it as some sort of joke ultimately, or that I was just joking about it all along. I really wasn't - I have a ring (WTF am I going to do with it?!) and had been thinking about how to pull it off in an LDR.
* We weren't serious about being in the same place, according to her.


Needless to say, I don't get why she broke up with me.  Ultimately, I feel like she didn't give me a real chance to address her issues or open a dialogue. Instead, she got the idea things needed to change and contacted me once she felt like it. I was expected to take my lumps and get out.


It's been an insanely rough time for me. I've been pouring my feelings into alcohol and having fairly rage-y conversations with her, where she tells me I'm just talking and circles and that she's too busy to talk.  In those, ultimately, I want her to actually seem like she's sorry or cares (despite claiming to). Really, I feel like she handled it wrong (and wronged me, but I haven't gotten her to admit it - am I just being an asshole? I am also trying to let her figure out that she's actually hurt me really badly - I always seem like someone not affected by emotional turmoil, but I am just beside myself here. I just feel *unstable*.



Half the time I want to cry, the other half I'm punching my bed and pillows because I just have an urge to destroy something (but also don't want to break actual stuff). Most of the time I want to drink. I don't want it to be like this, and I feel helpless. I'm scared of what will happen to me. I have let a few friends know, but their support has been limited. I don't know who I can talk to - I don't want to talk to my family about it, after putting up such a fight for her, I don't want to hamper my friends with my shit, and I don't have anyone else.

**tl;dr**: Girlfriend decides she needs to break up with me, I feel left out of the process of coming to that conclusion. Blindsided, even. I don't know how to handle myself, and I fear I'm going to destroy myself or destroy something."

1llvz7,2,2013-09-02,Question about drug testing in the work place.,MarkHirsch91,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1llvz7/question_about_drug_testing_in_the_work_place/,"Someone I know took amphetamines this weekend (adderall and vyvanse) to help study. She is not prescribed adderall or vyvanse. She  just started an internship last week (there was no one else getting employed by the company at the time, so they did not do drug screenings for potential employees). On Wednesday, she has to meet with the Human Resources guy at the workplace (he is from an HR company, not a direct employee of the company my friend works at). Her supervisor told her that she would be meeting with him to go over things, assuming payroll and what not. She has not received an employee handbook and does not know the company's drug testing policies. My question for you guys is, will my friend get drug tested by herself? I know companies that do them will require everyone employed to get tested at once. Will companies do it for someone they just hired? She has worked for a full week and is getting paid, so would the company drug test now? Thanks!"

But I would like to change that and maybe there are fellow redditors on the same quest.

I am into movies and books to a degree where it is not funny anymore, but I also like to take a walk and just be outside, obseving things. During my short while here I already noticed that a lot of people are into bouldering/climbing, so I would not be opposed to trying that out.

Also, I am in the process of acumulating my filmmaking equipment, since that was my primary motivation to come here. (I am german, not one of those über-interesting foreign people that come to Berlin in hordes)
If you know someone who wants to sell me his Panasonic GH3 or Canon 7D for cheap, I am all ears ;)
Any fellow aspiring filmmaker is welcome to contact me, really
Or if you need/want someone to go to the cinema with. Tomorrow I will probably go see the english show of The Bling Ring at Potsdamer Platz.
And one of my greatest joys is to browse (2nd hand) bookstores. Too bad there aren't as many here as there are in Dublin. If you need someone to have a trip to Dublin within the next 14 months, I am your man.
Or if you want to go a Museum together.
Or if you want to play videogames together.
Or if you want to apply to a cooking class together.
Or if you want to rob a bank.

To be honest, I am open to almost anything. I am just sick of doing most things alone.

So write me, if you want to, and merry christmas!"

I have a B.S. In Geomechanics (AKA Interdepartmental Geology and Mech. Eng). I have every intention on going on to get a Grad degree, but am still undecided between and MS in Geophysics and PhD in Planetary Science, and also have no idea about what I can do until then. Even if I start applying now, I have a year until I can begin a grad program, and so I need work until then.

I have 3.27, have 3 internships under my belt, So I do have experience, but that does not change the fact that I have thus far not heard back from anything I have applied to.

Any ideas of what to do until I go to Grad School? I am willing to relocate to pretty much any city on Earth that speaks english, is medium to large sized, at least moderately liberal, and ideally near a body of water.

Also don't suggest Oil/Gas. I don't think they are evil or anything, but it is not what I'm looking for, which is either geotechnical engineering, geophysics research, or scientific outreach.

Hope to hear back, thanks!"

been together for 2.5 years but had quite a few taxing legs of distance. Im working in our home town, while she has been away for studies and internships often. We have probably spent about 1 year physically in the same place. She just started a new internship 4 hrs away but will return home for at least 4 months afterwards.


Her new internship is going horrible! She´s very ambitious and works in a tough field. However this time around she´s having a really hard time. Nobody talks to her and people belittle her in meetings. She even goes to lunch on her own.


I want to be there for her and help her get through this! However our phone conversations are going really bad lately. I try pretty hard to be understanding and listen to her and let her tell her story with me asking the details. 

But then she gets embarrassed and angry at me asking for details, since she´s not used to performing bad.


I then try to give her suggestions whioch she doesn´t like either and gets angry at me for not really understanding her problem. She says she doesn´t want solutions but wants me to guide her to a solution.


Makes sense, but I suck at this sort of thing. Every conversation about work feels liek a minefield right now. And it just makes me sad. I wish I had something funnny or witty to tell her and cheer her up but nothing just seems to work at the moment. 

She also hates it when I try to relate problems to me, as in ""I had a similar situation lately, i solved it this way and it went well""..
She further says she doesn´t want to be teaching me how to give proper advice. I already have a lot more relationship experience than her but she is more demanding intellectually than anyone I have ever been with. It has really helped me becoming better person. But right now I feel like I try to be very sensible and am annoyed for her being disappointed in me as a partner.

So how do I talk to her about her workproblems in an understanding way that doesn´t let her feel bad?! 



I am currently dreading the phone conversations but want to do better!

Any ideas or input would be greatly appreciated

tl;dr: GF and I are in a long distance leg and she´s having a really tough time at work. I try to talk to her about it but conversations go badly and feel like a minefield :("
1lljl6,2,2013-09-02,Thinking about mentioning symptoms to my psychologist. Thoughts?,[deleted],aspergers,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/1lljl6/thinking_about_mentioning_symptoms_to_my/,"From the beginning....


As a kid (around 3 or 4) I was sent to a school psychologist because of problems at school (tantrums, not sharing with kids, not getting along with others, at one point completely stopped speaking) but this was before Asperger's was really considered a diagnosis, and I ended up just being moved schools and remaining undiagnosed. At my new school, I got along much better because there were two friends who I had grown up with (literally from birth, basically) who I stuck around, and while I didn't really make new friends or anything, I was much easier to get along with and caused fewer problems. I did get made fun of (A LOT) for different things, but my parents basically thought I brought it upon myself by being ""weird."" (I still remember covering my ears when there were pinatas at birthday parties and just sobbing because of the noise.) 



Fast forward 20 years, and I am noticing my ""differences"" more and more. My social anxiety is through the roof, but what bothers me more is the fact that no matter how hard I try to act ""normal"" I cannot seem to hold a conversation with people I've just met, or keep eye contact, etc. My mom likes to remind me that I took drama as a kid and I should be able to ""act"" like I'm social, because I ""make people really uncomfortable."" ""It's not normal for a 20-something year old"" to not be able to carry a conversation, etc etc. She doesn't seem to understand that I am just as (if not more than) uncomfortable as the people I'm meeting. 



What really sparked my brain was when I began looking more into signs and noticed things about being touched/hugged. I do not like hugs. I don't care who they're from, they make me want to crawl into a hole and die. The friends that I've managed to make think it's hilarious to ""fake"" hug me, but it causes extreme panic and in some cases I have actually cried from being so uncomfortable. I do have trouble keeping friends, because even if a few manage to ""break"" me and get to know me, once they see the bad side of me (meltdowns, being unintentionally rude/honest, etc) they go running. Luckily, as of now, I seem to have a few friends who understand that there's ""something"" different about me and just deal with it. 




**tl;dr**

**My main issue now** I have finished college and am starting to pursue a career in the music industry. I have been lucky enough to secure an internship where I primarily work from home, alone (answering email requests, dealing with merch orders, helping with online grant information, etc) but last week I had to be at a music video shoot for a whole day (12 hours) with people I had NEVER actually met before (the one person I had met was only there for about an hour later in the day,) and it was absolute torture. I'm really worried that I ended up making a bad impression (as the day went on I became more withdrawn, etc) but with no real diagnosis, it's hard to explain to them what it's like for me to be in those situations. 


**I don't want to be excluded in the future, I'd just like there to be a way to easily explain to them that this is something I deal with but if they kind of ""bear with me"" I'm pretty easy to get along with. Should I bring up the signs/symptoms I've noticed to the psychologist I've been seeing?** (I've been seeing him at the request of my mother who ""can't deal with"" how ""difficult"" I am making her life, she's retired and never imagined having to still take care of a 23 year old child, she wants to be able to travel and live ""peacefully"" in her own house, etc etc)


I always worry that I will basically be laughed at or told some variation of ""you're not a professional, why would you self-diagnose"" if I bring up things that I believe are symptoms, and then have the idea dismissed. I also have a very good sense of humour (which I think would be unusual for someone on the spectrum, no?) and once I get to know people good luck getting me to shut up, but the other ""symptoms"" I notice are really affecting my life. I'm not even looking for a full diagnosis, even just a professional to say ""You meet the requirements, here's how we can work on handling this"" without a concrete diagnosis would be helpful in my eyes. 



What has your experience been with bringing up what you believe are signs of an ASD to a professional? Any tips, etc?
Thank you all! The more I read in this subreddit, the more I realize I may not just be a spoiled brat with an anger problem. "

1llj3c,47,2013-09-02,"You spin me right round round round, baby",[deleted],talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1llj3c/you_spin_me_right_round_round_round_baby/,"I apologize for the length of this, but I tried to be as detailed as possible describing the WTF moments. This is how we experienced it.

I am The Admin's Hand (read: temporary intern) at a medium-sized company. There are 40 or 50 people at the location I work at right now.

Well, the admin himself is horrifyingly overworked and is forced to rely on a lot of service from external companies. Spending truckloads of money on that doesn't matter to the higher-ups, but hiring is out of the question for some reason. Oh well.

Anyway, this morning I arrived at work and I could immediately tell my boss had been there for at least 2 hours already and had probably aged 2 years in that time. The entire network was down - printers unreachable, servers unreachable, no internet connections, no communication between clients. So it didn't take a long time to determine that the main switch for the entire building was the culprit. That switch is quite big and powerful, but also comparably old.

Because my boss was already at his wits' end and I wasn't even entirely present yet (no coffee), he called the external company who'd generally be handling ""OH SHIT"" situations regarding our network.

The network guy arrived, came to the same conclusion we did (switch might be broken), and gave it a quick test with a small replacement switch. Sure enough, with just a server, one of the routers and the IT office clients on the new switch, everything worked fine. He called a colleague to check if they had a replacement switch of the required size (48 ports plus at least 2 fiber ports) available. But, just to be sure, he accessed the switch configuration via its serial port. A quick look at the logs showed us ""Excessive Broadcasts at ports 7+8"". Whoa. So he unplugged ports 7 and 8. And sure enough, the entire network came back online instantly.

After asking my boss who was connected to those Ports, it took me less than 3 seconds to understand what had happened. I went to the corresponing office room, confirmed it, changed a few things and voila - everything was fine again even with ports 7 and 8 plugged in.

**What had happened?**

Last Thursday, one of the office trainees (unrelated to IT) came to us. My boss was on the phone so she asked me if the network cable attached to her laptop belonged to the laptop. She had to go to another office for a day or two to learn from the office drones there. I said I had no idea, but it wouldn't matter anyway, as we had a supply of literally hundreds of spare cables. I told her she could just unplug it and take it with her.

10 minutes later we get a call from the office she had been in: ""We're offline! HALP!"" I went down there and found out that apparently I had underestimated her... 'lack of expertise'. My bad. There are 2 computers in that room, both plugged into a basic 5port switch. Her Laptop was plugged into that switch while she was there, and the switch was connected to one of the wall sockets.

Well, she had ripped out almost everything in that room. The only connection left was the connection from one of the other computers to the switch. The cable from the wall to the switch was unplugged on the switch side and so was the cable from the 2nd computer to the switch.

So when I went down to that room today, sure enough I found the trainee back in the room. And of course she plugged her Laptop back in herself! And of course, if you plug the Laptop into the switch, the switch needs another connection to the wall. Right? Right. So now we had 2 cables going from the 5port switch to the wall. The wall, which is directly connection to our main switch. Creating a [Switching loop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switching_loop).

So, yeah, I do consider it my bad to a degree. I underestimated this trainee's stupidity. After last Thursday, I probably should have approached her to kindly ask her to call us the next time she has to unplug something or plug something into something else. I just didn't care cause she didn't really do any damage aside from taking 2 people offline for 10 minutes. However, once she learned that she was responsible for a 3 hour network outage for the entire building, she was mortified. I made sure to let her know that nobody blames her, but to please come to us even for minor stuff like unplugging her Laptop in the future. I don't think she's ever going to touch a cable in the building again.

**-----**

Yes, the main switch has no internal loop protection. It could have, with a firmware update, but since the entire network is bound to be upgraded (including some cabling and the main switch) **(edit: within the next few weeks)**, it isn't worth the risk in case something goes wrong during the update.

There's no STP in use; but even if it was, the small 5port switch probably doesn't support STP anyway."

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[I am a front line supervisor.  Thanks for the opportunity to ask a question as management without the flack that comes with it.  Why did unions get away from policing their own?  Stories I hear from people who work for me say that back in the day, the union helped keep the slackers from getting out of hand.  That is definitely not the case anymore. My workers complain the union is ""over protecting"". Do you agree? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc07vlo?context=5)|Every union is different and speaking as both a union member AND a union employee I will say this: some unions are run REALLY badly. I personally think the MTA union in New York is one of the worst. With that you also need to remember there are some people that truly are ""slackers"" and others who are just there to get the paycheck and go home by doing the bare minimum. It is not the unions jobs to decide someones motivation for being at a particular job. Those slackers won't advance (we hope) and they can stay at the bottom if thats what they want. If you are talking about someone actively NOT doing their duties then the management has the right to step in to discuss the matter with the member and union rep. 
[Slackers staying on the bottom is usually where the frustration arises. You have to promote by seniority, and if the most senior person does not deserve a promotion then no one gets a promotion.  In practice anyway. Demotivates people in my experience. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc08ht3?context=5)|I think promotion solely based on seniority is a complete outdated practice. 
[That is one of my major griefs with unions (certain ones\). Why should that slacker be allowed to stay at the bottom? His or her ass should be fired, not protected by a rep.  That slacker not only wastes company dollars but the create more work and headache for everyone.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc0bzgq?context=5)|There is a different between someone not doing their job and someone doing the minimum amount of work. Some people have a job just to have a job. Those that are actively not doing their duties can and should be reprimanded but it needs to be a documented situation. Just saying ""fire the slackers"" lends itself to corruption on behalf of the employer. Making it harder to fire someone just means that yeah, slackers might stay lover before being fired but those being kicked out for reasons that have nothing to do with job performance will remain. 
[I notice that attitudes towards unions in the US seem to be more hostile than elsewhere in the world. Why is this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc07fqx?context=5)|I honestly believe that it's the folks with the money spending a lot to convince the middle class that they can do better on their own while there is no study that shows that. Take a look at the Costco business model in the US for a great example of how it should be.
[Over here, Unions are seen as normal. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc07fqx?context=5)|Also, unions are doing a really bad job of fighting the propaganda. Some of which has to do the with National Labor Relations Act. Every time it's been amended over the years, it was to modernize the rules for employers but they rules for unions are left reflecting the needs of years ago. 
[Unions are fine as long as they are voluntary and aren't beating up scabs. My only issue with unions is when they try to become legally protected or mandatory.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc09o9v?context=5)|Okay. Let me dispel a myth here. No where in the United States are you required to join a union. NO WHERE. you can however be asked to work under a union contract. 
[Lets call a spade a spade. If you have to work under a contract and in many cases have to pay dues, you are effectively forced into the Union.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc0bjid?context=5)|No you're not. You don't need to pay initiation fees or yearly dues. 
[That is not true, unless you are in a right to work state, Unions can require nonmembers to pay ""fair share fees"" to cover collective bargaining costs.  Link to www.maine.edu.  Edit: members to nonmembers.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc0c5fk?context=5)|Those dues are solely collected on your salary. Yes. But the YEARLY dues and initiation fees would not apply as you are not a member. And guess what, if you get fired illegally you'll likely be entitled to a grievance or arbitration at no expense to you so you'll be glad it was there. 
[I should have worded my initial statement differently. Regardless, you are forced to pay the union money which many people believe is wrong and a form of extortion.  Individuals should have the right whether or not they want to be represented by a union or pay into one.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc0cblc?context=5)|Then there is no point to having the union. You cannot have two classes of worker doing the same job. RTW laws cripple unions that are FORCED to represent the worker while getting nothing to contribute to the unions needs.
[Do you think fast food workers will be successful in unionizing?  I feel for them, but unions are usually people of skill, which the fast food sector is not.  Pretty much, if you are easily trained and replaced, a strike isn't effective. Right?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc09m7z?context=5)|I sure hope they will and yes, if you can be replaced it's a lot harder. The goal would be to get people to refuse to work there without a contract and let the working class rise up and demand better treatment.
[How exactly are they being treated poorly? The whole fast food strike thing to me was ridiculous. You expect $15 an hour for working at McDonalds? Does anyone think thats an appropriate wage for that job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc0f8dz?context=5)|Even if you take the $15 wage out of it there are huge safety concerns along with hours they are asked to work and no enforcement of break times. 
[I was in a Union for one year, I paid my dues weekly. When my company laid me off, the Union sat on their hands and did nothing. I violated none of the rules, and I did everything I was supposed to do. Any insight on why the union was cool with taking my money, but not protecting me?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc05tkq?context=5)|Let's start here. Why did you get laid off? Did they discriminate against you? Was it part of a larger lay off? Ultimately, unions cant make employment decisions (though Im sure some unions think they can). They can however make sure you are protected if you get laid off for an illegal reason but a simple lay off is sadly part of life. If this went down badly and the union ignored your requests for conversation about your rights and what was happening, then that's on them for not doing their job. While they can't help you keep a job if layoffs happen (though they can try to work with employers to avoid them) they should be there to answer questions.
[In hindsight, I know all of this now. Over the years Ive learned proper procedures on how it should have worked. It was just disapointing at the time.

[What do you try to achieve the most in your unions?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc07otp?context=5)|An equal and fair working environment. We try to maintain wages while understanding that things do change. When I worked at the entertainment union, we actively looked at the ""books"" of employers with their permission so we could better understand what would keep the industry alive. We were lucky in that our top employers didn't really try to low ball on wages because they knew they needed our members as badly as we needed their films/theatre/cabarets...
 |Safety is also a huge factor. A lot of times this types of concerns can be address for minimal cost and completely change the moral of a unit.

I recently moved into something more mainstream.
[ what (broad if you prefer\) industry are we talking about?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc07xol?context=5)|As far as people being paid equally, yes and no. I think there should be a base salary that is livable and that wages should increase across the the board based upon cost of living. On top of that, I believe in the idea of Merit raises. The annual raise should be simply to keep up with the economy and then I think if you work harder, you should be given other incentives such as an added vacation day, promotion to a team lead (with a monetary increase) or some monetary amount per week/hour/day... The hard part is convincing employers that a merit raise is a good idea. THey think because everyone got a cost of living raise that they don't deserve anything else when as I said before, the COL raise should simply be about keeping up. 
[So workers generally don't want to fight for extra wages after they get a raise?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc08c3e?context=5)|I think they would be willing to work harder with a merit raise incentive. Or incentive tied to production.

What they can do is ""permanently replace"" them but then the fired employees must be hired back if the job opens up again. That is a law many unions are trying to change.
[Are unions dead?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lklmz/in_honor_of_labor_day_i_work_at_a_nationally/cc09205?context=5)|Not at all. They just have trouble marketing themselves.

I've seen people fired for not doing their job but I said in another comment, being a ""bare minimum"" worker is everyones right. If you're being to paid to do a job, you do not need to go above and beyond if you don't want to. I think it's a terrible attitude to take but i don't think people can be fired for doing the job they were hired to do and nothing more.

My reply was referring to the fact that not living in SF, I cant even figure out what their actual demands are or what they are currently making.

""We're all on the same side!"" and ""a rising tide lifts all boats"" is the motto of Labor Day, effectively white-washing class tensions and rising inequality.

[With the fact that our country (USA\) has pretty extensive labor laws, why do we need unions? It seems to me that it results in many entry level positions being paid considerably more than they're worth. With the increased wage, it would seem to me, that as the head of..say a manufacturing company, that it would be more cost effective to outsource the labor to other countries. By outsourcing these jobs, there are less jobs available, so in turn there's less money being injected back into our economy.

Labor law doesn't even come CLOSE to covering everything. OSHA laws cover general situations but do not always cover specific issues that might come up in the work place. FMLA is also great but it does not mean you will get paid for maternity leave or family leave. Also, if you are fired form a non-union job in an at-will state then that's it.

1llcin,12,2013-09-02,How I Went From Intern to Business Owner in Five Years,adrianthomp,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1llcin/how_i_went_from_intern_to_business_owner_in_five/,"As I look back on the last 5 years of my life, I can’t help but think of the classic Anchorman quote, “Boy, that escalated quickly.” Life in the Silicon Valley has been somewhat of a roller coaster, including: community college, two internships, my dream job, freelancing for big name clients, getting married and even starting my own business.

Before we start, I just want to say that I’m not particularly proud of how I handled myself at these first few internships. The reason I’m sharing my story is that I hope it can be an encouragement to others. Especially a younger audience that may be doubting their career path.

Story: http://adrianthompson.com/from-intern-to-business-owner-in-5-years/

Company: http://modio.tv/

My business is less than 2 years old and we've been able to work with big name companies such as: Intuit, Hitachi, Salix Pharmaceuticals and Genentech.

P.S. I'm 25 years old."

1ll9gc,1,2013-09-02,Well Reasoned Rage: A brief examination of a particular problem within TNA,davoinshower-handel,SquaredCircle,https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/1ll9gc/well_reasoned_rage_a_brief_examination_of_a/,"This was originally a part of a comment I wanted to post in another thread. However, I decided it was different from the first part of the comment, so I've decided to post about it and start a new discussion. The comment is still there though.(http://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/1lcsfx/bischoff_and_hogan_bury_tna_and_anonymous_tna/) 

Anyway, let me know what you all think. I'm thinking of making this a regular thing, since it felt really good to get it all out on paper... er, screen.

While TNA had the right idea in trying to bring in younger talent over the past year or so, they've still failed to give the genuinely talented workers the opportunities they deserve. They started with Joey Ryan, and he was pretty damn golden at first, but then they completely, inexplicably dropped the ball with him. The same goes for every Gutcheck contestant that actually seemed to catch on quickly with the fans. So while the dirtsheets and news sites mention that they're interested in new blood, but they repeatedly give up on the new guys who show the most potential. 

It's also worth noting that their scouting process itself is sub-par at best; they often brought up decent guys who just happened to already be well into their 30s (eg Christian York), or they tried to promote guys who just plain don't deserve the roster spot (Bischoff- but we all know why for him, Brisco, Gunner, Robbie E, etc.) Hell, even Magnus comes to mind, seeing as how they've pushed him to the moon even though he has yet to prove himself as an excellent in-ring performer. Keep in mind, this is all despite the company having shown fairly recently that they have at least some capability of finding and hiring great workers from the Indy circuit--- take one look at Austin Aries, for Christy's sake! (see what I did there?) And yet, here are the ""fresh young wrestlers"" that TNA has brought in recently in some capacity: Jessie Godderz and Rockstar Spud. 

This is where I get extremely confused. Despite WWE's now-regular practice of snatching up big names within ROH and other promotions, there is still an abundance of talent out there. Since you guys like evidence, here's a few dudes that come to mind: Davey Richards, Michael Elgin, Colt Cabana (I don't even care that he's old, make him a goddamn announcer to put Mike Tenay out of his misery), Roderick Strong, John Morrison (remember him?), The Briscoe Brothers, Prince Devitt, and last but not least, Kevin Steen. Screw it, pick up one of the youngsters WWE has wasted when he gets released. You could even go with the common practice of the mid-90s and pick up the stars of Japan and Mexico; I don't even keep track of NJPW, but it doesn't take much web surfing to have heard the name Kazuchika Okada It would take a single intern with nothing other than a single computer to figure out who's worth checking out. So, please, Bischoff and Co: go back to basics and remember that there's voices out there besides those of your friends. I'm not even talking about the Internet; read a PWI issue or look at Dave Meltzer's match rankings once in a while and you'll have a direction to go in. That is all. Thank you for your time.

**TL;DR: TNA has started to take baby steps in incorporating younger talent into their product in the past year or so, despite claims to the contrary, but they're either pushing the wrong guys as if they don't know where to look, or they're throwing away potential stars for no clear reason.**"

10, Cat Mario with Scene, well, the game is unfair beyond belief.

9, Mortal Kombat with Hip Hop, You said in a previous episode of The Mosh that you loved Mortal Kombat, so it would be fun to watch you play it

8, Timesplitters Future Perfect, with Scene, Hip Hop, and Intern 2.  Just look at the multiplayer mode, you can play as a gingerbread man, a monkey, a robot with a fish tank for a head, and even a hipster secret agent, while playing a first person shooter.

7, Bomberman, with the entire staff.  If you do not know what it is, basically, you have to defeat the other players with bombs, and it is fun to play and watch.  I recommend playing the Wii Version because the Wii Version allows for up to 8 players, so everyone can play together in one episode, well, except for intern 2 of course

6, Far Cry Blood Dragon. In a post apocalyptic 2007, one super soldier will fight robotic dragons, kick ass, save scientists, and virtually flick things off.

5, Guitar Hero or Rock Band, your metal, enough said

4, Amnesia, It is impossible to do a gaming series while avoiding amnesia

3, Any Open World Crime Game, it will be fun watching you just mess around doing what ever they want

2, Blood And Bacon, Killing pigs, and blood baths, everything metal loves

1, Mad World, just, look at this video and Metal would fall in love with the game http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4McsGqNwX68"

My plan is to pay down my loans, and then go back to get a Master's of Public Administration or Public Policy.  I have some limited internship experience with the local Board of County Commissioners,  and I'd like to work in policy research, maybe eventually run for local office.  

When I discuss this plan with others, they often wonder why I don't just get a law degree.  And honestly, I don't really know.  In high school, it was a goal of mine, but I heard too many horror stories of exorbitant debt and read too many Grisham novels about ambulance chasers, so I changed plans.  Now, though, the idea is intriguing.  

Ultimately, I am curious as to how these two programs relate, and which will offer the opportunities most in line with my interests.  Specifically, I am interested in Campaign Finance law, as I understand it is one of the more in-demand fields, and it ties in directly with politics.

Here are some ways you can do this:

- Go to conferences and talk to every single booth, every person who will talk to you, every lead you can possibly find. Try to get as many business cards as you can and add them all on linkedin. 

- You'll have two or three professors who you like, or who teach things that you like. Maybe they're doing some research over the summer and could use a spare couple of hands. Maybe they have industry contacts, or contacts in tiny labs you've never heard of. 

- Find a relevant group on linkedin for something you're interested in and post that you're interested in a summer internship or are willing to be useful to some company. Be prepared to work for free, the work experience you gain will be worth more than anything they might pay you. 

- Check with anyone who you know who is remotely related to the field you're interested in. Family and friends are obligated to help you so pull every string you have. 

There are literally hundreds of ways to go about getting summer work and building your CV, and the answer to 'how do I get an internship?' is to try every single one of them. 

I was lucky enough to set up both of my final year projects for my degrees with outside companies using all of the aforementioned articles and that was solely responsible for me getting employed after university... interviewers took me seriously. A big factor that helped is that I started looking around in September and didn't wait until two months before my final project like everyone else in my class.

Anyway starting from now, I'll have to look for a job and got a question or two (for now).  
  
Generally is it better to use a custom Resume (I thought on purchasing one from [here](http://graphicriver.net/category/print-templates/stationery/resumes)) or use the plain one in word?   
  
Also is it a good idea to buy the designer extra $50 (for example) to edit the template to my needs. I believe that by using a ""custom"" Resume, I may distinguish myself from other plain resumes.

  I'm graduating in December with my MPH in Epi and the job search is starting to loom over me and I was hoping for some advice from anyone currently working in the field. I have a few years work experience prior to starting my MPH, mainly working at a large hospital on primary care research projects as an RA. I'm currently interning at our local health department as well as in an infection control department at a local hospital.

I guess my first issue is that I'm not 100% sure what sorts of jobs I should be looking for. The job listings I’ve been seeing for Epi are so broad that there doesn’t seem to be a particular path jumping out at me. I'm enjoying the health department internship so far and I like the practical aspect of being able to see results of your efforts, which in my previous research jobs I often felt was lacking.  However I see many job postings in research that seem appealing, but I worry that I’ll end up not really feeling like I’m making any sort of impact.  Does anyone here work in one of these areas that can offer some advice? Are the job prospects/salaries better for particular positions?

The other big concern is of course salary. Again the ranges I’m seeing are all over the place and location will obviously play a big role. I’m hoping to move back up to the Northeast eventually, but with the higher cost of living and my student loans, I’m not sure that it will be feasible for me right out of school. 

So I guess my questions are:

Any comments on the current trends you see in the job market for Epi?  How hard is it to land a job after an MPH and what sorts of entry level salaries are common? 

Finally are there any job search tips you wish you had known? I’ve already met with career services to review my resume and I’m planning to start sending out application in the next few weeks so any advice would be appreciated!

I recently started a part-time position with a small company whose employees work remotely. I had been working with them for 4 months as an unpaid intern, and was looking forward to finally getting paid.

After dragging me along about this potential position for a couple months, we finally had a skype meeting about me taking over as content manager and social media manager. We agreed on an amount that we both thought could work (me and the founder - there are only 7 people in this company total). It was a bit confusing because we were talking about part-time, 20 hours a week, but also discussed the salary in full-time terms since there was a possibility for the position to become full time in the future.

So, 2 months later I check my bank account, and see my two deposits from them are half of what we agreed to for my wage. I asked the founder about it, and he claimed that that was the correct amount, and he was sorry for any misunderstanding, but that was what I would be paid. I was flabbergasted, because I am POSITIVE that is not what we agreed to - I would never have accepted the position. 

I went back through my emails and have nothing in writing. On top of all this, I've been working well over my allotted 20 hours for them because they are giving me a lot to do and I enjoy the work. Now I just feel angry and frustrated and don't know what to do - do I argue with him more about it? Just quit immediately? I also really can't tell if he is sincerely confused or is trying to rip me off.

To make things even weirder - they are flying me out to a company meeting in a few weeks. It's in a cool area I'd like to visit, so I want to go before I do anything drastic. Then again, I feel like I should bring up this pay issue ASAP if I want any chance of resolving it (we discussed the issue originally a few days ago). 

I've been out of school for three years, and have previous experience with content writing and marketing. The pay they are offering me now is less than what I got for my first internship out of college. I don't know what to do because I love the company and enjoy the work, but the pay isn't acceptable for me. Any advice?"

What caught me really off guard then were two things:
1) My doctor had a med student as resident with her.
2) We weren't in the room where we would be sitting at the table face to face but were we kind of sat next to each other. Small thing for sure, but I expected the other room and when preparing I pictured us in that room. :D

The intern sort of made it a hard time to keep myself confident. I was happy I had a couple of opening sentences prepared to get into the topic easy, but with a third person in the room it blocked me a bit. I don't mean to complain it was okay, it just held me back a bit. In fact, I even trembled during the conversation.

But my doctor was great as usual, she's the best. Asked things like whether this made me feel depressed or anything, or if there were any occasions that led to this, how long I've been feeling that way.. whether I told anybody about it, and just like that she went to ""I recall a story about this pole jumper who went through something similar"" and I knew she meant Balian Buschbaum, ""yeah, he's from Ulm!"" 
Ulm is about 30km from here we hope to get a therapist that suits me there (I know somebody who went to all this with a therapist from Ulm, I just don't have a name so far) The next shot would be Munich, which is about 150km from here. D:

Don't want to work in a typical office job. Need help to find alternatives!**

So I have one year left out of five before I've got a degree in power engineering. I've had to summer internships along the way, one in a governmental institution and one in a larger oil services company.

Up until quite recently, I have been focused on finishing my degree and getting a good paying job in a large company, but now it doesn't seem as attractive anymore. Think I've gotten a little tired of all the theoretical work. 

So I was wondering if anyone knows of some internships/positions/jobs where you can utilize your degree, but allows you to experience something else than the 9-5 office routine? I was thinking about non-profits, but have no idea where to start looking. Any help or stories of people in similar situations would be most welcome! "

Been counting calories and lifting weights for about 5 months, and have had plenty of non-scale-victories in that time. But today...today was something. 

Right around when I started losing weight I had an interview for an internship that would have been absolutely fantastic for experience as a soon to be college grad. At that time, I weighed a solid 357lbs and had no appropriate clothing to wear to the interview that fit. So I bought a shirt, dress pants, belt (56 waist), and tie at a Big and Tall clothing store. It was the single most degrading experience to plunk down good money for clothing just to fit my roundness. And to boot, I wasn't selected for the internship. Now maybe I was under qualified or they found a better candidate, but I often think back as wonder if the interview would have been different if I was 100lbs lighter. 

Skip to today and realize that after I bought the outfit for that interview, every instance I've tried on clothing since then has been less than satisfying. But today I was with my girlfriend in an outdoor sporting goods store looking at fleece jackets. I remembered trying on a XXL North Face jacket back in January of this year and it wasn't even close to even zipping up. I saw the same jacket, same size today and figured, ""what the hell, let's give this shit a go."" I'll be goddamned...it zipped up all the way with some room to spare. Had to buy that fucker on the spot.

1ljxxm,11,2013-09-01,My 7 year old is missing his dad super hard and I'm worried and overwhelmed.,[deleted],Parenting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1ljxxm/my_7_year_old_is_missing_his_dad_super_hard_and/,"My kiddo turned 7 last month.  When he was 3.5, we left his father and went to a domestic violence shelter.  I was granted a one year protection order, and his dad left us 100% alone for almost three years.

Earlier this year, I randomly got a text saying he wanted to be a part of our son's life.  We talked on the phone that night, and later Skyped.  This was February 2013.  In late March, a very close, very loved family member on that side of the family unexpectedly passed away.  My son's father came up for the funeral and we saw him for the first time in years.  It went fine.

Fast forward a few months, we're having weekly phone calls (which I supervised) and Skypes.  He asks if this summer the kiddo can come visit him for awhile.  I said maybe, I had conditions, I had to be convinced.  I was/am an exhausted and young single mom, who was bogged down with full-time school, a job and an internship.  I eventually agreed to a 5.5 week visit - we live in Washington state, he and his new wife live in Colorado.

Overall, everything went really well.  I had near-daily phone calls, kid had a blast.  I missed him like hell, but I also really appreciated the free time.  I've had him since I was 18, and I hadn't ever been alone for more than two days at time in my entire life.  It was rough in some ways, but I think it was super valuable for us both.

So, he's home now.  The first couple of days were great.  He was excited to be home.  He's always been a very sweet, loving and well-behaved kiddo.  High energy, for sure, but well-behaved.  Things aren't great today.  This morning I took him for a special treat breakfast (we don't go out a lot, what with being broke).  He was being subtly annoying - not obnoxious enough for others to be bothered by it, I don't think.  But he was mouthing everything I said, lying down on the booth, complaining the food was taking too long, saying we should get it ""to go"", etc.  Annoying.

I got mad.  I texted his dad (knowing that they took him out to eat just about every day while he was there), asking if the kid misbehaved like that with him.  He said no, that he was great.  That they usually brought coloring for him (which I'd done) and played tic-tac-toe, etc.

I'm not proud of this part.  I looked the kiddo in the eye and asked him why he was being a little monster for me, and never for his dad.  Told him I'd texted his dad and told him he was being annoying in a resturaunt.  Asked what's up with that.  His face fell.  I asked him if he'd like to play tic-tac-toe, since he enjoyed that with his dad.

At that point, he held his coloring up to his face and I saw these tears streaming off his chin.  No audible sounds, just silent tears.  His pancakes came, and the tears kept coming.  He started eating, still crying.

I felt awful.  Totally awful.  I pride myself on being a gentle but firm parent, and I lost that for a minute.  I gave him a hug, told him to eat his food.

He started complaining that he wanted to go home and lie down after eating some of his food.  So I got the check, boxed the food, we went home.  He laid in my  bed and stared at the ceiling for a solid 4 hours.

We/he have family support here kind of, but they're in another city (fairly accesible, but not very much so).  I feel pretty alone and exhausted and stressed, and terrified of bills, etc, most of the time.  My kid is typically wonderful, but he's also kind of high needs.  He still has accidents (pees himself) most days of the week.  Occasionally #2 accidents, too.  He's behind in reading.  I worry so much.

Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this stuff, how to help foster a good parent/child relationship when his dad is in another state and is actually quite the douche who still hasn't apologized for anything that happened?  Yeah, I'm a little bitter.  He also hasn't paid a penny of child support, ever.  So there's that.

TL;DR:  7 year old spent 5.5 weeks with his long-lost dad out of state, came home, and is misbehaving and doesn't want to do anything but lie around and watch TV.  Young, single mom is overwhelmed and worried.

EDIT:  We've been going to therapy together for almost 3 years, which has been immensely helpful in a lot of ways, and I'm grateful it.  However, it's not everything.  We do play-therapy, which he leads and it's parenting support for me.  It hasn't been helpful with the accidents at all, and the therapist and I kind of clash in how to handle it (for instance, he'll pretend to use the bathroom and lie about it.  I say that's lying and he should be in trouble, she analyzed me for calling it lying and says it comes from shame, and we should figure out why he does it.)  Etc."

I attend a relatively large university for my state. As of this August, I am completing my last round of classes online, as I have moved out of state. The school is not a major research university, and I have not had any success asking for advice or guidance from the PhD's there.

I would like some advice on how to find and participate in research in my field that isn't sponsored by my university. The town I am currently in does have a major research university, and they are doing research in several areas in which I am interested. Their website makes it quite clear they give preference to applicants with research experience, of which I have none.

If it helps, I think I am a good candidate otherwise. I have a 3.94 GPA, have completed a minor in Mathematics with a 4.0, belong to several nationally recognized honor societies (including Pi Mu Epsilon), was a Senator in the SGA, was the secretary of our campus' CS Club, and I accepted and worked a CS internship over the summer, after which the company decided to keep me on as a remote worker. 

From what I have read on my own, my best option might be to write a paper for a conference, like something sponsored by the IEEE. Without the guidance of professor/mentor, I am at a loss of how to start this process, or if there are other options that are better. Any advice would be much appreciated.

Need some advice.,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1log52/im_23f_unsure_of_what_to_do_about_my_gf_21f_need/,"Hey everyone, just needed some advice because I'm kind of torn up on what to do about my current relationship. We met off OKcupid in March when I was living across the country, planning to move out East for grad school in May. We talked every day until finally meeting at the end of May and have been dating ever since. We spent about 3 nights a week together this summer but now I'm moving to do a grad school internship 2.5 hours away for the next 8 months. We plan on alternating weekends so will spend two weekends a month with each other. We've talked haphazardly about living together after this rotation and for the majority of the time we've been together, things have been great. We love each other, and have a lot of fun together. 

But now the distance has started and my anxiety is skyrocketing. I've had a lot of trouble with relationships in the past (and she has too) but this seems to be my first mature, healthy relationship. That being said, we are different in a lot of ways. I'm very emotional, external, and open whereas she's more internal, reserved, and quiet. I thought we did a good job of balancing each other out, but the last week or so, seriously starting to have doubts. 

We've begun to argue a bit about things (her roommate, drunk times, etc.) but overall do not fight often or anything. I got mad at her for the first time in the five months we've been talking because of an experience of her getting so drunk going out with her best friend (who happens to be my roommate) that she woke me up at 1:30a HAMMERED and I was up until 4am taking care of her while she was sick in my bathroom the night before I had a job interview in the morning. But we moved on from that fast and she took accountability for her actions. Another thing that irks me is how often she says that I need to ""relax"", which is something that yes, I'm quite aware of. I know that I have anxiety issues and am working on them but reminding me 10+ times a day that I need to relax (especially in context of her playful banter with me striking a chord and followed up by how much I need to 'relax'). Telling me constantly that I need to relax is not going to help me relax. 

I sent an email last night explaining my fears about the transitions occurring for both of us and how it's tough on me, how important it is to respect the fact that we have different modes of communication and how I need to respect that she's not an emotional person just like she needs to respect the fact that I am. She's starting her senior year of undergrad while I'm a first year master's student. Big changes are coming up for her, and she's on the fence about grad school vs. career. I also said in the email that I supported her choices, would be there for her through it all, and value our relationship a lot. Granted, she's been traveling and with friends/family all day but a full 24 hours have passed and not a single acknowledgment of the email has happened other than me asking if she'd read it yet and her saying ""not entirely"". Seems a bit ironic, actually. 

Basically I'm just wondering if there's a way to find a middle ground in terms of communication styles and if not, what options do I have?

TL;DR: Girlfriend and I are now doing distance and have different modes of communication. Love each other very much but at a loss for finding middle ground. "

I'm a fairly recent college grad working in Payroll Audit (auditing multi-employer benefit plans). I accepted this position because it sure beats being unemployed, but I'd like to actually get into financial audit proper at some point down the road. My question to you is this: how long should I plan to keep my current position before looking for something new?

I graduated from a good business school with B.S. in Accounting a 3.25 overall GPA (3.4 major) and also worked as an RA at university. I graduated with my 150 credits and everything required to sit for my CPA as well. I did an internship as part of a study abroad program, but found out too late it wasn't anything to do with accounting (by far, my biggest regret). I interviewed for some Big 4 jobs during senior year but think my lower GPA/lack of experience hampered me there.

I would eventually like to get into audit with the Big 4 or Grant Thornton or something. My current employer has a financial audit segment as well, but I'm not really sure I'd want to stay in this industry - it's a rather specialized niche. I'm want to pursue my CPA as well, but if I pursue it through my current employer I'd have to sign on for another 2 years, so I'm still hesitant.

First of all, my [overall progress picture.](http://i.imgur.com/7CmxvPy.jpg)


**I'm a 6’0, 75kg/165lbs 19 year old guy** (If that wasn't obvious) from England. In the before half of my progress photo I was 16 years old, 5'9 and roughly 65kg/145lbs. I bulked up to 83kg/183lbs at 6'0 and spent 10 weeks cutting down to 74.8kg/165lbs. This after photo was taken after a week of carbohydrate depletion and 24 hour reload, with a back and bicep pump, in order to look my best for a casting.  


I've been reading /r/fitness for the last 3 years, I don't comment much because I feel I don't have much to add. I wanted to share my progress with you guys and say thanks so much for all the help and motivation along the way.
___________________________________________________________________

**MY STORY**

I originally got into lifting 3 years ago because I was tired of being one of the weediest and weakest kids in my year group at school. I didn’t know what I was doing and tried to work my own way around the gym with a little help from YouTube. A good year, if not more, of my original training was wasted to fuckarounditis; I would train 3x a week with no real idea of what I was doing, which resulted in a heavy emphasis on core and arms, with almost no chest whatsoever. After browsing /r/fitness more and more I started doing a typical split routine in my second year and bulked over the winter on a 3/4x weekly split. I then cut down for last summer to [look like this](http://i.imgur.com/qNDIo1o.jpg?1). This was the first time I ever felt I had a good body and felt confident to take my shirt off at a beach, and is also when people started to notice I had got into shape, which was an incredible feeling.


From last summer I dirty bulked once again on a 4x week split, often having to miss legs due to a serious knee problem which came back to haunt me from when I used to swim competitively when I was 10 and 11.  My workouts would usually be 2 hours each in length and covered two body parts with four exercises of 4x12 each: Back &amp; Biceps, Chest &amp; Triceps, Shoulders &amp; Abs, Legs. 


During this process I massively emphasised good form and a mind-muscle connection over weight. My lifts improved slightly over this period, but nowhere near the standard that other people seem to see strength gains. Due to my knee injury I can’t squat or deadlift anymore, but I did do a 1RM bench max of 85kg/185lbs. I know this is average at best, but is what I am going to be focusing on improving over the next year.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

**DIET**

For roughly the first 5 months of my bulk I ate absolutely anything and everything, I would eat a whole pack of sausages, half a kilo of chips and half a jar of mayo for tea after munching nuts through my day at work. After 5 months of this I had made muscle gains but also significant fat gains which I was starting to notice, particularly around my face. The second five months of my bulk I ate cleaner, still very much a dirty bulk but probably down from ~5000 calories a day to ~4000. 

After 10 months of bulking on this routine I dieted for 10 weeks from 83kg down to 75kg, although a significant portion of that weight will be water due to my keto diet for my last week. I initially followed a leangains diet with an 8 hour feeding window, something I found very successful in 2012, but I was no longer in school and working full time meant I couldn’t make the 8 hour window work with very long days at my Management Consultancy intership. 

I ended up cutting with 2000 calories on workout days and 1500 on rest days, with 150g+ of protein a day. I estimated my TDEE at 3500 calories, and find losing weight a lot easier than putting it on, because of this I was not 100% strict on those diet figures, although that is approximately what they averaged at. 

I had very regular cheat days, at least once a week, and went away for a weekend where I ate 7 whole packets of cookies and little else. I made a .gif of my 10 weeks progress on that diet, which I think is quite interesting. Apologies for the douchey pose in the photos but they’re all I could take consistently. The [10 week diet progress gif here]( http://i.imgur.com/zIccVFo.gif)

-----------------------------------------------------------------

**THE FUTURE**

From here I intend to bulk more cleanly over the winter in an aim to minimise fat gains so I stay a little leaner than I was during my last bulk. I will be following a 4x weekly split routine once again, with an emphasis particularly on my chest and also traps, the two body parts I feel are lagging behind and so I will be training twice a week. I’m also going to try and bring my strength up to standard and hopefully train my legs around the knee injury I talked about above.

I am going to university to study Computer Science at UCL in London in three weeks time, something I’m massively looking forward to. My one concern with this is the alcohol intake and the impact that will have on my progress, I feel that drinking very rarely (Once every two weeks at most) because of my internship enormously helped me over the last year. Does anyone have any insight on this? I think I will just have to watch the bulk more carefully due to the calories from alcohol.

I feel like I am now the person I wanted to be 3 years ago, having completed the goals I set for myself when I first started to lift and go to the gym. I now have a new hobby that I am passionate about and look forward to continuing with. In addition to the obvious changes in my body, I have also noticed how the change in physique has changed my face. This is something I remember seeing threads about previously, but didn’t think I would experience.

I’ve found the whole process incredibly rewarding, getting into shape has changed me into a completely different, happier, proud and far more confident, person. As a result of this transformation I have been able to sign to a modelling agency and work at the Abercrombie &amp; Fitch flagship in London (Although I know this is unpopular on reddit, I still feel it’s relevant and served as a sign of progress for me where I wouldn’t have been able to hold eye contact with a customer 3 years ago when I worked at Burger King)

If anyone has read this far then thanks very much, and thank you for all the incredible helpful threads on here and /r/bodybuilding that have helped on this journey.

Feel free to ask me any questions and sorry for the wall of text!

I graduated in May with a B.A. in Anthropology (minor in Mediterranean archaeology). My interest is in archaeology. I've attended a field school and completed an internship (following graduation). Upon graduating, I decided that a gap year would be the best for me. It would allow me to focus and figure things out in my own time. I also felt that I needed to improve my application with more field/lab experience (or any other academic job). I have been unable to find a job that falls within those parameters. What do I need to do? Hold out until I find a job like that (unlikely, since they are hard to come by)? Or do I need to broaden my horizons (get a job that really doesn't relate to my degree field)? 

Forgive me if I sound ignorant. I'm the first person in my family to even get an undergraduate degree. Grad school is an extremely difficult thing to navigate and I often get conflicting advice from friends and advisers. I'm not sure what Grad schools are even looking for in the way of life experience. Thanks. "
1lo2om,3,2013-09-03,[Request] May I critique your YA manuscript? Details inside...,MayICritiqueYourBook,writing,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/1lo2om/request_may_i_critique_your_ya_manuscript_details/,"I am in a bit of a unique situation. I did an internship at a major publishing house in 2010, where I read a lot of submissions and wrote a lot of reader's reports. I have since realized that I love reading submissions and critiquing them. Some of my publishing contacts want me to submit samples of my reader's reports to potentially get a job freelance critiquing. My problem is I'm not sure if I can send them the reader's reports I wrote while completing my internship, as they may be considered property of the publishing house. I am waiting to hear back from the editor I worked under, but I may need samples before I hear back from her.

This is where you come in: Do you have a complete unpublished YA manuscript that I can read and review? I am more than willing to send you a copy of my reader's report (covers plot, voice, character development, quality of writing, etc-- does *not* cover copyediting) and discuss any of my critiques with you. In return I ask that you give me permission to send my report as is (I will not edit it to make your book sound better as it is necessary to show my honest thoughts) to publishing houses and/or agents. I am more than willing to leave your name, the title of your book, and main character's name off the report I use as a sample if you want your anonymity protected. I may also be able to leave off the summary and only send the base critique depending on the story.

I graduated from Northeastern University in 2012 with a degree in English (focusing on literature, but I technically completed all of the extra classes necessary for a minor in writing including two workshops taught by B.A. Shapiro, NY Times best selling author of ""The Art Forger"") and am half way done with a certification in copyediting from UCSD extension.

If you are willing to let me look at your manuscript please e-mail me at mayicritiqueyourbook@gmail.com with the title, brief synopsis, word count, and about how many passes/readers/editors it has had. I would prefer dystopia, teen romance, and possibly light science fiction (my favorite books are ""Divergent,"" ""The Hunger Games,"" ""Matched,"" ""Ender's Game,"" etc.) but ultimately I am fine with just about anything that is fiction.

If would like any proof of my story please feel free to send me an e-mail and I will send you proof. I do need to create/provide the samples very quickly (probably by the end of the week at the latest) so I would need a copy of your manuscript ASAP. I promise not to do anything unsavory with it or your contact information. I am using a throw-away right now, but I have been an active redditor for over a year and a half. 

Thanks for considering, I look forward to hearing from you!

1lo1ea,4,2013-09-03,"I am one of those people who loves listening to other peoples stories and problems, but I never find the courage to share my own.",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1lo1ea/i_am_one_of_those_people_who_loves_listening_to/,"I may not want to admit this EVER, OPENLY, TO ANYONE, but I have issues. Some of them a bit serious. And I have absolutely no idea why, and this is what bothers me most. I am the shoulder friends can cry on, I love hearing stories and it makes me really happy when people trust me up to the point where they share some of their darkest secrets with me. Paradoxically I have serious issues in trusting other people and I NEVER openly share ANYTHING about myself.

I have heard stories of people being raped, abused, treated quite roughly by their parents, gone through a fucked up childhood etc, well... I didn't have to go through any of these, yet somehow, I begin to realize that my mind is badly messed up. Overly screwed, virused, like a barely functioning computer. I feel as if I'm equipped with an incredible amount of RAM, a fairly decent processor and some other pretty cool, proficient parts. I feel as if I have the power to do anything in the whole wide world and I'd really like to do everything, but the truth is , life is pretty damn short and one lifetime is barely enough to choose just 1-2 big goals. I have absolutely no idea what to choose and what not to. I am lost. 

Almost everyone I meet inspires me to follow a different career path, to me every job is so damn interesting: doctors, nurses, teachers, tourist guides, photographers, writers, cooks, psychologists, researchers, librarians, pilots, train drivers, taxi drivers, programmers etc. etc... and even janitors. Yes, I would like to find the time to do become all of the above (and more) and simultaneously find time for friends, concerts and dozens of leisure activities, such as playing sports, playing guitar, reading and rereading science fiction, going hiking, swimming, exploring places etc. etc. etc.

Ever since I finished high school, I've been in this fucked up existential crisis. At first it all led me to believe philosophy could provide answers. I began reading more and more philosophy books and later on studying philosophy at a local university. But not even 6 months passed and I got lost in the wildness. I could no longer grasp the purpose of philosophy, as it proved to be useless in finding any concrete answers. I dropped out of university. I took a gap year, then I discovered this sort of new and totally revolutionary college of liberal arts, which sounded like the perfect thing for the - the place I had always imagined as ""heaven on earth"" for a person like me (whose mind is filled with uncommon peculiarities). I wrote the best application letter I possibly could, I got invited to the application interview and, due too my overly uncontrollable enthusiasm, I scared the shit out of the commission and got rejected. What followed were 6 months of what I would call severe depression. I have never seen a shrink or a psychotherapist -&gt; therefore I am not 100% certain whether ""depression"" is the correct label for what I went through or not. Frankly, I always tried to keep away from anything that forced me to become psychological vulnerable to other people. After receiving that rejection letter I could barely leave the bed, I spent 10-15 hours per day reading books or articles on the internet or just looking at the ceiling, and I would only leave the house once a week, in order to buy toilet paper, cheap wine and some stuff to eat.

As time passed, I slowly climbed out of the black hole and tried to put my life back together. I was still in the same existential crisis as always, I wished to go to so many places at the same time, but I had no idea what to choose. So I began following a lifestyle based on the famous ""carpe diem"" principle -&gt; do whatever you feel like doing.

Since I wasn't able to chose a career path with rational arguments, I tried to make a decision by flipping a coin. I flipped coins for all my 30 study options and eventually ""psychology"" won. I applied for psychology and, based on my graduation marks I got rejected. The last admitted application was 1.22 and I was at 1.23. More  ""depression"" followed, nevertheless not as severe as the last time. I spent a whole new year doing meaningless jobs, lived life as if it's only purpose was to pay the monthly rent, buy&amp;eat pre-cooked meals and wait for time to pass, inside a small apartment with my boyfriend (whom I had been dating since I was 16 - now I am 23 and we're still living happily together and, in spite of this unbelievably rare blessing, my mind still feels like an old, rusty, broken computer. but why?!). So, after the second rejection letter, thanks to my boyfriend's support I gradually climbed out of the black hole again and, since psychology didn't work out for me, I decided this time to go for photography. I applied for some of the most famous photography colleges in Europe and got accepted by many of these, but due to the high tuition fees (about 600 Euros / month) I was forced to turn all the acceptances down. Instead I did some internships at some pretty kick ass press agencies and began working on a few photo documentaries. 

Everything went great, I was once again settling for an amazing career path, more and more people began to appreciate my photos (I even had an exhibition). But then another 6-8 months went by and I have no idea what happened then. Somehow this whole passion for photo documentaries shifted in the background and one day I woke up in the same old existential shit hole: ""Life is so short, how can I make sure I am making the right choices? Yes, in 2-3 I might be able to get really good at photography. But will my future me be happy with the choices I am making today or will I bitterly regret everything? Should I consider pursuing this photography bullshit forever or should I aim for some of the other cool careers out there? What would everything look like if I had been accepted for a B.A. in psychology? etc. etc.""

And so, during the summer of 2011 I flipped another coin for some 20-30 times and eventually, based on the fact that I visited an Indian restaurant and really enjoyed their Pakooras and their deliciously milky Ras Malai, I decided to enroll for a B.A. in South Asian studies. I spent the past two years passionately learning Hindi and Urdu, I felt quite happy and content with what I was doing. I enjoyed the courses, the languages, all the Bollywood movies and the fact that the guys at our local Pakistani restaurant would talk to me in Urdu (they still do). Once again everything was great, but then a new wave of craziness emerged - as you probably already noticed, every 1-2 years I wake up with a powerful drive to run away from everything I have, tear it all apart and start from scratch. This is exactly what I am doing now: even though I didn't drop out of college (yet - I am struggling not to), in 2012 I began taking less and less courses and... opened a startup company: a tea store. Yes, I am 100% crazy, you probably figured it out by now.

I started working on a business plan, did some research and figured it would be a great moment to open a tea store (tea is getting more and more popular) + owning a business is one of the things I always wanted to do in my life.

So, today I'm here: the tea business is going on a good path, it has taught me so many things during the past year and I don't regret getting into it, but so far I haven't managed to make it profitable, and I believe this is ONLY due to my chaotic commitments to far to many things. It is difficult to study, have a job (my parents don't support me financially and they disapprove of every crazy thing I do) and run a successful business at the same time. I am stuck at a sort of crossroad, I am doing far to many times at the same time, it is impossible for all of them to work out, so I need to cut things out, decide what to focus on and, for heaven's sake, stick with my decision for a longer period of time!!

But how? How the hell can I break this devilish pattern and why have I fallen into it in the first place? Why do I want so many things, why can't I be like most folks: commit to one single thing, get really good at it and continue doing it for the rest of my life? 

Inevitably, I begin to ask myself: where does this existential crisis arise from? This need, this obsession for doing EVERYTHING? Am I trying to prove something to someone? If yes, to whom and why? Are other people driven by the same inexplicable urge? If yes, what is it? Is it a disease? 

Expect this pile of text to be full of spelling mistakes, as I haven't studied English in school. As a Balkans kid, I only had the chance to learn English through cartoons and movies... nevertheless, I did run it through spell checkers and I hope it's decent enough for you to read it. :)

TL DR: 22 year old stuck in a seemingly endless existential crisis. 

There's a lot more to this whole story, many thanks to those of you who took the time to read it and if anyone feels like reading a bit more, let me know and I'll post a part2 and part3 as comments. They are all in a .txt file, but I am still not sure whether sharing all of this is good or bad. "

I'm posting here with the hope that someone can give me any suggestions on organizations in the area I should look into that could advance my knowledge of the environment and give back. I thoroughly enjoy manual labor and would prefer ""working in the field."" Anything in the area of forestry, conservation, trail maintenance, etc. would be awesome. 

I have been attempting to find some opportunities through SCA, the nature conservancy, and Adirondack mountain club. However, much of these opportunities take place over the summer. Surely environmental work needs to be done year round, and organizations must desire volunteers or interns not just in the summer. 

So, if anyone can give me some guidance on any kind of environmental work that can be done year round, please let me know."
1lnzvr,6,2013-09-03,That summertime sadness.,onetwothreeforfive,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1lnzvr/that_summertime_sadness/,"I started the first day of my last year of high school today.

It's been been a hard transition, for the end of my summer felt quite unsatisfying. I spent my summer in an internship, then lived in Paris with my family for a month. Now, this was a summer of incredible experiences, but it's timing was very strange. 

The internship began practically at the beginning of summer, stopped working a week before Paris, and I started school a week after I got back (last weekend). The transition back my life at home was very limited. I felt so much like I 'missed out' on a part of summer, which I've narrowed down to a lack of interaction with friends, etc due to me being busy at my internship during the week, and gone from mid-July to the end of August. 
I've been struggling with the notion of going back to school etc, because I long for the freedom and leisure with friends (I.E. beach days etc) I feel like I missed out on during the last month. 

Another major cause for this depressive period is that my girlfriend (whom I cared for very deeply and with whom I had an incredible relationship) worked at a camp all summer, which really lead to feelings of missing out on time with her. In the beginning it was still hard, but we tried to keep in contact as much as possible...I visited her and that was nice, although when I left it made us both realize how much we missed each other, and how hard the distance was. She decided that the best strategy for her was to just focus on work (and fun, she partied with her friends all the time). We gradually lost contact, going a day, two days, three days without texting, then in France it all went downhill. 

The entirety of my trip we did not talk save for two or three meaningless conversations. That was hard. Not talking to her was a major source of anxiety and depression for me. I got back from the trip only and we started talking again (which was nice) and we hung out a few times which made me feel like things were almost back to normal. But I still feel disconnected from her, for we haven't had any time alone just the two of us since I've been back. It's going be hard going into this year, for we go to one of the best private schools in the country, and naturally there is little time/balance for relationships with classes and college prep work, but after writing this text I'm feeling more hopeful about the future.

I'd absolutely love to pursue my interest in RF as microwaves was my favorite by far. I applied to a few places such as AT&amp;T and Verizon as they had open positions that matched with my interests but I am just looking for other options. 

I'm willing to relocate most anywhere in the US. I feel like I've got a pretty solid resume, just without any experience due to not being able to land an internship. I was chair of my school's IEEE chapter and have a couple of service awards from my engineering department though.

[Did you quit? Why? Best and worst thing about working for Disney? Was it hard to be nice to EVERYONE? Best behind the scenes story?  And what is your favorite Disney Movie?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0nb2g?context=5)|The best thing about working for Disney was probably getting to learn the secret ins and outs of how things worked behind the scenes.  The worst part was that sometimes I was a little bored.  If you're working outdoors as a character during the summer you spend 20 minutes meeting and greeting people, then a long time inside cooling off (can't remember exactly how long--I want to say 40 mins-1 hour).  So that's a lot of break time!   It was hard to be nice to everyone some days, but it was made way easier because (the majority of the time) no one could see my face.  So if I felt snarky with some guests I didn't have to smile to them, talk to them nicely, etc.  That was easier on me than regular social interaction would have been for me (believe it or not I'm an introvert!).  I think that any employee who has face-to-face guest contact would have had a way harder time than I did being ""on"" or nice all the time.  I will say, though, that the vast majority of the people I knew who worked for Disney in that capacity were extroverts and the niceness came naturally to them.   I was working at Chef Mickey's (one of my favorite places--I really liked doing character dining shifts) one night--I was ""friends with"" Dale.  It was the end of the evening, so the majority of the guests had left the restaurant.  There was an older girl there--maybe about 6--who LOVED Dale, and her family was finishing up.  She said, ""Dale!  You're my biggest fan!  Can I have your autograph?!""  I thought it was a cute slip of the tongue--so did the adults at the table--so I hugged her, etc, and then signaled that I would be back in a moment.  I knew there was a printer close by backstage that had a piece of computer paper in it.  I went back and grabbed one, then signaled that I wanted her autograph too.  I signed half the paper for her, and she signed the other for me.  She was really excited!  I still have the piece of paper she signed :)  One more story because it's really hard to pick just one!  I had covered the lunch shift for the people in Toon Town, and the other characters that were working with me were all full time and good friends.  They asked me if I would come with them and ""make some backstage magic.""  I said sure!  So we randomly picked an office in the tunnel--I'm not even sure who worked there or what they did--and just caused trouble in it.  It was GREAT!  The cast members were so excited!  We pretended to steal stuff off of their desks, wrote all over their marker boards, made pretend phone calls, etc.  The group must have done this before because one guy said, ""I've been bringing my camera to work every day in case you ever came back!""  He took a picture of me on his work phone with my feet up on his desk.  It's cool to make good memories for guests, but it's also really special to make another cast member's day!
[I was there in 2005 and there was a group who would do this back them. I wonder if it was the same group. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0nvg1?context=5)|Could be!  They were great--I ended up working with them a lot!
[I heard that there is a secret jail at Disneyland where they detain people who are too drunk to be in public or are tripping on drugs.  Any truth to the rumor?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0nrpu?context=5)|I don't know a whole lot about this, but I do know they have ways to hold people.  Once I was backstage at EPCOT and saw what looked like holding cells.  I also saw the place where the drug/bomb-sniffing dogs that they have for security reasons.  They were cute!
 |What is actually more interesting to me is the room they have near Guest Relations in the Magic Kingdom.  I never saw it, but was told by a reliable source that they have a room where they take irate guests.  It's decorated nicely but has absolutely nothing Disney-related in it--because they don't want to enrage you further, I guess.  The psychology of that is interesting to me!
[Have you ever been assaulted? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0n9lb?context=5)|I was never assaulted by a guest, but I was assaulted (sexually) backstage by another cast member.  
[How did that go down? Was it a supervisor? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0npiy?context=5)|It happened during my first week there while I was training in a crowded dressing room.  I don't actually know who the guy was--I mean, it happened really quickly and afterward I couldn't recall his name.
 |I reported it, but I don't think anything came of it.
[Can you explain what happened? You don't have to if you don't want to.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0ni4k?context=5)|It happened during my first week there while I was training in a crowded dressing room. I don't actually know who the guy was--I mean, it happened really quickly and afterward I couldn't recall his name.
 |I reported it, but I don't think anything came of it. 
[Wow that really sucks, I'm sorry.  Fucking scumbag.  Edit: grammar ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0o5lt?context=5)|The worst part was that the person who helped me fill out the report said something like, ""Well, what I've found is that theatre people have less boundaries than people do normally.""  As if that excused what happened.  I was younger then and (obviously) vulnerable.  I did say something back about how that was irrelevant, but it REALLY boils my blood to think about it now.
[Edit- also which housing area did you live in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0nl3k?context=5)|Characters are all done by height.  I mainly played Chip and Dale and Figment.
 |My Disney height is weird--I'm 5'4, which means I'm too tall/too short for a lot of characters.  I'm honestly not super sure why they hired me because I don't fit an in-demand height range!
[What height are the Disney princesses? :D ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0x7d3?context=5)|When I was there it started at 5'4 and ended somewhere around 5'9. 
[Were you face or fur?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0n9rd?context=5)|Fur!  I did show my face in the Magic Kingdom afternoon parade and in the Christmas tree lighting show, but never played a face character.
[Is it true that Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse broke up because Donald Duck said he had a three way with Minnie and Goofy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0nlxq?context=5)|I assume you're kidding, but cast members in Entertainment joke about this CONSTANTLY--well, they joke that Max, Goofy's son, looks like a combination of Minnie and Goofy.  So they say that Minnie and Goofy had a baby and it was Max.  Some people who played Minnie even used to be like ""Goofy can you zip me up?"" and try to act all sexy about it (there's nothing sexy about it in actuality because you look ridiculous under the costume) or grind up on each other.  It might have been funny the first time by the 100th time you hear/see that it's just stupid.
[You know, I was born in Orlando. I live a bit north now (Jax area...not going to say exactly because, obvious\). But I always thought it would be nice to work there. I used to go there every weekend when my dad worked there in the early days.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0q105?context=5)|The working conditions are largely very good.  They work hard to make sure you feel safe at all times, etc.  The costumes I wore were always clean.  The rules are also very clear, so if you follow them it's easy to keep your job.
[So how are the working conditions? What would you say is the hardest work you've had to do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0q105?context=5)|Depending on the job, though, it can be quite hot and will most likely have some thankless aspects (like every job I've ever had).  If you're an extroverted, generally positive person that will most definitely help.
[If I ever did move back to Orlando, I would not mind giving it a shot. (For the record, I've never had a job :P\) ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0q105?context=5)|It's probably the hardest work I've ever had to do physically simply because of the heat+costume (which have no air conditioning)+moving, though getting carts in from an asphalt covered grocery store parking lot in 90+ heat/humidity is a close second.  :)  
[Ever been inside Club 33? what is it like inside?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0pt5l?context=5)|I haven't been inside Club 33!  There was an AMA of someone who has been a longtime member, though--here's a link: [Link to www.reddit.com](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rz72/iama_club_33_member_by_request/) 
[What's the pay?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0nt2u?context=5)|Really low.  I believe I made 6-something an hour--but remember that was in 2006-2007.  Entertainment cast members (in the college program made more an hour than those that worked in other areas of the park.
 |If you're full time/part time (and not in the college program), you make slightly more an hour, but it's still dismal pay.  People I knew who were shorter and had more in-demand characters in their height range could make significantly more by picking up shifts.  If there were less than a certain number of hours between your shifts you got ""turn-around"" pay, which I believe was either time and a half or double time.  But, in general, no one there is in it for the money.
 |I should also note that people who do face characters get more an hour as well--something hotly contested among cast members.
[What kind of freebies do you get?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0pqbr?context=5)|When I was working there (things might have changed since then), I could get into the parks free any time.  I got what was called a Blue Pass that allowed me to get me+3 guests into the parks (one day park hopper tickets) 6 times per calendar year.  I also got a Christmas season bonus pack of coupons that allowed me to get myself +3 people in an additional day.  We also got 1 admission for the same number of people to a water park.
 |We got 10% off certain quick service food, but that was extremely limited.  We could get a significant amount off of a full service dining restaurant (I want to say 20-40%) a limited amount of times a year, plus some extras for the Christmas season.
 |The Christmas season coupon pack also included 6 coupons for free popcorn and sodas, and some coupons for discounts on merchandise.  I also got a cast member Christmas gift--a sort of cheap silver frame that said something like ""Thanks for making dreams come true"" in it.
 |There were few true freebies aside from the park entrances, and, let's face it, if you or you and your family went to the parks you were going to spend a fair amount on food, souvenirs, etc.
 |People who were higher up in the company had what I believe was called a silver pass that allowed them to take themselves +3 people into the parks as much as they wanted.
 |Also--there were blackout dates on the passes for everyone that included the busiest days of the year, like Christmas Eve/Day, New Year's Eve, etc.  So if I wasn't scheduled to work on one of those days I wouldn't be allowed into the parks at all for free--and I definitely couldn't bring any guests.
 |In addition to freebies/discounts, they also gave cast members the opportunity to purchase exclusive merchandise at Company D--a small store that sold things like key chains, sweatshirts/tee-shirts, and some cast member only pins for trading.  There was also a store adjacent to the employee parking lot for the Magic Kingdom that sold discounted merchandise that guests didn't buy.  Next to that was a trailer that sold merchandise that was damaged in some way and (no lie) things that guests either lost or left behind.  There were designer sunglasses, expensive jewelry, cameras, strollers, etc--all that were unclaimed by guests. 
[Is it true that when someone yells ""Andy is coming!"" You all have to fall to the ground and play dead? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0polj?context=5)|I've seen pictures of that on Reddit but never heard of it while I was working there.  I've also read that they had to stop doing that because people were saying it too much :(
 |I was never scheduled to play any of the Toy Story characters myself (though Jessie and Bullseye were in my height range), nor did I know anyone who did--so I can't speak from personal experience in that regard.
[Thanks for the response :\) I've heard its a myth. Maybe someone else will chime in!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0pqup?context=5)|I suppose I can also add that laying on the ground is definitely not strictly allowed according to the rules we're told in training.  So it's also possible that enough people did it that managers found out and put a stop to it!
[When I was there everyone went to the clubs at Pleasure Island (PI\) two nights a week. Cast members didn't have a cover those nights. There was also a place called Jungle Jim's (I think\) and the piano bar on the boardwalk. I have heard that the PI clubs were closed and turned into restaurants and stuff like that. Were they still open when you were there? And if not is there still a place where all the crazy cp's go to get drunk and dance it off?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0oagg?context=5)|That's right!  I'm not much of a partier myself, but I went to the Adventurer's Club a couple of times.  Everything was open when I was there, but they had (I believe) announced the closing.
 |I don't think there's a place where CP's party now...the last time I was there (I was a guest) PI was a ghost town.  I think you can rent the spaces for private functions, though.
[Random, but is it true that all the cast members have to share underwear for the costumes?  I'm not sure if that's an urban legend or not.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0sl5p?context=5)|Not at all--you wear your own underwear--they don't provide it.  Basically they give you shorts and a tee-shirt for under the costume and that's it.
[Also, is it true that the ""face characters"" are a little crazy?  I had a friend who swore by this, as you get a lot of women who are obsessed with Disney Princesses and what not whose life goal is to *be* Ariel or whoever.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0sl5p?context=5)|Sure, there were some face characters that were a little ""crazy"" if by that you mean obsessed with themselves as princesses.  But I would say that there are some people in just about every department there that are a little ""crazy"" in that their life dream is to work for Disney.  There was definitely a caste system within the cast members, though.  People generally ate lunch with their own--and most face characters ate with each other and not with the fur characters.  On the other hand, I knew some really nice people who played face characters too.  It just depends on the person!
[This might seem like kind of an abstract question, but since working there, do you at all feel like you've contributed at all to the Disney legacy? For some reason, I have always had this ideal that when you're employed by Disney in any capacity really that you're essentially making magic happen for children (and adults that are still children at heart, I suppose\). Did you feel that at all while working there or was it mostly just ""another job"" for you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0rzlc?context=5)|This is an interesting question!
 |I wouldn't say that it was just another job for me because I felt like I had a responsibility to do it to the best of my ability and was emotionally invested in that.  However, I would say that the Company is so big now that I definitely felt like we were treated like cogs in a wheel.  I felt very replaceable, which was true, but it still doesn't feel good to be treated like that.  I think this is something that a lot of hourly employees felt.  It didn't so much matter to those of us doing an internship, but it makes me sad for people who worked full time.  
[I am currently a student and majoring in theatre. I am hoping to go into performance, but working for Disney as a face character has always been something I considered. How hard was it for you to get a job with Disney?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0nxc1?context=5)|When I was auditioning it was less difficult than it is now, I believe--at least if you go through the College Program.  Now the competition for the internship is higher because it's paid and more kids who are graduating can't find jobs right away.
 |It depends a lot on your height--if you're really short (I would say 5'2 and below) or quite tall (6'0 and up) then you'll have an easier time.  If you want to be a face character then anywhere between 5'4-5'9 is good (if you're a girl)--they changed those height ranges while I was there, so I can't be 100% positive on those numbers.  But slightly taller than average was preferred when I was there.
 |When you audition (or at least when I did), we had to do an animation exercise ""Pretend you're eating your favorite snack at the parks!"" and also learn a simple musical theatre-style dance combination.  If you showed some dance ability then you got to learn a harder combination.  There were also some puppetry auditions, but I'm not sure what they did with you in those or how they picked people--I did the harder dance one instead.
 |So it's pretty much about if you can communicate through movement--and it's good to have an extra skill on top.  Bear in mind that everyone does fur, including face characters.  So it's possible that they'd hire you to do fur, then you could be pulled to do a face audition (you put on wig/makeup and read from a script) afterward.
[I started going regularly to WDW in 2010 and have had an annual pass ever since.  I've probably seen the daytime parade at least 50 times in MK.  I'm am almost positive every now and then Alice is actually a guy in a wig and dress.  Once I noticed she (he?\) had an Adam's apple and totally the face of a guy.  Is this something common?  I mean, every meet and greet character where they speak obviously they match up gender to the gender of the character, but does this happen a lot on the parade characters?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc10245?context=5)|Nope-that's never true!  Face characters are always the right sex-fur characters it varies.  
[Did it spoil the magic of characters to you when you visit DL because you were once one?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0puik?context=5)|I haven't been to Disneyland yet, but I've been back to Disney World several times since working there.
 |In some ways some of the magic is spoiled.  Interestingly enough it didn't ruin anything to see the costumes all hanging in racks or the characters' heads all lined up--it's more the screwing around that went on backstage that disillusioned me a little bit.
 |There are some aspects that are more fun now that I've worked there, though.  I've visited some of my friends who worked full time while they're on set, and it's a lot of fun to meet them in character.  I also like looking for familiar faces in the parades/shows, and I enjoy seeing them.  I have a greater appreciation for how hard the cast members--at least most of them--work.  
[I hope so too! I have never been to the 4 parks and I hope to head out there mid-late January! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0ph4g?context=5)|Have fun!  As I recall that's not a super-crowded time, which will be nice!
 |:)
[Best part about working at Disney ? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0os7q?context=5)|Learning the ins and outs of the ""behind the scenes"" stuff (How do the parade floats coordinate the music with speakers in the streets?  Where do employees eat?  What do the tunnels look like?)--but I also liked making kids/adults I met/performed for happy.
[So who were you? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0vec0?context=5)|Mostly Chip and Dale, but also Figment and one of the penguins from Mary Poppins!
 |I was also an animator in the Magic Kingdom afternoon parade.
[When you went through traditions, did you feel like you were joining a cult? I sure as hell did.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0zjnx?context=5)|Ha!   To an extent, yes.  Disney definitely tries to sell you on how working for them is different/special.  It made me a little sad to see people just drinking it all in and not thinking critically about what they were hearing.
 |I don't think we're typical employees-let's put it that way. 
[Do employees really call it Mouschwitz? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc12d9k?context=5)|I never heard that term used, but it used to be awful to be a character working at the restaurant Crystal Palace in the Magic Kingdom.   The workers called that place crystal prison. 
[Have you had the opportunity to go inside Cinderella's castle?  My best friend and his wife (die hard Disney fans\) are dying for the chance to get in there but have no clue who/how to start.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0xxku?context=5)|I assume you mean the hotel suite they built inside the castle?  I was there when they were building it,  but I've never seen it in person.  I imagine that someday you might be able to pay a lot to stay there, but right now you can't.
 |They could look in to having breakfast or dinner in the restaurant there, though!   Perhaps that's better than nothing! 
[Which housing complex did you live in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0pkol?context=5)|Chatham!
[Did you ever go to jungle jims when it would get wild?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0qygh?context=5)|Nope!  I didn't have a car with me and neither did most of my friends.
[I was there about 15 years ago and we were able to take a tour of the tunnels. It was very cool. Not sure if they still offer that. (It was an extra cost.\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0nrep?context=5)|As far as I know they still do that!  They only show you the nice parts of the tunnels though :p!
[Does disney really have an underground ciry of tunnels and if so how often does the avg employee use them.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0nacl?context=5)|Yes, in Disney World!  They run under every part of the park except for where Toon Town was.  The average employee uses them on a daily basis.  I can't think of anyone who worked there who didn't go in the tunnel at some point.  It's where the employee cafeteria is (the Mousecateria), some breakrooms, where the Entertainment case members get their costumes, places to clock in, etc.  There's even a (tiny) barber shop!
 |The tunnels aren't very nice, though--they're just all cement floors, etc.  They are also stinky in some places!  They're a lot bigger than I imagined--you can drive a truck the size of a small u-haul into them.  I saw armored trucks, for example, picking up flats of money--they fit very easily.
[My parents used to work there. So every time we would go past an entrance to the tunnels they would point them out. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lmbty/iama_former_disney_cast_member_character/cc0rrbx?context=5)|:)

 |Everyone that I knew in Disney World who had also worked in Disneyland seemed to think it was nicer there--smaller, and more of a family as a result.  Do you think that's true?

Hello! I hope everyone's weekend was glorious. I came in to work this morning to find a ton of UPS boxes waiting for me... apparently my mother bought me the majority of the stuff left on my Amazon baby registry... an insane amount of stuff... and since I am feeling overwhelmed with her generosity, I want to pay it forward!

In the spirit of my scads of baby-loot (and all the putting-away I will need to do tonight), **tell me your favorite story that you have been told *about yourself* as a baby or very small child**. If you don't have a favorite story about yourself, one about a sibling will have to do, I suppose.

For example:

&gt;My favorite story is from when I was little and my mother was finishing her Internship. She had a bunch of other female doctors over for a get-together (this is back in the very early 80s, when it still wasn't common for women to be physicians and things weren't made easy for them, to put it lightly), and it just so happened that I had found out just that day that my friend's father was also a doctor. I came bursting into the room, yelling, ""Mom, mom, did you know Sam's father is a doctor, too? I didn't know men could be doctors!"" I apparently made the day of every woman in the room. My mother still loves to tell that story (I think my husband has heard it about 12 times by now).

Also **link a ~$15 item from your Amazon wishlist that you'd like to get if you win**. Or I can surprise you, or do a gift card thing (if I can figure out how). Sorry for the low amount, but I *am* expecting a little one fairly soon and need my money for diapers.

I am planning on picking at least one, but possibly up to three winners. It depends on the quality and quantity of your stories! Go ahead and make me all warm and fuzzy and even MORE ready for this baby to get here!

**Contest will end Thursday, September 5th at 11:59pm EST!**

**The winners are....** (in no particular order)

""Hi guys,

I'm working for Rick Kriseman's campaign and he's currently hiring interns for the mayors race. Right now we're looking for Finance Interns and Field Interns.

Finance Interns would help research donors and staff the candidate. Once they gain experience, they'll help target our solicitation program, draft fundraising emails and letters, and even run their own events.

Field Interns will be given their own ""turf"" in St. Petersburg and be charged with recruiting volunteers, persuading voters, and running GOTV in their area. They will also work with the Field Director to target voters and learn about targeted direct mail and robo-calls.

Both types of interns will work in candidate staffing, opposition research, communications, event planning, and various tasks as needed. Minimum requirement is about 10 hours a week increasing as the November 5th election gets closer. The position is unpaid and we are offering college credit.

This is a throwaway, but I wanted to reach out to some fellow Redditors and see if anyone is interested in politics or knows of someone young who could use the experience. This is how I started in politics and now I'm working in my dream job for a very competitive campaign.

I'm not authorized to speak about policy for the campaign, but you can check out the website to see what he's about: www.kriseman.com.

Reply if you're interested and I'll PM you with how to apply."""

I have four years work experience post college. Also some internships from back in the day.

My skills are primarily in SQL, Oracle, and Teradata, along the lines of data analysis and reporting. 

I also am proficient in Access, Excel, PowerPoint, Word, etc.

I had a secret clearance approved, but the project got cancelled, so I may have it still.

I also know some VB.NET, COBOL and PL/I, although I would prefer not to use these. I've also dabbled lightly in SAP. 

Any suggestions, anyone?

Edit: I'm open to any type of IT position. Not just data analysis. If a company is willing to train, I'm willing to learn!!!

1lnpio,1,2013-09-03,"Drank too much, I think I made a mistake.",[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1lnpio/drank_too_much_i_think_i_made_a_mistake/,"Very long backstory, I could use an outside perspective.

So I met this girl, let's call her Brittni, about 3 years ago through a friend. I met her and her boyfriend at the same time, we'll call him Chad.  Brittni and Chad and I were pretty good friends for about a year until I moved out of state for an internship, while I was away I stayed in contact with Brittni and her and Chad broke up. Being attracted to Brittni I tried to take her out on a date as soon as I got back but every time I visited her this other dude Bryan was around. 

This ended up forming this weird triangle thing where Bryan and I were trying to court Brittni and I just ended up backing off because he lived closer to her and was always around. Two years later and Bryan and Brittni are still dating. During this time I became very close friends with Brittni, eventually confessing how I felt about her at a very rocky time during her and Bryan's relationship. For a while it even looked like she was going to break it off with Bryan and date me but they patched things up.

Ever since then Brittni and I have been flirting more in person, over the phone, and through texting. There is this weird 'sexual tension' between us even though she is in a relationship, (her choice of words not mine.) We've both acknowledged that we are closer than friends and want something to happen but she is also happy with Bryan.

This has all been a lead up to this camping trip last night with myself, Bryan, Brittni, my friend Jeff, and Brittni's friend Lisa. I made the first mistake by consuming way more alcohol than I had any right to. (First of all, I realize this does not condone or excuse my behavior, I still take responsibility for what I did, I'm just mentioning this as a factor.) Anyways Lisa, (who also consumed way too much alcohol,) made it quite clear that she was wanting to have sex with either myself or Jeff, or both of us. For over 8 hours she ran around naked, hanging off of me and my friend Jeff, kissing us, feeling us up, etc. Basically I ended up talking with Brittni again about how I felt while we had a moment together, (albeit very drunkenly on my part but it was truly how I felt.) She told me we couldn't be together right now though she really did like me and we were closer than friends and there was something between us. Then her boyfriend came back.

Again this doesn't excuse my actions but it is a factor, no girl has ever expressed desire to me before. I've never had that in my life. So when Lisa was telling me she wanted the two of us to head off to the tent I went with her willingly. I was afraid of being left behind and her going in there with Jeff, I was afraid I would have been the only one on the outside while everyone else had somebody. I went in there with her and she took my virginity and while it felt great at the time it hurt Brittni quite a bit. She heard everything. Now she is chewing me out and I guess I deserve it but I just don't know what I can do to make it right. Losing her as a friend, losing her trust, and losing whatever else it is that we had wasn't worth what happened last night. Should I be feeling this bad? Is there anything I can do to fix this? If she doesn't want to pursue a relationship with me right now and she's with Bryan then why can't I be with someone?

TL:DR
I gave up my v-card to the girl I'm in love with's best friend. I regret this and want to do damage control. Help?"

1lnhd1,298,2013-09-03,7 lessons I wish I learned before staring my first game internship,FamousAspect,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1lnhd1/7_lessons_i_wish_i_learned_before_staring_my/,"It is rapidly approaching 11 years between my entry into the games business interning at Pandemic Studios and founding an indie studio to develop [Enhanced Wars](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/904858263/enhanced-wars-multiplayer-turn-based-strategy-evol/). Although it is still early days in my career, I think I have at least gained a modicum of insight worth sharing. When one of my mentors asked me to speak at the college course I credit for turning me into me into a game designer, I saw an opportunity to reflect on my time in the game industry and codify the lessons I wish I could go back in time to teach my youthfully arrogant college self. It is not like I am not still making missteps regularly;  I hope that 40 year old me is telepathically beaming back his list through time to send some wisdom my way. But it feels like a good time to share the top 7 lessons I wish I knew on my first day as an intern:

**1) It's a small world after all**

The game industry is small. Remarkably small. The sort of small that only becomes apparent when you have been developing games for a while. In the past year and change that I have worked as a consultant to help fund [Enhanced Wars](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/904858263/enhanced-wars-multiplayer-turn-based-strategy-evol/), I have been recommended for gigs by people I worked with 9 years ago I did not expect to work alongside again. I have been able to pay my rent thanks to jobs I was referred to by people at EA that I am certain I aggravated at one point or another. I have walked into meetings to instantly regret the actions a younger, more abrasive self thought were completely justified at the time. 

Every person that you meet in your early career, you are guaranteed to meet again. Every professional relationship you have is a long term investment. Every person you see as an obstacle to your success today will invariably be someone you are too embarrassed to ask for a favor 5, 10, 20 years down the line. It is nearly impossible to take the long view when you are young, but the sooner you realize just how tiny the game industry is the better off you will be.

**2) Don't go for a big splash**

When I reflect on my career, the clearest facepalm moments come from the first few weeks on a new job. The times when I really wanted to prove myself. The times when I was trying to convince the people around me that I was a rockstar. 

Every time I tried to make a big splash at a new job, I made a belly flop. I was young, I was excited, I was trying to instantly make my mark. The hard smack of soft belly against the surface of the pool was a clear reminder that I had no idea what I was doing.

When starting new jobs, my instinct was to be Impressive. What I wish I had done was try to be Invisible. Only by taking the time to learn how an office works can you truly see  the opportunities to make a meaningful difference. When you come into a job you are entering a mature organism with layers of depth. 

When I reflect on the past, I more or less wish I had stayed silent for the first month of every new job. If I had kept my head down and my eyes open, I would have spotted the real opportunities to make a difference.

**3) Fixers not moaners**

When you are low down the game development totem pole, it is easy to look at the actions of the people above you and scoff. If you were in charge, you would do things differently. How could they make such obvious mistakes?

But then 8 or 10 years go by, and you start to occupy the shoes of someone whose every decision is questioned. You think about the past and you understand why your team leads made the decisions they made. Things were not nearly as clear cut as they seemed.

When you're working on a game development team, it feels good to moan about the people in charge. After a tough week, it is satisfying to blow off some steam with your co-workers. During lunch breaks or late night team dinners, it is easy to complain about what is happening. You feel closer to your colleagues and better about yourself.

But if you really want to prove yourself, then moaning and groaning is a complete waste of your time. If you are an intern, you will see things big and small go wrong around you. The easy route to take is to tell your co-workers what an idiot person X, Y or Z is. The far harder thing is to identify the problems you are capable of solving completely on your own and fixing them.

If you go to your boss and you say ""the build process is broken,"" all you have accomplished is accusing a person who is already overloaded with work that she's doing something wrong. But if you go to your boss and say ""the build process was inefficient so I did X and now programmers have 10 extra minutes to code each day,"" you will shine.

The best way to distinguish yourself in your internship is to be someone who fixes problems without being told. Small problems. If you fix small problems and make a difference, you will be asked to fix bigger problems. 

**4) Cultivate mentorship**

The value of having a mentor cannot be overstated. When times are tough, when you are facing a problem you do not know how to solve, when you are so burnt out you cannot see straight, you need someone to talk to. Someone with a perspective that will help you see your problem different. Someone to buy you a burrito, listen to your problems and offer advice. And not just one person, but several.

It can be difficult to spot a mentor. If someone is going out of her way to help you avoid mistakes or is willing to go out to lunch with you and answer your questions, these are signs of a relationship you will want to keep up. Try and set up a regular lunch or coffee break every other week and prepare for that meeting so you can get as much value of it as possible. Arrive with a few questions you want to ask written down. Thank your mentor for her time and encouragement. Be appreciative. If your internship ends or your mentor moves on from the company, keep in contact with her over email and instant messenger.

**5) Don't watch TV during working hours**

This is the simplest mistake to avoid. The top mistake I have seen from interns and new grads is to have their work on one monitor and streaming TV on the other. And I cannot pretend that I've never put TV on while working on more tedious tuning tasks on [Enhanced Wars](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/904858263/enhanced-wars-multiplayer-turn-based-strategy-evol/). You may never be told to stop, but people will notice. 

Watching TV while you work is a bad habit. You may think you are capable of working at 100% efficiency but you are not. Even if you finish all the tasks you are assigned while enjoying The Daily Show, if you cut out the distractions you would finish your work quicker and have more time to show initiative by solving the small problems that will make you stand out.

Watching TV while you work is very visible. Your manager may never tell you to cut it out, but when writing up your intern report or deciding which interns have the potential to go full time your TV watching will rear its head. These decisions are generally made by several layers of people, and decision makers who never really had a chance to interact with you at work may only know that you spent an awful lot of time streaming Marvel Vs Capcom 3 matches from EVO.

**6) Open yourself to opportunity**

Tied into my first point about the smallness of the industry is the idea that you have to open yourself up to the opportunities around you. If you are taking classes in game development, if you are going to mixers in your city or industry events, if guest lecturers come talk at your school, you are undoubtedly letting opportunities pass you by left and right. I am very happy with my career today but there are still plenty of moments where I wish had written down an email address or connected with someone on LinkedIn. You will never know what smash success someone will enjoy 5 years down the line, or what game you will wish you were working on as your personal tastes change or you are exposed to new things.

For instance, Ratchet &amp; Clank is one of my top videogame series of all time. But I didn't learn that its mixture of appealing graphics and run &amp; gun action put me in my happy place until at least a year after Insomniac boss Ted Price gave a guest lecture to my game production class. I did not get his card or write down his email address. I do not think I even introduced myself after the class was over. All things I wish I had done. I am also fairly certain that Infinity Ward co-founder Vince Zampella spoke to one of our classes shortly after Call of Duty II was released. But I cannot be certain who from the Infinity Ward team spoke because I did not introduce myself. I did not get his card or write down his email. I am pretty sure I wore my Pandemic Studios t-shirt to class that night and if I stood out, it was for asking a cocky question.

These are just two of the higher profile examples, but trust me, there are many more opportunities in my past that I was blind to.

**7) There's more to life than videogames**

If you made it this far into the post, it is safe to assume that working in videogames has been a lifelong passion for you. That when you land that internship or first job, it will be one of the great triumphs of your life. That you will gladly sacrifice nights, weekends and friendships for a chance to make videogames. I know I did.

There is more to life than making videogames. Being a young person is an incredible opportunity in itself, one you will never get a second shot at. So do not put your game developer dreams above everything else in your life. 

When I am up late at night balancing units or making maps for [Enhanced Wars](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/904858263/enhanced-wars-multiplayer-turn-based-strategy-evol/), I am not  thinking ""it's a really good thing I skipped out on spring break my junior year so that I could pick up team dinners and burn discs."" Recognize that you are an intern and that (unless your boss disagrees) the game team will go on without you. Live your life. Be young. Enjoy yourself. 

I may have devoted my life to the pursuit, but in the end even I realize that it is only videogames."

We considered each other our soul mates. When we were more religious we thought that God or the Universe had made the two of us just for each other. I am 99% sure there is no one else in the picture. Basically she says she has fallen out of love with me. We had a fight that nearly broke our marriage but was later saved. She said she hasn't loved me for the last ~9 months. I thought she just said this in anger. We made up and talked about everything we wanted from each other. Everything she brought up I fixed. I went above and beyond the shitty husband I had been.

We then had a perfect week after this. Without exaggerating it was one of the best weeks we have ever shared. We got a hotel room in town just to get away and connect even more. I do not remember how it came up but we started to fight. In this argument she said that she has not loved me for the past ~9 months and she did not feel any love towards me during the last week - basically she was faking any feelings of love towards me. She said she loved me. She also could not remember the things I brought up when we made up ~1 week earlier. She wants to find out what it is like to live alone because we have always been together - since high school. She wants a separation and/or a divorce.

I am deeply in love with my wife and can not bear to be without her. I tell her she is everything to me. The reason I do everything I do. She says she can't handle that. When I would tell her that before it would melt her heart. She seems to have changed suddenly. She does not think our relationship is worth saving. She does not want to seek counseling. I want to do almost anything to save this relationship, but she does not.

I am going to school and working as a paid intern right now. My internship is nearing its end and I will be going back to another department in the company I work for. Unfortunately it will only be 16 hours/week. This used to be ok because my wife works full time. When my wife was getting her undergrad degree, I postponed my schooling and worked full time to support us. We thought this was a great solution. Unfortunately if I have to move out I will struggle to support myself like this.

This clearly does not include every little detail, which I would be willing to share if it helps.

I'll not mention any names but basically her hours have been reduced to ten hours a week which just isn't enough to live on and JSA don't like having people on the books who can't receive anything even though they are eligible to be signed on (as they work under 16 hours) Which means next to no housing benefit in other words making ends meet is harder each month.

So ideally she wants to move into another job ( can't quit and go on job-seekers because there is a six month wait after quitting, even though that would make her financially stable and not eating her overdraft to survive). But even if she could just get something temporary for a few months it would allow her to leave the hell she works in and be free so to speak.

So I thought hell, why not ask UKjobs they have given me great advice in the past for interviews and other things so maybe they can help her.

She's a trained photographer,
Is currently a Bar person/waitress at a busy restaurant and has experience supervising under the old management, has had key holding responsibilities.
Great with customers and has done office work ( only minor, but still familiar with the setting )

I graduated with a B.S in Psychology (plenty of jokes have already been made at that degree).  Last year a left grad school early not finishing my masters after realizing that I was a tad impulsive and jumped into a grad program that wasn't right for me or my interests. After a about 6 months of unemployment I finally got a job. Not one that I wanted but a job nonetheless as a claims adjuster for an insurance company. Basically a glorified call center position.

I have been at my current position for about 8 months now and I have no plans for staying in the long term as one I'm not a fan of working in auto insurance and two call centers drain the life out of me. Unfortunately, for the most part the only full time positions readily available to me in my current city are other call center positions. I want to attempt to move out of this city by early next year.

My question is what are my best options for a next career move that would make sense with the experience I'm getting at my current job and what is the best option for getting out of this city? Where would be the best places to look for a new gig. I do have experience in the health care field from an internship at an oncology clinic I had during my undergrad, and a year of research experience.

Here is the background: my fiance just turned 25, I am 24. He and I started college at the same time but he had a jump start on his masters program so he is already done with school and has his masters in engineering working at a company making about $70k. I am still in graduate school and work at a company making $14/hr and recently went down to part time status.  Which is weird since I have had a dull time job since I started college (but have had a job since I was 13). Why did I go part time? Because I was working 40hr/wk plus a 20hr/wk internship while trying to plan a wedding. My fiance was upset that I was never home and offered to pay more in rent so I could cut down to part time and I would be home more. (this was an argument in itself because I don't like him to ""take care of me"" I'm very independent). But now that I don't work full time, I feel like I don't have a say in anything whether its money related or not. This is new territory for me as I have always supported myself. Remember how I said I was getting my masters? initially I wanted a career but with limited opportunities in the city we are in, I would have to look for jobs elsewhere. Well, about a month ago my fiance was offered an opportunity to train overseas at their company headquarters for ""3-6"" months (right after the wedding). I immediately told him to go for it without thinking about the fact that now we are stuck in the city where I can't find even a pathway into my field. So, now I don't even know why I'm getting my master's... But I feel like I have sacrificed my future and all my hard work and what I am working towards for him to do this.. BC his opportunity is right NOW and honestly, I was happy to do it, I'm proud of him. But when he makes remarks of ""well, how much do you pay in rent?"" or ""I'm sacrificing my money"" or ""I worked hard for the money I'm spending to support you since you can't afford it.. I gave you 'all of this'""... It makes me think.. Does a bank account trump everything? Does my sacrifice not count? How am I even compared at the same level? I'm still in school. And I am still working..bur because I make less it doesn't matter? So can relationships survive income inequality, or does one always succumb to it?"

I'd like to get some experience outside of the workplace where I don't have to worry about breaking anything.

I mostly focus on Linux and would like to start working on a blog as a learning aid of sorts (writing posts about various operations and commands in Linux). I think this would help because writing as though I was teaching others would help reinforce my knowledge and serve as a reference if I forget something. So, I figure there are two good ways to start learning: set up/administer a server to run the blog, and set up some VMs to practice securing and maintaining servers.

I need some advice about the best way to go about doing these things. I assume for the VMs it would be relatively straight forward: set up a network between a couple Linux servers (I have VirtualBox, but I'm not opposed to VMware if that is a better option), configure and secure them, and then maybe try my hand at pen testing each box. For a blog I'm a little less knowledgeable. My ISP doesn't allow servers to be run through our connection, so I assume I'll need to find a cheap hosting service. I could use some advice on which hosting services I should look at. My basic needs include: low cost, ability to run Linux, and enough flexibility to get my hands dirty practicing administration of a server. I don't foresee any blog posts I write getting a huge amount of traffic so I shouldn't need a lot of power, at least not anytime soon.

Can anyone here point me in the right direction? Any advice on gaining experience in System Administration and cyber security in general would be great. I know there is a lot of free reading material on this subreddit and other sites so I'll be sure to keep reading up as well. If this isn't the correct place to ask this question just let me know."

It was simply my opinion and he shoved it back at me, condescended me, and humiliated me in front of the other interviewer.

I am a 30 year old college senior who is finally finishing up my degree. After previously not attending school because I didn't know what I wanted to get my degree in, I had to put my college education further on hold when I moved back in with my parents to become a caretaker for my grandmother at the end of her life. My grandmother passed two years ago and once she did I completed my two year degree and transferred to a smaller college not far from home. I will graduate with my Bachelors in April of 2014.

As you can probably surmise, meeting classmates is out of the question due to my age. Unfortunately the college does not offer graduate programs, so my chances of meeting mid-late 20 somethings that are back in school are nil. 

Whenever I try to meet someone my own age, they are almost always established professionals who have been out of college for a while. I do very well in school (two time Dean's List student and on pace to graduate with Honors) and I work two on campus internships - unfortunately, it pays very little. As a result, I make nowhere near the money someone my age should make because of still being a student.

My question for the ladies is would you reject someone like me out of hand for still being in college at 30? I am finding it extremely difficult to even get responses from people my own age on dating sites. Should I simply put my dating ambitions on hold until I graduate and get a steady job?

For what it's worth, I am of average looks and have been told I'm handsome by some women. I am 5'7 and 170 lb, so I could stand to lose 10-15 lbs. I work out and run daily.

tl;dr - I'm a 30 year old college senior who can't attract women my own age because I am not in my career, and I'm too old for my classmates. Am I screwed?"

I've become afraid of anything related to CS. I can only think of my failure in all those interviews whenever I'm reminded of CS careers.

After realizing that the biggest factor for my failure is my lack of actual development experience, I've tried doing some of my own projects in android, iphone and even BB10 ffs. But my motivation to keep at it is decreasing and my financial debt is increasing. 

At this point I'm considering trying to get a job at McDonald's for basic necessities and forget that I ever had a degree in CS.

I wish I can just get some kind of positive feedback. Even a ""would you like to work as an intern instead?"" would be fine.

Sorry if I sound like I'm just ranting but this is such an important point in my life and its really getting to me. Seeing all your good friends from school move on with their lives and enjoying California with a developer's salary certainly doesn't help.

I need some help deciding what to do in my situation. I’m 19, currently attending a Community College that’s fully paid for by FAFSA  (Student Aid), scholarships, and grants. This is currently my second year in College and I’ll be transferring to an actual four year school next year; where the tuition is 4x the cost.


**The Good**


* I currently have ~$10,100 saved.
* I’m working 18 hrs a week for $8.25 / hour. I grab more hours over summer and anytime I’m not in class. Last year I made $5,200 after taxes.
* My awesome grandparents will be paying for rent off campus (I currently live at home).
* My mom will be sending me a food allowance which is unknown for now next year.
* I have no debts and no real obligations except for maintenance on my car.
* I can work remotely


**The Bad**


* My year earnings are about to exceed FAFSA’s student protection allowance (So I’ve already made more this year than lasts). My savings may also impact the calculations (student assets = high EFC).
* I commute ~50 miles four days a week to class and average ~22 MPG, but will change next year.
* Tuition will cost roughly $20,000 a year for the four year school. If everything goes well I’ll only be there 4 semesters.


**So here’s my plan** and it may even seem unethical, but I’m not really sure.


I can get up to $5,500 for financial aid from FAFSA and I’ll be getting a guaranteed $2,000 grant by transferring from my CC and being in a STEM major. I plan on also starting my scholarship search this weekend in my free time to see how much more aid I can get.


I’d like to max out my Roth IRA contributions for this year in small payments to capture the market and to shelter $5500.  Along with maxing out a traditional IRA the following two years to lower my income below the protection allowance. This will allow me to hopefully save up $16,500 by the time I graduate in accounts I wouldn't otherwise be able to contribute too along with sheltering the assets. I'm pretty sure it’s penalty free to withdraw from any IRA for school expenses, but is considered income and can bump up my tax bracket along with damaging my FAFSA scores.


In saying that it means I’ll have to take out Direct Subsidized loans to cover the rest of my tuition for the two years so I don’t hurt my FAFSA score. I know debt is the plague, but wouldn't it be worth it to receive more aid? I would then be given a 6 month grace period once graduated to save up a large payment on those loans while possibly dipping into the IRAs to cover the rest. However, I’d like to avoid dipping into the IRAs if at all possible, but it can be there as a safety net. (I’m going to try to live at home after graduation)


As for my career, I plan on getting my Bachelors in Computer Engineering and will have my Associates specialized in mechanical engineering this coming spring. Since that doesn't really guarantee anything I have been working as an intern at a local web development company for a little over two years now (about ~6 months after they were founded). It’s been great working with such brilliant people and they plan on keeping me after school. The thing is they’ve been wanting me to sign a contract saying I’d work for them a year after school (they’re bribing me with a trip to Las Vegas to go see Amazon’s Invent conference). I’ve seen the company go from 5 to 16 people and it’s very tempting. However, they haven’t talked openly about my salary yet or raises leading up to that point. They've just said I'd be salary base, but never really said when it’d start or what it would be. I’m also hesitant to bring any of it up. ( They do call me wonderboy though =])


As for the rest of the money leftover I’m going to use it for books and necessities like gas, but to get back to my original question. Can you help me? Do you have any other suggestions or comments on my understanding of personal finances? Do you think my following plan will work out or do you think stashing all the cash in IRAs is a bad idea?

I confronted her and she said that she was good mates with him, and his gf (the one who messaged me) was a bit crazy and overprotective and basically thought that they'd been sleeping together, when they hadn't and I should stop worrying, that she loves me etc. Even though I believed her, I couldn't help thinking why this girl would go to all the trouble of finding me and messaging me if it wasn't anything. 

---

About a week passes and I find that I cant stop thinking and obsessing about it. I went from a laid back guy in a relationship to checking minute things on facebook, to see hidden meanings in her statuses etc. It all got too much for me so I ended it. 

She was devasted, and has been in constant contact with me saying that I made a mistake and how much she loves me. I do believe her and I genuinely don't think she cheated, but did I make the right decision and should I stick by it?

tl;dr: message from random girl prompts me to break up with gf, having second thoughts whether I made the right decision. "

I could use prayer for the opportunity to show my boss that I'm totally capable of filling the newly-opened role, and that my boss will look upon me with favour.

I'm disappointed. I'm sad.

If you said I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I can still have a fun senior year with you, I realize you don't care if I go out to bars, fuck. I'd still take you back. I'm sorry for breaking your heart. I'm sorry for trying to break up with you over voicemail. I'm sorry I was a coward.

I'd take you back. I would take you back for less. I hate myself for it.

I've forgotten how to be single. In 2 years I forgot how to make friends without you by my side. I'm so terrified that everyone I know really doesn't like me and then I'm going to be so fucking lonely. I hate myself for how lonely and unloved I feel. I want to go back home. I want to be embraced by my mother and go back to highschool. You represent college in its entirety, alluring, always partying, fun, carefree, no responsibilities until suddenly the deadline is smack there. Christ. 

I'm going to write a list about all of the bad things about you, so I stop thinking about the good.

You're a dick for not breaking up with me over the summer, when I could have had time. You're a dick for breaking up with me 10 days before my birthday and a month away from our anniversary.

Why didn't I make you happy?

I do, though, still want you to be happy. I really do. I just wish it was with me. I think you're still a great guy. You're just a fucking dumb ass for throwing away this so you can ~go party~ all the fucking time. I wouldn't even care if you went out a bunch! God. I just wanted like, one fucking day of the weekend. You're so stupid. The school year hasn't even started, you'll see how it's going to be. You're going to come back.

I wish you come back.

Good luck trying to get an internship without a car, butthole.

And I wish I would stop feeling so sad so I can go eat something.

At least, I know I want to be friends with you. I look forward to little things. I look forward to my stomach not hurting. Tears not welling up in my eyes when I think of you or talk about you. I look forward to saying hi, eventually, and I look forward to texting you that I'm pooping. Hopefully after sending that text I walk out of the bathroom and my new boyfriend is sitting there teasing me about the smell.

(Or you. I still want it open. To let you know. I would take you back. But I'm going to be pessimistic, like you always said I was, and say it's not going to happen.)"

I work a shitty temp job that doesn't even require a college degree, with  a shitty salary that allows me to have just enough to get me to work. 

I have the same thoughts looping in my head.

1lqz4y,1,2013-09-04,Student teaching worries,spiitze,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1lqz4y/student_teaching_worries/,"Hey all, 

I'm in my first year of my teaching program, and my university starts field experience in three weeks. We do a 2 day a week placement in one high school this year, with a full internship next fall. 

I found out today that my placement will be at a Catholic high school.   I am bisexual, but in a relationship with a man (I'm a lady), have many queer friends and family, and am quite atheist. The Catholic school system in my city is not extremely religious, but does have morning prayers and Christian ethics courses. 

Someone else who had been placed at the school brought this up in class with our professor today, and he explained that it could be a good opportunity to learn about other school environments and acceptance of other beliefs, and if someone had serious conflicts he would be open to trying to find a solution. We did not have any input into which schools we were placed at. 

So, r/teachers, my question to you is: 

1. Should I talk to my professor about feeling uncomfortable in this situation, or try to make the best of this opportunity,

2. Any tips on field experience as a whole?

3. any tips or advice on going into a school with different values than your own?

Thanks :) "

A little background: I purchased a fairly new, good condition, used car in 2011 prior to being accepted into pharmacy school.  It was half impulse buy and half I actually needed a better car than what I was driving at the time.  So now my situation is that I had to take out living expense loans in addition to tuition loans to get by and pay for the car.  In addition, I am working as an intern and as needed at my old job to add to my income.  

At this point, I'm sure I'm doing everything against the grain of this community but it's the situation in which I find myself.  

Today, while taking care of the monthly car payment I had the thought that I could actually pay off the remaining car loan (~$4400) with the amount in savings (~$6000).  It seems to me if I'm paying for the car with another loan that I should just pay off the remaining debt in one go rather than repeating the monthly routine.  I would still have what's left of the student loan in addition to regular income which will be more than enough to take care of other expenses. I have 2 years before I graduate and more loans to take out still.

What else should I consider before making a decision?

---

It's been three weeks since I moved out.  Given our past history, I moved most of my things out before telling my parents I was leaving (even though they both knew something was up since I was cleaning my room for the first time in months).  I would have told them beforehand, but they've made it clear that they were only ok with me moving out if I was moving in with female friends or on my own.  Also, my boyfriend wasn't allowed in their house, so I was solely relying on myself for the entire move.  I was afraid if I told them beforehand, they wouldn't let me leave.

As was to be expected, they didn't take it well.  Upon leaving, my mother was talking as though I was essentially not part of the family anymore and we wouldn't speak any longer.  My father said I could call him if I ever wanted to talk.  My brother wouldn't speak to me at all.  I gave them about a week and a half of no communication, trying to give them space, before I contacted my mother to see if we could have dinner.  She agreed and we had dinner Monday evening.  Afterward, we discussed where we go from here.

My parents are still very upset, which I expected they would be.  Throughout this whole ordeal, they have taken little to no responsibility for the problems between us.  They claim that our family was torn apart because I decided to date this guy.  Mind you, if you didn't glance at the older posts, my boyfriend treats me like a queen.  He has never done drugs, never even considered hurting me, supported me through the extreme lows all this conflict with my parents has brought on, and when he realized the long term effects my parents reactions were going to have on me, he offered to let me live with him until I graduate college and can get a full time job to fully support myself.  The only thing they have against him are the things mentioned above, which are basically that he doesn't live by their rules.  My parents basically told me they don't have anything to talk to me about because they don't want to hear about my life with him.  They assume my entire life revolves around him, despite the fact that I am seeking 3 degrees, an honors student, participate in 2 clubs, hold a part time job, and an internship.

It's important to understand that my parents are very religious.  I was raised to only consider Christian men as marriage material.  My mother is also very manipulative.  My father is extremely introverted and laid back, so it's easy for her to control him.  She has lost many friends over the years because of her controlling nature.  She has called me names and told me my choice to date my boyfriend has poisoned every aspect of my life and that I've completely changed because of him.  In the past, she's used fear and guilt tripping to get me to do what she wants.  

When I left, I fully intended to move heaven and earth to repair this relationship so I wouldn't lose my family completely.  Dinner this week was the first step.  However, after our conversation and the things my mother has posted on facebook (yes, I know, but there is a point to this), I'm not really sure anymore.  My parents never got over me breaking up with my ex boyfriend.  He WAS a Christian and plays football for a school several states away.  They still keep in touch, watch all his games, and are actually road tripping to see one this fall.  
Several years ago, his older sister got pregnant by her non-Christian boyfriend, who she then married.  She then divorced him after cheating on him with her coworker after their separation and did everything in her power to keep him from their daughter.  She just married the guy she cheated with.  All of this wouldn't matter at all if my mom hadn't gone through and liked/made nice, supportive comments on several of her pictures.  It really gets to me that after this woman has broken just as many and more of my mom's rules as I have, mom gives her approval.  This person my mom has no more reasons to be connected to and not her own daughter.  It makes me wonder if I should even bother trying.

What do you guys think?  At what point should I stop trying?  Or should I ever stop?  What should I do to try and fix this?  I don't want to be without a family, but if my family hates me, what does it even mean to have one?

I've taken only one theoretical computer science class, Data Structures and Algorithms. I originally intended on doing research in computer science and I'm beginning to realize that my university has done absolutely nothing for preparing me for this.

When I came in as a freshman, my major was declared as ""computer science"", and the course descriptions were highly glorified. After my freshman year ended, my advisor strong armed me into changing my major to ""applied computer science"", saying that it would make everything easier for the university and that they would really only be offering the courses for that major anyway.

I have a little bit of [outside work](https://github.com/evanandrewrose) and I worked an internship as a software engineer this past summer, but I feel like I lack the theoretical and mathematical background to pursue career in research. I feel that I would have been much better off if I had just taught myself computer science and majored in mathematics.

So now I'm thinking I could get a BSc in math from a reputable university and then follow it up with research in computer science. Does this sound like a respectable path to begin venturing on? I'm slightly worried because I already feel like I have wasted ~$20,000 on a degree that wasn't what I expected at all and would hate to dig myself deeper."

Here is a brief situation of what I am dealing with. I am 20 years old. I am not currently going to school this semester and just plan on working.
I currently work at a retail job. They pay 9.25 an hour with the occassional 1% bonus for monthly sales. I am not going to sugarcoat it, I kick ass at selling. I have consistently sold around 30-50k a month on average at this retail store (average person there does about 20, I've been #1 salesman in my district numerous times). We sell sunglasses and you can probably figure out the company from there. Long story short, I getting taken to the cleaners for the amount of work I do for the pay I get. I make in an aver month about 1300 take home after taxes. Working their sucks, they treat me like shit.

Second problem, I signed up to intern for this company this summer. Its in the field I would love to work in and I am meeting and acquiring new skills constantly. However, it is a start up company and they have yet to get funded. They actually have some very intelligent people on their board of directors and they could be a very big company here in the future. But as it stands right now they don't have a dime to pay anyone, and I am required to A+ work for them and have tasks being done at all times. I manage their social media platforms (i.e. Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, etc.) as well as do leads for what we need to make our website successful. I probably do an average of 10 to 15 hours of work for them. Luckily, I don't have to show up to an office but I am always call with emails, and updating our social media and phone calls. And I am seeing nothing in return except viable skills and meeting people in the industry I would love to be in. I could hold my breath til they get funded, but who knows when then that is. I don't mind working for them either...

Finally, on the side of all this madness. When I am not working at my real job, I do work for home theater installation and security cameras for my Step Uncle. Its fun work pays pretty well (11 hr) and work isn't hard. Buts super fluctuating. I can never bank on hours and jobs come and go. If I could get steady livable income of this, I would love to make a profession out of it.



So my question is, what would be an ideal move for someone in my shoes where I need to make a forward step. I would like to keep interning but I feel like its a lot of constant work. Should I find a new job? 

Any help on this would be greatly appreciated!!!"

I'm 24 years old and have slept with 3 girls my entire life. First one I dated for 2 years, second one I dated for a year and a half, and the second I dated only for a month because of the school program we're in. It was one of those great months of amazing sex and it turned into a relationship and I actually fell in love with her. Fast forward three months later and I'm here. I moved to Paris for an internship for three months. First, I was so excited to get here because not only will I be able to explore Paris all I wanted, I would now be able to fap whenever and however I wanted to. The internet speeds over here destroy those in the states!

Anyways, I've really been feeling self conscious over here because of A. not speaking french B. being single in a city of romance C. I've eaten a LOT here, it's hard not to (i'm not fat but i've noticed my stomach getting flabbier) and D. I haven't had a proper hair cut in 4 or 5 months and I look a mess and cover my head with a snapback (in my profession, jeans and t shirt is dress code (ps. see advertising creative). So with all of that, the guilty pleasures I can find here are photography and reading but I can only read for so long and I can only walk before the soles of my shoes begin to be ineffective so, I return home to unwind. 

I don't smoke cigarettes, I smoke weed only once in a blue moon with friends, and when I drink it's usually only a couple beers or glasses of wine. My addiction is what we're all chatting about.

I've done this before, over the last holiday I decided that when I went home I would spend my free time with my family and not deal with all of the late nights edging or constantly browsing pics on tumblr. It felt amazing! I was plenty more energetic, positive, would sleep a lot better, and I was motivated to spend time with my little brother just going on hikes or grabbing some pizza.

It's time to do it again, here's day 1. Paris was amazing for a lot of reasons and the fact that I'm finding this now before I leave is a sign or something.

&gt;Lesbians and transsexual women have overrun the world

&gt;Hillary Clinton has been appointed supreme leader of the world

&gt;Be me

&gt;Be GLBT

&gt;Be oppressed by the new matriarchy for putting the G before the L

&gt;Hardly remember the old days of the patriarchy

&gt;In fact, patriarchy is just a string of symbols and sounds, devoid of any meaning.

&gt;Have to wear a Gold Vagina pinned to my chest and be assigned a designation

&gt;We don't even get numbers because those are inventions of men

&gt;Be yoked together with other ""undesirables"" such as thought rapists, wet dreamers, and door holders

&gt;Have to pull a train full of Feminazis to a concentration camp

&gt;Upon arrival be forced to take a shower

&gt;When the showers are turned on, a clear liquid comes out, washing away my manly scents and emasculating me

&gt;Soon the liquid is replaced by a lavender and honey-scented gas

&gt;The oppression I face is palpable as I leave the showers smelling like a ""woman,"" another group persecuted by the womyn.

&gt;Notice another smell in the air.

&gt;Be disgusted as I realize the smell is coming from the crematorium on my right.

&gt;It is the smell of tons upon tons of incense being burned.

&gt;Be herded into a small room where we will be assigned our new roles in the concentration camp.

&gt;Heart can sink no lower as I hear my designation called out and learn that I will be cleaning out the crematorium.

&gt;Immediately be taken to the crematorium

&gt;Overseer is a dominatrix in a leather suit.

&gt;Just like all of the other unique womyn who will not be forced into an identity by men.

&gt;Ironic.mp3

&gt;Be forced to eat bananas while my overseer watches.

&gt;(Bananas look like phalli in case you didn't get that)

&gt;(Phalli means dicks in case you didn't get that either)

&gt;Overseer takes the banana peel from my hands and throws it over her back, refusing to acknowledge that womyn are not as athletically able as men.

&gt;She doesn't notice that she missed the ""man can,"" formerly referred to as a trash can or many other dialectical terms.

&gt;She turns on the fire to burn the incense.

&gt;She starts to walk down to the corridor, presumably to idly calibrate something that men cannot be trusted with.

&gt;She slips on the banana peel

&gt;Her back ends up touching the ovens.

&gt;Even through her leather suit she suffers first-degree burns

&gt;I take a step towards her

&gt;""Stay back,"" she exclaims. ""You 'GLBT'-types put it in the wrong order so that men are first!""

&gt;A spark ignites within me, soon to swell into raging fire reminiscent of the all-consuming flames within the ovens.

&gt;I feel something I haven't felt since the womyn uprising began

&gt;A realization hits me.

&gt;""If you think about it, lesbians are similar to men.  By forcing use of the term 'LGBT' you are only furthering the...the...""

&gt;I remember the concept of etymology

&gt;Matriarchy and patriarchy look similar, they must come from the same root.

&gt;I suddenly notice the song playing over the loud speakers.

&gt;California_Dreamin.mp3

&gt;Realize the band is not The Mama &amp; the  Mama as the matriarchical propaganda brainwashed me to believe

&gt;The Mamas &amp; the *Papas*

&gt;Patriarchy must mean a matriarchy ruled by men instead of womyn

&gt;""You are only furthering the patriarchy!""

&gt;A new era of oppression has begun; the tides have turned.

&gt;Something else has overpowered the smell of the incense.

&gt;Men around the world smell the scent of oppression.

&gt;Luckily, scent is the sense most closely tied to memory so they remember what that smell actually is.

&gt;The dominatrix trembles as the scent washes over her.

&gt;I approach her and offer my hand to her.

&gt;Her eyes say no but she takes it nonetheless

&gt;She opens her mouth but the words won't come out

&gt;Lose_Yourself.mp3

&gt;""Shh,"" I say tenderly to her as shockwaves of oppression cause tsunamis on the other side of the world.

&gt;Millions of womyn who finally felt comfortably in their favorite white t-shirts are embarrassed to see that the tidal waves have rendered their shirts transparent

&gt;Nearby men, hungry for oppression offer them dry shirts and towels for them to dry off.

&gt;Within the crematorium I guide the overseer to a chair where she can rest after her recent brush with pain.

&gt;""Here,"" I say, giving her a blanket, ""cover yourself with this so I can take a look at that burn on your back.""

&gt;She's quivering under the oppression but all that she can do is acquiesce.

&gt;""Oh, it's quite red,"" I tell her. ""Wait here for a moment.""

&gt;I go over to the first aid cabinet and get a bottle of aloe vera.

&gt;Her voice finally returns.

&gt;""There's no need; I can do it.""

&gt;""No,"" I respond, ""I don't think you can quite reach this burn; it's quite high on your back.""

&gt;She can't believe what's happening as I open the bottle and pour a little bit of aloe into my hands.

&gt;As I rub the aloe onto her burn I can see the cold, cold oppression overcoming the heat of her burn

&gt;To a mind as primitive as the woman's this feels good.

&gt;I step back and the oppression is complete.

&gt;Bill Clinton has taken Hillary's place as the supreme leader of the world with a bevy of young interns ready to be oppressed at any time.

&gt;The patriarchy has returned.

&gt;As I leave to retake my rightful place as a man I can barely hear a sound from behind me

&gt;I turn to see what is making such a pitiful noise.

&gt;It's the woman stuttering and stammering, barely able to speak.

&gt;""Th-th-th-thank...thank you..."" she finally spits out.

&gt;I will allow her to not swallow her words this time.

&gt;I briskly turn away from her, my newfound cape, a clear indication of my authority as a member of the patriarchy, flutters as it swoops through the air

&gt;As I fly off to join the ranks of the patriarchy the woman can hear me utter one last expression of my oppression.

&gt;""It was my privilege."""

I am playing on a laptop since forever and I'm tired of 10-15 FPS on minimal settings.

&gt;&gt;What will you be doing with this PC? Gaming? Photoshop? Web browsing? etc. If you need a Workstation, be specific on the programs you'll be using. Try to list as many games/applications that you'll be using as you can, as well as your performance goals for those programs.

&gt;Mainly gaming, like GTA5, Metro, Far Cry, SC2, etc. Preparing for next-gen games. (Division looks awesome)

&gt;&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

&gt;I was aiming for 2000€, but I can go up to 2500€ if it offers a significant performance improvement.
 
&gt;&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC? (note: if you're planning on buying more than 2 weeks from now, it's very much recommended you wait and come back then, to ensure you get the most recent and accurate price data)

&gt;ASAP.

&gt;&gt;What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? ""Everything"" is not specific enough. Tower, Operating System, peripherals like the keyboard, mouse, and monitor(s), wifi adapter, speakers/headphones, etc. are all relevant

&gt;I have a mouse, a headset, and my secondary screen, so i need a main screen and a full tower.

&gt;&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?

&gt;France

&gt;&gt;If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.

&gt;Dell monitor (old), 1280x960 (Or is it 1024x768?)

&gt;&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?

&gt;I might. Not right now. 

&gt;&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.

&gt;- Front USB panel/Jack
&gt;- 128GB SSD
&gt;- 2T HDD

&gt;&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?

&gt;Honestly, i don't care about leds, window or anything like that. I would like an efficient setup, and good airflow.

&gt;&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS?

&gt;Yeah. I've got a legit windows key. ^^^^*cough*

&gt;&gt;Extra info or specifics:

&gt;I'm a little bit afraid of water cooling, so I'd like to avoid it if possible.

Thanks in advance!

1lqk0e,40,2013-09-04,Update to JPL internship,Asinane,nasa,https://www.reddit.com/r/nasa/comments/1lqk0e/update_to_jpl_internship/,"I got it! 

After the interview I felt like there was no way I had a chance because my interviewers looked very serious and I was nervous and I said some things I shouldn't have said. But the orientation was great and my mentor actually turned out to be very chatty and cool.

JPL looks and feels like a college campus, except way more exciting. Its the size of Disneyland except with more magic. One of the presenters mentioned how it would take 52 miles of walking to go through the numbered buildings in order (due to how illogical the numbering system was). 

There is no dress code and everyone, including the higher ups, dress in casuals. There was a guy with rainbow looking socks.

Turns out, all the Mission OPs and ground dats systems operations were conducted by sections of several divisions. They finally just created Division 39, which took all of these sectors of different divisions and put them together. My mentor was really excited about it so she dragged me to the first offical meeting of the division. Sitting in a room full of engineers talking about few hundred million dollar budgets is pretty cool. 

However some problems...

My professor who forwarded my application to JPL told me today that I was being dishonest in my application as I had put that I was an intern at our schools planterarium. The problem is that I was never an official intern. What had happened was that while I never went through the offical paperwork of going through an interview and getting accredited to the position, I knew the people in the planterium who were working there and were responsible for the training of inters. They recommended me to the professor in charge and I went, met with her, and got the ok to go the planterarium along with the other interns. So essentially, I did the same thing as all the other interns did, put the same time, and had the same experience and qualification that they did. Now while I think the act of going through and being a trainee of people who are teaching you something makes you an intern, I see how it can seem misleading. Its an honest mistake, but ""intern"" is the first thing I thought when describing my experience there.

However, it turned out the planterium experience wasn't even relevant to the work that I will be doing at JPL and I honestly don't think my mentor will even care about this. I don't mind telling her myself that ""Hey, I messed up. Let me explain that I never had an official intership at the plantarium and was merely voluntary. I should have put ""volunteer"" rather than ""intern"" on the applications. I am sorry and I hope this wouldn't have made a difference in your decision."" My professors dilemma is this: He feels like if he withdraws me it will be unfair to JPL because they'll be out of an intern. So his proposal is that I have to have such a spectacular presentation at JPL, which he will attend, or else he will give me an F for the 3 internship credits. I have no idea to do here. I don't even care about the silly grade, I am more hurt that the professor whose class I am taking hates me and that I now have to think that the mentor I will be working with is someone who I deceived. 

I want to tell him that he or I should tell my mentor directly and let him/her decide. I hate that I have to bogged down by this right as I start a new internship and a challenging semester. The mental aspect makes everything so much tougher.

I'm a recent accounting grad (B.Comm, June 2013) and I'm now living in Ottawa (did B.Comm in Montreal). I'm starting the CMA Designation program this fall with CMA Ontario and have been having a tough time finding an entry level accounting job to get the ball rolling on my career so I can move up the ladder.

Unfortunately a combination of health problems (now better) and poor french skills (pretty functional now though) ended up hindering my ability to compete for internships during my studies in Montreal. I do have 3+ years experience in technical software quality assurance work, as well as 4+ years of private tutoring work (mostly management/cost accounting, some finance).

I know this is a bit of a longshot, but I'm hoping maybe someone here on /r/Ottawa can point me in the right direction. I've contacted some staffing agencies (i.e. Accountemps, Lannick) but have been told to contact them again once I've gained more work experience. It's been suggested that I do volunteer work or find an internship, but I have monthly expenses (rent, food, utilities, etc) and cannot afford to go several months working without an income. 

As I'm going to be doing the CMA accounting designation, I'd be looking mostly for work at companies instead of public accounting firms (as I don't think work there fulfills the CMA work experience requirements....different type of accounting)...obviously willing to start at the very bottom and work up (but can't be unpaid for the reasons mentioned above).

So yeah, any helpful protips would be highly appreciated!

I'm an Accounting grad (not sure if my University should be mentioned) and I've been looking for work for the last few months. I've been applying on Monster, Careerbuilder, numerous headhunters, but to no avail.

 I have no professional accounting experience and I am starting to think that my inability to find accounting work during my school years will cause me to give up Accounting forever. I dont know what to do with my life beyond Accounting. I did an internship as a broker for Wall Street, which I hated, and to add insult to injury, the card that my boss gave me was extremely ineffective in communicating with him, despite being one of his best interns. My entrepreneurial internship that I did as well is equally ineffective.  

Concerning my networking abilities, I think the only ones I can really use are my professors, and I've been communicating with them, but again, no luck so far.

I am worried that I cant do this. I don't know if I can solve complex problems. I highly doubt I'd be able to design a part. Last time I worked on a project I really didn't feel like it was engineering. All I contributed was that we'd be able to use x material for heat, and that we could do something like blunt the end of our flying object to increase drag.

Even when my team did egg breaking competition, all I figured was to take those foam cup holders and create a capsule for the egg, and I didn't really feel like I was solving problems or doing engineering."

They posted a reply for a forum post about themselves claiming that there have been recent attempts to tarnish their reputation by a ""jealous"" competitor.  It is very difficult to know what to trust and not what to trust, and the program is not cheap (definitely a little more expensive than paying for accomodation etc on your own, but at least with them it should be lower stress / shared experiences with other interns).

Has anyone got any experience with CRCC, or other such companies?  I am hesitant to trust the information that I am being given from either side."

-----------------------------------

The single, best way get the attention of your representatives and senators is to **write a letter to the editor calling them out by name and have it published in your local or regional newspaper.**

I know this because, as one of the summer interns, one of the duties I shared was preparing a document that was distributed internally both online and in paper format.  This document was made every day, and comprised world news articles, national news, state news, and any letters to the editor in the 5-10 largest newspapers within my state that mentioned my senator by name.  I was often the person who put that document on his desk, and it was the first thing he read every morning after arriving to the office.

Additionally, I've learned that this is standard operating procedure across most offices.  I suspected as much at the time because several other senators' offices share the same printer, and I saw other interns doing the exact same procedures that I was involved in.  Since the internship, I've conferred with other Senate and House employees past and present and determined that most--if not all--offices use essentially the same procedure.

**TL;DR:** 

If you want to get the attention of Congress, an email or a phone call is *something*, but if you *really* want to get their attention, a letter to the editor that mentions them specifically is the way to go.  

**Note:**

In the comments, I will be sharing the body of the letter to the editor that I have written about the prospect of intervention in Syria.  You are all welcome to use what I've written to determine the content of your own letter, or lift any or all of the letter for the purposes of your own.

Keep fighting the good fight.

I have a one year old Chinese Crested neutered male.
He's a super sweet dog and super silly and playful with us and people he knows.

He really really does not like strangers or kids (not from lack of socialization on my part, that I can say.) He is very very people shy ever since I got him (should have been a warning when getting him but it's too late now) He recognizes people when he sees them 2-3 more times and is happy to see them. 

Ever since he was young he has always been stressed on a leash (he grew up in the city and then we moved to a countryside (but still next to a busy road) when he was 7 months old and now we live in the suburbs next to neighbors and it's quiet etc. but he still manages to be stressed and 'needing to get away from here' sort of reaction where ever we are. He has two switches. Super stressed and pulling and panting and freaking out and can't sit still and looking everywhere to bouncing around in excitement to be outside going for a walk and he gets so pumped up and barks at all the noises and dogs and people and just...everything. 

And these days...

He.

barks. 

so.

much.

at.

everything.

This started back when I did an internship at a doggy daycare and he started barking along with the other dogs when someone came in. Sometimes he even started it (he was... 7-9 months when I was working there) and it hasn't gotten any better. Now he barks at any sound outside or anyone walking by. I've tried many ways of correcting him and he just gets more intense if I poke him or try to distract him or turn the other way.

He is not aggressive AT ALL. At all. It's all for show. If someone were to walk up to him, he'd run away. He loves to play with dogs but now he is barking like crazy at them and then when they come near he'll crouch and run away and be super shy. I really can't understand his train of thought and how to curb both of these problems... We have been using a head collar to get him to calm down on walks and it helps a LOT but I don't want it forever.  When he is super stressed he doesn't take to treats or toys or anything. He just shuts down and finds the nearest corner to hide in."

Again thank you!

NOTE: I am a Third Year Canadian Student, applying for internships, hopefully to the larger companies.

As it stands i don't know anyone in the area and my transportation is limited to a bike and roller blades. I'd love to meet some of you guys to hit up the beach or bars or what not when i'm not interning. If that sounds like something that interests you just message back or PM me and we can swap numbers, Facebook, or whatever else not. Looking forward to hearing from some of you."

I'm currently finishing up my doctoral hours via an internship through a county program that works with probation kids who are often also dual diagnosed due to substance use issues (alcohol, weed, meth, cocaine). While working with children who have essentially been failed by their parents is rewarding, it unfortunately doesn't pay at all therefore no games for me. I realize the humor here in helping kids avoid future crimes, then asking fellow redditors to help me get a game where I commit felonies. I have to listen to quite a bit of depressing situations while at work and in the field of psychology self care is a huge aspect of one's career. Gaming has always helped me decompress after a day at work, as well as it helps me reconnect with my little brother who lives out of state. I don't expect to have this request fulfilled, but figured there may be a fellow redditor who has an extra key they'd like to share :)

1lq4on,15,2013-09-04,7 lessons I wish I learned before my tech internship,FamousAspect,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1lq4on/7_lessons_i_wish_i_learned_before_my_tech/,"It is rapidly approaching 11 years between my entry into the tech industry interning at Pandemic Studios and founding an indie game development studio to build [Enhanced Wars](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/904858263/enhanced-wars-multiplayer-turn-based-strategy-evol). Although it is still early days in my career, I think I have at least gained a modicum of insight worth sharing. When one of my mentors asked me to speak at the college course I credit for setting me on the path from enthusiast to professional, I saw an opportunity to reflect on my time in the industry and codify the lessons I wish I could go back in time to teach my youthfully arrogant college self. It is not like I am not still making missteps regularly;  I hope that 40 year old me is telepathically beaming back his list through time to send some wisdom my way. But it feels like a good time to share the top 7 lessons I wish I knew on my first day as a tech intern:

**1) It's a small world after all**

The industry is small. Remarkably small. The sort of small that only becomes apparent when you have been working in it for a while. In the past year and change that I have worked as a monetization consultant to help fund Enhanced Wars, I have been recommended for gigs by people I worked with 9 years ago I did not expect to work alongside again. I have been able to pay my rent thanks to jobs I was referred to by people at EA that I am certain I aggravated at one point or another. I have walked into meetings to instantly regret the actions a younger, more abrasive self thought were completely justified at the time. 

Every person that you meet in your early career, you are guaranteed to meet again. Every professional relationship you have is a long term investment. Every person you see as an obstacle to your success today will invariably be someone you are too embarrassed to ask for a favor 5, 10, 20 years down the line. It is nearly impossible to take the long view when you are young, but the sooner you realize just how tiny the professional world is, the better off you will be.

**2) Don't go for a big splash**

When I reflect on my career, the clearest facepalm moments come from the first few weeks on a new job. The times when I really wanted to prove myself. The times when I was trying to convince the people around me that I was a rockstar. 

Every time I tried to make a big splash at a new job, I made a belly flop. I was young, I was excited, I was trying to instantly make my mark. The hard smack of soft belly against the surface of the pool was a clear reminder that I had no idea what I was doing.

When starting new jobs, my instinct was to be Impressive. What I wish I had done was try to be Invisible. Only by taking the time to learn how an office works can you truly see  the opportunities to make a meaningful difference. When you come into a job you are entering a mature organism with layers of depth. 

When I reflect on the past, I more or less wish I had kept a low profile for the first two or three weeks of every new job. If I had kept my head down and my eyes open, I would have spotted the real opportunities to make a difference.

**3) Fixers not moaners**

When you are low down on the totem pole, it is easy to look at the actions of the people above you and scoff. If you were in charge, you would do things differently. How could they make such obvious mistakes?

But then 8 or 10 years go by, and you start to occupy the shoes of someone whose every decision is questioned. You think about the past and you understand why your team leads made the decisions they made. Things were not nearly as clear cut as they seemed.

When you're working on a software development team, it feels good to moan about the people in charge. After a tough week, it is satisfying to blow off some steam with your co-workers. During lunch breaks or late night team dinners, it is easy to complain about what is happening. You feel closer to your colleagues and better about yourself.

But if you really want to prove yourself, then moaning and groaning is a complete waste of your time. If you are an intern, you will see things big and small go wrong around you. The easy route to take is to tell your co-workers what an idiot person X, Y or Z is. The far harder thing is to identify the problems you are capable of solving completely on your own and fixing them.

If you go to your boss and you say ""the build process is broken,"" all you have accomplished is accusing a person who is already overloaded with work that she's doing something wrong. But if you go to your boss and say ""the build process was inefficient so I did X and now programmers have 10 extra minutes to code each day,"" you will shine.

The best way to distinguish yourself in your internship is to be someone who fixes problems without being told. Small problems. If you fix small problems and make a difference, you will be asked to fix bigger problems. 

**4) Cultivate mentorship**

The value of having a mentor cannot be overstated. When times are tough, when you are facing a problem you do not know how to solve, when you are so burnt out you cannot see straight, you need someone to talk to. Someone with a perspective that will help you see your problem different. Someone to buy you a burrito, listen to your problems and offer advice. And not just one person, but several.

It can be difficult to spot a mentor. If someone is going out of her way to help you avoid mistakes or is willing to go out to lunch with you and answer your questions, these are signs of a relationship you will want to keep up. Try and set up a regular lunch or coffee break every other week and prepare for that meeting so you can get as much value of it as possible. Arrive with a few questions you want to ask written down. Thank your mentor for her time and encouragement. Be appreciative. If your internship ends or your mentor moves on from the company, keep in contact with her over email and instant messenger.

**5) Don't watch TV during working hours**

This is the simplest mistake to avoid. The top mistake I have seen from interns and new grads is to have their work on one monitor and streaming TV on the other. And I cannot pretend that I've never put TV on while working on more tedious tuning tasks on [Enhanced Wars](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/904858263/enhanced-wars-multiplayer-turn-based-strategy-evol). You may never be told to stop, but people will notice. 

Watching TV while you work is a bad habit. You may think you are capable of working at 100% efficiency but you are not. Even if you finish all the tasks you are assigned while enjoying The Daily Show, if you cut out the distractions you would finish your work quicker and have more time to show initiative by solving the small problems that will make you stand out.

Watching TV while you work is very visible. Your manager may never tell you to cut it out, but when writing up your intern report or deciding which interns have the potential to go full time your TV watching will rear its head. These decisions are generally made by several layers of people, and decision makers who never really had a chance to interact with you at work may only know that you finally caught up on Breaking Bad.

**6) Open yourself to opportunity**

Tied into my first point about the smallness of the industry is the idea that you have to open yourself up to the opportunities around you. If you are taking classes in software development, if you are going to mixers in your city or industry events, if guest lecturers come talk at your school, you are undoubtedly letting opportunities pass you by left and right. I am very happy with my career today but there are still plenty of moments where I wish had written down an email address or connected with someone on LinkedIn. You will never know what smash success someone will enjoy 5 years down the line, or what new trend you will wish you were working on as your personal tastes change or you are exposed to new things.

For instance, Ratchet &amp; Clank is one of my top videogame series of all time. But I didn't learn that its mixture of appealing graphics and run &amp; gun action put me in my happy place until at least a year after Insomniac boss Ted Price gave a guest lecture to my game production class. I did not get his card or write down his email address. I do not think I even introduced myself after the class was over. All things I wish I had done. I am also fairly certain that Infinity Ward co-founder Vince Zampella spoke to one of our classes shortly after Call of Duty II was released. But I cannot be certain who from the Infinity Ward team spoke because I did not introduce myself. I did not get his card or write down his email. I am pretty sure I wore my Pandemic Studios t-shirt to class that night and if I stood out, it was for asking a cocky question.

These are just two of the higher profile examples, but trust me, there are many more opportunities in my past that I was blind to.

**7) There's more to life than working**

If you made it this far into the post, it is safe to assume that you chose technology out of a lifelong passion. That when you land that internship or first job, it will be one of the great triumphs of your life. That you will gladly sacrifice nights, weekends and friendships for a chance to build tech. I know I did.

There is more to life than work. Being a young person is an incredible opportunity in itself, one you will never get a second shot at. So do not put your developer dreams above everything else in your life. 

When I am up late at night balancing units or making maps for [Enhanced Wars](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/904858263/enhanced-wars-multiplayer-turn-based-strategy-evol), I am not  thinking ""it's a really good thing I skipped out on spring break my junior year so that I could pick up team dinners and make sure the build process was successful."" Recognize that you are an intern and that (unless your boss disagrees) the game team will go on without you. Live your life. Be young. Enjoy yourself. 

I may have devoted my life to building videogames, but in the end even I realize that it is only work."

I'm 5'8, 160lbs. Like I said I last smoked last Saturday (one bowl pack) and one bowl pack maybe once or twice going two weeks back. I smoked a lot this summer though.

I'm currently a co-op student (what we call interns) at Disney Interactive up in Canada, and I'm curious about my experience vs yours. Disney is a huge company and I assume there are a bunch of you out there!

I got hired relatively easily. The office up here is in a medium sized city, and the postings are generally only for the university in that city and a few other ones surrounding it. I didn't find it hard to get hired at all. I am very active in student life in uni, and I think thats mostly why I got hired. Phone interview with a recruiter, Skype interview with my now bosses, and that was it. How is the process of getting hired in the US?

Do you guys get paid? I signed a contract for 8 months, and make about $16/hour. 

What are your perks? Our office is awesome, fun and laid-back. Free drinks, snacks and sometimes food. Also got 2 tickets to a Disney park (which I'll never use, we live so far away).

Do you like it? My job so far, being there 4 months, has been very challenging. I'm working side-by-side with some Marketing Managers and I feel like I'm getting an amazing experience. 

There are only about 5 or 6 co-op students in our office, so generally we are separated into our own departments and don't see each other much which is unfortunate. Do you guys have any special intern events?

Anyways, working for Disney is amazing and I'm so sad my term is already half over. Would be sweet to meet some other interns!"
1lpwul,1,2013-09-04,[AMA] I just turned 24. I went to a liberal arts university. I make 120k from a Fortune 500 company as a WordPress developer.,[deleted],webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1lpwul/ama_i_just_turned_24_i_went_to_a_liberal_arts/,"**Background**

I started building websites (like a lot of people) when I was in my teens. Growing up, I didn't know best practices, but I used Dreamweaver to make websites. 

I didn't consider my interest a career and went to college for the humanities. At 20, I started making websites in exchange for services (car mechanic, internship, etc). I started seeing my service in terms of the value I created, rather than the time I spent on a project.

I always had a job since I was 15, but always got paid hourly work. When I started making websites, I initially started billing based on the hours needed. Slowly, I began charging a range which I thought fit a fair hourly amount.

Last year, after graduating college, I decided to start my own company. I took 6 years to finish school and ended up with a cumulative 2.48 GPA. By working myself, I bypassed the bullshit of resume judging and went straight to clients. I billed on a weekly rate and always had 2 weeks of clients planned ahead. I charged 3200 and additional for overtime (+50 hours).

Last month, I decided that I would grow a lot from being in a corporate environment. I lived in China for a year and worked for another Fortune 500. 

I kept a clear LinkedIn profile and regularly updated my Github and portfolio site. I saw the value of working in a big company, so I started responding to recruiters and ended up going on an interview.

Considering I was making good money on my own, I went on the interview without the need to get the job. This resulted in my ability to standup for a salary on the high end of the overall spectrum. Additionally, Im being given the title of Senior Software Engineer. 

**Note** 

The job is in New York City. (This is important because people living in other places may make less, but are also spending less.) I taught myself everything I do. I am interested in starting a business, but I find that knowing where my financial security comes from gives me the ability to fully explore my own projects without feeling at risk. At this point, I'm going to give this company my all and see how I can make a positive contribution in the projects I take on.

I think Im in a very fortunate position and know a lot of it has to do with luck. Regardless, I want to help everyone here if theres anything that I can do to shed light on process. 

Ask me anything. I'd love to be of help.

* Keep an active portfolio.
* Keep your LinkedIn up-to-date. Use brief but clear descriptions of projects you worked on. 
* Attend meetups and always ask people what they get paid.  
* Always be closing deals. 
* Freelance at a low rate, until you can start demanding more money because you are too busy.
* Dont be an asshole. Follow through with promises.
* Be responsive in your communication. 
* If you want to charge more, identify the people who can afford the rate you want to bill.
* Referrals are often 60% of your business and repeat customers are 20%. The other 20% is hustle.
* Always be reading and learning. The moment you stop learning new things, you will fall behind quickly."

I would really love some feedback, maybe from people who have gone through similar situations? Or just someone who can see the problem from a different point of view! Please bear with me, it's kind of long! 

My boyfriend is in Germany and I am in the US and he is planning on visiting me for a month in November (!!!).  He is also going to be working abroad for a few months in a Scandinavian country either before or after he visits me.  Possibly before AND after. I want to be happy for him but I feel as though I am in such a rut. I am dealing with my father quickly dying from a non-curable disease and I am also trying to figure out what to do after I graduate. This brings on more stress because there is a strong possibility I will be headed to Germany for my Masters. 

I want to be with him one day in the future, but we don't have an end date in sight, since I am not sure if I will graduate on time. There is a possibility that I will be there this summer, as I am trying to get an internship anywhere and Germany is my top choice, if I can help it. He said he would try and transfer his job over here after he is finished with his schooling, which is sooner than I will be finished. 

I suppose I just need your advice on how to be supportive even though I am so confused and hurting. I just wish he was here for me and I know it is so so selfish. I could never ask him to uproot his life, I even feel guilty that he is considering coming to the US temporarily for work. I am just at a point in my life (father's fast-approaching death) and it is so hard. 

With him working in another country, he will be having the time of his life and I will be coping and caring for my dad and family. This comes off as me being jealous of his life-style, but it is the exact opposite. I cannot go through this alone and I need to have someone there and I want it to be him so badly. This could not be any worse timing because at this rate my pops probably will not be here within the next 6 months. I'm not a weak person and my love for him is so strong but I'm not sure if I can mentally handle a long distance relationship and the death of my dad. "

1lpexx,1,2013-09-04,Which is the Wisest Path?,3dollars6dimes,graphic_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/1lpexx/which_is_the_wisest_path/,"I need some advice Reddit.

So I have a Bachelor of Science in Communications with a focus in Broadcast Journalism and Film. I enjoyed studying this but after graduating I have lost the passion to continue to pursue it. 

One of my really good friends is a Graphic Designer and after talking to him about what he does on a daily basis I realized how much it interests me. One thing I hated about Broadcast is that it allows for absolutely no creativity, while Graphic Design allows for at least some while still being a stable area of work. I've always been a creative person and love art, drawing, etc. though I don't draw or anything seriously. I've also always been extremely fascinated with the branding of stores and the way their promotional materials come together. Knowing all of this and talking to him I think I would like to pursue it... the only problem is I don't know what the next step should be.

I can think of three options as to what I should do:

1. Go back and get another Bachelor's Degree in Graphic Design. While I  wouldn't necessarily like to go back for a completely different Bachelor's, this would help me the most as it would give me the full curriculum including art theory courses and software training (currently I have no technical knowledge of design software besides very minimal Photoshop) as well as allowing me to build a strong portfolio and have time to get some strong internships. The only issue is that I'd have to support myself through this financially as I know there can be some stipulations with financial aid on a 2nd Bachelor's.

2. Get an Associate's in Graphic Design. This seems like a good option as far as software training, time and tuition goes, but how much an Associate's will help me towards my portfolio and how extensive the curriculum will be kind of leaves me wondering. Also I'm not sure how many hiring managers at firms and such are looking for someone with an Associate's? I'm clueless about that whole aspect.

3. Get a Certificate in Graphic Design. This came up because a nearby university offers this. I don't think I would go this route because there doesn't seem to be as much emphasis on student projects and such. Also a Certificate doesn't look that impressive on a resume in my opinion.

The only other option I can think of would be a Master's in Graphic Design but with no previous work and no software knowledge I feel completely unqualified for all of the programs I've looked at. What do you think is the wisest thing to do? I'm pretty open to any opinions as I'm not making any decisions just yet. Any advice someone in the business or with knowledge about any of this could give me would be much appreciated... as right now I just feel lost.

**TL;DR: I have a BS in Communication already. I want to get into Graphic Design. What is the best option for me? 2nd Bachelors, Associates, Certification or other?**"
1lpcgv,3,2013-09-04,Moving from account management to account planning?,Jasdoe,advertising,https://www.reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/1lpcgv/moving_from_account_management_to_account_planning/,"I was recently passed over for a planning internship for another candidate (why, I'm not sure and will probably never know). I have a very strong interest in account planning, which is why I pursued the internship in the first place. However, my four internship experiences do not justify a junior planning role, so being rejected for this specialized, paid internship was really my last hope to start my career out in planning.

On the other hand, I'm qualified for account coordinating roles to start off (although I'm not attracted to the field, my experiences vouche for that side of advertising more convincingly). I've been applying for account coordination and assistant account executive roles in an attempt to start out.

I doubt I will lose interest in planning down the line, as I want this to be part of my career. Would it be realistic to think someone could make a transition from an entry level management role into something closer to planning within a couple years of management experience?

1lp9fn,3,2013-09-04,Forever stuck in existential angst,dumpdump543,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1lp9fn/forever_stuck_in_existential_angst/,"I may not want to admit this EVER, OPENLY, TO ANYONE, but I have issues. Some of them a bit serious. And I have absolutely no idea why, and this is what bothers me most. I am the shoulder friends can cry on, I love hearing stories and it makes me really happy when people trust me up to the point where they share some of their darkest secrets with me. Paradoxically I have serious issues in trusting other people and I NEVER openly share ANYTHING about myself.

I have heard stories of people being raped, abused, treated quite roughly by their parents, gone through a fucked up childhood etc, well... I didn't have to go through any of these, yet somehow, I begin to realize that my mind is badly messed up. Overly screwed, virused, like a barely functioning computer. I feel as if I'm equipped with an incredible amount of RAM, a fairly decent processor and some other pretty cool, proficient parts. I feel as if I have the power to do anything in the whole wide world and I'd really like to do everything, but the truth is , life is pretty damn short and one lifetime is barely enough to choose just 1-2 big goals. I have absolutely no idea what to choose and what not to. I am lost.

Almost everyone I meet inspires me to follow a different career path, to me every job is so damn interesting: doctors, nurses, teachers, tourist guides, photographers, writers, cooks, psychologists, researchers, librarians, pilots, train drivers, taxi drivers, programmers etc. etc... and even janitors. Yes, I would like to find the time to do become all of the above (and more) and simultaneously find time for friends, concerts and dozens of leisure activities, such as playing sports, playing guitar, reading and rereading science fiction, going hiking, swimming, exploring places etc. etc. etc.

Ever since I finished high school, I've been in this fucked up existential crisis. At first it all led me to believe philosophy could provide answers. I began reading more and more philosophy books and later on studying philosophy at a local university. But not even 6 months passed and I got lost in the wildness. I could no longer grasp the purpose of philosophy, as it proved to be useless in finding any concrete answers. I dropped out of university. I took a gap year, then I discovered this sort of new and totally revolutionary college of liberal arts, which sounded like the perfect thing for the - the place I had always imagined as ""heaven on earth"" for a person like me (whose mind is filled with uncommon peculiarities). I wrote the best application letter I possibly could, I got invited to the application interview and, due too my overly uncontrollable enthusiasm, I scared the shit out of the commission and got rejected. What followed were 6 months of what I would call severe depression. I have never seen a shrink or a psychotherapist -&gt; therefore I am not 100% certain whether ""depression"" is the correct label for what I went through or not. Frankly, I always tried to keep away from anything that forced me to become psychological vulnerable to other people. After receiving that rejection letter I could barely leave the bed, I spent 10-15 hours per day reading books or articles on the internet or just looking at the ceiling, and I would only leave the house once a week, in order to buy toilet paper, cheap wine and some stuff to eat.

As time passed, I slowly climbed out of the black hole and tried to put my life back together. I was still in the same existential crisis as always, I wished to go to so many places at the same time, but I had no idea what to choose. So I began following a lifestyle based on the famous ""carpe diem"" principle -&gt; do whatever you feel like doing.

Since I wasn't able to chose a career path with rational arguments, I tried to make a decision by flipping a coin. I flipped coins for all my 30 study options and eventually ""psychology"" won. I applied for psychology and, based on my graduation marks I got rejected. The last admitted application was 1.22 and I was at 1.23. More ""depression"" followed, nevertheless not as severe as the last time. I spent a whole new year doing meaningless jobs, lived life as if it's only purpose was to pay the monthly rent, buy&amp;eat pre-cooked meals and wait for time to pass, inside a small apartment with my boyfriend (whom I had been dating since I was 16 - now I am 23 and we're still living happily together and, in spite of this unbelievably rare blessing, my mind still feels like an old, rusty, broken computer. but why?!). So, after the second rejection letter, thanks to my boyfriend's support I gradually climbed out of the black hole again and, since psychology didn't work out for me, I decided this time to go for photography. I applied for some of the most famous photography colleges in Europe and got accepted by many of these, but due to the high tuition fees (about 600 Euros / month) I was forced to turn all the acceptances down. Instead I did some internships at some pretty kick ass press agencies and began working on a few photo documentaries.

Everything went great, I was once again settling for an amazing career path, more and more people began to appreciate my photos (I even had an exhibition). But then another 6-8 months went by and I have no idea what happened then. Somehow this whole passion for photo documentaries shifted in the background and one day I woke up in the same old existential shit hole: ""Life is so short, how can I make sure I am making the right choices? Yes, in 2-3 I might be able to get really good at photography. But will my future me be happy with the choices I am making today or will I bitterly regret everything? Should I consider pursuing this photography bullshit forever or should I aim for some of the other cool careers out there? What would everything look like if I had been accepted for a B.A. in psychology? etc. etc.""

And so, during the summer of 2011 I flipped another coin for some 20-30 times and eventually, based on the fact that I visited an Indian restaurant and really enjoyed their Pakooras and their deliciously milky Ras Malai, I decided to enroll for a B.A. in South Asian studies. I spent the past two years passionately learning Hindi and Urdu, I felt quite happy and content with what I was doing. I enjoyed the courses, the languages, all the Bollywood movies and the fact that the guys at our local Pakistani restaurant would talk to me in Urdu (they still do). Once again everything was great, but then a new wave of craziness emerged - as you probably already noticed, every 1-2 years I wake up with a powerful drive to run away from everything I have, tear it all apart and start from scratch. This is exactly what I am doing now: even though I didn't drop out of college (yet - I am struggling not to), in 2012 I began taking less and less courses and... opened a startup company: a tea store. Yes, I am 100% crazy, you probably figured it out by now.

I started working on a business plan, did some research and figured it would be a great moment to open a tea store (tea is getting more and more popular) + owning a business is one of the things I always wanted to do in my life.

So, today I'm here: the tea business is going on a good path, it has taught me so many things during the past year and I don't regret getting into it, but so far I haven't managed to make it profitable, and I believe this is ONLY due to my chaotic commitments to far to many things. It is difficult to study, have a job (my parents don't support me financially and they disapprove of every crazy thing I do) and run a successful business at the same time. I am stuck at a sort of crossroad, I am doing far to many times at the same time, it is impossible for all of them to work out, so I need to cut things out, decide what to focus on and, for heaven's sake, stick with my decision for a longer period of time!!

But how? How the hell can I break this devilish pattern and why have I fallen into it in the first place? Why do I want so many things, why can't I be like most folks: commit to one single thing, get really good at it and continue doing it for the rest of my life?

Inevitably, I begin to ask myself: where does this existential crisis arise from? This need, this obsession for doing EVERYTHING? Am I trying to prove something to someone? If yes, to whom and why? Are other people driven by the same inexplicable urge? If yes, what is it? Is it a disease?

Expect this pile of text to be full of spelling mistakes, as I haven't studied English in school. As a Balkans kid, I only had the chance to learn English through cartoons and movies... nevertheless, I did run it through spell checkers and I hope it's decent enough for you to read it. :)

TL DR: 22 year old stuck in a seemingly endless existential crisis.

http://campeonesenelring.com.ar/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/DSC08363.jpg (the guy who writes them is the guy on the right)

It's possible that a monday session is not the same as the previous monday. The hard labor of this day contrasts the joyfulness and tranquility of last weekend, and it makes it seen like the villain of the weekdays. The beginning of training was slow and lazy, the return to the mandatory routines, and the focus and concentration in the objectives of the session are just some of the burdens. But this very day is the first of the month of september. Somebody who does not belong to the world of boxing, would ask themselves about the uniqueness of this month.

I will start saying that it is important for Argentinean boxing for many reasons. Almost one year ago, Lucas obtained the interim WBC junior welterweight world title after defeating Ajose Olusegun. Marcos Maidana obtained a significant triumph for his career against Jesus Soto Karass, and Sergio Martinez solidfied himself as the absolute king of the middleweight division after defeating Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. I think I'm starting to make my points a little valid (I think you can see the validity of my points).

With all that history on our backs was how this monday began. On our way to the gym for our regular training and commenting on everything that was awaiting for us this week, we little by little, started to get our focus back. Lucas will also suffer (meaning it will cost him, physically) this week. 

Arriving to our destination, and with high temperatures, we hurried to enter the gym. We started with an aerobic warm up, then speed exercises and leg coordination, and then we combined both to try to finish a session that wasn't too heavy/hard, so that we could sparr 12 rounds after. We finished with 25 minutes of movement exercises and elasticity.  

http://campeonesenelring.com.ar/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/DSC08344.jpg

Thinking about training as time passed by, the first monday seems that it will be harder than anticipated. A temperature that feels about 45 degrees celsius seems to justify my reasoning. 

http://campeonesenelring.com.ar/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/DSC08376.jpg

We arrived at the boxing gym before the rest of the protagonists, who quickly began to enter: Joel and Antonio Diaz, many amateur boxers and some spectators. Minutes after two sparring partners of Latino origin arrived, in addition to the already known Ivey Nixon 

For me to say that Lucas is an amazing boxer may be a bit subjective. But I can assure you that he can accurately time three different fighters stylistically speaking, he can adjust the timing of his punches, and practice defensive movements, and hide like a poker player his momentarily weaknesses. An applause is deserved. And above all, if we add to that the evening exercises, the 45 Celsius degrees that are signaled by the sun outside, the quality of his competition and that this is his ninth week of training...Again, you should stand up and celebrate.  

http://campeonesenelring.com.ar/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/DSC08435.jpg

We finished with a nice stretch. Then the usual and repeated handshakes and pictures. It is over. The first day of a symbolic month for argentinean pugilism.  

The very same 9/14, in Argentina, it is the celebration of ""Fighter's Day"", ""Boxer's day"", Could it be a coincidence? 

The memorable combat of this very same date illustrates our very well remembered Luis Angel Firpo against Jack Dempsey, and it motivates Lucas. Could this be a coincidence? 

In the same way, “The Wild Bull of the Pampas” was born in Junin (Lucas' hometown) Could THIS ONE be a coincidence?


PS: Thank all of you. I'm also very proud to announce that I got an internship. It's unpaid, but better than being unemployed. I also eyed this German chick, so I may need more luck than Danny boy himself. Wish me luck y'all. 

Thanks Brauli0, I will also be betting on the Machine. We will feast on September 14th, my friend."

I couldn't really think of anywhere else to have this discussion, so why not put a feminine spin on it and post here? 

I suppose I feel a bit bitter over being forced to give up 4 years of my life and tens of thousands of dollars to get a degree, at such a young age, when I'm not even sure what I want to do. I feel like a degree probably really is necessary to get actual 'career' type jobs. I'd love it if companies offered unpaid internships you could get without uni experience, where they'd teach you and give you experience in exchange for work...but that's not how it works. So, I guess my point is, university is something we're almost ""forced"" into.

But, I often see (especially on reddit), the trades suggested as an alternative. Do trades school/an apprenticeship quickly and for cheap, and start earning 6 digits. Sounds nice. However, maybe just because of my own ignorance, these types of jobs seem to be much more male oriented. Even if women were to choose it, I imagine it could be a very hostile environment and hard to climb that ladder. Speaking as a tiny, rather girly-girl, working on an oil rig or something is not what I’d consider for myself - though I’m sure many women do pursue those jobs.

SO, discussion time!! (｡◕‿◕｡)

While we were dating things were great, we moved in together, and really liked each other’s company. After some long thinking I ended up getting my girlfriend an engagement ring it was about $400. I had money but I thought it was unnecessary to shell out all that money for such a cosmetic thing? Right? 

Well this is where the problems began, my wife said she was so excited to get married. She told me she wanted to be in charge of the wedding planning and getting stuff together. This woman from being with her thus far has been frugal, making food as opposed to eating out, only goes to salons for special occasions. However, I take a look at the projected costs over 50,000. I told her that this is too much. I told her I am not taking a loan out on a wedding. Then she starts sneering at me telling me how much of a cheap skate I was for buying a ‘shitty engagement ring.’ That this is the “least I owe her.”

I don’t know what the hell happened, my sweet fiancé turned into a massive out of control bitch. I told her I am done with this shit, and I want her out. It has been a couple days since I kicked her out and she has been calling me back saying that she is sorry. I haven’t responded yet, I just need to cool off a bit.

I want to think that this was just a wedding planning hormone phase but then as a lot of my friends have said that this is the women she is going to become once we get married.

I am a high school senior that decided I would like to major in tourism &amp; hospitality management. I will probably minor in business management. This career path would make me very happy, I absolutely love dealing with people with my liftie job at the local ski resort.

 It would be a dream of mine to move out west to manage a ski resort or manage a hotel by the ocean. 
 I will definitely try to get good quality internships in college, for the experience

Is there anything I need to know as I go down this route? How do i prepare myself to be successful down this path? Thanks! :)"

1loi4h,1,2013-09-03,I (24 M) suddenly find myself falling for my friend's (22 M) ex (23 F) and I've got no clue what to do.,Legion6jf4,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1loi4h/i_24_m_suddenly_find_myself_falling_for_my/,"This isn't a crazy, off the wall situation. However, this is the first time I've ever experienced something like this, and friendly advice is all I'm seeking.

I've known my friend (we'll call him Tom) for a little bit over two years. We're not ""best"" friends, however when we met through others, we became fast friends. Shared many interests. It was an easy friendship. We've been that way ever since. A few months after we meet (and after hanging out quite a lot), he suddenly introduces me to his (then) GF (we'll call her Jill).


Now, according to Jill, at this time, they'd been together for quite some time (almost a year), and personally I found it odd that he never brought her around. I soon find out it's because she was in Texas on an internship. That explained the not every meeting her, but that didn't explain the failure to *ever* mention her, and the many nights I saw Tom with other girls, going home with other girls, and acting single. But nevertheless, I paid no mind due to being in my own (albeit failing at this point) relationship. Not really my business. I saw her periodically throughout the next several months but never long enough to have any real conversations or experiences. Mainly just out with a group of people here and there.


Fast forward to about April of this year. He texts me to inform me that he ended the relationship, but felt bad about how things ended. He had broken it off stating that as much as he cared about her as a person, his heart was simply not in the relationship anymore. To which I advised him the same thing I was told when I did something similar once upon a time, ""Dude, if you weren't in it and you had no desire to be, it's better to let her go find someone who will be."" After all, we live in New York City. There's plenty of ""fish"" in the proverbial sea.


So randomly one day around June, I receive a tweet from Jill, and the ensuing conversation bled into text messaging. We met up for lunch one day later that week (I work downtown, so does she) and chatted for a bit. And since then, we've made some plans, hung out a few times, she came out for my birthday.... Stuff like that. At this point, I had absolutely zero intentions for anything outside of, ""Hey you're fun, come hang out with me let's be pals."" After all, I wasn't actively searching for anything after recently having my soul crushed by an evil woman. But it just clicked one day. I was (and still am) falling for Jill in a big way. 


She's amazing. I started noticing and discovering things about her that I never knew before because I didn't bother to pay attention previously. The small quirky stuff about people that you'll never catch unless you look for it. You know the, ""my clothes never fit right around you"" type feeling. That. Even though I'm awful at the whole courtship thing anymore, the feelings are advanced. And I've got no idea what to do here.


There's recently been a reconnecting between Tom and Jill. But if I'm to believe what Tom has told me, it's just for the sake of friendship. Personally, I see it on his end, but I know how some girls can be with the exes who shattered their hearts. But that's neither here nor there. The most important question is: which route do I take?


On one hand, I feel as though it's not really any of Tom's business now that they're not together. I don't believe in the ""dude bro code"" or anything like that. We're all adults trying to lead adult lives. On the other hand, not everyone is like me, and he might not take it so well. Obviously, the first response would be, ""Talk to her, then talk to him."" And while I agree to an extent, I feel as though I'm seeking a way to do it. I'd like to let things develop naturally between Jill and I (if they even are to develop as I've not expressed my feelings as of yet), but I'm torn on what to do with Tom if they indeed develop. Talk to him now, or talk to him later? If I do it right away I feel as though I'm asking him permission, and some might label it ""stealing her."" Well, you can't really ""steal"" something that doesn't ""belong"" to anyone, and I don't know if I'm on board with the asking permission-type avenue, as again, part of me feels like it's not really his business.

Thoughts? Opinions? Recipes? 

Thanks

Basically, research starts spring of sophomore year and continues over the summer. A PhD can be earned in around 7 years total (4 years for a BS plus some research and 3 years to finish up the PhD). As of right now I think I want to do some form of research, whether it be in industry or academia. My biggest problems are that I have never done any research before and I'm unsure if I will like it or be good at it and also a fear that I will end up overqualified/over-specialized for general software engineering if I finish the program and feel burnt out on research. I am reasonably sure I can handle miserable workloads. 

As of right now I'm leaning towards Computer Graphics as a specialty, but I'm not 100% sure. Am I better off working in industry for a few years and paying off my undergraduate loans before making the decision to go back for more school? If I go that root, should I be looking for internships or for research opportunities over this coming summer?

I'm planning on talking with my adviser tomorrow to help make the decision. My school has a graduate program ranked around the top 50, so I don't think that's an issue. My GPA now is a 4.0, but that probably doesn't mean much because freshmen classes weren't that hard."

Hi all, I'm graduating in December with my MPH in Epi and the job search is starting to loom over me and I was hoping for some advice from anyone currently working in the field. 
   I have a few years work experience prior to starting my MPH, mainly working at a large hospital on primary care research projects as an RA. I'm currently interning at the local health department as well as in an infection control department at a local hospital.
   I guess my first issue is that I'm not 100% sure what sorts of jobs I should be looking for as an entry level candidate. The job listings I’ve been seeing are so broad that there doesn't seem to be a particular starting point for me. I'm enjoying the health department internship so far and I like the practical aspect of being able to see results of your efforts, which in my previous research jobs I often felt was lacking. However I see many job postings in more research-oriented roles that seem appealing, but I worry that I’ll end up not really feeling like I’m making any sort of impact. Does anyone here work in one of these areas that can offer some advice? Are the job prospects/salaries better for particular positions?
   The other big concern is of course salary. Again the ranges I’m seeing are all over the place and location will obviously play a big role. I’m hoping to move back up to the Northeast eventually, but with the higher cost of living and my student loans, I’m not sure that it will be feasible for me right out of school.

So I guess my questions are:

Any comments on the current trends you see in the job market for Epi? How hard is it to land a job after an MPH and what sorts of entry level salaries are common?

Finally are there any job search tips you wish you had known? I’ve already met with career services to review my resume and I’m planning to start sending out application in the next few weeks so any advice would be appreciated!"

We're an extremely small creative marketing agency doing enormous things in LA and NY. Our LA office is looking for design/marketing interns to help us out on various projects w/ clients you've probably heard of; Levi's, Sonos, Alternative Apparel, Absolut, and more. 

As a design intern you would assist our creative director and NY designer on creating interesting, aesthetically pleasing artwork for prints, vinyls, email blasts, and more. 

As a marketing intern you'll be tasked with various and unique jobs dependent on the project we're working on. One week you might be helping out at a music festival for an event we put on, and the next you'll be doing extensive research on the music and culture of dancehall music.

This isn't a paper and coffee job; we will work with you to provide you with experiences relevant and interesting to what you want out of an internship with us. 

Unfortunately, this is an unpaid internship. That's why we are looking for undergraduate applicants so that we may provide college course credit and hands-on experience for someone without any experiences in this field. 

If you're interested, PM me and I'll give you all the details!

Thanks for your time ಠ‿ಠ"

I did this last year as well as an internship for my job. Last year went really well and we handled it very well. Our two year anniversary was last march so we are very comfortable with each other and know each other well. This summer was....different.

It started with her getting distant. Not that anything ever seemed wrong or strange, just the quantity of texts between us started to dwindle about a month into the internship. The quality was still the same, just less. It made sense. I work 84 hour weeks in Alaska so I'm always busy. She got a new job and started working 70 hr weeks. Then the quality of texts started to die.

It became less pictures, less ""Have a great day hun!"", less everything. It became more distant and formal. Texts including plans for afterwards in a business like tone. Texts asking about what to do with some of my stuff she found when we moved out (lived together). Less texts telling me she missed me. I shrugged it off. we were both working, both busy. Two months in she got very very distant. For about two weeks she barely texted me, no pictures, no talking. Barely picked up the phone or was sleeping when I called. After two weeks she said she had let a guy at work flirt with her and she let it go too far. No cheating, just let him get too close. It's hard to explain but I have absolute trust she would not cheat. She's too good of a person. Please don't assume that. She basically called crying she felt really bad that she had let this guy affect her in this way. She told me that she felt that I didn't say she was pretty often enough, and she wanted me to give her more attention. That's why she let it slide with this guy was her explenation. She missed the attention and liked it. We had a good long talk that night and worked through things. Normally we couldn't talk that long because of our hours, we just were both super tired in the morning.

Well things got better after that but it was still a lot more distant than at the beginning of the summer. By august we were comfortable and happy with each other, but there always seemed to be an underlying.... something. We coulnd't get close, I couldn't seem to get her to send as many pictures, (back and forth, I sent a lot too), and so on. She kept saying that she just tried to focus on not missing me and she hoped things would go back to normal when we saw each other again. I felt the same way. If felt like we grew apart from each other. We were both nervous to see each other. We hadn't talked that much, hadnt' seen each other on facetime near as often as the first time. She kept saying she just felt ""weird""

Well I finally get home. She ran crying up to me in the airport and jumepd into my arms. see, we had always loved each other. Both missed each other terribly, it was just a dwindling of conversation. I picked her up and spun her around in the airport and we just got lost in each other. But by the time we got my luggage the weirdness and distance seemed to be coming back. She smiled and turned away, or focused on menial things like getting out of the airport while I coulnd't seem to tear myself from her. Ah fuck, I missed her so badly. It seemed to just get weirder when we got to her place. She gave me a tour (moved when I left, only saw it via facetime) and showed me the bedroom. Now, I don't want to get graphic, but last summer when I got back we dind't sleep for three days. This time was weird. She wasn't feeling any foreplay, nothing. I stopped pretty quick as it was obvious she wasn't feeling it. I was all ""mmmmm, babe"" and she was all ""haha....yeah""

ended up watching a movie and ordering out. I had much bigger plans. I wanted to take her to a dinner, maybe a movie. She wanted to order and watch cable. Well, whatever at least we're back together. She ended up falling asleep around 10, I picked her off the couch and put her to bed. ended up sleeping next to her (not cuddling or touching, more my choice. it seemed weird). Anyway I ended up staring at the ceiling for about 4 hours thinking about the day. The only thing I could come up with was that it was distant. It was like two friends seeing each other after going to seperate summer camps. you know you both missed each other and can't wait to see each other but when you acutally do it's weird.

It never really got better. It's been two weeks and we've had some serious talks. Basically she's told me she's not sure if she wants to be with me or something along those lines. We spend the nights together, and we do have sex a lot. Things seem to be going back to normal but it's still just weird. She keeps saying she loves me but i feel like i could lose her at any second. If I don't give her attention, If if accidentaly bail on a date. I suggested counseling and she was for it, but only for herself. I wanted to go to counseling together, she wanted to go seperate. I don't know what's going on. Help?"
1lt5sr,291,2013-09-05,My office is not a 'spare parts room' (x-post /r/pettyrevenge),[deleted],talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1lt5sr/my_office_is_not_a_spare_parts_room_xpost/,"I originally posted this in /r/pettyrevenge as a way to make fun of all the revenge stories that aren't really revenge. I hadn't thought of posting it here until someone commented and suggested I do so.

Background:

I have a part time job as an IT intern. It's a fairly small business, so I am the entire IT department. My office is a closet that houses several switches and a cabinet filled with spare parts. The development team sits in a room close to my office. Their boss sits in the same room. Their boss is also my boss. Oftentimes, developers will come into my office without knocking in order to look for spare computer parts. This typically isn't an issue, since I only work 2 days a week. I use my personal laptop at work, so I take it home every day. I also brought in my own spare monitor from home so I could have two monitors. This monitor is identical to the ones set up at all the developer's workstations, except mine had a sticker on the back that said ""Property of bunny_kisses"".


The Story:

I walked into my office after having the 3 previous days off and noticed immediately that there was no monitor on my desk. I set up my laptop and got through some email before embarking on a mission to locate my monitor. I visited my friends over in the sales department, as their offices are located close to mine, so they were most likely to have witnessed something. My favorite Sales Guy confirmed that he saw several developers in and out of my office during my days off, most likely looking for parts.

I'm pretty confident now that one of the developers has taken my monitor, so I head over to their workspace, and ask if anyone took a monitor from my office. No one spoke up, so I said ""That's alright. It should be easy to find. There's a sticker on the back stating that it's my property."" Still, no one speaks up. I decide to go around and personally check the back of each and every monitor for my sticker. I reach the station of a new developer, and I notice he's looking a little nervous. There is very clearly residue from a sticker on the back of the monitor, along with pieces of the sticker, but none of the writing.

I look the developer right in the eyes and ask him ""Did you take peel the sticker off my monitor?"" He turns bright red and looks at the boss. The boss has a serious (frightening) look on his face The developer turned back to me and says ""I saw it in the spare parts room, so I took the sticker off and moved it over here. I'm sorry."" Then he began unplugging it so he could hand it over. The boss then made an announcement to the developers that my office is not a spare parts room, and they need to ask him to get parts for them from my office when I wasn't available.

TL;DR Monitor went missing so I roofied the entire company and went home early."

I understand so much now. 

I work in a male-dominated field and have for years, including experience with firefighters and construction workers, but I've never felt demeaned or disrespected as a woman until just now. At the beginning of the meeting I was sitting down and when I saw that he was talking to my tits, first I couldn't believe it, then I made a big point of putting my bag on the table in front of me so he'd have to look me in the eye. Then I stood up to leave because I thought the meeting was over and he went right back to talking to my chest. Not that it's relevant, but I was wearing a loosish, henleyish cotton knit top that was buttoned a good couple or three inches above my cleavage. I was so angry I couldn't pay attention to what he was saying. All I could think about was stabbing him or stomping the shit out of his head. When I left his office it took me a minute to regroup--I could not remember where the next office on my schedule was, although I had been there before. I've experienced sexual harassment before (in my first job, my boss came to my desk late on a Friday to ask personal questions that were none of his business, I blew him off and he soon redirected attention and choice assignments to younger, gigglier intern), but that didn't even get me this angry--I just wrote off that company as a place where I couldn't get ahead and found another job as soon as I could. After today, I completely understand how women give up on entire fields as a reaction to disrespect from male bosses and colleagues. Honestly, after this I understand on-the-job homicide (not literally, cool your jets).

So, AskWomen, have you experienced this, and what did you do? Normally I would ignore, but this got me. Partly I think what made me so angry was that he was being an asshole with his words as well as his eyes. The staring was just an extra-demeaning little touch. He wasn't just saying ""Fuck you"" (not his literal words), it was ""Fuck you, Tits."" There's not much I can do right now while he's in a position of authority, but I'm leaving this job in a few months and I have plenty of good references that don't depend on this scumbag. So I think I'll write him an email asking why he stared at my chest the whole time and telling him he's a sexual harassment lawsuit waiting to happen, then cc'ing his bosses, the highest-up of whom is female. It's not much, but it's the least I can do. "

Does anyone know of a cheaper or easier way to register for an internship credit class? Or can I go around the prereqs?

I know unpaid for-credit only internships are somewhat controversial, but I don’t need the credit, I have a steady income, and I graduated. I just need the internship experience for my resume."

If so, does anyone have any advice for learning to identify personal goals and maximizing the satisfaction from attaining them?  Additionally, does anyone else also feel they are an acutely passive person and have any advice on managing their life under such a condition?

Thanks.

---

I'm not sure if I'm framing this the best way, but I've noticed that I seem to possess no intrinsic agency.  I am perfectly capable of reacting to suggestions and tasks that are asked of me, but I can't think of anything I've endeavored for in my life that I set out to do for myself.

It may be a subtle distinction, but the best way I can describe the issue would be the difference between deciding and choosing.  A choice is something given to a passive entity, while a decision is made by an agentive entity.  I think I am capable of choosing from options when I am presented with them, though I don't always understand how I make them.  I don't think I'm capable of making decisions, though.

Functionally, I don't think this lack of agency has had a significant detrimental impact on me; I am reasonably functional in my daily activities.  I graduated with a Bachelor's degree a few years ago, I've held steady employment in an internship and more recently a full-time research assistantship, and I just returned to school for a Master's program.  However, I don't feel like the decisions to go to school or work were mine.  If you asked me, ""Why did you go to school?""  I would answer, ""Because my parents and to some extent my larger social structure expected me to.""  It wasn't a decision between going to school or work or not, it was a choice of which schools and jobs to apply for.  In fact, I imagine that being able to execute tasks and fulfill the expectations that are asked of me, without being distracted or interrupted by personal goals or desires, has, in some ways, probably made me a more valuable asset to my superiors.

That said, I can't identify any desires, personal goals, or motivations outside of possibly being motivated to learn about and practice skills related to the academic field of my graduate studies.  I'm uncertain if this is really a desire or not, though.  I could easily be convinced that this is just another form of fulfilling extrinsic expectations.  In fact, the sensation of spontaneous, self-generated desire seems so foreign to me that I'm not sure if I could detect it in myself.  That may relate more to my alexithymia than a lack of agency—though the two conditions may be related in some way.

For a child, this passivity never seemed an issue to me, and actually seems typical in retrospect.  Now that I am a largely autonomous adult, it seems abnormal.  The one way in which I've recently wondered if this passivity/lack of agency may be affecting me detrimentally is in my overall happiness and satisfaction with life.  I don't ever seem to find satisfaction in attaining goals that are given to me, and those seem to be the only kinds of goals that I have.  When I graduated from my alma mater, and when I matriculated in my current Master's program, I did not feel happy or satisfied.  Any satisfaction that I can truthfully say I derived from my undergraduate program were from what I learned in my courses, not from fulfilling degree requirements.

I have faced some tribulations in my life including a major depressive episode, and a bout with testicular cancer, but I have overcome both of those maladies, and I've been concentrating on this issue of not being able to find satisfaction that seems to coincide with accomplishing personal goals.  I guess in an abstract way, maybe I desire happiness, but I can't even tell if the goal, ""You should be happy"" is too, itself, a goal imposed by my parents and my therapist or other extrinsic entity.  Thus, I fear that personal satisfaction may be unattainable."

I'm very grateful for the internship, and even the (painfully) small stipend I receive for the work I do, because I don't have too much real world experience out of school, and I've actually been officially jobless since March, so this internship is a small blessing. The term of the internship is coming to a close, as I was only contracted for the months of July through the end of September, yet there is a TON of work that is left to be done. Various set backs out of both of our hands lead to this inevitability, but I'm not really worried about losing the work, it has all but been said that she would like to keep me around in some capacity to keep working.

Question: Like I mentioned above I'm not exactly swimming in real world experience, so my main concern is how I would negotiate my role with them post internship.  I don't really want just an extension of the internship, because that's not financially viable for me.  I'm also not too crazy sticking around as a freelance contractor because of it's lack of stability as a whole, the self employment taxes quite frankly scare me, and I... sorta have a baby one the way in October.  How would I negotiate to this marketing director, and eventually the owner of the entire company to hire me on as say a ""Marketing Assistant,"" without shooting myself in the foot and losing the work entirely?

EDIT: adding a **tl;dr:** Current internship is ending with work still left on the table, how do I negotiate new terms, ideally into a permanent role, without losing out on any work from them freelance or otherwise."

It does this through litigation, sustainable management practices, educating the public, and enforcing existing laws. In a nutshell, finding roadblocks so that the US Forest Service cannot condone logging these forests. Here is the website for all the info: www.sequoiaforestkeeper.org

I was one of the interns (I think you can guess which one I am based on my username) and did all the field work for SFK along with three other people. When we were not living in a house (which was rare: only to compile data and resupply), we backpacked in the Sierra Nevadas near our study sites. We focused our efforts in Sequoia National Forest and Giant Sequoia National Monument. The primary study of our work was to find optimal growing conditions of sequoias and whether or not logging has a significant impact on it. Another study was finding populations of pacific fishers, since they are listed as endangered in the state of California, and to see if logging also has a significant impact. This was done via camera traps checked on a weekly basis. Other side projects include studying mountain biking impacts on hiking trails near sequoias, and studying cattle grazing impacts on meadows.  

Based on our research, we found that sequoia saplings tend to grow clumped together and prefer shady conditions. Also, we did not find any pacific fishers, which may or may not have anything to do with recent logging activity.

I am getting an engineering degree from a college with a fairly high ranked program within the next one and a half years.  I expect to graduate with a decent, but not mindblowing GPA (3.3-3.5).  

My work experience will include one year of internships and one year working as an student assistant for an environmental lab (basically working as a test engineer).  At the second job, I've worked with companies from four different continents.  I've had to program, automate and build testing assemblies, correspond with customers, and have done some design work for fixtures in CATIA. 

I have a lot of tech experience along with my more traditional engineering background.  Along with engineering specific programs (Catia, PLC programming software, DAQ software, MATLAB), I've used R for statistical analysis, done a large amount of digital media work (started on Apple programs, but have switched to Windows variants), and have done programming in HTML/SSL, Javascript, C++, Ruby, VBA, MATLAB, and SQL.

* Kansas City, MO
* Chattanooga, TN
* Springfield, VT
* Omaha, NE
* Minneapolis, MN
* Seattle, WA
* Chicago, IL
* Austin, TX

I'm 27 and I've been working at a job I don't like for the last 2 years.  Was well paid but faked my way through the whole thing and my boss wasn't impressed with my progression after about a year.  I managed to do enough to get by and last month I got a different job in the same company, hoping that I would like it and feel motivated/less depressed.  NOPE!

I lasted 3 days and have a severe breakdown and have been off on medical leave since (1 week now).  I don't think I can go back, i have so much to learn before I can work on my own, it's high stress and fast pace and I have 0 interest in it. 

I have a degree but its in accounting and I quit that right after school (see a pattern yet?). I did a paid internship and was a huge disappointment.  Was even told once (I really don't know how you made it this far).  I do, I'm very well spoken and I do well in a classroom setting.  That's about it.  I have no work ethic and I'm pretty shy.  The thought of going in somewhere day after day and sitting there makes me immediately depressed and then come the panic attacks and pain issues.  The only reason I got my current job is because my dad worked there for 30 years and got me in.  Now, I've got nowhere to go and I'm too depressed to take some menial job.  I had really high expectations of myself and I already feel like a failure.  If I go become a janitor I might actually become suicidal. 

I've thought about going back to school but what's the point, I'm just going to be right back where I started after a few years.  What happened to me?  I hate myself and I feel worthless. My friends are all super successful and my wife is doing great in her career and I can't even go in to work anymore without going crazy.

I'm on Wellbutrin and cipralex now (just started).  I hope this starts working soon because I'm slinking further and further into the dark cave of depression.  And in case you can't tell, the negative thoughts have taken over and I'm losing the battle. 


I really don't even know what the light of the end of the tunnel looks like right now.  If I take a job ""beneath me"" (what a horribly entitled thing to say) I guarantee I will end up severely depressed.  If I go back to my current job ill be fired quickly for spending most of my time in the bathroom have panic attacks and will not be able to be trained.  If I quit and go back to school, Ill have the impossible task of figuring out what I want to do without doubting every single minute of my new education, feeling like I made a huge mistake and won't be able to perform this new job.

Short of winning the lottery, the only way I see this going is losing my house, wife leaving me (who would want to be with a fucking loser like me who has no dreams, no passions and can't work because he's too fragile), ending up on my parents couch ready to just say fuck it.  I wanted to type ""end it all"" there but I don't mean that...I'd rather become a gypsy traveller and die homeless.

I've failed at every job I've ever had, the only thing I've ever been OK at is school.  I thought about being a teacher but im probably too mentally unstable.  The kids might break me.  Let alone is probably have a panic attack with 30 eyes on me, knowing I can't go to the bathroom or escape. 

I'm seriously fucked.  Thank god for disability right now or id be broke right now too.  I seriously can't understand why my wife hasn't left me yet...all i do is drag her down.

Should apply into the regular school for the spring, knock out the pre-req's, then apply to the Business School for the Fall? Can you apply for the Business School on the premise that you will have the pre-req's by the end of Spring?

How are the classes/professors and the students who are in the programs? How helpful is the department with finding internships or jobs in the field? **or** just take them all at some community college and apply in the Fall? (I'm not too fond of the cc experience)

Should I live on campus/off campus? I'm not much of a party guy, but what do I miss out on or gain by living on/off campus at RU?

After extensive research on free time in my intrests (I.E: Cosmology, Philosiphy, ect) I have decided I would like my future career in Phychiatry, mainly because I have had a fascination with human mind, the salary is very well, and I seem like I have a natural talent at it, and my theories/skill with understanding how others think/feel would be very helpful in this field. I also would help some hurt people. I decided some Harvard collage experience would have me set for life! However, I am very confused on what batchlor degrees Harvard offers, their medical school criteria, and Phychiatry degrees. I would like to get a batchlor that gives me the best chances at getting into med school, a good medical school in Harvard so I become a certified Doctor, than finally get some experience in child/teen Phychiatry. This should take 12 or more years, preferably at Harvard. I'm asking for somebody to give me a plan on what exact degrees I should take, in order, to be a Phychiatrist. Tips, schollarship ideas, and internship recommendations greatly appreciated too. Please help me plan this out, so my goals are in check for Middle/High School, and than Harvard, a great Collage.

1lrjs9,9,2013-09-05,The Objective Statement on a Résumé Dilemma,potatoriot,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1lrjs9/the_objective_statement_on_a_résumé_dilemma/,"**The Objective Statement Dilemma** pops up with almost every single résumé critique thread that is posted and it's generally always about 50/50 with people approving or disapproving of the use of an Objective statement. So, I'd like to discuss this and get the real in-depth reasons out there on why a student should or should not use an objective statement.

***Disclaimer***: Cultural differences take place depending on region, please keep in mind that views may differ. Just remember that the opinions you state here should be considering a recruiting perspective on what recruiters and firms are looking for out of a resume and not solely your personal individual preference.

From my standpoint as a firm professional and my active involvement in the recruiting process, I agree that both sides have a valid argument, which is why I think everyone is so divided. From my observance, I think a lot of those who comment on it do not fully grasp the internal recruiting process firms go through year-round. Don't forget that firms are pre-identifying students all year long and recruiting does not take place just between August and October.

I find that there is definitely appropriate times and places to include an Objective Statement and there are times and places when it is not appropriate. People often make the common mistake in thinking that you should have just one specific resume. This could not be further from the truth as you should be developing a resume to the specific objective at hand. A resume you build to obtain scholarships should not look exactly like one that is meant for landing a job in public accounting. Same goes for the situation in how you are submitting your resume to a firm for said job.

***Important Points to Consider***

* If your resume is lacking enough content and you are completely unable to build it up further, adding an objective statement can enhance it without adding too much fluff.

* If you already have an Objective Statement and you are struggling for more room, you should consider removing it from the resume.

* If your resume is full as it is and adding an Objective Statement would cause it to extend to two pages or require you to remove other valuable information, it is probably best to just exclude it.

Now, let's tackle what an appropriate Objective Statement should look like before we determine whether we should use it. The Objective Statement should be concise and to the point with no unnecessary fluff. You are simply stating your objective as to why you are providing your resume.

&gt;***Objective Statement Template:***

&gt;&gt;**To obtain a** ""*position* (internship or full-time) and *field* (tax or audit)"" **with** *""Specific Firm Name""* **in the** *""City/Region""* **area starting** *""Date to start (Winter or Summer)""*

&gt;***Objective Statement Example:***

&gt;&gt;To obtain a tax internship with Potatoriot, LLC in the Greater Potato Area starting January 2014.

This example is to the point, is catered specifically to the firm to show that you are seriously interested in them, and tells them exactly what it is you're looking for. Now that we have an idea of what an appropriate objective statement might look like, let's discuss when it's appropriate or inappropriate to actually use it.

***When to use an Objective Statement:***
&gt;* **Large recruiting events where your resume is being physically handed to professionals.**

&gt;&gt;Big events like Meet the Firms, ""Mock"" Career Fairs, and the big ""Real"" Career Fair where firms are meeting with literally hundreds of students can be beneficial to include an objective statement to ensure that your resume clearly states what you are looking for when it is reviewed at a later time.

&gt;&gt;If you make a good impression, firm reps will remember you, but it gets difficult to distinguish resumes on paper and link faces to them. Generally, firms divide them into separate piles for Audit and Tax, but sometimes these can get mixed up. Also, it's difficult to remember if you're looking for an internship or full-time position, or a start date in the winter or summer. Firms all have different hiring needs based on the field and start date, so it is important that you are put into the correct category.

&gt;* **E-mailing a firm representative and attaching your resume**

&gt;&gt;This I think is more of a gray area and you can argue either way. However, while you think with this, ""Oh, I can just state what I'm looking for in the body of the e-mail"", you need to realize that unless you are directly e-mailing a recruiter in the HR department, this information can easily be lost in transfer. Firm professionals that aren't recruiters that receive follow-up e-mails from you end up forwarding the e-mail on to HR and often the body of the e-mail can be overlooked, especially if it's long. 

&gt;&gt;Attaching your resume to these follow-up e-mails and having an appropriate objective statement mentioning exactly what you're looking for ensures everyone is on the same page. Firm reps receive hundreds of these e-mails and they don't have time to follow-up with each one to make sure they know what your objective is if they are uncertain.

&gt;* **Handing your resume to an acquaintance to pass it along to someone you have not met**

&gt;&gt;If you are physically providing your resume to someone that will be handing it on to another firm rep or recruiter that you have not personally met, it's important to have the Objective Statement to ensure that this new person knows exactly what you are looking for and does not forget it.

***When NOT to use an Objective Statement:***

&gt;* **Applying online to a specific position with a firm**

&gt;&gt;If you are applying directly to a position, then the firm representatives already know everything that you would be including in an Objective Statement. At this point you are just being redundant and distracting from the rest of your resume.

&gt;* **Whenever you are including a Cover Letter**

&gt;&gt; The points in your Objective Statement should all be included in your Cover Letter, so as the point above you would be redundant to include one and distract the reader.

&gt;* **Small or specialized recruiting events**

&gt;&gt; If you are attending a small recruiting event or a specialized one where it will be very easy to remember you or it's clear that you are there for a specific position, then an Objective Statement is not necessary.

To reiterate, opinions may vary depending on region. An Objective Statement generally will not make or break you in the recruiting process, but it can be beneficial depending on the situations stated above in helping ensure recruiters are clear with your intentions. If you decide to include one, just be sure that it does not have fluff and concisely states what you are looking for. You do not want it to distract the reader from the rest of your resume.

Sorry I'm new to this. Anyway bit of my history. Left a pretty good job to pursue my graduate studies in a foreign country. Met a girl in the first month and fell hook, line and sinker. Anyway, I'm not a guy with a load of friends and being in a relationship, I didnt make too many new friends here either. Fast forward a couple of months and she breaks up with me in a manner I really would't like to discuss and thats when things started going downhill. I first sunk into a major bout of depression for about two months, not coming out of my room, not going out, basically just sitting and thinking. The next semester I took up a project to get my mind of things and it worked to a certain extent. I made a couple of new friends, but my mind has sort of lost it. I don't trust anyone anymore. Talking with people is a chore and all the time, my head doesn't stop talking. I am now at the end of my graduate studies and even though I have two internships here, both of them offered a job first and then declined, stating recession as a cause. I made the mistake of checking up on my ex and found she is globetrotting in a nice job and here I am talking to myself all the time, thinking, talking to myself. My head throbs all the time,except when I sleep, which is a relief. I am out of a job, have no close relationships and cannot afford to breakdown to my parents(even though they are very close) because they always dreamed of me graduating. 

I tried to talk to a doctor and was prescribed some pills, and the first time I took them, I felt a surge of happiness for the first time in months, for about 2 mins and the day just carried on without change later on. I tried it for two months and I realised there was no change and I stopped going to the doctor altogether.

I can't seem to do this anymore, I'm not suicidal, but I'd love a break.
Sorry about the rant.."

Where to begin.. My immediate family is on my ass about doing good in college and getting a stable career (i.e. Lawyer, doctor, etc). I honestly have NO idea on what I want to do! And to be completely honest.. and hey maybe im wrong or I just dont see it but.. I feel like im just going to college just to please my folks. Seriosly. My sister is pushing for me to succeed but its coming off as annoying. My bro tells me I should get an internship which I want to try out but I dont know where to start.

All my school career I strived to be a good student. Best I could do is get C's and B's. I got A's mind you, but in stuff like pe, music or art. 

I dont even know what the hell I want to do in life. Like I got no usefull skills that I can potentially bring to the table, I feel my family is breathing down my neck, and im just freaken lost. I mean I can get an internship but where would I even start?

I was living in La Jolla over the summer and it was really nice, but there didn't seem to be much going on.

I'm now in my third year of Software Engineering and I am one of the better developers in my class.  Around 15% of our class got a summer job.  I was in the 15%.  My job got extended to a part-time during the year because my boss was so happy with my work.

I'm so lucky that I have a brain that works so well with computers.  I'm so lucky that I was exposed to programming at a young age.  I'm so lucky that I love what I want to do for a career.

I was dealt an awesome hand in life, but now, 90% of my free time is used to smoke weed, watch shows, and play video games.  

My fucking goal in life was to never work for a single day.  Now, that I've gotten a job, it's to not work for a single day outside of internships.  That is still my goal.  I want to develop something big, something that will rake in a lot of money over a few years, so I can retire and not have to have any responsibilities for the rest of my life.  

I don't even know if this is normal.  Maybe everyone wants to do that, but they don't have a means.  I genuinely think it is possible for me to work hard for a year or two now, and rake in the big dollars.  Would everyone else strive for the same thing if they thought they had a chance?

I know that I want to high acuity care, but am open to other avenues, like research.  

My question is this:  How hard will it be to find a job outside of school city?  For example, I live and go to school in Memphis, but am open to relocating to the Carolinas, Colorado, or Texas.  

I know that these are all compact states, which may help, but I'm just feeling some anxiety about the job hunting process in general.  

Some background:  
This is my second bachelors.  I have a degree in psychology already and have a few years of social work experience under my belt.  
I have been tutoring A&amp;P, patho-physiology, and other subjects for the last three years.  I started my internship in the PACU at a local hospital in February and have been diligent about finding learning experiences while in the clinical setting.  

Overall, I feel very competitive.  My anxiety is coming from just not knowing much about how difficult it will be to find a job in a hospital that hasn't heard of the schools where I was educated.  

I know that I have developed a lot of social capital in the Memphis area.  It's just that I haven't looked for work in a place I didn't live.  I am hoping for any helpful pointers!  - Thanks for any input."

I was voted friendliest in my graduating class back in high school and have a wide circle of friends who support me while I (hopefully) support them.

I've held down a job at a local chain restaurant for more than four years. It's not the best but I've had a steady income since my senior year of high school. I'm in the process of paying off the loan for my own car. I have a wide variety of hobbies, I'm always trying to learn new things, I plan my future well in advance and believe I'm set up for success. 

My life is pretty goddamn good on the whole.

Well, I suppose I could have picked a different major. I mean, where's the challenge? Not that it isn't interesting, but...I see people majoring in engineering, nursing, and pharmacy. And I'm doing...sociology. Maybe I'm just taking the easy way out to say I got a degree. 

Sure, I'm a good writer. But there are plenty of others out there...I'm not THAT unique. Plenty of people can string words together, how special is that? I don't have any talents that set me apart from anyone else.

In fact, what do I REALLY do? I spend a few minutes every day playing my guitar, and I try to tell myself I can be a successful musician. But how can I be? Writing isn't a unique talent, plenty of people can write music. But I'm not good enough at guitar to make my own music, and I don't spend enough time trying because I'm unmotivated.

I play basketball for fun all the time. Like, ALL the time. How much better have I gotten in the last year, though? I'm still too scared to drive into the lane, I suck at defense, I can barely dribble, and I can't pass. Nobody wants me on their team unless they're awful and want someone to shoot for them every possession.

Selfishness. There's something I'm great at. My girlfriend is great to me, and I sit and sulk all the time when she isn't constantly fawning over me. I'm pitiful. Can't even be grateful for what she's done for me; I just poke at the negatives in my mind. She notices, too. How long can that go on before she gets sick of it? She has so many better options walking around campus every day. I don't deserve to be in a room with her, let alone a relationship. 

I have no muscle- I'm just doughy. 165 pounds of bone, skin, and fat from a high metabolism and not enough activity. Sure, I play basketball a lot. And run when my allergies don't fuck me up. And do my best to eat all the right things. But I don't have the willpower to stick with them, and give up time and time again. There's going to come a day when I'm fat and out of shape and too fucking lazy to change anything.

How the hell can I achieve any of my goals without any motivation? I know what I want to do, but I won't do it. I just tell everyone I will so I sound important in front of them, then go home and find a way to avoid stepping out of my comfort zone. I won't follow up on anything.

This is how I think. I CAN'T keep my motivation to my own health. I WON'T get the job I want. I DON'T deserve to be with my girlfriend. I have no fucking confidence- in my mind I'm overweight, weak (mentally and physically), unintelligent, untalented, and lazy. I know I'm not actually any of these things, but I've spent years convincing myself otherwise. I talk myself out of doing things, saying things, BEING things. Just to prove to myself that I'm right. That I can't, won't, and don't. 

I don't write this seeking sympathy, pity, or a ""eureka!"" post to cure whatever mental disease I've contracted between my ears. I want a physical manifestation of my struggle, so I can look at it and read it and understand it. Force myself to, even though I don't want to. And so I can tell someone and let others hear what my problem is, because I CAN'T tell anyone in person. I WON'T do it. Even though I should."

________________________________________________________

It was the closing half of the 2000s, and I was in my junior year of college.  A hopeless romantic and nerdy engineering major, I felt that my years of youth were coming to a close.  Things couldn't have been better though.  I was getting excellent grades  and I had an internship lined up for the summer, which meant I could start doing meaningful, interesting work.  I couldn't wait to quit my summer job as a cashier at the local pharmacy.   Making minimum wage after 4 years of service can really take its toll on your ability to care about hanging sale signs and stocking shelves.   Honestly, it was the worst job I've ever had.  So, why did I stay for so long?  
She was 3 years younger than me.   My cousin, a petite girl, with slender legs and a smile that would brighten your worst day.  Eve worked as a technician in the pharmacy and I worked in the front of the store.  Her father, my uncle, landed both of us the job.  
Eve and I have always had a close relationship and I frequently fantasized about her, but never would have had the guts to say anything.  I always had a suspicion that she liked me though.  We would always tease each other.  Play stupid little pranks like placing the card board cutouts of famous movie stars or singers into the bathrooms to scare unsuspecting customers when they walked in and the motion-sensing lights turned on.  High-school stuff really.
Things were pretty great between us, except for one thing.  Eve had a boyfriend.   It seems to always be the case that when you want something there is always an obstacle in place to prevent you from getting what you want.   The mere inability to get what you want makes you want it even more.   Part of me realized that as cousins the likely-hood of anything happing was remote, and in fact trying to do anything about the situation may cause some serious damage to my reputation and hers.  So I felt it best to move on to other opportunities.
Terri, one of my close co-workers, was a few years older than me.   A tall blonde woman with glacial blue eyes, a tight physique, and an ass that redefines the term.  I definitely had a crush on her, but knew she didn't really have much interest in me beyond our good times at the bar.  We went to the bar frequently and as usual one night after work we decided to wash away our troubles.  Terri had made it a habit to invite Eve out with us, but since Eve wasn't able to legally drink yet she almost always declined, however this time we were able to persuade her to come out.  Peer pressure is a bitch.  
The night started out pretty benign. We started kicking back a few beers and talking about  how much we hate our jobs, the typical jibber-jabber you would expect at a bar.   At this stage of life,  newly 21, I wasn't a very experienced drinker so it didn't take a whole lot to get a buzz on.  Terri however,  was an experienced socialite who had a special plan for this evening.  
I remember getting up to go to the bathroom.  When I came back there was a shot of Jack waiting for me.  ""To the shit we have to deal with day in and day out"", she said.  We tipped our shots back and clacked them back down on the table.  This was the first shot I had ever had.  I recall the warmth of liquor as it ran throughout my chest and down into my stomach.  Eve sat there and sipped on her cola and munched on some fries.  She seemed to enjoy how loopy I was starting to get.  ""Do another!"", eve said.  I ordered another round for Terri and I and we quickly drank them.   If you are not an experienced  drinker you should know there comes a point where the blood to alcohol ratio becomes so high as to remove one's inhibition completely.   
I began to notice my Eve again this night.  She was wearing our standard work uniform but even in that she had a radiance that compelled me to stare at her.  She was thoroughly enjoying our slurred words and brazen disregard for etiquette.    ""Lets do something crazy!"", Terri said while looking at Eve.  She asked Eve if she had ever kissed a girl.  Eve, being totally sober, blushed immediately.  I laughed hysterically.  To my surprise, and delight I might add,  Eve answered by saying she had never kissed a girl but was always curious.  My higher centers immediately shifted power to the lower brain.
She switched sides of the booth to be close to Terri.  I watched in anticipation as their lips drew close together.  I could feel a surge of blood rushing to my groin and the faint pulse of my penis beginning to rise.  Their lips locked.  Terri, opened her mouth and pressed her tongue against Eve's lips, begging for entry.  Eve obliged.  The kiss only lasted a few moments but it felt like a blissful lifetime to me.  As they withdrew Terri looked over at me, surely noticing my intense, awkward gaze.  She smiled; a deviant smile with head tilted low and slight curl on left side of her lips.  She eased back into the booth.  As she did so, I could feel something moving up my leg.  It was her foot inching closer and closer until it founds its mark.  This was the first time anyone had ever touched my groin.  It was a good thing I was drunk, otherwise I would have freaked out.  Her toes slowly rubbed along my penis.  Eve watched, fascinated by what was going on.  She bit her lower lip at the site of me giving out an exhale of pleasure.
It was all a tease of course.  Terri withdrew and quickly changed the subject.  Laughing the whole time at how in-experienced and how ""innocent"" I was.  Eve got up to go to the bathroom and Terri and I just chatted.   When Eve got back I tried my best to steer the conversation back to their kiss but to no avail.  ""HEY GUYS!""   Rather startled at the random voice I withdrew and turned to see what was going on.  Terri's boyfriend had arrived and decided to join us.   
The night was approaching a close and the bartenders had been making last calls.  I was too drunk at this point to safely drive home so I asked Eve if she would be able to take me.  She agreed that it would be safer for everyone if I didn't even look at a car.  We had a chance to talk some during the ride home, mostly reminiscing of the nights events.  I couldn't help but bring up their kiss.  I remember Eve turning bright red.  I told her that it turned me on (sort of in a joking way, to ... feel the mood).   She laughed and smiled at me.  She then told me that she was turned on by watching Terri feel me up under the table, but what was interesting was that she was dead serious about it.  I could feel the sexual tension beginning to build.  She glanced over at me with a smirk that might as well have been a neon sign pointing directly at her pussy.  We arrived at my house.  The tension still high I wasn't really sure how to end the evening, so simply stated that I had fun hanging out with her.  She smiled, leaned over, and gave me a kiss on the cheek and wished me a good night.

On top of that she calls me arrogant because I knew more about the transfer process to the Haas School than she did and proceeded to tell her all the details (from ancedotal evidence) and statistics (posted by Cal) that I knew.

1lr9fp,2,2013-09-04,Struggling with the real-world (even though I have a well paying job)... post-college struggle,Xx_Squall_xX,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1lr9fp/struggling_with_the_realworld_even_though_i_have/,"So this is the first time it's been September and I haven't been in an academic setting for about 17 years.  Needless to say, my mind is pretty confused.  I've got a good job at a large company, I live in a stable community, and I have abundant resources to support myself (some people I realize would be happy to have these things alone. . . but bear with me).   

I'm no stranger to working a job, I've had a job of some sort or another since I was 13.  Shoveling snow, mowing lawns, detassling corn, fast food joints, tutoring, etc.  This job however, my ""real"" job, seems to be the most difficult to cope with.  I started in early June, and have given it what I consider a fair amount of time to make a judgement.  I guess some of my problem lies within the job itself, which isn't very satisfying personally.  Similarly, I feel as though there is a negative mood with most of my fellow workers, which doesn't really help.

In college I wasn't a frat boy by any means.  I did enjoy myself on occasion, but I considered a night at home with friends to be just as fun as a night out partying.  I think a large part of my issue lies within the fact that I MISS MY FRIENDS.  I no longer have access to the abundance of people I know, like, and are my age.  I no longer am in an environment that's tailored to fit a young student adult (walkable convenient locations to everyday needs).  I took summer courses every year so I spent 4 years straight at the last place I lived (most college students go home or get internships during the summer)... so the city really grew on me and I really consider it my home.  Also, the city I'm in now isn't very glamorous.  It happens to often be featured on ""Worst cities in US"".  Not necessarily dangerous, but it's not very pretty by any means here.  Lots of neglect.  

Also I'm struggling to find things that I like to do.  The things I used to like doing are quickly becoming meaningless.  I could really use a hobby, and am currently seeking out new ideas.  I tried hanging out with coworkers, but am struggling to find any common grounds with them.  It seems like a lot of people at this company were farmed from local colleges, and I find it surprising that I was picked from out of state.  To me, it shows that this company is entirely okay with getting 2nd tier talent.... which is a huge concern.  I don't want to be pretentious, but I typically hung out with students in the top 25% of the class.  I'm attracted to and easily make friends with those who take their lives seriously.  My coworkers aren't necessarily that caliber of individuals, and the friend making process is more difficult as a result.  (don't get me wrong, they are wonderful people... just not those I would easily befriend).

I'm in a pretty serious relationship that started in college and is currently in good standing but long distance.  There are plans to have her move to me within the next 6 months.  I really like the city she's currently in, but I don't want to be with my company for less than a year (and ideally, I'd stay with them longer), thus I can't just pack up and head there.  

So, to sum it up:  I'm unhappy with my new job despite making decent money, I'm lonely and miss my friends, I miss the academic environment,  I struggle to find things to do in my freetime, and I'm involved in a long distance relationship.  I guess I'm just really uncomfortable with where I'm at, and there is always an underlying level of restlessness within me that keeps me from being happy or even content with my present status in life. 

I know how important it is to be happy for what you have, but I'm the type of person that is happier when he has more.  I have an ambition to do more with my life than just get by making decent money.  

If you've managed to read this far, I'd like to thank you for listening to my rant, and I welcome any input you have on the situation.  

Thanks for letting me get this off my chest reddit!"

I'm currently a Physics and Information Science major with a bunch of minors at UALR. I was set to graduate a year early this fall with just my InfoSci degree, but I realized I'd rather not just be a desk jockey the rest of my life.

 I'm a huge computer nerd in the process of building my third right now. Yay for scholarship refunds! I'm also a very avid reader, well I was when I have free time. My favorite series is, without a doubt, ASOIAF. I'm a huge fan of the show as well. Other shows I've watched/am keeping up with are Parks and Rec, Doctor Who(Tennant e'eryday), HIMYM, The Walking Dead, The League, Breaking Bad, Archer, South Park, Big Bang Theory, and Scandal. I listen to pretty much any kind of music except screamo, sorry but I like to listen to words, not angrily decipher them. 

I'm not a huge outdoor person, but I grew up in SE Arkansas so I was raised outside. I like the occasional hike and whatnot. I also just ordered a nice telescope for my astronomy class and would like to find a place to go camping and star gaze a couple of times before it gets too cold. And assuming I get this internship I'm interviewing for next Tuesday, I'll be getting a bike so I can ride around more.

I'd like for who ever I take to at least be in college or graduated. I'm definitely not an expert on a whole lot, but I do know a lot of random tidbits of information, so if you bring something up I can probably hold a conversation about it, assuming it's not makeup or fashion related.

If you hate Lord of the Rings, and don't feel like reading 1,000 words, here's the gist of what I'm posting: What can I do to better my chances at breaking into Finance with a low GPA?

**Speak 'Finance' and Enter**.

I can't see myself doing anything other than Finance. I'm going to relay some information in the hope that someone may have some words of wisdom or may be able to advise the best course of action, given my situation.  

If you decide to read this, thank you.

**Mistake #1... ~~and #2~~:** I applied to The University of Virginia last year. *Wait, why is that a mistake?*. Well it wouldn't have been, had I applied to the highly regarded McIntre School of Commerce. I had a pretty good chance too, based on their incoming averages for applicants and my extracurriculars. But I didn't apply to McIntre, and that's where Mistake 2 comes in. I made the decision based on somebody else. *Who?* My current girlfriend and highschool sweetheart of 4.5 years. *You idiot*. Yes, yes, let me hear the ""Never bring your highschool girlfriend to college, it doesn't work"" spiel for the 1,000th time. Or the preferred, ""You should never make a life decision based on someone else."" While I agree with that, my girlfriend and I have a stellar relationship and I'm about to ask her to marry me, so it wasn't necessarily a mistake after all—moreso a solicited wrench, thrust into my works.  

*So wait, why didn't you apply to McIntre again?* Well I wanted to be with my girlfriend. If I had applied and not gotten accepted, I would've had to have waited another year—a year that I now wish I had—to reapply.  
*Why not apply to both?* That would have been great... if they allowed it. They don't. So I couldn't. Thus, the predicament.

**""The Hiccup""**: With all the stress that comes with trying to appease a girlfriend, weighing my options, and hoping I would be accepted to *either* school (the College of A&amp;S or McIntre), my dam began to creak. I applied to the University in March, and around that time, the river was released. What followed was a year of unending physiological agony in the form of severe hypochondria. To put it shortly, I visited the hospital nearly every week in August, and probably around a total of ten or so times over the course of three months. I've been to the doctor's office more times than I can count, and generally, I had a pretty terrible time upon arrival to U.Va (I forgot to mention: I got accepted). I still have nerve issues like muscle spasms and twitching limbs, and couldn't eat right for half of that year.

So from that March (2012) to this March/April (2013), I struggled. After many hours of therapy, tens of pounds of weight lifted, and hundreds of down and up dogs in Yoga class, I started mending. I still have small relapses and struggle with it, but I have  a level head at this point, and can't claim it to be impeding my ability to do well anymore (in all honesty, I could before).

*I bet your GPA suffered during all of that*. You're damn right. Not only did I have to acclimate myself to the difficulty of one of the best public schools in the country, I had to acclimate myself to the perpetual thought of death at any moment. As you can imagine, it was hard to concentrate on my classes. It was hard to concentrate on anything other than the aneurysm forming in my brain, or my heart stopping, or sometimes both.

**Where I stand now:** So I'm a fourth year now, at the University of Virginia, standing on nothing short of an abysmal 2.2 GPA. I'm currently a declared Statistics major, and I'm set to double major in Economics and Statistics, and hopefully graduate in May of next year (2014). I may end up having to walk in May, and take an extra class or two in the summer to fully complete my degree. (I have to retake several classes).

**The Plan (""Get the Ring to Mordor"")**: If I do stellar these next two semesters, I can get my GPA up to the high 2's. It's pretty much impossible at this point to break 3.0. Realistically, I'll probably bring it up to around a 2.6 or 2.7.

If someone told you they wanted to go into Finance with a 2.6, you would laugh. *One does not simply get into high Finance with a 2.6*. Well I'm going to do it, dammit:  

I'm a strong test taker, and I think I can smash the GMAT.  
I'm also planning on taking the first CFA exam. *What is that going to get you?* I don't know, man! I'm trying everything!  
 I'm also planning on finishing up Spanish and French, of which I'm already conversational in.   
I think I'm competent at writing a decent essay.   
I have extensive computer skills (I build computers in my free time), and programming experience (I plan on acquiring more experience).  
 I've been told by numerous people that I'm pretty charismatic, and I've always had an easy time networking (I buddied up with the former VP at my Community College and got a recommendation for my UVa application.)   
I have a really arbitrary ""Banking"" (Teller) internship at a Credit Union (it's something right?).   
And I have a strong track record prior to U.Va.   
I think if I can demonstrate that this past third year was a fluke in performance by doing really well my last year, and showing my first two years and my last year, and explain the health problems in between, I might be able to scoot around the elephant that is my GPA.  
&lt;s&gt;I'm also pretty cool and play guitar, piano, and write fiction in my spare time.&lt;/sarcasm&gt;  

**Calling All Sams:** If none of you have watched Lord of the Rings, these analogies are really going to confuse things. I'm reaching out to all of you Sams... I need someone to carry me to the top of Mount Doom. I need some advice. I need some support. I need help. I have to do this. I am willing to do whatever it takes.   
What can I possibly do to appear a stronger candidate for the field of Finance, and for a decently ranked graduate business school?

**'And he lives happily ever after, till the end of his days.'  
TL;DR: I need a sword, a bow, and an axe to help me get to Mt. Doom. Any takers?**

It's my senior year of high school. I just came back from my internship in San Fran this summer, I have 2 AP courses, I'm a TA, an school internship, college applications and a job as a junior web dev in which I get to work from home. 

I'm finding it incredibly hard to be motivated through all of this. I know it might sound like I have ""senioritis"" but the truth is I don't even know. Trying to juggle everything has left me incredibly unmotivated. Instead of thinking about the good things that come out of something, all I can do is think about the bad. What if I don't get into this college? What if I fail this test I have tomorrow? 

Everytime I feel like giving up, I hear my mom's voice and I hear her say ""Make me proud"". My mom gave me everything. She made me into the person I am today. Up until now, it's been all the motivation I've needed but it's getting harder to stay on task. I only think about the negatives. I know before I succeed I must fail. After numerous failures and I succeed will I know what success truly is. 

Lately, I've just been having a ""fuck it, I don't care"" attitude towards things. Homework is due tomorrow? Fuck it. I don't care and I won't do it. I don't like being unmotivated and not productive at all. The rush and feeling I get from being productive and motivated is something I want to feel everyday. 

I was just wondering if someone can help me out. If there's a way I can stay on point and not fuck up. 

**TL;DR I'm slowly becoming unmotivated and I hate it. I'm looking to do something about it so I can stay motivated and finish things through.**"

Year 1, Month 1:

Approximate Year - 2004

I had been working at AtomicEnergyInc as an intern for a few months, in the Major Components Design and Analysis group.  Sounds important huh?  Well it wasn’t.  I honestly found that the work that I was doing was the least gratifying work that I had ever done.  My job as a lowly intern… do simple trigonometry to calculate weld throat sizes, for structural weld overlay applied to nozzles and piping within Nuclear Power Plants.  My purpose, my modus opporandi; to confirm that a stack of drawings about 3-inches thick, printed on 11 x 17 inch paper were technically correct.  After doing this for 3 days, the thought of waking up with a shotgun barrel in my mouth, and my big toe on the trigger seemed less painful.  But I was making good money, damn good money for a little shit still in college.

I don’t know about you but my mind needs to be challenged.  Given that I was between my junior and my first senior year of college (1) pursuing a degree in mechanical engineering, my mind was prepped and overflowing with ideas and academic knowledge ready for an opportunity to implement it.  That summer I didn’t get that challenge.  That summer I got handed a bullshit assignment that a monkey with 2 months of proper training could perform, hell even exceed at.  Well I made it through my 3 inch stack of paper in 1 week, only to find out that the 3 inch stack of paper was the only assignment they had come up with me for the entire summer…  my immediate thought; “fuck.”

It didn’t take me long to find things to do to keep myself busy and occupied.  Thanks to the lax internet security at the time, I could browse YouTube, listen to streaming music, piss around on Facebook, you name it.  Well guess what…  when you have infinite free time, and you can’t look at porn, you can browse through all the internet has to offer VERY quickly.  Well eventually big-brother caught on to what myself, and undoubtedly several others were doing and beefed up the internet security software.  Try going to YouTube; “cannot open application – Streaming/Online content”.  Try going to Pandora or Groove Shark, and the exact same message.  Try going to Facebook, by the grace of God big brother forgot to block Facebook.  Probably because those fuckers were goofing around on that website more than I was.  Needless to say, Facebook quickly became a crutch that I relied heavily on as it connected me from Zombieland (aka work) to the real world.
Let’s just say my “friends” quickly got annoyed with my constant messaging on Facebook, and I found myself to be alone and unable to really talk to anyone who wasn’t, in my head as an immature summer intern, a complete fucking tool.  

So here is my situation, I have 2.5 months of internship left, I have completed my entire summer assignment in 1 week, I have no friends that I can bullshit with throughout the day to help me pass time, I can’t look at porn on a work computer, and I have already explored all that the internet has to offer (that isn’t porn) while being at work…  When coming to this realization, guess what my immediate thought was…  
If you guessed “fuck” you are wrong.  My immediate thought was, “well it’s time to go exploring.” 
That day I found myself in the cafeteria.  I had one of two options.  Option 1 – eat my lunch alone like I typically did (2), because I couldn’t stand a single person who worked in this company.  OR Option 2 – find someone to eat with and strike up a random conversation.  
That day I felt overly-motivated, and for the first time in a long time chose Option 2.  So I walked around, and started scouting.  

At one table I saw several engineers I was currently going to college with at the University of Pittsburgh, practically jerking each other off in public (3).  I mumbled something audible enough for them to hear along the lines of “I can’t fucking stand you nerds,” and kept my search going.  I know they heard me.    
I came by another table of several interns who I vividly remember still to this day proclaiming at the intern orientation “I went to Penn State, I am soooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much smarter than you Pitt Engineers… this is my 4th internship here… I love it here… I am such a fucking douche,  etc. etc. etc.”  I’m pretty sure that is a verbatim quote right there.  There were a few moderately attractive women at this table, which made it enticing.  But these nerdlingers (4) get as possessive of any women that shows them attention as a mother Black Bear does to her newborn baby cubs.  Needless to say I didn’t feel like stomping the dicks in of a few nerds, I mean that figuratively by the way, that day so the search continued.  I did mouth the words “fuck you” to the head nerdlinger at the table and kept on walking.  It’s funny to see how nerds react to confrontation like this, he didn’t know what to do.

I finally came across what ended up being the table that I would sit at.  It was a moderately attractive young female, who either could be a very recent new hire or summer intern.  I sat down at the table and said “Hi, my name is Dave… I can’t fucking stand all these nerds that are around me.” Upon saying this, every elderly woman that was in the vicinity looked at me like I just farted in church.  I continued, “You don’t strike me as being a nerd.  Can I sit with you?”  She laughed and responded, “Sure thing dude.  My name is Sarah, and I can assure you that I am not a nerd.” 

Well Sarah turned out to be an incredible chic.  Somehow, probably by divine intervention, God steered me away from a potentially hilarious situation pounding the snot out of nerds, and saw fit to deliver me to the attractive, hippy (5), pot-smoking (6), great sense of humor, woman named Sarah.
Sarah and I had a great lunch.  Hell I don’t even think I ate my crappy lunch.  We talked and talked and talked and talked.  We got on the topic of how I had just got my heart broken from a girl that I had been dating in college.  

With how good our conversation was going, I felt comfortable enough being around this girl that I told her flat out, “man, I need to get fucking laid.”  At this point empirical evidence would dictate that 99% of women would have thrown a drink in my face, slapped me in the face, or said something like “GASP! I am so utterly offended by that comment.” 

How did Sarah react? “Yeah dude, sounds like you need some pussy.”  I was completely dumbfounded… never-before had I met a chic this cool.  What she lacked in super-model looks, her personality made her absolutely gorgeous in my mind.  I needed to know if she was available, I needed to know if I could have her in a biblical way… IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN… After some more conversation it became immediately clear that she had a boyfriend.  But I wasn’t pressing the issue to get together with her, and hook up or anything along those lines.  Let’s say that though I was young, dumb, and full of cum… I still had a semblance of morals.  
Well I made the mistake of asking her, more so for a shock reaction, “do you have any loose friends that are DTF?” (7), not expecting anything other than a nervous laughter in return.  But the surprises kept on coming…  Sarah said, “yeah actually, I have a friend named Kara.”

And that kids… is how I met your mother.

--END CHAPTER 1--

Chapter 1 Footnotes:

1.	It took me 5.5 years to graduate with a Bachelors of Science.

2.	Probably looking like a total psychopath doing so.

3.	This is my way of saying they were being overly obnoxious nerds that I would love to give the high-school bully treatment to.  And given the recent negative public perception on bullying I want to clarify that when I say that I mean, pick them up by their ankles and flush their heads in the toilet, as this is appropriate treatment for fucking nerds.

4.	Thank you Justin for coining that term back in college.

5.	I fucking hate hippies, but they are less hated than nerds.


6.	I know this comes with the territory of being a hippy.

7.	Note to readers; DTF means down to fuck.

1lr5w4,6,2013-09-04,Need some advice on whether to buy or rent a house,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1lr5w4/need_some_advice_on_whether_to_buy_or_rent_a_house/,"I will try to keep this as short and concise as possible. I recently graduated college, May of this year. Throughout college, since 2010, I have worked on and off as a supplemental employee and intern at a large company. After graduating I started a full time job with this same company in June and make $64k a year before tax. This is the only company I have worked for since 2010. My debt is minimal, I have been paying on my student loans since I started college, and starting in November I will be paying my full monthly loan payment of $550. I have two credit cards which I pay off in full each month, they have a combined minimum payment of $40 a month. Because I have been paying on my loans and credit cards for the past 4 years, I have a high credit score of ~720. 

I would prefer to buy a house but I am not sure it will be possible. Since graduating I have been living with my parents to save money to buy a house. Because of this I have $10k currently saved, and am saving an average of $2,500 a month. I am familiar with the area I want to buy in (lived here my whole life), and am looking to buy a house somewhere within the $80k - $120k range. I have no plans of moving within the next 5+ years. I'm sure I would be an excellent candidate for a mortgage someday, buttt a wrench has been throw in my plan. My original plan was to stay with my parents until I had enough saved for a 20% down payment, closing costs, and extra for ""just in case"". Now, my boyfriend is planning to move the city I'm in in February of 2014, and I'm not sure I will be able to afford a house a by then. I definitely wouldn't be able to have a 20% down payment, but I could have 10%. PMI would only be about $35 a month for me, so I'm not overly concerned with having to pay that for a while until I have 20% equity on the home. If I keep saving like I am I will have $20k by the end of January 2014. My boyfriend does not have savings to add. A monthly mortgage payment would land probably around the $450 - $600 mark for me if I were to buy.

I have looked into renting a home, but it is undesirable to me. At this point it may be our only option. However, renting a home would easily cost us $1,000 - $1,200 a month. If we were to rent, this means that I would only be saving maybe $1,000 a month, thus making it much harder and considerably longer to save for a home. My boyfriend is still in school and does not have an income comparable to mine, so I am factoring in only my income here. 

I guess what it really comes down to is, can I reasonable buy a home or would it be wise of me to rent? Can I even get a mortgage? Or hell, even afford to buy a home?"

Anyone have any tips on the process? I've been sending off my resumes to companies on career builder, my school's career site,  indeed.com, etc, but I feel as if my resume is going to get lost in the big pile of resumes that companies receive each day.

Butler America e-mailed me two minutes right after I applied, which seems fishy in itself, plus the fact that the company website is giving off vague descriptions on what they do. The contents of the e-mail are that it's a 6 month plus contract position, 18.50/hr, and that ""the client"" is not paying for relocation expenses. I'm just looking for advice on what I should do. Thanks."

1lr4p3,2,2013-09-04,[22/F] Need to confront roommate (23/m) about rent in a delicate situation,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1lr4p3/22f_need_to_confront_roommate_23m_about_rent_in_a/,"I live with my boyfriend and a roommate at school and we have a year long lease. It began in May. Over the summer my roommate went home, I went on an internship across the state, and my boyfriend stayed at the house. We all agreed to continue paying our share of the rent each month even though my boyfriend was the only one there. 

We are required to send one check to the landlord, and the lease does not specify how much each person has to pay. If one person doesn't pay, the others have to cover their share. Our roommate was difficult to get in contact with all summer and never paid his share of the rent. My boyfriend and I have covered him thinking, 'He'll be back in the fall and we'll get it from him then'. He also left a bunch of stuff in his room that he didn't need over the summer (Bed, skis, kitchen stuff, school books, etc.) 

The semester started this week and he never showed up. He texted my boyfriend and it turns out his dad had heart surgery over the summer and he's had to pick up the slack at home and at their (4) family businesses. He isn't coming back this semester so that he can help his family while his dad recovers. 

I'm really sympathetic for him, but I'm also a bit frustrated. He owes me and my boyfriend $1600 for rent so far, and I can't afford to cover his rent anymore. He lives 5 hours from my school, so I can't drive to his house and talk to him. 

I'm also worried he won't come back next semester, because he has a handful of classes left before graduation and I'm pretty sure his classes next semester would require first taking classes only offered this semester. I think he's going to take the whole year off, in which case it will be impossible to confront him in person about rent. Normally he's really easy to get ahold of, but it's been impossible to contact him since he told us he isn't coming this semester. 

I know he's stressed out over his family, so how do I ask him to pay rent while also letting him know I'm sympathetic about his situation? Or would asking him be too insensitive, and should I just not bother him right now?

**TL;DR** My roommate is dealing with a family situation and owes me a few months of rent (and will owe me money in the next few months). How do I ask him for money without sounding like an ass?"

I rated it as a Buy because

Financials: Look good, revenues up 53% from 2Q last year.
Costs down 35% from 2Q, Margin 31% as compared to -63%, net income 333 M compared to -157 M

They have finally started to make money off of mobile, mobile sector accounts for 41% of revenue

Many hedge funds such as Stifel, Valiant, Matrix, have been upgrading/loading it recently

Insiders continue to hold a large portion of the company

Surpassed 1 mil active users in last quarter

PE slightly below average in PE group

Growth in adjusted EPS, Sales, and Net Income stronger than comps

Today RSI was at 54.2, and Macd was positive

Subjectively they have a high potential for growth as they find new ways to monetize their users.

1lr13m,0,2013-09-04,I cheated on my high school boyfriend and lost my virginity to a college senior,throwawayacct96,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1lr13m/i_cheated_on_my_high_school_boyfriend_and_lost_my/,"Sorry this turned out to be so long. I am a high school senior, and I have been with my bf since April. he is my first love and i can see myself being with him for the rest ofmy life. Let's call him ""Jake."" We are both straight A students, kinda nerdy but still social, and we were planning to lose our virginities to each other before we went off to college, and probably within the next few months. Except I screwed that up. Here is the story:

My dad is a professor at a large state university. This summer, every friday (when i wasn't at my internship) my dad would take me with him to campus so I could use one of the campus library for studying since I am trying to get a head start on one of the AP exams. Back in July, a guy approached me while I was waiting for my coffee at the library cafe. He was very attractive (tall and built) so I followed my instincts and flirted back. I knew he was obviously a college student and he assumed I was also in college, and because I was so flattered I played along. This was fairly easy to do, because I had spent a great deal of time on campus already and it was easy for me to name my freshmen dorm, etc.  We chatted for a couple of minutes and then I went back to my study spot, which was relatively secluded. I honestly though I would probably never see him again so I didn't see the harm in the white lies I had told him. 

 But then the following week, when I arrived I chose a study spot in a more open area. I don't know if I just wanted to change of scenery or if my subconscious was hoping i would run into this hot college senior again, even if i didn't perceive a great chance of it happening again. I didn't even know his name at this point. Well thanks to my luck, in a couple of hours, he showed up. He just walked up to my table, sat down across from me, and said something like ""Hey it's me, how's it going?"" We chatted again and I kept pretending I was college sophomore.  That day I was taking a practice exam on my laptop and just had a big biology textbook with me, so he didn't see my AP book. He didn't stay very long, but before he left he gave me his name and we exchanged numbers. 

Later that day he texted me inviting me to a house party at his place off campus. Coincidentally, Jake was away on vacation with his family during this time. I wasn't seriously thinking of going at first, but then I told the story to my friend ""Jessie."" She convinced me that I should stop being such a good two shoes all the time, and that we should go, and she could take us because she had a car. I lied to my parents and said we were just going to the movies and then I would probably sleep over at Jessie’s place. On our way over, we created totally fake identifies for ourselves. We kept out real first names but came up with where we were from, what we were majoring in, where on campus we were living that year, etc, etc. The party was a lot larger than I expected (maybe 30-40 people? it was a big house) and there was plenty of alcohol. I only had a few beers and just got buzzed, while Jessie drank way more until she was fairly drunk (but not black our drunk) since I said I would drive back that night. Jessie was playing flip cup with a bunch of people when I wandered into the kitchen to get water and started talked to “Mike”. He was even flirtier than before and very touchy. I knew it was wrong but him touching me started to turn me on so I went along with it. After a while he led me up to his room and we made out for a bit. He tried to take it further, but I freaked out, and said I had to go check on my friend. I found Jessie and we left after 10 minutes. She had no idea what had happened and I didn’t tell her. I considered calling Jake to confess at this point but decided not to because I figured it was a one time thing and I didn’t want to hurt him and wanted to just forget about it. 

A week later, Mike finds me at the library again) and comes up to and casually said something like “It wasn’t nice what you did to me last time. I don’t like rude girls. You’re going to have to make it up to me. See ya soon.” And walks away. I was floored. I felt somewhat nervous but also very excited by the idea that he wanted to see me again. Long story short, I ended up going to another one of his house parties that weekend and we hooked up again. We were kissing on his bed when he reached for a condom and then I whispered that I was virgin. He just said “that’s okay sweetie.” And that is how I lost my virginity. That weekend Jake came back from his vacation and I felt super guilty but tried to act normal. I think he might have noticed something was off but probably blamed it on PMS or something. What I did was/is extremely out of character for me so I don’t think he suspected anything like that. I so I kept hiding it from him. After Jake came back it became more difficult for me to get to campus to meet up with Mike but I managed it several times. The sex got more and more rough every time but I guess I liked the feeling of being used. The last time I went over there things got even more intense… he got his roommate involved and I ended up giving head and having sex with both of them, taking turns. 

So that is my confession. I am in a big mess because Jake still wants to have sex soon, and he thinks I am virgin too, so I am afraid of doing it with him because he will probably wonder why Im not bleeding. I am not sure what to do about it. I still love him very much and I don’t want to end it but I do feel horrible about what I didn’t behind his back. To make me even more paranoid, I recently found out that Mike is taking my dad’s class this semester (I saw him on a roster my dad left on the coffee table once). I worried that my dad will somehow show the class a family photo with me in it or that Mike will come to office hours one day and see the photos on his desk (although that is unlikely since he doesn’t seem to be the academic type). I haven’t told anyone about it and I don’t plan on it. Jessie does not know that we made out that first night and I deliberately didn’t tell her about the times following that.

Peter Parker has been living in Japan for twenty years after the deaths of his parents when he was five. While there he attended the finest schools and went to a very prestigious university. He has returned to New York to work at Oscorp, the leading name in high-tech defensive design. When he returns he takes up residence at his Aunt May's house and begins working at Oscorp as an intern. While at Oscorp he meets Mary Jane Watson, a biologist that he had known when he was a child. The two hit it off until she asks some awkward question that makes him lament about his loss. He timidly explains that he hasn't been in New York since his parents were killed by a horrible maniac twenty years prior.

He is also introduced to Dr. Thompson, the youngest department lead at Oscorp. His department has frequently produced some of the most innovative and brilliant ideas in Oscorp. Thompson has a group of assistants that follow him around. He thinks he is a hot shot and has his assistants call him ""Flash"". Dr. Thompson notices Peter and Mary Jane and decides to intervene making Peter do menial tasks while flexing his departments achievements to him.

Peter Parker is saved only when Dr. Norman Osborn intervenes. ""Dr. Thompson, I think we can treat our new interns better than this."" He takes Peter Parker aside and has a discussion with him while Dr. ""Flash"" Thompson has talks with Mary Jane. ""Peter,"" Dr. Osborn says ""You're the son of Richard Parker, am I right?"" while extending his hand for a shake. Peter hesitates for a moment and then shakes his hand. ""You knew my father sir?"" Osborn laughs ""Knew him, we were practically brothers!"" Dr. Osborn puts his hand around Parker's shoulder and leads him to his office. ""I noticed your resume when it came across my desk."" Norman looks down at Peter. Dr. Osborn stands a good foot taller than him. ""Your Aunt June..."" Peter interrupts, ""Sorry doctor, Aunt May."" Norman laughs again. ""Yes, your Aunt May brought this over to us months ago."" Peter just stares forward ""You should thank her, my boy, she wanted to secure your employment."" He smiles. ""...and with the economy the way it is today. Well... bless her."" Peter gulps. He can't help but feel a bit breathless when he is around Dr. Osborn. ""Please Peter, step into my office. Let's talk about your future!"" He holds his office door open while Peter graciously goes inside.

""What were you two talking about anyway?"" Dr. Thompson asks Mary Jane. ""You were laughing, was he funny?"" Mary Jane looks over to Peter going into Dr. Osborn's office. ""He was funny 'Flash'!"" Mary Jane retorts stabbing Dr. Thompsons goofy grin. ""Babe!"" He spits back. ""You know you can call me Gene!"" Mary Jane tries to walk away but he grabs her by the bicep. A few people look at him and then go back to working. ""Dr. Thompson! Please let go of my arm!"" Mary Jane replies yanking her arm. He tightens his grip then leans in close to her and says. ""Your buddy, your little funny buddy, is dangerous. For you... For me and for Oscorp. His working here is a problem for all of us. Don't say anything to anyone. Dr. Osborn told me that in secrecy. I don't know why he's here but believe me don't get attached!"" He let's go of Mary Jane's arm and walks out of the room. Mary Jane stands there stunned looking at Dr. Norman Osborn's door.

I have 4 years experience in leadership positions that have included military, wilderness expedition guiding, project development, school clubs, student government, and community service.

As far as work, I am seeking a company that employs self motivated and hard working individuals,cultivates growth, has a good value system, and that can allow me to accomplish a healthy life/work balance.

I feel versatile. I enjoy working with people, technology, and development. I am curious as to how I should go about making the transition from KY college girl to real world living a successful one. Which cities might be right for what I'm looking for, should I use a recruiter or head hunter, and do you have any general advice for me? 
I am seeking a non-profit, a sales, or engineering position.

I wasnt able to take up any internships due to other commitments. Now I've moved to Phoenix area, and finally have now had the ability to look for work, and have been trying for the last month, unsuccessfully. 

How the heck do you guys get internships or jobs if you were in my situation? I've applied to a bunch places, entry level as well as internships, and I havent got any responses other than a few automated rejections. I didnt work during school and dont have a job right now. (2010 - present), so my credentials are pretty dated.

Most of the internships if not all require the applicant to be a student currently attending a school, which makes me ineligible for those positions. There is a career fair coming up next month at ASU, which I will attend, but I'm not getting my hopes up. I talked to a guy, and his advice was to go get my Masters, which I really dont want to do. 

Any advice? Thanks."

1lvp2a,1,2013-09-06,I think I'm too young for a mid-life crisis.,casey-dilla,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1lvp2a/i_think_im_too_young_for_a_midlife_crisis/,"Okay, so my title is a bit exaggerated. I'm only 18. I've had depression and anxiety for over a decade and certainly gets the best of me...

Here is my story:

I've wanted to create films my entire life. I spent my entire high school career juggling APs, extra-curriculars, a job, and making short films in hopes to get accepted into the school of my dreams. And I did it. I got into a school considered to be within the top ten of the world.

Then I didn't go. Being too rich for financial aid, and too poor to attend a private university, I decided to discontinue my enrollment two months before my move-in day. I was devastated. Everything I had worked for disappeared. It was the hardest decision I ever had to make, but I would have been over $200,000 in private student loan debt if I decided to attend.

So where am I now? I'm a communications major at my local community college. It's triggering a lot of depressive thoughts. The classes are not challenging in the slightest, and the majority of the student body (especially in my major) are unmotivated and aren't passionate like the students at other schools I visited. I'm surrounded in a pessimistic environment and it sucks. 

I have two problems: One is, where do I go from here? I willingly enrolled in the community college ONLY by realizing that it's temporary, and in two years I could transfer to an even better film school out in California-- a place where I've always wanted to be, even though my parents are against it. Even though they forbid me from applying to CA schools senior year, they're more okay with me attending if I'm two years older by then.

California seems like the perfect option. Too bad my credits aren't guaranteed to transfer (I'm from New York). I even called up those schools and asked how I should go about transferring, being out-of-state and all. They said it would probably take me an extra year to complete a Bachelor's degree, which defeats the whole purpose of sacrificing the school I was supposed to attend originally...I'm supposed to save money. Additionally, my chances of getting in are slim because CA residents get first dibs.

So I looked at schools on this side of the coast. NYU would send me into a hole of debt, being about $15,000-$20,000 more than the school I originally planned on attending. Being a film major, I'll probably have to take on some unpaid internships and low-paying/entry level jobs, which I don't think I could afford with that debt.

I also looked at SUNY schools, but Purchase is the only one with a reputable film program. Though the price of tuition is appealing, the campus atmosphere and social vibe are a huge turn off.

Lately, I feel like there's no way out. I'm trapped within this bubble of uncertainty and all my hopes and dreams are slipping through my fingers. Is filmmaking even a realistic career anyway? Should I find another interest? I've always liked the medical field and did well in biology, but I don't know if I should give up on what I love the most just because my financial situation isn't ideal.

I'm very confident in my abilities, though. I've won awards for my work, I'm a good student, and I'm very easy to get along with. These are some of the only things I can take pride in.

I feel like my depression is at its lowest right now. What do I even have to look forward to? I need some sort of assurance that everything will be okay and that I'll be able to achieve some sort of success in the film industry, whether I go to a brand name film school or not...if I decide to continue with it, that is.

Help. That's really all I can say right now."
1lvp27,5,2013-09-06,FWB Advice,thaa527,BDSMcommunity,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMcommunity/comments/1lvp27/fwb_advice/,"The issue I'm looking for advice for isn't directly bdsm related, but since this started as a bdsm relationship I decided to post here anyway.

About 8 months ago I (23M Dom) met a submissive (21F) on collarme that lived in the same city and went to the same university as me. Not long after that, we met in person and pretty much jumped right into a D/S dynamic as fuck buddies. We were fairly inexperienced with bdsm, both only having done limited online experiences in the past. I also hadn't had a whole lot of experience with vanilla sex (none of which was fwb), but she had (mostly or all fwb).

At first we pretty mostly interacted only in bdsm sessions about once or twice a week. She would come over to my place, we'd have a session, maybe talk for about random stuff for half and hour to an hour, then she'd go home. Several weeks into it, we also started some limited power exchange outside of sessions too. She needed permission to touch herself or orgasm, had to keep me informed of her schedule, and would perform basic tasks when told (edging, sending pictures of herself, stuff like that).

Over the summer, she temporarily moved a few hours away for an internship. I ended up driving up there fairly often on the weekends, and she came down here a few times too. We probably ended up seeing each other about once every two weeks. When visiting, we'd usually stay for almost the whole weekend to get as much out of the trip as we could. This gave us a lot more time together outside of sessions than we'd had before. We'd hang out, get meals together, go see a movie, etc. We ended up becoming pretty good friends.

She moved back for here for school about a month ago, and we've decided to move to a TPE-like dynamic. But we've also been keeping up the friendship outside of bdsm that we started this summer. While she's expected to follow my rules and orders at all times, we still mostly interact as normal friends outside of sessions.

With how we get along so well outside of the bedroom, the fact that we're having sex, and the fact the she keeps me informed of pretty much everything in her personal life because of the TPE, it's starting to feel a little bit like we're also in a vanilla relationship to me. And I think that's something I might want to try with her. I'm a little on the fence about whether I have any feelings for her. I'm not nearly in love or anything, but even without the bdsm she's the kind of girl I'm usually attracted to, and if we weren't already having sex, I'm pretty sure I'd ask her out. But I'm hesitant to discuss this with her. I'm not sure if she feels the same way. She's not much of an initiator in general, but especially with the dom/sub dynamic, it's hard for me to get a read on that. I'm confident that even if she said she wasn't interested in that, I would be capable of continuing to do what we're doing now, and I would definitely want to. But I'm a little worried that she would distance herself or even break it off entirely if she's not interested and thinks I'm attached.

Any advice about how to bring this up or if I even should?

tl;dr - Might be interested in starting a relationship with my fwb sub, but I'm not sure if she's interested, so I don't know how or whether to bring it up because I don't want her to stop what we're doing now if she's not."
1lvn7p,3,2013-09-06,"I don't know if I can handle 4 years of university, but there's really no other choice.",cewz,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1lvn7p/i_dont_know_if_i_can_handle_4_years_of_university/,"I've just started my first year, and I'm already feeling really awful. I'm bitter because it feels like it's something I've been ""forced"" into because there's really no other options. Society says I have to pay (or admittedly, my parents have to pay) tens of thousands of dollars and work for 4 years to get a degree that may or may not help me get a job. There are so many jobs where I really don't get why *that much* education is necessary. 

I'm probably going to major computer science, and obviously that requires training, but why do I have to take courses with no relevance to fit some degree requirements? 

 More than anything I wish I could just go straight to an unpaid internship and receive on the job education and training from them. 

But I'm in for 4 more years of learning things I don't care about, studying, and exams...

And yeah yeah, university is a good growing experience, you meet lots of people, whatever. I at least appreciated high school because I got to see my friends everyday and actually spend quality time with them. And I'm looking forward to a career and getting to know my coworkers. At university, it feels more about quantity of friends vs. quality...

I'm also scared I'm not going to do well in comp. sci. I'm not great at theoretical math, which I think will end up being very frustrating for me. My other interests would be in the film/tv industry or fashion industry, and I think I would enjoy art school much more, but I don't know if I'd be able to go far. This sounds bad, but it's important to me that I have a good salary, so that I have the means to do the things I actually care about and enjoy.

Okay that sounded really whiny. But I feel like I'm being forced down  this path. I worry this will really take an emotional toll on me."
1lvlx2,7,2013-09-06,Applying for grad school - falling behind,badgrad,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/1lvlx2/applying_for_grad_school_falling_behind/,"Hey everyone. This is going to be long and maybe annoying. I apologize in advance. I am a senior anthropology student who is working on starting grad school applications. I am taking the GRE in October and I have narrowed down the schools I want to apply to, but I'm feeling pretty lost as far as applying goes.

**My background**: To be completely honest, I don't think I'm a very good candidate, and I'm worried. I started school later than the average person, so I'm much older than most of the other undergrads and all of them have achieved a lot more than me. Most of them have participated in multiple field schools, honors, and big undergrad research projects. I honestly just haven't had the time and money for these experiences. I'm not sure how I am going to be able to compete with other grad applicants. 

My GPA is only a 3.4 (3.7 in my department. I have this semester and spring semester to go still). I graduated from a community college with a 3.7 GPA, but I don't know if this will be combined with the GPA from my current school for grad applications. I haven't done any research at all (not for lack of trying, I just haven't found anything or had enough time to do any until now). I might try to do some research this fall, but I'm already taking five classes and studying for the GRE and I don't want any of those things to suffer because I'm doing too much - I would also have to design my own research project since no one anywhere in my department seems to have anything I can do. Because I haven't done research or major honors projects, I don't really even have any good writing samples I can send to grad schools. I've only done one field school. I currently have an internship at a local anthropology related organization, but it's more in the archaeology field and I'm more interested in biological anthropology (and will be applying to programs that focus on this). I'm participating in the internship because it involves museum work, which is what I would ultimately like to do - museum research in biological anthropology. I'm studying for the GRE, but I am fairly certain my scores won't be great. I don't test well and am struggling with the math. 

**Questions**: How important are GRE scores and GPAs when applying to grad schools? How can I improve my chances of acceptance? If I know what professors I want to study with, should I email them before applying? Do I have to fit directly into their current research, or can I suggest doing research that is only somewhat related to what they are interested in? 

I also have no idea where to start on my statement of purpose. Any tips on that? I've read a lot of advice online, but none of it seems to apply to me because I don't have all of this distinguished undergraduate experience. Much of the advice that I have read suggests giving a lot of information about the disadvantages you've overcome. I have not had a very easy life, but I also don't really feel comfortable divulging details about this in a professional setting like an formal statement of purpose for grad school. Would it really benefit me to write about the hardships I've overcome? How much should I reasonably reveal? 

**TL;DR** Am I making this out to be a bigger deal than it is??

[What is Alan Davies cumulative score? And is it more than the audience's?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc32o88?context=5)|According to our calculations, Alan's total score stands at minus 2283. That's if you don't count the time he got minus 1 gazillion.
 |Stephen's score is currently 800044. It's partly self-awarded.
 |Over the series the audience have racked up a total of minus 60 points; ASIMO the robot scored 32 points in the 'I' series, and despite never having appeared on the show, Barack Obama is on minus 10.
 |Panellists are allowed to appeal if they think their score is wrong - but so far no-one has exercised this right.
 |Highest ever score: 200 (Helen Atkinson Wood, C Series)
 |Lowest ever score: Minus 144 (Alan Davies, D Series)
 |Rich Hall is currently the most successful guest, having won 10 out of the 24 episodes he has appeared on.
[Can you please explain how the scoring system works? Does anyone know or is it magic?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc31p7t?context=5)|All we know is that a man called Murray (formerly Colin) from a company called Lumina arrives at the studio in a big black car and is escorted to a blacked-out scoring room, where he does something with a proprietary algorithm and a cat. Numbers come out of a tube and we beam them straight to Stephen.
[What's your favourite fact that has never made a show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc31tp3?context=5)|My favourite non-TV (so far) fact is that the International Space Station is worth roughly 7 times its own weight in gold.

It's the further question that it opens up, and the resulting answer that's the real secret.
[Do you have all the possible 'alarm' answers queued in? Or does someone with fast fingers type it in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc320by?context=5)|They're all pre-programmed in - it takes a few minutes to set them up, so we can only add in new ones if we have enough time in the show -eg. Victoria Coren and the Aztec March Hare.
[Why won't the BBC air QI on BBC America? Will there ever be a QI dvd set so I can watch the show legally in America?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc31qyn?context=5)|Actually certain series of QI are now available on Hulu in the US and Netlfix in the UK: keep an eye on www.qi.com for further developments.
[I'm guessing this has to do with photo/video/audio copyrights and such?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc324ru?context=5)|Yup. It's as frustrating for us as it it for you guys that all of QI isn't available to watch, but we're working on it; the main problem is the images behind the panellists.
[Can't you just release the raw recordings as Podcasts in audio only?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc32nwc?context=5)|We're working on that as well.
[Do you guys really work behind the scenes even while they are filming the episodes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc31zn6?context=5)|Yes, we are behind the scenes, there's a special Elves' booth that we occupy from where we watch the recording through a window (we're not allowed into the control gallery because we shout at the TV like it's a football match). We mostly make notes on how the recording is panning out and check things that the panellists say. If there's time to correct anything they say before they move on, we message Stephen on his screen.
[Are there topics you prefer not to talk about on the show, either because they are too touchy, or because they are not good enough for a panel show/comedy programme?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc31zn6?context=5)|We look at each fact's sources individually so it depends, but after a while you get to know which sources to trust and which need backing up. Our most senior researchers have a spidey-sense for that sort of thing. The trick is to not assume something is trustworthy just because when you Google it it comes up in a load of news articles - because usually they're copying each other.  Aside from things you're not allowed to talk about on BBC Two, we don't really steer clear of anything, QI works best when it's an open and inquisitive look at anything and everything.
[DO you reckon you will make it to Z?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc31s12?context=5)|We will start on the numbers. Once we have finished them, we will get started on symbols.

[What does Stephen Fry smell like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc3216f?context=5)|Faintly of raspberries.
[What is your average day like at work? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc32e1f?context=5)|We all get in to the office appallingly late and then spend most of the day writing an illicit sitcom based around QI. Occasionally we get a phone call informing us of the Chief Gnome's imminent arrival, whereupon we grab the heaviest books we can find and get researching until he goes away. The show gets written in these five minutes bursts.
[On the rare occasion that you get something wrong, how hard do you take it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc322kw?context=5)|Usually the elf responsible endures days of abuse from fellow researchers and a healthy dose of Dobby-esque self-flagellation.
[Does Stephen Fry actually need the answer cards?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc32eur?context=5)|Stephen does possess an impossible amount of knowledge for a human. But it's fun to give him an extra leg-up over the panellists, so we equip him with the cards, an autocue, an information screen embedded into his desk, and we also shout at him through an earpiece.
[What was the most obscure question that was actually answered by a panelist? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc326eh?context=5)|Back in C series Rory McGrath demonstrated a knowledge of Latin bird names that blew our notes apart.
[How many elves work on QI?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc31qwf?context=5)|We have five elves working all-year round in the QI office manning the website and writing the books (the collective noun is 'a mischief of elves'). The number increases to about 12 in the run-up to recording season, and drops around Christmas when we're doing...other things.
[Be honest, how much of your job simply involves reading Wikipedia?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc326ou?context=5)|I personally use Wikipedia quite a lot as a jumping off point, but not as a primary source for QI facts.  Wikipedia has an unfair reputation for being unreliable, and although the references themselves are often not up to scratch, a lot of the QI information I've discovered on Wikipedia has turned out to be correct, after being verified by different sources.
 |The brilliant thing about Wikipedia is that it covers everything, and it's all linked together - so you can get completely lost and go for a walk for hours just by clicking on anything that looks interesting - and that's a great way to find QI facts.

 |Anything that does fit gets put into a bit database and then sorted into a thing called a conflatus (we don't know what that means). Then we look at what we've got and try to divide it up into episode-sized themes. Once that's done, episodes get allocated a 'curator' ie. a senior elf who takes charge of that show and writes up the script.
 |Then we go back to meetings to discuss the questions, re-write the questions to meet our annual double-entendre quota, and then skew the show to make Alan look a ridiculous as possible. If we can find an excuse to dress Stephen up too then that's a bonus.

Oh, and tell Steven I said hi, and Denmark loves him :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc36qnq?context=5)|He got his foot stuck in a hole under the set in the first episode, and we haven't been able to free him yet.
[Can I please come work with you? What is the hiring process?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc31smm?context=5)|We've had a lot of questions about jobs at QI so we'll put up a thorough response at the top of this thread at the end.
[For years, my favorite thing to do is research. I once spent a week learning the life cycle of jellyfish simply out of curiosity. It is my *dream* to do this for a living!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc31smm?context=5)|Edit: There's a link to the answer of this question up the top now!
[Stephen mentioned that sometimes while filming he is going through a depressive episode. Have that ever been an obstacle? Did you ever have to reschedule an episode or reshoot because he wasn't feeling well?  How/when did you come up with the genius alarm? Is Rory the only person in QI history to ever receive that title?  Is general ignorance gone for good?  Why was the funniest bit in QI history cut from the episode?  For which other QI inventions is Head Science Elf Will Bowen responsible for?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc320zw?context=5)|To answer some of your questions: Rory is indeed the only person who's earned himself the genius alarm, although we have had other tailored alarms for other guests e.g. the well-deserved Luvvie alarm for John Sessions. General Ignorance isn't gone, we've just interspersed it throughout episodes, rather than having it as a round at the end, so now you never know when we've planted a trap. It gives us more opportunity to catch out unsuspecting panellists that way. The glorious Acropolis moment you're talking about was never going to be cut from the series - we just found that it fitted better into the outtakes episode that we did for the E series, rather than the Engineering episode for which it was originally filmed. Don't worry - we knew it was unmissable comedy gold as soon as it happened! If anything on QI ever involves clever props, explosions, safety goggles or the accidental destruction of bits of the set, it will have been masterminded by Will Bowen. Who, incidentally, is a genius of immeasurable proportions and refuses to own a mobile phone. You can check at the top of this feed now for information on working or volunteering for QI. We welcome contributions from all curious minds. 
[Do the Elves have a pub quiz team? (Or better yet, write a pub quiz?!\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc3486b?context=5)|We have been known to turn up to the odd pub quiz in London. Our arrival is usually met with an awed hush - which is swiftly punctured when they realise that we're actually pretty useless at general knowledge, and we have an annoying habit of debunking all the questions and making inappropriate klaxon noises.
[Have you ever come across a fact which you'd like to have included in a show, but which was either too complicated or simply too far fetched to be believed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc31zq4?context=5)|Cutting a fact because it's too long-winded or requires too much of a run up is the last the we want to do if it's ultimately interesting, but sometimes it does happen. What we did start to do in the J series was touch upon a topic (e.g. different theories on the subtext of Alice in Wonderland) and elaborate on qi.com.
 |Now that our shiny new website is nearly up and running, we'll hopefully be able to do this more - so far we've already begun to post a list of references for the show material, plus some of Stephen's notes, and the most exciting part of all, the INFOCLOUD.
[Has Stephen ever given you a sock?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc369rb?context=5)|WE ARE FREE ELVES.
[I love the show here in Australia. Thanks for such a great show. Cant wait for the new season.  One thing always intrigued me though..  Who is the baby in the opening credits? does he/she hold any significance?.. Or is it a random stock photo of a child?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc34l4q?context=5)|The baby in the opening credits is one of QI creator John Lloyd's daughters. He is almost certain he knows which (of two) it is. The other child in the opening credits is John Lloyd's son.
[Who chooses the buzzer sounds?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc3242l?context=5)|The episode curator puts ideas in their script as a jumping-off point, and they're done on the day of recording, usually chosen by QI creator John Lloyd. If we can't find exactly the sound we're looking for we're sometimes able to record it in the studio. 
[How many men and how many women on the team?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc388mu?context=5)|The number of people on the entire team fluctuates from month to month, but in the office full time there are 3 boys, 2 girls, and the company is run by Mr and Mrs Lloyd.
[An interesting fact about Dr Watson (Sherlock\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc388mu?context=5)|**From our Sherlock Holmes page: [Link to qi.com](http://qi.com/infocloud/sherlock-holmes**)
[I went to a recording of QI once, London studios I think it was, firstly, thanks for a great day out! Secondly, before the show you have screens displaying interesting facts, who does those? Yourselves? Steven?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc36bke?context=5)|We're so thrilled people notice them! We elves take it in turns with the fact screen - it's whoever can get near the computer fast enough, really.
[Qi Elves,  What is the one thing you have learned through all of these years that has changed your lives the most?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc35z66?context=5)|Biscuits.

[Why not?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc34hek?context=5)|And we have sourced all of 1,227 Facts - if you look in the front (or back) of the book, you can go to qi.com/1227 and type in a page number for a reference...
[Also, do you make Stephen's pants?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc34hek?context=5)|And yes we do - it's the coveted summer internship.
[What did each of you do as a career before you became the QI elves?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc34u1f?context=5)|Aaah, that fateful day when we all met in an abandoned warehouse on the South Bank in an Ocean's Eleven-style round-up. Amongst our ranks are mathematicians, historians, scientists, quiz champions, publishers, an astronomer, a theatrical engineer, a Private Eye hack, an ex-accountant, an ex-commodity broker, an ex-chef, an ex-zoo-keeper,  two ex-Scottish parliamentary researchers (one of them's still Scottish though), an ex-Latin tutor, and one reclusive researcher who submits his work over the internet, and whom no-one has ever actually met. We think he may have originally run Charlie's Angels. 
[Can you tell me about the episode John Hodgman ended up on (and winning!\) He felt like such a last-minute addition, wedged in as a third guest on one side of the set.  Was he a surprise? Did he just show up and hit it off with Stephen at the pub the night before filming?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc35efd?context=5)|I think he was in the UK at the time we were recording, and we wanted to have him on but we'd already booked up all the guests, so we just gouged an extra space into the set for him...
[What is your favourite fact or joke that was deemed inappropriate to air? Were there any?  Edit: Removed fave unaired fact, has been asked already.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc31zn9?context=5)|There was a bit about a chicken which most of us still haven't been allowed to watch...
[What would you put in The Museum of Curiosity? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc3640i?context=5)|I know everyone else has different answers, but they've all gone to bed, so I personally would donate...all of LEGO. As in every piece. I'm aware that this would cause some inconvenience in playrooms across the world, but I think it's the most brilliant toy/genuinely useful tool/supremely creative material there is.
 |The fact that manufacturing and technology development companies across the world use it in prototyping, and yet the very same product is one of the most successful toys &amp; educational tools worldwide demonstrates that it breaks down the barriers between imagination/ingenuity/creativity and the realisation of those things into tangible entities more effectively than almost anything else. It has almost boundless potential, and yes the skill required to master it is negligible - in particular the Technic/Robotics area of Lego is an absolute masterpiece of seamless compatibility and a genius example of complexity-through-simplicity, albeit also a slightly scary IKEA-esque conformity.
 |I reckon that if you could give everyone a limitless supply of LEGO there would be a massive upswing in creativity being put to practical use.
 |Edit: spelling corrections.
[What's your method for going about finding a fact? I honestly don't know where I'd start!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc35mtj?context=5)|We all have different preferences for methods of research; we have a sizeable library in the office, plus memberships to other libraries in London. There's not really a place to start when it comes to QI research, you just dive in - pick up the most obscure book you can find and start reading.
 |We also have an extensive network of shady contacts in Museum basements, so they're always useful for getting into places that people aren't usually allowed, and we sometimes get their opinion on facts as well. I've recently taken to accosting academic guests of our radio show after recordings and insisting they give me all their contact details so I can probe their brains for QI nuggets.
[On a scale of 1 to 10, Steven fry is 11. I have read his book, amazing man. What is he like behind close doors just chatting, brilliant as ever or more reserved?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc34yqk?context=5)|Utterly genial, and very tall.
[QI seems hilarious, but I've only ever watched clips on youtube. If I wantes to get into the show, should I just start from episode one and go forward until I catch up? Should I ignore the past and start with the newest episode? Is there some sort of ""Best Of"" collection?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc35oij?context=5)|Again, something we're working on, but for now we'd recommend you just dive in! (Although the 'Greats' episode from Series G is particularly good...)
 |You might miss out on the developing character relationship between Alan and Stephen we've been subtly writing in over the last 7 series, but still... 
[In season 7, episode 4 (about 6 minutes in\), Stephen refers to Gibraltar Point being in the Grimsby area.  It's not.  Grimsby is about 40 miles away.  Gibraltar Point is in Skegness.  It's not even on the QI Quibble Blog...  *sorry - I love the show, but I couldn't resist.  Can I have a prize? ;\) ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc33fjf?context=5)|Dreadfully sorry for the Grimsby-Skegness mix up. We promise to rap Stephen's knuckles accordingly and give him an emergency Geography lesson ASAP.
[In one episode, Stephen name-dropped someone famous and was penalised with the incredibly rare ""Luvvie Alert"". Could you shed some light on what this alert is about? Is it still hovering over Stephen like a Sword of Damocles?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc37pq2?context=5)|Who knows how many esoteric and completely inexplicable alarms, klaxons and booby-traps are inexorably weaved into the fabric of QI. Many of them are said to have been pre-programmed in by Nostradamus himself. 
[Is there a place where we can submit QI facts or suggestions for guests?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc35q2v?context=5)|Yes, the QI Forums (currently undergoing renovation) - go to qi.com.
[Why do you hate the Unbelievable Truth so much? Is it just to annoy David Mitchell or are you at war with their elves?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc3795k?context=5)|DON'T MENTION THE WAR.
[What does the fox say?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc36bay?context=5)|Recent research in Norway suggests that foxes actually go ring-ding-ding-ding-dingeringeding.
 |This has already been widely discredited by everyone.
[What's your favorite memory from working on QI?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc324wa?context=5)|In the A series we had a streaker on the set. That's the most vivid memory, anyway...
[On the show, Stephen Fry sounds like he's just speaking from a vast repository of information in his brain half the time. How much of what he says come from the notes prepared for him, and how much is off the top of his head?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc37gdd?context=5)|We provide Stephen with a stack of questions with notes before the show, and he does this brilliant trick where he disappears off to his dressing room for a bit a emerges later having fully assimilated all of the notes, with all of the facts at his fingertips, and invariably having topped it off with a sprinkle of his own knowledge, anecdotes and glorious innuendo.
[Whenever you get something wrong, do people when they find out what you do for a living constantly bring it up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc37cys?context=5)|This question is based on the assumption that we socialise with people, or indeed leave the office.
[Hi Elves! How important would you say images are to the series? Where do you source them all from? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc36d3e?context=5)|A good proportion of the jokes or the information comes from the screens, so we'd say they're very important. Without them it would be a bit like being in a classroom without a whiteboard.
 |Most of our pictures come from a stock image company (and lots of them are tailored by our image researchers) but for the more obscure topics there might only be one copy of the photo, guarded by an angry old lady in basement of Sicilian museum, so it takes a bit more effort...
[I remember watching a program saying that you once read a whole dictionary (of some foreign language\) just to get two facts for the show. Is your job laborious and boring sometimes or is it thrills and spills all the time? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc355rj?context=5)|We've all been on the edge of nervous breakdown at some stage in the desperate, laborious, and sometimes seemingly fruitless dig for great facts. But a splendid little nugget - like the fact that Google was originally called Backrub, for instance, or that the dialling code for calling Russia from the UK is 007 - always pops up right in the nick of time.
[What's up with the strange air dates?  K series begins this evening, but the last episode of J aired like two weeks ago.  and then the previous episode before that was like 6 months ago.  that's not how TV is supposed to work.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv64o/we_are_the_qi_elves_the_researchers_behind_the/cc35k0i?context=5)|That last episode of Series J was just a straggler. The BBC held it back for Inventors' Season... we don't really know what happened with that...
[Dear QI Elves - I'm curious. Do you have things like a notepad beside your bed in case you wake up with a question that you *know* will screw with Alan Davies?

As I work as a Security Analyst or Portfolio Manager after completing CFA, I want to start working on my MBA so I can get into Investment Banking. It sounds really easy as I write, but we all know it is not! So my question is am I on the right track? Am I missing something? How long should this take me? Is it possible? I am not the smartest but I will read the books till I get it! 
As I finish my BS in June, how should I start on CFA? It will take me at least 2 years to finish it, and then what should I get my MBA (2+ years) in?

Sorry for all the questions, but my advisers at school suck! and other students are confused as I am. We don't know what to do, where to go. I do not want to waste my time doing something that is not worth it. Time Value Money!

The module synopses are here:

1. [Web Information Processing](http://www.nuim.ie/courses/?TARGET=MODULE&amp;MODE=VIEW&amp;MODULE_CODE=CS230&amp;YEAR=2014)
1. [Media Programming](http://www.nuim.ie/courses/?TARGET=MODULE&amp;MODE=VIEW&amp;MODULE_CODE=CS270&amp;YEAR=2014)
1. [Mobile Application Development](http://www.nuim.ie/courses/?TARGET=MODULE&amp;MODE=VIEW&amp;MODULE_CODE=CS385&amp;YEAR=2014)

I spent the summer working at an internship, building a web app in Java with Play 2, so I'm instantly drawn to the web-based choice, but reading the synopsis, it seems a bit outdated. Would I be right in thinking that?

Media programming would be basically new to me, but I think I'd like a module that heavily focuses on algorithmic programming.

Lastly, with the popularity of mobile devices, the mobile app module seems like a no-brainer in terms of careers options, especially paired with a decent web programming course.

Of those three modules, which ones seem the most forward-facing and useful?

**EDIT 09/09/13:** Thanks for all the advice. I've found out that I can register for only two modules, but I can attend all three. I reckon I'll register for the web dev and mobile dev modules, and just attend the medai programming module."

So, I've just moved over to Switzerland for my Year Abroad - so far pretty good, loving my internship, closer to my BEST FRIEND EVER IN THE WHOLE WORLD (hai if you're reading this!) and in a nice city and comfy flat.

....that said. I'm living with two guys (eek, can't believe I did this as someone who was living with six other girls this last year!), they are nice enough, polite and so far pretty friendly. 

But it is also weird and a little awkward at times as I really don't know them yet at all!  (Boys and girls also definitely have different levels of considerate!) Like tonight, got home from work and they let me know that in half an hour they are having people over for a bbq. Ok, cool, I like being in a busy and social place!

I didn't realise however that there would be loud music, a lot of people I dont know and that when they told me - well, they were just letting me know and not really inviting me :/ and it was horrendously awkward and i'm sitting in my room alone eating dried cereal because it was scary and everyone was outside apart from two random men watching football, *and-i'm-a-massive-wimp*.

**SO, THIS IS WHAT YOU REALLY NEED TO READ!!!!**

**Lets have a discussion:**

* What are your experiences of moving in with strangers?

* What is some advice you wish someone had given you when you were living with these people/this person?!

**IT IS ALSO A CONTEST - YIPPEEE**

* Simple, I will pick advice I like or a funny/entertaining/sad/embarrassing experience or story i most enjoyed!

* Contest will close **SATURDAY, 8AM SWISS TIME -&gt; GMT +1?** and winner(s) will be chosen at my discretion. :)

I started school later than the average person, so I'm much older than most of the other undergrads and all of them have achieved a lot more than me.  Most of them have participated in multiple field schools, honors, and big undergrad research projects.  I honestly just haven't had the time and money for these experiences.  I'm not sure how I am going to be able to compete with other grad applicants. 

My GPA is only a 3.4 (3.7 in my department.  I have this semester and spring semester to go still).  I graduated from a community college with a 3.7 GPA, but I don't know if this will be combined with the GPA from my current school for grad applications.  I haven't done any research at all (not for lack of trying, I just haven't found anything or had enough time to do any until now).  I might try to do some research this fall, but I'm already taking five classes and studying for the GRE and I don't want any of those things to suffer because I'm doing too much - I would also have to design my own research project since no one anywhere in my department seems to have anything I can do.  Because I haven't done research or major honors projects, I don't really even have any good writing samples I can send to grad schools.  I've only done one field school.  I currently have an internship at a local anthropology related organization, but it's more in the archaeology field and I'm more interested in biological anthropology (and will be applying to programs that focus on this).  I'm participating in the internship because it involves museum work, which is what I would ultimately like to do - museum research in biological anthropology.  I'm studying for the GRE, but I am fairly certain my scores won't be great.  I don't test well and am struggling with the math. 

**Questions**: How important are GRE scores and GPAs when applying to grad schools?  How can I improve my chances of acceptance? If I know what professors I want to study with, should I email them before applying?  Do I have to fit directly into their current research, or can I suggest doing research that is only somewhat related to what they are interested in?  

I also have no idea where to start on my statement of purpose.  Any tips on that? I've read a lot of advice online, but none of it seems to apply to me because I don't have all of this distinguished undergraduate experience.  Much of the advice that I have read suggests giving a lot of information about the disadvantages you've overcome.  I have not had a very easy life, but I also don't really feel comfortable divulging details about this in a professional setting like an formal statement of purpose for grad school.  Would it really benefit me to write about the hardships I've overcome?  How much should I reasonably reveal?   

Am I making this out to be a bigger deal than it is??"

My CreditKarma score is at 736. 

What can I do now to raise my score for the future? 
Would opening another credit card now help me out? (Opening it now would raise the 'average age' of my accounts in 3 or so years when I am looking to actually use my credit)

I am looking long term. I really don't need a higher credit score now (No plans to buy a house/car for probably 6-8 years).

I was never able to convince an employer to give me an internship during college despite having a 3.5 GPA, so I couldn't get a job after graduation either.

I followed my love for journalism to graduate school immediately afterward, where I built an extensive portfolio with multiple student and professional publications for both writing, editing and multimedia. Since my program was fall-spring-summer, I couldn't get an internship with that either.

My freelance career in journalism is stalling, so I'm thinking I might need to fall back on my engineering degree for a job in the meantime. I say ""fall back"" not because it is undesirable, but because my dream is to be a journalist first and engineer second. I tried really hard to make engineering work for me and really wanted to do that as a career, but it didn't work out, so I moved on in a sense.

I've perused local engineering firms' websites and any openings they have, but I feel woefully unqualified.

I'm 21 years old, and now heading into my final year of university. I am not from a wealthy family, and I've had to put myself through college (and all other expenses) by working while attending classes. This, along with my (now obvious) chronic depression, probably more than likely contributed to my poor academic performance.

It seems pretty clear now that I won't be able to go into surgery, the career I've wanted for my entire life. Between the mcats and the hundreds of hours I've spent at medical/surgical internships, I feel that I've wasted much of my time here, now that my future is set.

My parents cannot know of my inability to pursue medicine, and I would rather just have them remember me as the child they spoke so highly of to their peers, their child with the countless reference letters and near perfect mcat scores. The child that they were (are?) proud of.

Yes, there are always other jobs and fields I could explore or enter. I know this, it's not as if though I'm denying the possibility of my being content in some unrelated career. It's moreso that I will always have to live with the fact that I was too inadequate to reach that which I have always longed for, and in the face of this sobering realization (among many others), it is impossible for me to accept myself.

With that, I have finally decided to end my life.

It's not a new decision to me, as I've attempted it many times previously in my youth. I'm certain though that this time I will be successful, due to my newfound motivation.

What motivation? The motivation that this final year of mine (or 9 months now) will be the sweetest I've ever had. Now that I've accepted my fate, I feel free from the anxiety that's plagued me for so long. Now that I can count down how many days I have left, the remaining ones are that much more enjoyable. For the first time in my life, I can lay in the sun and simply enjoy the warmth.

Nothing has improved the quality of my life like the decision I made to end it.

So I'll live for the next few months, awaiting June 15th, the day I've marked as ideal. I think for the first time in my life I'm actually excited for something.

Feel free to ask me any questions if you'd like. I'm more than happy to answer any you may have."

I'm scared to take 17 credits this semester, but I need to if I want to graduate on time. Which would entail taking Process controls, engineering econ + analysis, kinetics, biochemistry, process controls lab, and nano transport.

Finishing up over the summer seems like a bad idea to me, because it would put me out of the job hunt loop. And finishing in fall of 2014 seems bad for the same reason. So my other idea would be to take 12-14 credits the next 2 semesters, get a 6 month co-op fall of 2014, and finish up in spring of 2015 and add some Bio classes to get a minor (I want to work in the biochemical industry). But then I don't graduate until I'm 25.

1luvss,24,2013-09-06,My boyfriend[m26] though that I[f26] triggered his friend P[m26] for reporting our relationship to our boss,defendingthetruth,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1luvss/my_boyfriendm26_though_that_if26_triggered_his/,"The reason I am writing this story is because I want to know how people view this. My boyfriend puts all the blame on me and I feel I should defend myself.
My boyfriend (bf) of 1.5 years, his best friend P and I work at the same place. My bf and I are full time employee and his best friend joined the company as a summer intern. 

June 2013: Everything started when my bf mentioned that he lent P his bike a few years ago and he has not returned it. My bf asked me whether he should ask P to return the bike. I told my bf that I need the bike for school in the fall so he decided to ask P to return it.  But at the time, he was not sure whether P still has the bike. So when I saw him at work, I casually asked P whether he still had the bike, he told me he had it in storage, I relayed the message to my bf.

First week of July 2013: I saw him at work and casually asked whether he is okay returning it. He said “okay” but need some time since he is busy. I told him I understood.

Last week of July 2013: My bf texted P asking him to return the bike. P told my bf that he was currently busy with summer school but agreed to return on the 2nd week of August. P went further by telling my bf that I had been nagging him for the past two months about the bike. My bf told me to stop nagging him. Even though, I felt that “nagging” is a not an appropriate word to use, I agreed to give P time to finish his summer school before looking for the bike.
At that time I was in the middle of negotiation of buying a bike at craigslist, my bf stopped me and asked me to wait. 

On the week P was supposed to return the bike (2nd week of August): P told us that he had to go to cabin with his family. He asked us to wait another week.

On the week after (3rd week of August): My bf totally forgot to follow up. Since I happened to run towards him at office, I asked nicely what happened. He replied, he commemorated the death anniversary of his brother so he was busy preparing the event last weekend. I told him I am sorry about his brother but anyway, when would you be able to return the bike since school is starting? He suddenly raised his voice “Why would you care since it is not your bike?”. Me (raised my voice too): “I need it for school and my bf even asked you to return it because he wants to give it to me. If you want to keep the bike, you should tell me from the very beginning so that I can buy one instead of getting false hope from you”  P:”Just leave me alone”. I left. After I left, P texted my bf that I harassed him at work about the bike. My bf without hearing the story from my side, stopped talking to me because of that.

On the 4th week of August: P went to my boss telling him that I was demanding (my boyfriend’s name)’s bike from him at work and basically let my boss know about our relationship.

On 1st week of September: My bf found out and confronted P about revealing the secret. P apologized to my bf that it was his last resort because he had ben annoyed by me for so long. P told me that he didn’t want to see my face or talk to me anymore. After the call, my bf was mad at me and forced me to apologize to him for triggering him to report our relationship to our boss. My bf also told me that he picked P’s side and the whole problem started because of me.

I don’t have a peni* but I am gentleman enough to admit if I do things wrong. It was probably my fault to bypass my bf in asking P about the bike although I see it as casual conversation between friends.  I am indifference about losing a “friend” like P. I was mostly upset because P chose to harm not only me but also my bf by revealing our secret. And obviously upset because my bf failed to act objectively and maturely. I never asked him to defend anyone. I just need him to be fair and neutral. Please let me know what do you think about this? Thanks!

Tl;dr My boyfirend’s friend P[m26]  who works at the same workplace with us reported our relationship to our boss. Office rules are potentially against dating. My bf put the blame on me for triggering him to do such thing by asking him to return my boyfriend’s bike.

Last year, between a job, an internship, and 18 credit hours I had let myself get to about 175lbs. I was short, chubby, and pissed off for letting it happen. I started with the full two months of Insanity and cut about 15lbs off, after that I immediately went into lifting. Figuring it out as I went took some time, and I didn’t get my diet down until the last six months, but now I’m up to 180 and my biggest complaint is that none of my clothes fit. Feels amazing every day. But this isn’t about me. 

My friend commented the other day that he’s watched my transformation and wants to start taking care of himself. I’ve been suggesting it for months and finally last week he asked if he could start training with me. He’s not in real bad shape, he played soccer in high school and some club soccer through college but quit that last year due to work. We also turned 21 at the beginning of this year and he took to beer most every day and it’s starting to give him a gut. Last week I told him no more beer or soda if he was serious, and so far he’s stuck it. We’ve done some cardio, chest, and a few others so far, but yesterday we had a couple hours free and I really wanted him to find out what he was capable of. I decided on making a 300 workout because the high reps on each exercise would give us a chance to start light and dial in how strong his different muscle groups were. I focused this one on back and core, we both had a great time so I’m thinking of writing a few more for chest, legs, etc. By the end of it we were both exhausted and shaking, so I’m calling it a win. Below is the workout with our results from last night, it took about 1:45 hours to finish since I had to show him the form on most exercises. Next time we’ll be able to blow through it quicker. I’d love any thoughts, suggestions, tweaks, or tips on how to keep him motivated. Thanks for reading!

I hear EE and ME are good chances, but I really don't enjoy it as much as Physics. I want to go to grad school for AI though, and I care a lot about the programming aspect and that's where I'd want to be involved. Which worries me because I hear that a B.S. in Physics isn't useful without a PhD. I do like Applied Physics, but I don't know if I could dual PhD, and my interest in AI supersedes my interest in Physics. Even though I love both, I would choose a CS PhD over a Physics PhD if I had to make the choice.

For internships at places like SpaceX or NASA and stuff, would it be better to double major in CS + Physics, or CS + EE, or CS + ME? (Maybe CS + Math too. I'd like studying math more than Engineering, but less than Physics. I just don't want to double major in Physics if it wouldn't be as helpful in getting me into the Space industry.) I'm also located in Texas at a reputable school that is ranked 8th for CS, 14th for Physics, 10th for ME, and 11th for EE, so the programs are reputable and the industry is nearby physically. 

Edit: I wanted to clarify, I am open to engineering, because I do like it, just that I don't like it as much as pure physics. I was just comparing the two to provide a hierarchy of interests. I would be very much happy and content with a degree in Aerospace Engineering or Mechanical Engineering or Electrical Engineering. In fact I would love to do Aerospace because that's very interesting to me."

We're in too deep, is what I think. Hey, the quicksand they started throwing under our feets? Now that's up to our necks; sinking us only deeper until it's probably too late anyways. Right?

Occupy movement failed, AFAIK due to lack of leadership and specific goals of the movement. The people all had their own ideas of what needed to be done. Everyone just self-serving in masses. 

What are we waiting for anyway? I feel like we're at the cinemas watching each turn of event as Snowden's leaks are dramatically revealed, one-by-one. Obama and the league of millionaires (no offense to all the cool millionaires out there) plotting to take over the world. Little do you know, it's already been taken over.

Sorry for the rant. Where was I?

So, what are we waiting for? The next big reveal from Snowden? I feel like it's gonna revolve around our security and privacy being compromised again. Where is Snowden anyway? Are we gonna wait until he's captured, or dead? What if we suddenly never hear from him again? 

We must be waiting for the war! Yes! Congress loves the idea and we're off to Syria. But since the people outcried beforehand to not go to war, we'll get pissed and THEN we'll do something about it!

Nothing. Stay calm and carry on. It's all we know how to do anyway. Right? Reading all this isn't gonna change anything, because it does not lead to action. There is no action because the right motivation is not present.  

You wanna stand outside for hours to ""protest""? Nope. 

You gonna fight for your rights on a march down to DC? Hell naw.

Write a letter to your Reps! That will get their attentions and through reading your letters (vicariously through the hot interns, mind you) will feel the passion and genuine concern in your writing and, in turn, will have a change of heart to just say ""NO"" (in a firm voice). Write a letter? Serious question: what is writing a letter gonna accomplish exactly? And it's for sure going to be read by the specific person I am writing to right? Because I would like *them* to know *my* opinion in hopes to encourage a change of mind.

Why do they even have the job still? What's the point of appointing Representatives if they don't represent hardly any of us. Except for some shit minorities out there, which btw.. *Fuck* you, you *fucking cunts*!

...

I don't know. Well, we can certainly discuss our state of disapproval and disappointment but that's only lead us back to [this](http://www.reddit.com/). Maybe some of [this](http://www.eyebleach.me/). Was it called [the box](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=reddit+the+box)? How about some [waffles](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=carrots)? 

Where were we?

Right.

I want to get mad, because I've had it. 

What are we gonna do? Let's get mad together! Where/when? Oh wait I can't; already made plans. How about we just discuss realistically logical goals and steps to achieve those said goals online? At this point what can be done? Should we just assimilate and accept it as the ""norm"" now? We're certainly not far from that idea. Maybe we can dissolve the evil corporations and corrupt officials? How about we just get rid of all of them, since they've so useless thus far?

Anywho.. I was mad but I just got done venting so not really mad anymore. I think I'll just head to bed. 

In case I don't see ya: good afternoon, good evening, and good night.

1lufsm,12,2013-09-06,Question for people working in rails industry,pJes2,rails,https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/1lufsm/question_for_people_working_in_rails_industry/,"Greetings fellow Redditors!

I have a question for people working as a RoR developers. I've only recently started learning ruby on rails and ruby itself, while having a little python background (up to and including basic OOP concepts with ability to write my own simple classes). I'm spending all the spare time I can get (so with me having full time job and weekend studies is equal to +- 6h per day) to study RoR and webdev related topics. Going strong with tutorials and books, damn, I've taken more notes already than I did in 3 years of college. The reason behind all this is that i want to change my job (currently having nothing common with programming/webdev at all) and move forward with my life ;) So, getting to the question:

I'm looking to start (obviously) with applying for internship or junior (""junior junior"") developer position. What was the knowledge required in Your case to get accepted, or what does it take for You to accept someone for this position in Your very own startup/company?

There are job offers which goes with line like this: ""(Some) Ruby on Rails experience"". What is this ""some""? I mean going ""rails new ..."", adding some models and controllers, routing, writting some simple tests, getting them all ""green"", bootstrapping like crazy, then deploying on heroku with leet terminal skills couldn't possibly be ""some"" experience. I mean it is the tip of the iceberg right? Also I understand the fact that html5/css3/databases/jquery(?) are all ""must have"" to some degree and I have all of them counted in my learning path."

My first post here, hope I'm not breaking any rules. For those of you in the UK, and further afield, I'd love to hear your thoughts on something I have been working on. Not a business, but a scheme for businesses (and freelancers &amp; young unemployed people). For the sake of the 'no promotion' rule, I won't post a link or the name. It is a genuinely positive, good thing, though, and I want as many people to know about it as possible. 


Please ask me questions about it, share your opinions on coworking, tell me about what help you need to grow as a small business. 

The scheme aims to connect SMEs with ""highly skilled freelancers and interns, selected with your development needs in mind; flexible, cost-effective and in-person. Whether it's a one-off job, ongoing support, or the nurturing of new team members, to bridge your immediate and future needs right at your door, while giving you the opportunity to network and support local talent."""

1lu7sr,4,2013-09-06,20[F4M] Philly/New York City - I tried this when I was out west a little while ago. Maybe the east will like me more? Looking for cuddle buddy/video game friend/possibly more.,darkchanter,r4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/1lu7sr/20f4m_phillynew_york_city_i_tried_this_when_i_was/,"I'm currently a 20 year old student working an internship in NYC. Because of money issues and class schedules, I'm commuting from my university back in Philly (I'll explain more if you really want to know). Working full time plus with classes can get a little stressful and I really could use a warm body to snuggle up and spend time with.
I usually like watching movies, playing video games, cooking, etc. I'm primarily looking for someone to cuddle/possibly spend the night with and sexual relations are a possibility if things go well. I mostly am looking to spend time indoors, but I'm not opposed to going out on occasion. Something similar to a FWB deal (I'm not against a relationship if it turns into that though), but I want it to start as friends first.

feel free to look through my history-- I've posted a little on GWC, so you can get a better feel for what I look like and such.

Just to speed things along, I'd like to ask for a picture in any replies. I'm sure you've seen mine and I'd like to see you :3"

The company would most likely pay for my relocation, as well as a stipend.  It's also in the area I really would like land a full-time job/move to once I graduate.

My question is, and this may be a silly one, but do companies ""look down"" at an internship post graduation?  Ideally I'd hope to land a job, but this is a very reputable and global company, and would no doubt be a huge beneficiary for my career."
1ltzc4,6,2013-09-05,How to get research experience as a freshman/sophmore?,wrongnoteseverywhere,UCSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/1ltzc4/how_to_get_research_experience_as_a/,"I did not receive the Chancellor's Scholarship, or the Reagent's Scholarship. I'm Filipino, but I don't qualify for any minority research programs and I have no prior experience working in a lab. I like to think I'm average.

I've been advised to just approach my professors and tell them I'm interested (hopefully genuinely) in their work or to just email scientists at a lab with my CV and hope for the best. I understand getting experience at a lab, in any way or form, isn't easy, but I'm skeptical of the advise I've been given so far.

How did you manage to get internships, jobs, undergraduate research, or any experience in a lab your first two years?"
1ltwfs,2,2013-09-05,I'm applying to a Department Store with absolutely no experience,DwelveDeeper,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1ltwfs/im_applying_to_a_department_store_with_absolutely/,"Hey guys, I was wondering if anyone could give me some advice for my resume. 

The store I'm applying for is a pretty popular clothing store chain, so they have those applications you just fill out and hand back to them and you can also include a real resume.

Because I have no experience I can't really mark down any of the skills/qualifications besides checking off I know how to use Microsoft Word.

The only jobs I've had before hand were a couple of internships I've had before hand so they were unpaid and unrelated to this field. They were also a couple years ago so I doubt if they'd remember me if they referred to them and I know one of the companies I interned at moved offices and I'm not sure if I know anyone who worked there anyway.

Should I be worried? I'd basically be turning in my application with just my name and address on it. I'm great at talking with people in public but there's no where I can put that on the resume. 

And do you think I should make a resume of my own identifying my skills to turn in as well? 


Thank you, all feedback is appreciated!"
1ltwee,3,2013-09-05,Back to Nothing,JustHere3,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ltwee/back_to_nothing/,"I spent the better part of 4 years after I graduated from high school pushing myself as hard as I could and getting nothing in return. I graduated right on the beginning of the recession and there was nothing for me out there. Even though I had a near perfect academic record and spent almost all my spare time on self-improvement projects, I could barely even get part time retail work. My parents, both out of work before the recession, made my life a living hell at home and blamed me for their own problems. 

I've never been good at making friends and I had no money, so I spent most of those 4 years alone in a library within walking distance, from opening to closing time. I survived on dollar menus fast food and water. My days were filled with an aimless feeling of hatred for everyone I encountered. They all seemed to have something I didn't have- a job, a car, a girlfriend, a family that loved them- anything really.

Starting about 2 years ago, things started to turn around a little bit. I did an internship that involved helping people. After hating other people for so long, I realized I really enjoyed doing something kind. Long story short, it eventually turned into a job. The pay wasn't much (just above minimum wage) and some of my co-workers are real jerks- but I feel proud of what I do. I couldn't live on it though.

Then, this Summer, I thought I had what would be my major breakthrough. I worked hard and sent a bunch of applications for internships out. To my surprise, the only response I received was from the CEO of an organization who wanted to take me on immediately. I was thrilled and jumped into work for them, before it could even count towards my class. I wanted to show them how serious I took it and I'd make those kinds of sacrifices.

Well, they weren't willing to make those kinds of sacrifices for me. I don't know what happened (I assumed they just lost focus) but they stopped giving me stuff to work on. I can never reach any important people because they are all too busy for me. I'm not receiving any hours I can count towards my internship class and I'm probably going to need to find a new, much less prestigious site. My experiences trying to communicate with them in the last 2 weeks pretty much leave me thinking there's no other option.

I'm back to being a nobody again. They took my work during that short time and now there's no way I can use any of it to my advantage- as hours towards my class, as a reference, as anything.

I worked hard as hell but my fate was in somebody else's hands- and like every other time that's happened, they let me down.

I feel as good as dead tonight. I didn't eat dinner. I walked at my local mall, which I haven't been to in years. I just wanted to try to do all the things I did as a kid. Most of my old favorite shops are closed. I went to visit the pet store but I felt none of the joy people usually have even just watching the pets. I sat in the food court for almost an hour and imagined what it would be like to be there with a friend. Then, knowing there wasn't one, I just went to the library. I'll be here until it closes in an hour.

Even if I get over this, I feel like this is going to be my entire life. I don't know if I'm ever going to break into a middle class job even though I did everything right. And even if I did it would just be more solitude and dealing with people who brush you off after you do things for them. And being laid off and back at the library again and again and again..."

[When you had escaped, did you know of North Korea's international reputation? Or had you been censored into believing it was a good place?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ltjg0/i_defected_from_north_korea_and_now_work_as_a/cc2nj94?context=5)|Yes, I thought North Korea is the strongest country under the leader of Kim Jung Il and a good place to live because I had n't known much about outside of the country. And I believed the famine and economic recession was because of US empire and its allies repression to overthrow North Korea. 
[Do people in North Korea have any sort of understanding of the how the rest of the world views them? Even if it's a small group of people who know about this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ltjg0/i_defected_from_north_korea_and_now_work_as_a/cc2lapa?context=5)|Cadre members, high-ranking party officials, and wealthy North Koreans who have access to the internet know about the outside world. The majority of North Koreans do not. However, some South Korean soap operas making their way to North Korea because of the black market. North Koreans are now more aware of the wealth in South Korea. 
[Did you know anyone before you left who remembered the era before the war? I imagine the Japanese occupation was just as oppressive for most people.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ltjg0/i_defected_from_north_korea_and_now_work_as_a/cc2my6s?context=5)|I heard about the era before the war from grandmother, who was born in Seoul and worked as a babysitter for a baby born to a Japanese mother and Korean father. The Japanese mom went back to her home country and my grandmother had to take the baby to the father in North Korea. The father was rich and owned factories in North Korea. The level of oppression depends on your position. and she was lucky.  
[Have you ever seen a public execution(s\)? How many? In your opinion have the police increased or decreased public executions in the past five years or so? Thank you.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ltjg0/i_defected_from_north_korea_and_now_work_as_a/cc2n574?context=5)|Yes, I saw two public executions. One when I was 9 (western age). A policeman shot thieves/rapists without any due process. They were taken outside and shot. They were then tied on a pole and the policeman shot them nine times-- head, chest, stomach, and legs. I saw a similar execution when was 19 (western age). The policemen told us to be careful. 
[Was there any historical events/knowledge did you not know happen or existed untill you escaped? For instance, moon landing etc, ancient Egypt, the Romans..](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ltjg0/i_defected_from_north_korea_and_now_work_as_a/cc2lb2z?context=5)|No I never knew about the moon landing. I did learn a bit about the Egyptians and the Romans. I had a basic world history course, and learned about the opium war involving Britain and China. 
[How did your educational experience in the UK compare with your educational experience in NK?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ltjg0/i_defected_from_north_korea_and_now_work_as_a/cc2l0no?context=5)|In one word: free. In the UK, I was freer to express myself and think my own thoughts. In North Korea, I did not study at university but I went to college for 1.5 years and everyday I had to form in a line with other students (military-style) and march from the gate to the classroom. I felt like I was doing military service in North Korea. In the UK, I felt like I was finding myself. 
[Hi thanks for doing this. Does religion as the rest of us might know it, ie Christianity, Islam , Buddhism , Judaism feature in North Korean life in any way?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ltjg0/i_defected_from_north_korea_and_now_work_as_a/cc2lox0?context=5)|The state is religion. Pyongyang has a few church/temples but they're just for show. Freedom of religion is not allowed, and many missionaries are persecuted. If North Koreans meet Christians in China, they're seriously punished upon return. Smuggling Bibles risks imprisonment and torture. 
[In your opinion, what percentage of people in North Korea actually believe that the Kim family are God like figures?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ltjg0/i_defected_from_north_korea_and_now_work_as_a/cc2muq3?context=5)|I don't have a percentage because I didn't live in every region, and there are big differences. The mass starvation of the 1990s undermined the cult of personality. Many of those who worshipped the regime died because they thought they would be cared for. Those who survived knew how to operate without the Kims, and the grassroots market began to thrive. People began to make money and enjoyed it. 
[In NK do the citizens genuinely believe that their government is great, or do the citizens have doubts but don't voice them in fear of the consequences.  Did you tell your family you were planning to escape? And if so, how did they react?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ltjg0/i_defected_from_north_korea_and_now_work_as_a/cc2meea?context=5)|I did not let my family know, and I haven't spoken to them since. 
[What are Weddings like in North Korea?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ltjg0/i_defected_from_north_korea_and_now_work_as_a/cc2ku6u?context=5)|All weddings in North Korea take place at home (not in a church or city hall). There are no wedding vows or exchanging of rings. Photos are taken, people gather, and there's food shared by visitors. It's more like a party and celebration than a formal ritual. The wife brings many household items (dishes, blankets, kitchen stuff and sometimes TV, appliances like a sewing machine) in order to display status to attendees. 
[Do you think that the North Korean government will fall in the near future (10-20 years\)? What do you see for the future of North Korea?  EDIT: forgot ""the""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ltjg0/i_defected_from_north_korea_and_now_work_as_a/cc2l05e?context=5)|I don't know when the North Korean goverment will collapse. However, I do hope their military first policy ends soon so normal citizens no longer starve. 
[What was the hardest part about adjusting to life outside of North Korea?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ltjg0/i_defected_from_north_korea_and_now_work_as_a/cc2mlit?context=5)|Defectors face some forms of social discrimination in South Korea. It's a complex situation. I faced difficulties because I really had no skills and South Korea is very competetive society. I'm learning to become a reporter now so I can contribute. 
[What do you personally think are the biggest hurdles facing reunification?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ltjg0/i_defected_from_north_korea_and_now_work_as_a/cc2l1pr?context=5)|I think building trust between North and South, and we need time to better understand each other. It cannot be solved in a short time with just a meeting or summit. Citizens from both countries need to meet each other, and the North Korean goverment has to help normal people live better, raise the standard of living. The Kim regime must understand this is not a threat to stability. 
[What is the best thing you discovered after leaving North Korea?  For example: food, culture, technology, freedoms?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ltjg0/i_defected_from_north_korea_and_now_work_as_a/cc2re8n?context=5)|Food. 
[Can you tell us more about your escape? Why did you need to climb the embassy's wall in Beijing? Are all embassies protected by Chinese guards which makes it difficult for any North Koreans to seek asylum?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ltjg0/i_defected_from_north_korea_and_now_work_as_a/cc2rcnb?context=5)|Yes, the do. The the height of the embassy wall was low (about 2meter). All embassies are guarded by Chinese guards. I waited for the guards to change, and jumped over the far right corner. 
[Hello! How did daily life work? Similar to the rest of the world? What did people do for recreation in their free time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ltjg0/i_defected_from_north_korea_and_now_work_as_a/cc2qse8?context=5)|My daily life included going to work in an office at 8:30am where we often also had to go pave the military roads. We worked at the office until 6pm, got off and came back home to have dinner (if i had food, but if I didn't have food I just skipped). My office had about fifteen workers, but some men didn't go to work, instead going to the market. they had to pay money not to go to work. Generally I would have chats with friends play poker if i had free time. If I lost, I had to buy food (rice cakes, etc.)
[What one thing amazed you the most in the ""free world""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ltjg0/i_defected_from_north_korea_and_now_work_as_a/cc2kwul?context=5)|Hhh many things, too many to talk about it, But I would say I didn't need worry somebody watch me

[Where was your father from? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ltjg0/i_defected_from_north_korea_and_now_work_as_a/cc2sihd?context=5)|I shouldn't talk about that. 
[Did you or your friends ever talk ill of the NK regime in private?  How much of the propaganda did you believe?  Do you ever miss any aspect of North korea?  Did you ever have good times in North Korea? I can't imagine how anybody could be happy, being watched all the time.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ltjg0/i_defected_from_north_korea_and_now_work_as_a/cc2oc5o?context=5)|No, I never talked about problems of the regime serioucly.  I believed everything, to be honest. even never attempted to think differently about it.  I miss my sister. she is a family only alive in North Korea 
[Could you tell us a bit about NK's songbun system. How much does it still rule people's lives?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ltjg0/i_defected_from_north_korea_and_now_work_as_a/cc2luvd?context=5)|When I was in North Korea, universities in Pyongyang (such as Kim Il Sung and Teachers University) do not admit certain students based on their family backgrounds. Having South Korean relatives, or people who are associated with the South Korean army, or relatives in Japan, or ancestors who owned land in North Korea during Japanese colonialism makes for bad blood. If records are not confirmed, they're also considered a bad family. People are victimized by a past they have no control over and North Korea's unforgiving bureaucracy. For many, this is worse than being dead. 
[By ""If records are not confirmed"" do you mean somebody has to have a stamp of approval ""This person has a good family"" and if not then the ""default"" is that they don't?  Its always really horrible for people to be blamed for things that they were not responsible for. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ltjg0/i_defected_from_north_korea_and_now_work_as_a/cc2mrft?context=5)|Well, here are example I can say, in my elder sister's class, there is a student in good grade, but she could not go to a university. she said "" because of my family background"" 
[What is the Kim Jong Un regime's biggest weakness? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ltjg0/i_defected_from_north_korea_and_now_work_as_a/cc2lsw3?context=5)|Ignoring ordinary people.

Negative: If Reddit users saw ordinary peoples' lives outside North Korea's decorated farm villages (shown to foreign visitors) they'd be shocked. Even in Pyongyang's suburbs, there are places with severe poverty. 
[Hey, thanks for the AMA! I've always been interested in what people go through after getting into China from North Korea. How did the German embassy react to you seeking their help? Did it seem like they had a lot of prior experience with NK defectors? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ltjg0/i_defected_from_north_korea_and_now_work_as_a/cc2lcqe?context=5)|They gave me food while I was there for three days in the embassy and asked me a few questions to confirm I was from North Korea. They then negotiated with Chinese chief policeman, and Embassy staff took me to the Phillipines in order to hand me over to South Korean Embassy staff.  I felt like the German Embassy was totally surprised.

 |30 years ago, two communists from France and Peru went to North Korea volunteerly, but they were sent to prison camp due to their decretive talks on the bed ""North Korea is not really socialist country, but it is more like a country under the control of Kim Il Sung""  and the Frenchman is dead after comming out the camp 15 years later. Their story was published in the report of Amnesty International.

[Do you think, even now, that you're fully aware of the high level of manipulation of the NK government?

[How safe is North Korea?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ltjg0/i_defected_from_north_korea_and_now_work_as_a/cc2liww?context=5)|North Koreans do not have guns, so I never worried about being shot. Food safety is not guaranteed, and famine represents a grave threat.

Is there already a plan in place?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ltjg0/i_defected_from_north_korea_and_now_work_as_a/cc2riew?context=5)|South Koreans wouldn't welcome a mass of refugees because the South Korean goverment already provides them food aid and economic support. It represents a burden on the system.

Misionaries like Kenneth Bae are detained, and don't try to take photos that aren't allowed. And don't ask the instructors if you visit the world museum or history museum questions that assume North Korea invaded the South.  
[Are there any things that you miss about NK?

Growing up, I didn't even know I could cross the river to go to China. I just knew I could go to China 6 months before I crossed. But there are people who worked in Russia or Kuwait or Libya. To go abroad, you apply to the government and pay bribes to governors.

I'm just looking for some people to talk to via Reddit PM (more or less, it could be more or less, your call). Why Reddit PM? I don't generally give out my contact information until I really get to know others, so after some time, we can move onto something else (if you'd like, of course).

A bit about me, I'm a 20 year old student who's currently working at an internship. I'd rather be in school though. I live in Toronto, but that doesn't really matter since I'm kinda looking for an online friendship. 

If you're wondering what I look like, that too will have to wait. Like my contact information, I don't hand it out freely. HOWEVER, if you're really concerned, I can PM you a description (I don't know why it would matter though).

What else.. I like learning languages, but I haven't learned many. It would be neat if you could teach me a few words in your native tongue! As far as music goes, I'll listen to anything, really. Even if it's in a foreign language!

I'm not really a huge movie person, or TV person for that matter. I'm watching Suits though, and I think its awesome! If you have any recommendations, send them this way! :)

Games. Well, if you look at my username, you'll see that I Iike the Ace Attorney series! Sadly, I don't have a 3DS, so I don't know what I'm going to do when the fifth game comes out this fall. Speaking of fifth games coming out this fall.... GTA V! It's already preordered, and something that I'm REALLY looking forward to this month! 

Alright, I feel like I've been talking too much, so if there's anything else you wanna know, feel free to PM me!"

I am a first generation hispanic male if that matters...

Just curious if you all think I have ANY chance at all? Providence and Brown seem like such a nice place to explore academically and socially. I really want to go here.

1lxsee,1,2013-09-07,My story...,[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1lxsee/my_story/,"Hi there,

First of all, please excuse my English as it is my second language.
Brace yourselves, it's a long read.

Here's my story:

I'm 20 years old, male and not doing very well.
I suppose a bit of back-story is required...

So, basically the past 5 years have been terrible. It all started after dropping out of high-school, back when I was 15 years old. I had a great time in Elementary School (besides an open-heart surgery when I was 11 or so, but got out of it quite well with only a leaking valve) and the first 3 years of high-school. 

In my third year I was having some trouble (or at least I thought so back then) and became a somewhat rebellious teenager. At the time I wasn't too fond of my classmates, had a grudge against the system and felt a little depressed. However, I had an amazing mentor/counselor and History teacher. She was Asian, late 20's (I think) very nice and understanding and to this day still, by far the greatest person I've ever had the pleasure to meet. She gave me advice and like no other knew what I meant when talking about the problems I was dealing with. She let me change classes when I'd decided I wanted to follow a different school profile which is normally not possible (like economics), Suggesting that if I couldn't bring it up to go to school 5 days a week it was alright for me to skip a day (even though my parents wouldn't let me) and even visit me at home once to talk. 

Anyhow, the change of profile didn't work out as intended. Having entered an all girls class ultimately resulting in going back to my old class and   eventually refusing to go to school. After all these years this has been the worst mistake of my life and I still feel bad for letting her down like that without a chance to apologize. I haven't seen her since, miss her a lot and am obviously afraid to contact her again (I guess it would be kind of weird). I've mostly blamed myself for quitting school, but I've always felt my parents could have done a bit more. They never explained to me why it was so important or took the time to have a meaningful conversation with me. The only thing they did was scream at me and occasionally use force to get me out of bed for school.

The last quarter of the year I spend at some small school, doing nothing really besides attending. After that I went on to college starting an education where it was possible to enter without a degree. I quit about 3/4th of the year due to not finding a good internship and lack of interest. The year after that I took a few jobs at a couple of agencies, but because I couldn't always find work I was home quite a lot which resulted in my parents becoming agitated, which is understandable, but I hated the way they've dealt with it. Screaming, provoking, suggesting I'd kill myself by jumping in front of a train, those kind of things. I had no friends any more and suffered from loneliness the entire time. All the while thinking back on how it was before.

After that, at long last I got my high-school degree nevertheless. It was a horrible year with the worst classmates imaginable, but somehow I managed to go through with it. At the start of this year I've also developed some kind of social anxiety, agoraphobia or whatever you want to call it (I haven't told anyone about this yet, because I am ashamed of it). I felt out of place, my heart began to race, started sweating and shaking in social situations and often had a fight of flight response. After a while I became more afraid of the ""attack"" itself rather than anything else. The fear of fear more or less.

The year after I took another year of high-school in an adult class (the rest was around my age) to ensure I could start with the right education. My dream has always been to become a history teacher (I love history, explaining things and to be in a high-school environment) However, I had to quit because of travel time, social anxiety issues that left me extremely uncomfortable in class which in turn had a negative effect upon my concentration.

The rest of the year has been downright awful and I pretty much hit rock bottom. Unable to - or really had the motivation - to find work I fought a lot with my parents. My mother only works part-time, constantly screaming and doing all those things I've told before. She knew it didn't help, but she'd continue anyway. I even think she gets some sort of satisfaction from it. Even after asking multiple times to stop and be quiet in a polite way, to raising my voice to screaming and even after threatening to brake things in the house she still wouldn't stop. I normally then go for a bike ride or listen to music, but this one time it went wrong. She was uttering the most horrible insults and I hit her twice. She then called the police and I'd gone to jail for half a week, luckily acquitted afterwards. during my time in jail a social worker took advantage of my vulnerability by addressing the most personal issues and bribing me into telling her, otherwise she'd threaten to give negative advise to the judge.

While I regret my decision I'm still mad about the things she said to me and provoking me that much. I'm a very patient and quiet guy and it takes a lot to get under my skin like that. I would never hit anyone, especially not a woman, but I guess you'd have to know my mother to at least somewhat understand. Not only have I been in jail, I've read the statement of my parents they gave to the police and it's ten times worse than it really was. Like they're out to give me a criminal record. I couldn't visit home for a couple of weeks due to a restraining order and I basically had to live on the street. At least I had somewhere to sleep at a place (with a lot of junkies and whatnot). I could've stayed at relatives, but I didn't want them to go through the trouble of providing me shelter.

These were some of the worst weeks I've ever had. No computer, reasonable food, books, music, guitar etc. I started smoking and doing drugs for a while there, but quit as soon as I was aloud to go back home. 

Now I'll go into something that really bothers me. My parents accuse me of having autism (aspergers) and I disagree with them completely. The social worker agrees with them and forced me to have a few conversations with psychiatrists, again threatening me that if I wouldn't she'd advise to prolong the restraining order to the major. They both said at a first impression nothing seemed wrong with me and further investigation wasn't necessary. When I had a talk with the social worker later she claimed the exact opposite. Either she's lying to me or they both have been lying to my face. I've also noticed she has a way of changing someone's words, like she only hears what she wants to hear.

Anyway, I started an education again this year. It's not what I wanted, below my capabilities, not that interesting either and it'll take years to get to where I want to be. As it is I'm barely holding on. Living with my parents whom I despise (I can't afford to live on my own, because of school), following an education I don't want to, dealing with social anxiety issues and parents + a social worker who constantly want to label me for something I don't have. This bothers me a lot, it's insulting accusing someone with a disorder they don't have. They won't leave me alone, even though I can function properly without. 

The problems I'm having are different and a result of 5 horrendous years. They sometimes say every failure makes you stronger, but in my case it broke me. I was a normal and happy kid during elementary and high-school. Now I'm not the same any more, not being able to think positively.

I'm thinking back all the time how my life used to be, and how it would've been if I hadn't made that mistake 5 years ago to drop out of school. I even take bike rides a few times a week the exact same route as I used to go to high-school just to try and live in the past again. It reminds me of that Metallica song ""fade to black"". ""Things not what they used to be. Missing one inside of me""

I don't want therapy due to bad experiences with them in the past and I don't feel talking could make things better. Not for my depression or my social anxiety. I sort of know already what they'd say and I don't want to be dependent on medication. I also don't like what they do to your brain and the side effects they have (like ssri's or benzos)

So, that's basically my story. I have no idea why all of a sudden I felt the need to type and post it here. I've thought about suicide for a long time now. Hope was the only thing that kept me going, but it isn't really there at the moment. Suicide is harder than most people think. All of the things you still wanted to be a part of and realize you can't when you're no more and even then they're so far beyond your reach. I don't think it's worth it.

Some kind of miracle has to happen in the next few days to prevent me from taking my own life. All I know is the method I'll be choosing will be one of the most fatal. No attempt."

1lxq5l,9,2013-09-07,Why is it so difficult to get in touch with a politicians who actually make you feel heard and represented?,NumenSD,politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1lxq5l/why_is_it_so_difficult_to_get_in_touch_with_a/,"I'm a consultant who's looking to get into political consulting. One of the ways I thought would jump start my career would be find a major issue that politicians are having trouble agreeing on and solve the problem. I did exactly that with a bill called the Marketplace Fairness Act. 

Forgive this for being a little long but I know there are a lot of people who work on Capitol Hill who may read this and reading it in it's entirety will get the point across better and hopefully inspire change.

Now for those of you who don't know, the MFA is a bill regulating tax on internet and remote sales where the seller does not have a physical nexus in that state. As a small business owner of an online only retail site in California, I'm actually all for an internet sales tax for a majority of reasons, but the way the current bill is written would be burdensome and downright toxic for businesses like mine. 

After doing countless hours of research, writing a proposal, a SWOT analysis, and even rewriting the senate bill in it's entirety to be simplified, streamlined, and actually beneficial to large and small businesses alike as well as creating jobs as a byproduct, I proceeded to contact senator's offices who cosponsored the bill. 

Now I know that it's very difficult if not impossible to get in touch with an actual senator but figured their staff could handle the messages. I also know that the majority of people in politics worked their way from the bottom doing internships and working on campaigns. What I didn't expect was to encounter the disappointing general attitude and atmosphere of the political process.

By the numbers to give you an idea:

--I spoke to 26 senators' offices who had a vested interest in and/or cosponsored the MFA.

--All 25 offices wanted me to send over my proposal via email, mail, or fax.

--All 23 offices put me in touch with their respective LAs (legislative assistants) on the issue either directly or through voicemail. The remaining 3 were actually among the offices of the main proponents of the bail.  

--I corresponded directly with 11 of the LAs on the issue. They all liked the basics of my idea and encouraged me as well to send them the ideas, but 10 stated the party line is that politicians aren't in the position to give credit and/or recognition to constituents who help politicians solve problems. 3 of those corresponded further and actually tried to see if there was something they could do for me but came back empty handed.
All I'm left with is a single LA from a senator's office who I have an upcoming conference call with in the near future who is taking an extra step.

--I have also spoken with numerous senate and house committees as well as organizations corporations who are also proponents of the bill with great success speaking to those in charge. Unfortunately, none of them had enough power to influence the bill despite how much liked like to help me.

The biggest problem with innovation in America has a spillover effect to politics as well. Everybody wants the credit for themselves and see's it as either threatening to their job or their ego's if somebody else comes up with an idea they couldn't. Whatever happened to the times when those in power recognized achievements of those below them to send the message that ""I'm good at my job because I can both recognize and utilize the talent/genius of my employees/constituents."" This recent article exemplifies the issue. http://www.today.com/money/gen-y-bosses-entitled-out-themselves-study-says-8C11066147 

Now I understand some of these politicians may have been working on a project throughout their entire political career and that I may be young and seemingly inexperienced in the political arena. However, my ideas time and time again have proven viable and successful when implemented in a variety of fields and industries regardless of my level of experience in them. I wasn't asking to get paid or hired as a thank you for my idea. I simply wanted recognition and them scratching my back for my scratching theirs. I'd help them get this bill passed and they would help me get my dream job (either directly or through a letter of recognition or public statement).

Why are these actions so unprecedented in the political arena and why are politicians and their LA's so unwilling to be humble when it comes to furthering their political agendas? I'm trying to give these senators a silver bullet for getting the bill passed and only asking for recognition in return. 

I have read countless posts on reddit alone from fellow redditors who wrote their representatives only to receive a standardized response on the topic. They are here to represent us, but we do not feel represented or even heard from.

Luckily some of the LA's gave me some advice and contacts they had and I will be pursuing alternate methods such as getting independent articles published through various publications on the issue to bring awareness.

If there are a few pieces of wisdom I'd like to impart on all of you reading this, it's to never give up pursuing your dream job. As long as you have the know-how, there are many different paths you can take to accomplish your goals. While I haven't finished mine yet, I continue finding new avenues and making contacts in the process. In fact, my journey has just begun. "

Thursday is a very awaited day for our champion. In the morning, he didn't train. He dedicates himself to taking a rest and a good sleep, both things that he very much deserves.  

As for the work for the rest of the team, it is not too different from his. Some spent the time communicating with family and friends, others slept late, and yours truly, this pseudo-journalist , trying to edit some pictures. Yerba Mate (an herb like tea infusion, a very common beverage to pass the time in Argentina) while listening to the great Polaco Goyeneche (a tango singer). They are keeping me both company, which makes me feel closer to Argentina.  

The action begins around noon. Colo (you might have seen a ginger in Matthysse's team, that's him who he referse to) tries to vary lunch for Lucas. Grilled fish with white rice and baby carrots, and a lemonade. It doesn't seem very appetizing, yet with good seasoning - garlic, lemon, ginger and pepper - everything changes.  

In the afternoon, the plan indicates that there will be a hand exercise session with Cuty (trainer). The idea is to work only on combination movements and speed repetition exercises. After, two rounds of strict defense and counter attack with Colo.

To the gentle handshakes and the looks of admiration on the behalf of the little ones at the gym, there's an addition which consists of a video producer and his team. They had the thumbs up to film a small film that they would then gift us. Warm up session and hand wrapping are done in between jokes and laughs, this time, with more cameras around us, eager to shoot.

http://campeonesenelring.com.ar/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/101_0060.jpg

After the first round, the speed and power of the punches stop the other people training around. Everyone's observing Lucas' work, and some cannot seem to hide their astonishment. In each of the breaks, Cuty (trainer) had a comment about the strength of Lucas' punches. The comment is followed by a complaint and a little gesture of pain, but the satisfaction is fully there. We're very happy.   .

http://campeonesenelring.com.ar/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/101_0033.jpg

http://campeonesenelring.com.ar/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/101_0055.jpg

The day of the fight is coming near, and with it, the culmination of a phase of training with specific exercises. We are a bit tired, yet with a great sense of happiness and joy, knowing that we are near the end and that everything has been done correctly. We have prepared an excellent boxer, with outstanding virtues. 

The physical demands diminish in intensity and volume, the technique movements are sharpening little by little, and the strategies began to gain territory in the space of our thinking/brains. We all think and live boxing, every single second.

From the social media, we can read encouraging words, and infinite shout outs. The anxiety and fervor is growing in Argentina. We have and feel a lot of support from all the country. This only pushes us forward. 

We are ready for a war, a war that will originate between 16 ropes. For we have given it our all, including that which we did not imagine we had.

In only one night, and perhaps in a brief moment of it, everything will end.

The last days are passing by, and I remember a reflexion/thoughht of a boxing trainer in Argentina. For this occasion, it comforts me and feeds my soul. And I hope it will also be a message for the Garcias.  

""We have not prepared an athlete that will play, this boxer is a warrior.  

 We do not consider him an athlete, because in boxing, there's no PLAYING AROUND"". "

Me [22F] Ex [22M]


So reddit, I definitely dodged a bullet on this one. So after that last conversation with him a week ago (we broke up a little over a week ago), I went NC and got myself back in order. Finished up some projects at my internship, joined a new club at University, hanging out a lot with friends.


I had plans to go over to my twin brother's house on Friday to drink with a him and his girlfriend and a bunch of other friends (I think I mentioned in the comments that my ex and my brother are roommates in a house of 5 people). My ex had been telling my brother for days now that he would not be there because he was leaving for his home town hrs before that. 20 min before I was supposed to arrive my brother texted me and told me my ex had decided he was going to stay for the festivities.....and bring his new 18 year old girlfriend (they decided to make it official last week)....


This is something I had been looking forward to this week and I was already dressed up and heading out the door, so I decided to go anyway. To my surprise I was actually OK. It did bother me when he started throwing out innuendos and talking about how much he wanted to sleep with her right in front of me....a little...but I wasn't so much hurt as thinking ""wow, he's being a grade A asshole considering he's crashing my plans"". After talking to the girl I came to realize that all that Facebook crap about how happy she is with him (she posted that right after we broke up) was more stupidity/the fact that she's a highschooler with an equal maturity than anything else. I'm not angry at her anymore. 


When they left the room my brother told me that my ex had talked the girl into an open relationship (he wouldn't agree to a closed one, she thinks she loves him and so she agreed) while she lives and goes to school in a different city. He can sleep with whoever he wants and they can be together (and facebook official exc) when in the same city. And apparently in the 1 week they have been together he has used that ""freedom"" privilege with 3 different girls that aren't her....


So basically he is a giant ass hat who is unmotivated to go back to school and is sooner or later going to break this poor girl's heart. I never in a million years imagined he could act like this when we starting dating. I'm sad that it took seeing how her relationship is going to be to make me realize it. Time to move on and find an actual good guy!


(She texted me after that night, must have got my phone number off him and said she really liked me, was sorry how things panned out and never meant to hurt me, and asked if we could be friends. Highschool mentality right there lol. I have nothing against her but I am in no way shape or form mature enough to handle that sure fire bag of drama so I just chose not to reply)


tldr: I am sooooo much better off without him!


*Edit* 

Thanks for the vote of confidence guys. Everyone needs it once and a while and I've had a hard time finding someone to be able to talk my feelings/hurt/surprise/anger (its only been a bit over a week now) out to because we have soooo many mutual friends and I don't want to bad mouth him to them, its not exactly classy. Random internet people rule for frustration venting!

Hater's gonna hate but everyone needs a someone to vent to and I would rather express my frustrations to people who don't know me than involve a bunch of mutual friends in drama that makes life complicated"
1lxira,3,2013-09-07,Not just the same old depression anymore..,fuckthecorporations,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1lxira/not_just_the_same_old_depression_anymore/,"I don't really know how to say it elegantly... but I feel like I've lost touch with my true self..
The first half of this you can skip.
Its my childhood issues, nbd.

As a kid, I looked different. Kids are mean, yadda yadda, made fun of my curly hair, my colorful clothing, my lanky-underweight body, my crooked teeth, the way I talked, my bucktoothed smile, and of course my glasses. (I'm female, so this gave me a lot of issues with my looks, that I still somewhat have..)
This followed me into highschool, long after I straightened up and started looking normal. 
Kids are just plain mean. I'll leave it at that.
Obviously I didn't make friends.
Well, I did, but they made fun of me, so I guess they weren't really friends..
I was very depressed most of the time, and spent most of my free days online alone, or creating things by myself.
My parents had very busy lives, but we did have dinner together  most nights, so it wasn't all bad.
This kept me happy. I learned to love my time alone, despite hating who I was. I'm still an introvert, and love it. I wish extroverts (basically everyone) understood why.
I hated school.
I would cry and scream and threaten to do terrible things to myself if my parents made me go.
I was so afraid and tired of being picked on daily, I guess they thought it was a phase, and I was only in middle school.
By high school, I had straight teeth, flat-ironed my hair, and became a goth kid. Oddly enough I was finally accepted as a person, and was pretty happy, until the bullying started again.

I never overcame it, dropped out, and homeschooled myself to get my diploma.

Fast forward though a few (mentally) abusive relationships, and one physically abusive relationship, my parents divorcing, living with a girlfriend that treated me like shit and put me $2500 in debt, and I'm 22 years old, with the man of my dreams.

And I'm seriously depressed.

But this is a different depressed than normal.
I'm used to, 
""My gf/bf/the world hates me, I have no reason to live, everyone hates me, it actually feels good to hurt myself, maybe I should end it.""
I would cry in a closet with a knife in my hand or some stupid shit, then start doing things to distract myself, go through all the motions, and eventually come out feeling on top of the world, because I just don't give a fuck.
I can work through these feelings because I've beaten them so many times before.. I used to feel so strong..

Things are different now.
About 2 months ago, I quit my serving job at a restaurant where I made decent money.
I hated it. The people, the stress, the rudeness, carpal tunnel, the EVERYTHING.
I lost a LOT of weight over the holiday season, and weighed 95lbs when I quit. I'm currently struggling to gain, but I feel like no matter how much I eat, I always come up at 97lbs.
I've been called everything in the book from anorexic to being told I'm not a real woman because I lack my mother's curves. And this coming from people I don't even know.
I feel as though this just feeds my depression.. the urge to fit in and feel normal for once.
But that's not what I want at all.

I also quit my birth control after 4 years, and decided to go organic when I met my current boyfriend. 
A good decision, until my ungodly PMS showed up.
This consists of cramping that causes me to writhe on the floor in pain, unable to move or speak until I can get a few ibuprofen in me, which don't even seem to work anymore.
My period is also never on time, and causes me massive anxiety/violent anger/ and suicidal thoughts that are harder and harder to suppress each month, and seem to be tearing my  boyfriend and I apart slowly every 3 weeks.
He can't handle me anymore after 2 years, and I sure as hell don't blame him. Our 2 year anniversary is in a month, and he has everything he could ever want, I feel like a bum and an idiot for not being able to afford anything, or even know what to get him that he hasn't already bought. I'm so fucking stupid.
He does so many nice things for me and I just leech and self-hate, and do NOTHING all day.

Now add that on top of the fact that I've been to college twice for stupid ideas that I ended up hating or not being able to get a job with, I'm broke, in debt by a lot, no REAL education (degree/diploma), and all I want to do is create.

I'm an artist. I paint, every day of my life. 
I also sculpt, I make jewelry, I illustrate, I fabricate, I love to do it all, and I do it well. Its my everything.
I work with other local artists, and make money every once-in-a-while.. I even have a page on facebook and an etsy store that I'd made a few grand in sales.
For awhile I had so much motivation, and was starting to finally get up..

But suddenly, I feel nothing.
All I can think about is politics, and taking in information, and crying over the dying people of the world, and everything else that seems to be going on that my friends and family don't care too much about.
I feel like a tiny grain of sand in a giant pool of unending consciousness, not even a dot in the timeline of the infinitely changing history of the universe.. I feel like nothing.
I cry, and I don't understand why I'm crying.
All the beautiful scenes of intergalactic heavenly bodies melding into an incomprehensible rainbow quilt of colors melting into the skyline of the nameless planet I saw.. the feelings of love and beauty and hope that came along.. the motivation to keep pushing forward.. its all gone.
All replaced with thoughts of money.
I don't want the measley green scraps of government-issued currency that run my entire world. I can't eat them, I can't plant them, I can't wear, or craft, or use them for really anything.
They just pay my bills, and determine my monetary value (which is about $4.25 an hour).
Yet, that's all I think about because I know that is the only way to keep living, to collect it so I can give it away once more..
Its a stupid problem to have.. it hurts me in a way that nothing else can. I constantly devalue myself and I can't stop.

It has drawn the life out of me.
All I can think about when I create now is,""How much $$$ can this make me?"" ""Will people like this enough to pay for it?"" ""Should I make things I don't like so people who do like it will give me money?"" ""Should I make this cheaper so its more appealing?""


And now when I pick up the pen and paper, I draw only blanks.
I guess that's a fitting punishment for trying to commercialize and cheapen something that should be a passion, not a job.

After losing my imagination.. I feel as though I've lost it all.
I don't dream anymore. I can't dance with my hoop because I end up doing the same few moves over and over as mind mind struggles to find something fresh.
The colors of the earth have lost their luster, and I find myself sinking into the same monotonous thought pattern as the rest of the dreary, gray business world..

I would go back to school, but I'd have to take out crazy loans, and I STILL don't know what I want to do for a career.
I was pressured into making a decision for college, blew my prepaid on Pastry School (Which I LOVED and miss dearly), now I've got a great portfolio, but no experience in the real world.
I haven't been able to find a job that didn't involve long shitty hours+shitty pay/ mass production of whatever (I'm sure my carpal tunnel would LOVE that), without experience.
Tried the college thing again, CNA school. 
Internship at the nursing home made me bawl my eyes out every night when I got home at the way they treat their residents.
Graduated, everyone in the class except one woman failed the licensing test.
Decided not to waste $150+ of my money, and worked waitressing instead for a year or two.
Now I'm here.

I have the most amazing boyfriend in the world, and  my friends and family are great.
But every time I try to talk about my depression it turns into, ""Why can't you just be happy? Just get over it. You have nothing to be sad about.""
But there are SO many reasons to be sad, so many reasons to care... they just have little or nothing to do with me. 
Now I wonder if I just plain CAN'T feel happiness anymore, or if I've forgotten maybe..
I haven't felt excited about anything or happy to do something.. not even a little.. in ages, I hate leaving the house because all I can think is ""I should be at home making money. If I'm not doing that, I'm worthless. I'm useless. I'm leeching from everyone around me and they hate it.""
So I fake another smile, steal someone else's expression so its appropriate to how I'm supposed to feel..

I really don't know where I'm going with this.
I just wanted to write it all out.. I've never taken depression meds, or even been diagnosed or treated, despite the fact that I'm the only one in my family who hasn't. I have nothing else to do but feel bad for myself, which makes me feel like even worse of a person, because my sadness is unjustified and selfish.

I should just get another fucking job so I can make some quick cash, work the 25-hour weeks so they don't have to give me insurance, and pretend I'm going to be able to afford retirement one day when my parents, who are as poor as I am, are long gone.. god I'm scared..

I guess you can say whatever you want at this point. maybe give me some pointers on how to not be such a self-loathing, leechy person.
I don't even know where all this self hate comes from anymore, its like mouth diarrhea. 
I want to be understood.
I wish I could get my boyfriend to read that hyperbole and half comic.(http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2013/05/depression-part-two.html)
 Maybe he would understand a little bit, but he admitted he doesn't really want to understand, he wants me to get better/over it. 
I feel like that's how everyone feels. Even me.
Not that it matters,
I don't feel much anymore. :(

But a month ago in a bicycle accident I broke both legs....after 3 weeks at the hospital I'm back home and besides not moving very well(or at all) as you can imagine, I don't have much pain and if I dont miss my physiotherapy sessions I will be walking and running in less than year!



Now comes my problem I want to work, but no1 will hire me while I'm recovering...I live in Portugal, in case you dont know our unemployment is close to 30%, 45% between 20-30 years old....So yeah, finding a job here is super hard atm, now imagine at my corrent condition :\



So I had this idea last night, I was uninstalling some games and programs at my pc and I saw: ""Diablo 3""! I haven't play this in months...and then it hitted me! This game as a real money auction house, since I'm not be doing anything for the last couple of months, why not?


I spoke to a friend about my idea and he told me straight way, if an1 knows how to make some income from this game I bet you can find him on reddit. So I made an account, because I hadn't one, and here I am :D



Before I start asking for tips, I wont be lying to you. I wont say I will starv if I dont get money from the game or I will be living in poverty...I live on my own, I still have some savings and my parents will help me with everything I need! BUT if I can contribute with something I will feel better, I will feel useless and its not that stressful for my parents :). And D3 seems like a good idea, since I will spent many hours playing games, at least I can try and put some usefulness on that!


So redditors, can you guys help me?

Im looking for: tips, guides, item lists that sell good, nice builds to farm, best class, pretty much everything since I'm a noob at the game. I did normal difficulty and the next one on a Monk and I stopped.


Thanks in advance and for the ones who read the all thing my big thanks!"

I spend time reading and complaining about the company, but emotionally unaffected by its close proximity. A sort of out of mind in plain sight scenario. I live in University Housing next door to Altria HQ, and was staring into the windows where the labs are and started wondering, ""would I be a total tool if petitioned for an internship?"" While I am very active in the vaping community, introducing people trying to quit analogs to alternatives and trying to change the image of vapers at school, I can't help but want to make a larger impact from the bowels of the system. I am working on my chemistry and mathematics degrees (just recently added math) so the benefit would be two fold. I would be able to gain valuable experience, a kickass resume addition and possibly help change corporate opinion (the young intern who knows more about the vaping equipment than the CEO's trying to market them). Would this count as selling out, or would I eventually be forced to sell out? **Opinions**

1lxee0,3,2013-09-07,"[NY] ex-boyfriend moved out, stole my bike, hasn't paid me 8 months rent.",legalthr0waway,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1lxee0/ny_exboyfriend_moved_out_stole_my_bike_hasnt_paid/,"The short version: My boyfriend (19, M) and I (22, M) rented an apartment together from January to the end of August. From June through August, I was doing an internship in another state.  We both signed the lease, but I paid the rent in advance. He was supposed to pay me his half of the rent each month.  In August, we broke up (for a variety of reasons - he dropped out of school, didn't find a job, wouldn't pay rent, I wanted to date a girl, etc), and when I returned to our - now just mine - apartment at the end of August, I found the place a mess, and my bike missing. He admitted to taking my $700 bicycle in a text message.  I called the police, they suggested telling him he had two weeks to get me my bike back, and if he doesn't, I should go down to the courthouse, file a small-claims against him for the missing rent money and get him arrested for stealing my bike.
What should I do?

Longer version:
He and I met July 2012. We spent August together then went off to school - I went off to study abroad in Europe, he went to a small college in the middle of nowhere.  We keep talking online, he talks about how much he hates his school and wants to transfer to a school in the city where I go to school or just drop out and find a job in the city where I got to school, I tell him I'm planning on finding an apartment to live off campus.

By October, he's strongly considering moving in with me, we have the following exchange on skype: Me: ""Anyway, for finances, I want you to be as independent of me as possible. So, we'll keep separate accounts, we'll split food and rent down the middle, stuff like that. Obviously if you find yourself short on rent, I'll cover it, but as much as possible, we'll keep it separate."" Him: ""agreed""

In December, I'm still in Europe, but I have my friends at school looking for apartments for me. They find one I like, negotiate a significant decrease in rent for paying rent in advance.  I pseudo-sign the lease while abroad, pay the first month rent and security deposit, then pay the rest when I arrive back in the US. He and I sign the actual lease upon arriving.

First few months go well, he's dropped out of school and is looking for work, I'm studying. I get an internship in California for the summer, his job search continues to meet with failure, is unwilling to go back to school. Our relationship begins to deteriorate.  While in California, I finally get sick of his shit, decide to break up with him. I let him stay in the apartment until I get back. At this point, I don't care about him not paying me for rent, utilities, internet, food, his psychologist, or anything else. I just want him gone.

The day before I come back, I get a text from him.
&gt;Him: ""Uhm. I got a tiny bit of bad news.""

&gt;Me: ""okay, what is it?""

&gt;Him: ""Your bike is gone and I'm getting stalked.""

&gt;Me: ""What?""

&gt;Me: ""Why is my bike gone?""

He tells me some guy he hooked up with while I was in California stole my bike the day before, and that he called the police about it.  I called the police upon arriving back, find that he never talked to the police.
I try to talk to my ex, he keeps dodging my phone calls and replying cryptically. I call the police to file a report about my bike being stolen. I also contact university security to report it being stolen and to get the description of the bike from when I registered it with them (including serial number).  The police come over, suggest I send him the following text:

&gt;Me (advised to text by the police): ""I filed a police report, the police have advised me to ask you for my bike back or failing that to sue you in small claims court for $2600 in unpaid rent.""
Him: ""Wait. Sue me. Lmfao. Legalthr0waway you paid the rent full. I never signed ANYTHING that says I have to pay you. So good luck with that one. Ill try to contact the bike stealer. To be honest I actually KNOW this guy. Let him borrow the bike. He never gave it back. I didn't want to throw him under the bus. But since you're being the largest asshole on this side of the earth ill try to talk to him.""

&gt;Me: ""You loaned out my bike!?""

&gt;Him: ""What fucking part of I'm having lunch with my parents do you not fucking understand.""

&gt;Me: ""The police are in my driveway right now, I don't care about your lunch.""

&gt;Me: ""And Officer [blank] would like to speak with you.""

&gt;Him: ""That's cool. I'm not answering my phone until I am done with lunch, you arrogant ass.""

&gt;Him: ""Here's what happened. I loaned the bike to a guy named [blank]. Genuinely nice kid. You may hit him up on grindr eventually.  But he didn't have a car and needed a way to get to class for a couple days until he got one. I told him just use my bike. Make sure to return it and he never did.""

&gt;Him: ""This happened like a week and a half ago.""

&gt;Me: ""Well, how are you going to get it back for me?""

&gt;Him: Says he has no contact with the guy, describes him, blah, blah, blah

&gt;Me: ""Okay, so here's what's going to happen. You have two weeks, starting Monday, to get my bike back. If I do not have it by that time, I'm going down to the courthouse with the report Officer [blank] gave me, and I will ask for a warrant for your arrest for the bike, and a small claims judgement for the rent you didn't pay.  If I do have my bike back before then, then I don't care and I'll toss the report out and small claims stuff out.""

&gt;Me: ""So I don't care how you reach him, but you better reach him""

&gt;Him: ""You're going to get me arrested for a bike I don't even have? Seriously legalthr0waway?""

&gt;Me: ""I trusted you with that bike. You didn't get it back to me. It's that simple.""

&gt;Him: ""Plus you'd sue me. when you know I have NO money.""

&gt;Me: ""It's incentive to get me my bike.""

&gt;Him: ""After this if you contact me at all I'm getting a restraining order.

&gt;Me: ""I'm just doing what the police officer recommended I do.""

&gt;Him: ""Well there's no proof for an arrest and there's no signatures for me to be sued. GG.""


So, I have those text messages, I have him on skype promising to pay half the rent, I know he signed the lease (the copy of the lease stored in the apartment is missing, I'm calling my landlord to get another copy), I have the police officer's name, number, and case reference number, and I have the registration information of my bike.

If I show up to the courthouse with this next week, can I get him arrested? Can I sue him in small claims court? Will I win?  Any and all advice is welcome (and no, I don't have money for a real lawyer)."

This may end up being a pretty long post, so if you got the time to read it, I would really, really appreciate it.

Theres this girl I like and possibly more than that, let's call her Sarah for the sake of anonymity and being able to refer to them by a name. Regardless, I met this girl in the beginning of the school year, and I didn't pay much notice to her. However, she became more outgoing around February, and I started to notice her a lot more, and by god was she amazing. This was the first girl I had really liked, so I was nervous and didn't know what to do. About a month later, a friend I have turned out to like Sarah, so I kinda backed off a bit. He never really tried anything, he wimped out quite a bit, but man did I want to ask her out. On the school trip, she asked me and a couple of friends who we liked, but my friend was there, so I couldn't really answer it with ""you"". I just said I didn't and left it at that. About a week later I asked my friend if he was cool with me trying to ask her out, and he said I could go for it. I asked her out with the words ""Do you wanna hang out sometime"" not realizing that this wasn't totally asking her out on a date. She said sure and we planned to go see The Internship. That was great, but I started to realize slowly that she didn't think of this as a date. I then straight up asked her over skype 'Will you be my girlfriend'. Sarah seemed really really flattered, but said no. Her reasoning was that we were going to be going to different high schools this year (We just graduated 8th grade) and she didn't want an internet only relationship since she had some issues with that in the past. I understood, but we still remained great friends. She's an awesome friend let me tell you.

This is where things get more complicated. Hold onto your hats kids. Over summer she said to me something along the lines of 'Do you want to have a kissing only FwB thing'. I turned this down since she really didn't seem to want a relationship, and she seems to have accepted that. I have some friends that I talked to and showed some conversations and they said that she clearly liked me a lot. We decided to hang out on Labor Day. We baked brownies and that was amazing, but when I managed to get her alone in my room, I managed to get my first kiss with her. Oh my god, that feeling will be remembered for a long time. We talked about it later, and she said she wasn't ready for a relationship. Sarah gave me some pretty good reasons here. The main ones being that she feels that with some emotions she's been having that it would just blow up in our faces and she didn't want to lose me as a friend. The other one is that she has feelings for this girl she knows over Skype who lives in the Netherlands. [Worth noting here that she is bisexual, she told me this after we'd been talking for a bit] This confuses me even more since she said she didn't want an internet only relationship. 

For around a week she kept talking about the kiss and how amazing it was and how she still is having a hard time believing it happened. I figured by this that she was fine with me possibly doing it again. Fuck was that a mistake. We were chilling yesterday and we were cuddling on the couch watching Netflix, and I tried but she pulled away. She said she felt that doing that would be making a decision so she didn't want to do it. I told Sarah I understood entirely and didn't mean to make her uncomftorable(spelling).

For about a week now I've been crying myself to sleep. I like this girl so damn much, but I know I can't be with her, but we still talk all the time and have fun together.  I feel like this is almost worse than breaking up. We both acknowledge the feelings are there but she has reasons against it. It just hurts sometimes.

Sorry for the long rant. I just needed to let it out. If anyone has any advice, it's appreciated. It's not necessary though. Thanks for reading. :)"

Two years ago, I was in high school. I had everything. An amazing girlfriend whom my parents adored - marriage potential. Top of my class, and known by almost everyone in the school. I was having the time of my  life - going out to fuck around with my friends on the daily, enjoying my youth. I graduated with greatest honors, 4.4+ GPA, got into a HYPSM school, and a (honestly unnecessary) full-ride scholarship.


Freshman year was so rough. Academically, I was underperforming. I was unsuccessful in finding a new base of friends. As a result, I spent hours and hours every day on Reddit. It was easier than the inevitable awkwardness that comes with seeking new friends. 


My relationship with my now ex-girlfriend deteriorated. We were supposed to be good FUCKING friends. My stupid ass just had to bring up some old issues and fucked it all up. You wouldn't want to stay friends with a depressed, angsty, BPD friend either. Now we're not on speaking terms, and she wants absolutely nothing to do with me. 


No summer internship, and I spent my summer at home. What a fucking disgrace. Freeloading off my parents, even though I'm a legal adult now. Did nothing all summer. 


Now sophomore year. I tried rushing a frat and didn't get a bid. I'm living on the most unsocial floor of my new dorm, in the exact same situation I was in last year. 


I really don't know what to do from here. Why are friends so fucking hard to find? And why are these other fuckers so smart? I feel like I have nothing in my life, and nothing is rewarding. 


Fuck this cycle. Dull melancholy &gt; self-pity &gt; brief burst of angry motivation &gt; repeat ad inifinitum. Someone help. 


TLDR: I think I have mental issues, and being in college is not helping me.


Also, if you know who I am. Friend or family. Ask me if it's me and I'll tell you honestly. Life has been tougher than I have been letting on. "

I've got a solid GPA (3.97), and what I think is good work experience: 2 years experience as VP of Business in Student Government (by the time I graduate), an intern at a small local accounting firm, and 3 years experience as a Peer Tutor. 

I feel like my resume is competitive, but the problem is the career services here is as bad as you can imagine. No connections to good jobs, so I have to find them myself. I've been looking at the Big 4, but each firm's website makes it impossible to find any contact information to send in resumes for an entry-level position. Other firms almost always want that 150 hour requirement before getting the job, and I'll be at around 140 when I graduate. I've also looked at the internships for the Big 4, but it looks like I'm too late for them as I graduate in May. None of them would come to this campus anyway.

I could go for my Masters, but I don't want to spend all that money if I can have a strong career progression if all I need is my CPA. If that's the case then it'd be a lot easier to just take a few junk classes at a community college to get to that 150 limit. 

Also I want to say that I do love the college I'm going to. It sounds like I'm being really negative, but if I didn't go here then I wouldn't have had as many opportunities to be competitive out of college. It's got its bad points, but I wouldn't trade it for any other place.

I'm interesting, more specifically, in auditing or forensic accounting, So, what should my next step be? How do I go about finding contacts when I don't have any and my Professors don't have any for the area I'm looking at? Should I just go for my Masters? Am I being too picky about what I'm looking for? I feel like I've just ended up at a giant roadblock.

We currently have 56 students signed up, which is exactly 1 charter bus of students. Normally a school would start pushing people into a wait list at this point, but considering that we went from 8 total students to filling a bus in 48 hours I have decided to push for a second bus. 

**So, what is MHacks?**

MHacks is a hackathon being held in Ann Arbor, Michigan for 36 hours spanning September 20 - 22. There will be over 1,200 students attending from around the world with a prize pool of more than $30,000. After the hackathon you will then have the opportunity to meet with recruiters from companies like Facebook and Github as well as many venture capitalists and start up incubators. 

**Why should I go to MHacks?**

If the idea of staying up for 36 hours straight (not required) with your friends working towards a common goal sounds exciting to you then you'll enjoy MHacks. If you love coding, developing with Arduino or Raspberry Pi, and the feeling of making something new you should go to MHacks. Finally, if you want to have the opportunity to network with students from around the world, have a chance at getting an internship or a job at one of the sponsoring companies, or you want to create your own business MHacks is for you.

**So, what is provided for attendees?**

Transportation, food, drinks, showers, and shelter (the hackathon location will have a sleeping area) are all provided with absolutely no charge to any attendees.

**I'm not registered for MHacks and they're sold out what do I do?**

Fear not! If you are on a bus heading to MHacks you are 100% guaranteed entry into the hackathon regardless of your current registration status.

**I have a friend at another university that would also like to go, can they travel on our bus?**

Yes! If you or a friend go to another university you can sign up for a spot on one of our buses. Our bus form only requires a .edu email address NOT a vt.edu or a VT student id. I realize that there might be students at other universities that cannot get transportation to MHacks and as such we have opened our buses for them! The only requirement is that the student provides their own transportation to get to Virginia Tech before the bus departs the morning of September 20th.

**Will I have to miss class for this?**

If you have classes on Friday beyond an 8 AM, then yes you probably will. I'd advise that you notify your professor(s) immediately and explain your situation. Most (unfortunately not all) professors should be understanding given nearly 2 weeks of notice.

**Ok, so where do I sign up?**

We have a facebook event page here: https://www.facebook.com/events/534213639984900/
Please sign up for the event to keep up with updates (VERY IMPORTANT!) and reserve your seat through the bus sign up form found on that page! The bus form is first-come, first-serve so there is a wait list and you want to sign up ASAP to guarantee that you will have a seat.

**If you have any questions post them below or on the event page and I will do my best to answer them.**

Thanks,

Ben Johnston

**EDIT:** I will be adding more Q&amp;A's as I think of them. 

**What is the wait list cut off?**

The cut off is about 110 students. We are currently wait listing students, if you have not received a ""Wait List Notification"" or a similar email then you are not on the wait list. If you are on the wait list I will update you as positions change and will send you an email once you are off of the wait list and have a seat. 

**Can graduate students attend?**

Graduate students will only be admitted on a case by case basis. Email either me (benjdj6@vt.edu) or Jouella (jojofabe@vt.edu) if you are a grad student wishing to attend.

**What do I need to bring?**

Laptop, charger, anything to keep you entertained on the bus, at least 1 change of clothing, toiletries, finally food and water for the bus (we may make a food stop yet to be decided).

**What is the purpose of the last box on the form?**

That is for you to list your teammates if one or all of your teammates do not have a ticket for MHacks already.

**How do teams work? Do I need to be in one?**

Teams are groups of 2-4 students that are working on the same project and are completely voluntary. In order to form a team you simply agree to work together, no paperwork involved!

**Where can I find teammates?**

Post on our event page for now if you're looking for a teammate. List what your skills are or if you have a project idea state what skills you require from your teammates. We will be making a more official format for finding teammates soon.

**How will I know if I have a seat?**

By September 14th we will be able to send out confirmation emails to all students that have a seat. Once you receive this email you will have 24 hours to RSVP. If you do not reply you will lose your seat!

**Where do I sleep?**

From what we've been told there should be air mattresses and other sleeping amenities so you should not be forced to sleep on the floor.

**When do we leave VT and when will we get back?**

The current plan is to leave around 11 AM September 20th, and to be back by 8-9 PM September 22nd. This is subject to change based on bus availability and of course traffic."
1lwt7a,324,2013-09-07,History Jobs AMA: We’re 15 people who have jobs using history and you can Ask Us Anything!,caffarelli,teenagers,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1lwt7a/history_jobs_ama_were_15_people_who_have_jobs/,"**Hello new visitors! Most of the panel is not checking this any more, so if you want to talk to someone, shoot them a PM!** 

Hello /r/teenagers! We’re a bunch of people from /r/AskHistorians and we’d be happy to answer any questions you might have about how you can work with history. Want to know what an archaeologist actually does? Wondering what degrees will get you a job touching all the old stuff at the museum? Just looking for some proof for your parents that you can keep yourself fed with history degree before you go to college? It’s all free for the asking! 

You can address questions to one person in particular, to type of job, or to the panel at large, whatever you’d like. As you can see we have a global coalition of history here, so not all the panel will be here all at the same time, please be patient for your answers from particular people! 

**The Professional Historian:**

* **/u/itsallfolklore: Historian, USA:** For thirty years, I administered a state office dealing with historic preservation, advocating the preservation of historic buildings and archaeological sites. I also sat on numerous state and federal boards and committees and published ten books and dozens of articles until recently retiring. I currently serve as the executive director of a non-profit organization that works on historic preservation and archaeological projects. My degrees are in history and anthropology, but I emphasized folklore, studying in Europe and North America.

**The Jr High/High School History Teacher:** 

* **/u/HannibalElephant: Middle School Humanities Teacher, USA:** This will be my third year teaching public school, and my first year teaching 7th-8th graders. For the last two years, I was teaching 9-11th grade History. This year, I teach humanities, which means I teach geography, history, and writing, all in one wonderful class. I have my BA in History from the University of Colorado, Boulder, with plans to get my MA in Educational Management, to move on to an administrative role in a school, such as a principal or a dean. I am in my early-mid twenties, and I am single, and I love every day of my job.

**The History Professors:** 

* **/u/ProfessorRekal: Assistant Professor of American History, USA:** I teach a range of American and some European history courses at a small liberal arts college. My principal duties are teaching, preparing for lectures, advising students, participating in the community life of the college, and research and publishing on the my academic specialties (World War II, the Civil Rights Movement). I'm in my third year as a professor. Before that I taught at a big American public university as a graduate student. Like most full-time professors (and a lot of part-time instructors) I have a PhD., Master's, and Bachelor's degree. Before entering academia, I worked as a Director of Admissions at a boarding school. I'm a single guy in my mid-30's. Life is good. 

* **/u/Raaaghb: Assistant Professor, USA:** I am a history professor at a public research university in a Midwestern city. As a professor I spend about half of my time teaching courses and half of my time doing research and writing articles and books. I have a BA with majors in History and Geography, MA in Middle Eastern Studies, and a PhD in History. I'm in my mid-thirties, married, and we have no children.

* **/u/skedaddle: University Lecturer, UK.** There are two sides to my job: research &amp; teaching. During term time I spend most of the week writing lecturers, teaching classes, marking essays, meeting students, and doing administrative tasks. I spend the rest of my time doing original academic research. I work on the history of nineteenth century Britain and America, with a particular focus on journalism, jokes, and other forms of Victorian pop culture. This usually involves looking through archives (both physical and digital), analyzing evidence, reading the work of other historians, writing books and articles, preparing grant applications, speaking at conferences, and the occasional bit of media work. I've been published in several academic journals, written a piece for [The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/oct/08/chillax-emma-thompson-slang-english-language), and been interviewed by [The Times](http://www.digitalvictorianist.com/2011/12/the-jokes-of-christmas-past/). I have a BA in History, an MA in Victorian Studies, and a PhD in History. I'm 27, recently married, and I've been working as a lecturer for 18 months. In my spare time I play video games, walk, watch cricket, and feed my addiction to buying old newspapers on ebay. You can read more about me on [my blog](http://www.digitalvictorianist.com/), follow me on twitter (@DigiVictorian), or check out my profile on [AskHistorians](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/profiles/skedaddle)!

**The Archaeologists**

* **/u/polkadot8: Archaeologist, Canada:** I work in the public sector of archaeology, doing cultural resource management. I am working in Alberta right now. At the current site that I am at, we are at a construction site where a new structure is going up. We are there to sort through everything that gets dug up by the construction workers, to see if there are any artifacts in the area. This is important to know, because there are many First Nations groups that have occupied the area. We want to know who has been there, and when. I am currently doing my Bachelor of Arts degree, and will be taking more courses in archaeology. I am 21 years old, and I hope to be doing this as my career for the rest of my life. 

* **/u/OneSourDude : Archaeological Field Technician, Canada:** My job is to survey areas of potential major construction (housing developments, highways, mining, renewable energy sources, etc.) to make sure there is nothing of historical importance that might be destroyed if construction takes place. If we find something of importance (either Native American or European settlers), we excavate it, recording all the information we can, so that construction can commence. I've been doing it for three years now, and I've worked on a variety of projects ranging from European farmsteads to Native American villages and more. I'm 24 and I have a BA in archaeology.

* **/u/shovelingtom: My official title is Historic Preservation Specialist, but my actual job is Archaeology Crew Lead, USA:** There is no truly typical day for an archaeologist.  One day I might be constructing [GIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system) maps for analysis of site location patterns.  Another might involve running a crew that is conducting a [Phase I](http://www.crt.state.la.us/archaeology/review/field_standards_terrestrial_phase_I_surveys.aspx) shovel test survey to locate unknown archaeological sites.  At known sites, I may be conducting [Phase II](http://www.crt.state.la.us/archaeology/review/phase_II_investigation_field_standards.aspx) excavations in order to assess whether a site is eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places.  A general rule of thumb is that I spend at least three days of office time for every one day on a site.  Much of this time is spent washing, sorting, cataloging and analyzing artifacts.  After all of the lab work is completed I'll take the rest of my office time to write a comprehensive report on the survey or excavation. I have a BA in anthropology and an MA in applied anthropology (and am one of the moderators of the /r/anthropology subreddit!). I am 34, male, and married to another archaeologist.

**The Museum Pros:** 

* **/u/butforevernow: Assistant Curator, Australia:** I work in a small regional art gallery, basically as the gallery curator's right-hand woman. On any given day, my job could involve managing the permanent collection (changing the displays, rotating the works, looking for anything that might need to go to conservation), assessing new or potential acquisitions, giving tours and talks, researching for upcoming exhibits, publications or new works, working with the education and marketing officers on programs (we get a lot of school groups), looking after interns, updating our website... in a bigger gallery, these jobs would be divided into many more separate roles, but because we're small we do it all! I've been in this role for 1.5 years and it's a step up from an entry level position - I worked for two years as a Curatorial Assistant, and before that I did internships at a couple of different galleries + museums. I have a BA in Art History and am working on my Master's, and I'm 27. 

* **/u/hiphiphip0 Contemporary Art History Curator/Researcher US/UK:**  I research and exhibit contemporary art for a living. Contemporary art is a huge field that envelops a lot of different types of art forms. So, like most researchers and curators I had to pick one particular aspect of it.  I chose to specialize in New Media Art.  New Media Art is a genre that encompasses artworks created via new media technologies through practice, process and presentation.  It includes most traditional forms of art (performance, sculpture, painting etc.) and also embraces more contemporary ones such as computer graphics and animation, virtual and augmented reality, internet art, interactive installations, video games, robotics and biotechnology. I am currently a PhD candidate in the UK where I research these artworks full time. My PhD is fully funded. I also student teach and I am still payed to curate shows around new media art, which I do in the UK, the US and the EU.  I teach and curate part-time.  Before I went back to school I worked at a non-profit art gallery (co-director and co-curator) and an arts festival (assistant to the director) in a major US city. I did this for 7 years.  I have a BA in Studio Arts (Sculpture and Photography) and a MA in Art History.

I've been applying to internships left and right for the next upcoming months, and have finally heard back from a zoo and been offered a phone interview. The zoo, Utica Zoo, isn't AZA accredited however. Does anyone know anything about the zoo? Should I be wary in general of places with no accreditation or just be happy to be gaining experience?"

1lwizr,0,2013-09-07,Being a Nice Guy,[deleted],getdisciplined,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1lwizr/being_a_nice_guy/,"By giving these men the label Nice Guy, I'm not so much referring to their actual behavior, but to their core belief system about themselves and the world around them. These men have been conditioned to 
believe that if they are ""nice,"" they will be loved, get their needs met, and have a smooth life.  

The term Nice Guy is actually a misnomer because Nice Guys are often anything but nice. Here are some Not-So-Nice Traits of Nice Guys:  

Nice Guys are dishonest. These men hide their mistakes, avoid conflict, say what they think people want to hear, and repress their feelings. These traits make Nice Guys fundamentally dishonest.  

Nice Guys are secretive.Because they are so driven to seek approval, Nice Guys will hide anything that 
they believe might upset anyone. The Nice Guy motto is, ""If at first you don't succeed, hide the 
evidence.""  
  

Nice Guys are compartmentalized.Nice Guys are adept at harmonizing contradictory pieces of 
information about themselves by separating them into individual compartments in their minds. 
Therefore, a married man can create his own definition of fidelity which allows him to deny that he had 
an affair with his secretary (or intern) because he never put his penis in her vagina.  
  

Nice Guys are manipulative. Nice Guys tend to have a hard time making their needs a priority and 
have difficulty asking for what they want in clear and direct ways. This creates a sense of powerlessness. 
Therefore, they frequently resort to manipulation when trying to get their needs met.  
  

Nice Guys are controlling. A major priority for Nice Guys is keeping their world smooth. This creates 
a constant need to try to control the people and things around them.  
  

Nice Guys give to get . Though Nice Guys tend to be generous givers, their giving often has 
unconscious and unspoken strings attached. They want to be appreciated, they want some kind of 
reciprocation, they want someone to stop being angry at them, etc.   
  
Nice Guys often report feeling 
frustrated or resentful as a result of giving so much while seemingly getting so little in return.
  
  
Nice Guys are passive-aggressive. Nice Guys tend to express their frustration and resentment in 
indirect, roundabout, and not so nice ways. This includes being unavailable, forgetting, being late, not 
following through, not being able to get an erection, climaxing too quickly, and repeating the same 
annoying behaviors even when they have promised to never do them again.
  
  
Nice Guys are full of rage. Though Nice Guys frequently deny ever getting angry, a lifetime of 
frustration and resentment creates a pressure cooker of repressed rage deep inside these men. This rage 
tends to erupt at some of the most unexpected and seemingly inappropriate times.
  
  
Nice Guys are addictive. Addictive behavior serves the purpose of relieving stress, altering moods, or 
medicating pain. Since Nice Guys tend to keep so much bottled up inside, it has to come out somewhere. 
One of the most common addictive behaviors for Nice Guys is sexual compulsiveness.
  
  
Nice Guys have difficulty setting boundaries. Many Nice Guys have a hard time saying ""no,"" ""stop,"" 
or ""I'm going to."" They often feel like helpless victims and see the other person as the cause of the 
problems they are experiencing.
  
  
Nice Guys are frequently isolated. Though Nice Guys desire to be liked and loved, their behaviors 
actually make it difficult for people to get very close to them.
  
  
Nice Guys are often attracted to people and situations that need fixing.This behavior is often the 
result of the Nice Guy's childhood conditioning, his need to look good, or his quest for approval. 
Unfortunately, this tendency pretty much guarantees that Nice Guys will spend most of their time 
putting out fires and managing crises.
  
  
Nice Guys frequently have problems in intimate relationships.Though Nice Guys often put 
tremendous emphasis on this part of their lives, their intimate relationships are frequently a source of 
struggle and frustration. For example:
l  Nice Guys are often terrible listeners because they are too busy trying to figure out how to defend 
themselves or fix the other person's problem.
l  Because of their fear of conflict, they are frequently dishonest and are rarely available to work all 
the way through a problem.
l  It is not unusual for Nice Guys to form relationships with partners whom they believe to be 
""projects"" or ""diamonds in the rough."" When these projects don't polish up as expected, Nice 
Guys tend to blame their partner for standing in the way of their happiness.
  
  
Nice Guys have issues with sexuality. Though most Nice Guys deny having problems with sex, I have 
yet to meet one who isn't either dissatisfied with his sex life, has a sexual dysfunction (can't get or 
maintain an erection, climaxes too quickly), or has sexually acted out (through affairs, prostitution, 
pornography, compulsive masturbation, etc.).
  
  
Nice Guys are usually only relatively successful. The majority of Nice Guys I've met have been 
talented, intelligent, and moderately successful. Almost without exception though, they fail to live up to 
their full potential.  
  
Unfortunately, every fucking single one of these describes me.  
  
Reading 'No more Mr. Nice Guy' by Robert Glover right now.  
  
Just thought I would throw this out there.  Wish I would have found it earlier.

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[What are your views on the American political system?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc320em?context=5)|Worst form of government except for all others tried. 
[I like Frances parliamentary system better. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc35zmn?context=5)|I'll concede that proportional representation has it's benefits but it's hard to know if it would scale to a far larger geographical voting base. We tend to favor a direct connection to our reps. 
[What percent of your boss' time is spent on fund raising?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc33qr9?context=5)|More than it should be. Most members do about two hours a day of call time (cold calling rich people or past donors to max out). Weekends usually have one or two instate fundraisers. Recess weeks will usually have a day of national fundraising out of state. I have never met a member who enjoys fundraising but in order to compete against rich self-funders who believe strongly enough in something to drop 200mil of their own money into a race.
 |Campaign finance reform is the best way to fix the system, yet hardest to accomplish. So much money fighting against it and citizens united derailed most efforts to limit. 
[Was a House intern ( I'd love to come back, but I got fired so that's a bit problematic\), definitely agree with most of the answers here.  I never got an answer to this question, but I guess I might as well ask.  I know that when he was still around, Ron Paul's office was...weird.  Really weird.  It was very different from every other office, from my perspective, not in a good way, but then again I don't like him or his policies at all.  So, what about Rand?  Is his office peculiar?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc33td4?context=5)|Haven't worked with their office directly so can't really say but their softball team was a little over zealous. I think it's fair to say that they believe they are the only sane inmates in the asylum. 
[1\) Would it be fair to say that senators care more about campaign donors than constituents, even if those campaign donors are not from their state? What percentage of campaign donors are not constituents?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc3jsvr?context=5)|Some do, most don't. People forget that the vast majority of contributions, say 90% are small dollar donations. i'm talking less than $25 bucks per donation. And almost all, say 99% of those small dollar donations are from in state. If you start to piss off the average donor by placating a couple of the rich guys, that money will dry up quickly. 
[2\) What do you see as the key to why senators seem to have a huge ability to self-enrich themselves when in office?  It is far greater than the 174,000 salary they get.  So where is the money coming from?  Endorsement deals?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc3jsvr?context=5)|Again, I don't agree with your premise. Most are rich before they ever get here, they either come from money or enriched themselves in the private sector.. You almost have to be in order to run a successful campaign as it takes seed money to get one off the ground and to be viable before small donations can pick up the tab. That said, some Senators who get here the hard way, can make a little extra on the side in speaking fees. conventions or foreign businesses will pay a senator to come speak about something but this doesn't happen until they are out of office. In office, their best bet for extra cash is to write a book. All of their finances are public record btw, you can look up their financial disclosures and see everything line by line.  Those that aren't rich when they get here, wont be rich until they leave but thats alright for them as they can make bank once the do. Most will lobby or sit on a corporate board.
[3\)  Since special interest campaign donations correlate directly to votes in the senate, are the special interests generally donating because the senator already has the position they like, or are they donating in an effort to convince them to take the position they like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc3jsvr?context=5)|Not sure that they directly correlate, but most will only donate to those that are supportive already. That's the basis of campaigns, you support those who agree with your beliefs. Some will hedge their bets and donate to everyone because they will want their phone calls answered no matter who wins, but that's not as common as you would think. Also, national groups will donate to those that sit on committees relevant to their issues. ie Defense companies will donate to members of Armed Services. 
[4\) On a scale of 1 to 10 how much do senators understand the average issue they vote on?  I notice that they seem to generally be baffled about technology, science, and economics, is this just a case of having trouble articulating their understanding, or a lack on knowledge of the topic?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc3jsvr?context=5)|This varies drastically from member to member. Most successful senators will narrow their focus to a small subset of issues and become experts in that field. other members will rely on their knowledge for guidance. For some issues, they will rely on trade groups or associations for their expertise. Thats why it's important that each side of an issue have their own experts. For instance, we need the EFF to come in and argue against the MPAA on how best to combat piracy. Technology, specifically the internet and communications infrastructure, is where there is the biggest shortfall and you are right to be worried about this. One of the biggest mistakes we made was shutting down the Office of Technology Assessment. OTA's sole job was to provide nonpartisan analysis of complex scientific or technological issues to congress so that they could better understand and legislate. Some of OTA's responsibility was given to CRS but for the most part, we have to rely on outside groups to provide this kind of information. 
[What is your major and school you went to? How did you get this job? How much do you make?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc32uug?context=5)|Political science at a state university. First non food service/construction/janitorial job was on a campaign, from there I applied for a job in dc. Didn't get it but moved here anyway. Applied to a position in the senate employment bulletin. Got that but then the member retired so I got a new job with a different member. Worked for three so far and have been in dc for 7 years. All our salaries are public, google legistorm if your curious. Starting out, you'll be lucky to make more than 25k/year. That's why you get so many rich kids because it's very difficult to work here without help. When I started, I tended bar 20/hrs a week to make rent.
 |I'll also say that no one has had a raise around here in the last three years and turnover is increasing because of it. 7 years of hill plus 2 years of campaign net you about 60k in salary. (As an FYI a starting associate in a lobby shop will net you 110k, can you say revolving door?) 
[I have an uncle who said when he lived in DC he had to eat peanut butter sandwiches for 3 weeks straight once. Ever been in a similar situation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc3fnsx?context=5)|It is very hard to live in this city on your own on a staff assistant's salary. $25,000/yr goes quickly when you live with the third highest cost of living in the country. Most hill staffers if they are unsupported by rich parents (which admittedly there are few of and this is a problem) live in a flop house with five or six others, work a second job, and eat rammen. Luckily there is a large and poor immigrant population in DC so you can eat pretty well if you speak spanish and don't mind a sketchy neighborhood. This is how i survived for my first three years. 
[What's the most unprofessional thing you've ever seen at a hearing?  e.g John McCain playing poker on his phone.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc31xvw?context=5)|The thing about McCain is that he has an uncontrollable temper. The man has his reasons, his time as a pow had understandably lasting effects, but those effects have made him volatile and quick to judgement.  I once saw him go of on an intern for no other reason than he was wearing a black belt with brown shoes. 
[How much do they actually care about their constituents' opinions once elected?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc32drn?context=5)|More than anyone seems to think. The vast majority of these people don't go through the trouble of a long and grueling campaign for their own self interest. It's too much work and most of them are smart enough to make money in an easier way if that's their goal. Same can be said for staff. Their are exceptions of course, but the vast majority of people, on both sides of the aisle, are here because of a sense of public service an a genuine belief that they can improve their country. I know that sounds far fetched but the job is to demanding and thankless to do it for any other reason. 
[How, if at all, did the Edward Snowden ordeal impact your job? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc32xta?context=5)|My job, not so much directly. Indirectly, it is still very much an issue of discussion. Congress doesn't like to be made a fool of by the White House and many members believe they were misled by the NSA. The intel whence committee who has oversight will not let this go as they were largely unaware of the extent of these operations. This will be addressed this session. 
[What time will that be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc36l4b?context=5)|After 11 tonight or tomorrow morning. I'll keep answering as long as people are asking. 
[You started an AMA right before going out for a beerfest? From your phone?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc3fvvu?context=5)|To be fair, I started it several hours before beerfest. Just didn't think it would last this long. 
[Is being tough on drugs still seen as free political capital? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc349qb?context=5)|Generally yes but it varies from state to state. I assume you are referring to pot and not coke or heroin. Most members recognize that the tied is turning. Some have concerns that things could go horribly wrong if a transition is mishandled so they are being cautious. Everyone is watching CO and WA and the DoJ's response. I personally think it will be legalized in the next ten years, too costly to keep fighting against it. 
[Do senators and congresspeople look at their jobs as careers or as callings?  Cynically speaking, they often seem more interested in keeping their jobs than doing the work.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc32rmk?context=5)|I spoke a little about this up thread but the job is far too hard with far too little reward for most members to continue for self preservation alone. The vast majority believe that they can still make a difference and that's why they stay. Those that don't leave to lobby and make far more money doing so. 
[How often do representatives and senators speak to members of the opposite party? Is there hope for bipartisan compromise on any legislation in the future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc327sc?context=5)|Most daily. Several are friends but the pressure of being in state and the 24 hour news cycle have made it much more difficult. In the past, members moved to dc. They brought their families, they lived here, got to know one another. It made it much easier for them to work together because your relationship gave you some level of common ground. Outside of work, you realized the one issue you agreed on and worked towards a fix. Now members are wheels up on Thursday and don't get back to dc until Monday night. There simply isn't time for them to get to know each other, not when it's a story if an r and a d are seen having dinner together and are crucified for it by rush or shultz.
[Do you think that this lack of a personal connection between members plays a role in the current status quo? Or is it more related to a fear of a being seen in one's district or state with a member of the opposite party and getting flack for it in a re-election campaign?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc32lum?context=5)|I know he not popular around here but Senator Dodd summed this up pretty well in his last speech to the senate. It's long but worth a watch. [Link to youtu.be](http://youtu.be/zI9Df6zhdHg)
[What do Senators look for when interviewing?  How can one make up for the lack of DC experience?    Is there loan repayment in your office? If so, is it pretty good?    What are the typical employment options after working on the Hill?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc4j1n6?context=5)|Unless you want to be LD, Comm Dir, or CoS, the Senator won't be part of your interview process so what you are really asking is what does the office manager look for. This depends on how old you are and what you want to do but general advice is to be confident but don't pretend to know everything. Do your homework on the person you want to work for and their state. Be able to answer questions about issues they and their state care about. As for experience, if you are looking for an internship, being from the state or district is first. It's hard to get a staff ass job without interning somewhere first but campaign experience can help you there. LC's usually start as staff asses but some can jump that line by coming from a relevant NGO, think tank, or private sector job. ie work for a bank if you want to do banking policy. LA's are usually working on the hill already but it's not unheard of to hire someone with a higher degree. most offices will hire vets for defense or foreign policy gigs.
 |There is and it used to be generous but sequestration cut it in half. It covers about a third of my combined monthly student loan payments. Each office gets a total pot thats split among everyone who wants a cut. This is where nepotism can help you. If an office is full of rich kids with no loans, that pot can be quite generous. If your office is full of salt of the earth, hardworking, real folk, then it can be as little as $25/mo.
 |After the hill, it depends on what department you were in. Leg go to lobby if you're evil or advocacy if your not (these are exactly the same thing btw), press go to pr firms or consulting, admin goes to admin jobs pretty much anywhere. 
[What are the ratios of constituent calls regarding intervention in Syria, Against action vs in favor of action?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc32doq?context=5)|I'd say 90-10 against but the reasons for opposition are far more varied. Some oppose because it's not our business, some because they don't think chemical weapons are bad idea, some don't trust the intelligence. But the vast majority are convinced that we are sending soldiers and invading Syria. Misinformation is the biggest driver in opposition to anything. Most of the people who call are against an issue because we have done a horrible job communicating what's true and what's myth. (The ACA is not government run healthcare, it's insurance reform)
[What can we do to make your job just slightly easier?  Is there some small insight that a Redditor can provide that would help?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc369l2?context=5)|Be firm but polite when you call your reps office. Rude or angry calls may make you feel better but in the end, the 22 year old staff assistant wont record them if you're a dick. Also, don't have a short attention span; if you have a position on a particular policy, keep expressing it until you get what you want. A lot of things are easily ignored because public pressure wanes after a few days. 
[How did you get your job?

[What are your thoughts on US intervention in Syria?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc31xqo?context=5)|A rabbit hole with no right answer. If there was a simple solution we would have taken it. No secret that congress and the administration are always looking for the easy way out, but sometimes there isn't one. Cynicism aside, it's good for all involved that this debate is happening out in the open' messy as it may be.

[What is the best and worst part about your job?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc3aamf?context=5)|Corny as it sounds, best part is feeling that you have an opportunity to affect change that you can genuinely help a lot of individuals. Worst part, is watching your really good idea die on the senate floor.
 |Also, on a strictly personal level, I still get a high every time i walk in to the capitol. Feeling the worn marble under your feet, where countless others walked before you, gives you a real sense of history. You have to remind yourself to take a moment and realize how lucky you are to work in a place that is responsible for so much good in the world while also recognizing the potential exists to do so much harm. It still gets me.
[Congress gets an insane amount of days off...what do most congressmen do on their day off, and do you feel they deserve such a high amount of time off?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc4mc7h?context=5)|Well to start, I don't agree with your premise. I assume by days off, you are referring to days congress is in recess. The vast majority of those days are not vacation days (in fact we have been trying to re-brand recess as 'district work periods' for ages) On a typical recess day, the senator is back in the state meeting with constituent groups, holding office hours, touring employer sites, and yes, fundraising. For instance, this last august recess, my boss visited every county in the state and had at least three events per day, seven days a week. By design, these have a local focus and it's like pulling teeth to get even the local paper to cover it. Our press office works very hard to make sure this is not the case, but unless you're there, it's unlikely you'll ever hear about this kind of work. In fact, a lot of businesses will ask you not to mention a business out of fear they will be branded a supporter by their customers.
 |I think on the whole, the workload of a senator is drastically underestimated by the public. Most, if not all, have a daily schedule that starts at around 7:00am and goes to about 9:00 pm, seven days a week. That time belongs to the office and we schedule every minute of it. His only real down time is taken up with travel, and if he's on a train or in a car, we fill it with phone calls. Now i will say that too much of his time is spent fundraising for the next campaign. Something like 20% of his awake hours are used for 'call time' and fundraisers and that steadily increases the closer you get to the end of cycle.
 |My guy has had a total of five days off this year that he was supposed to be 'off the grid' but even then he was still taking phone calls from the Chief of Staff. 
[Do you find yourself/others on the staff frequently working extremely long/odd hours or is there a balance between your work and private life? Do you have to be willing to put everything else on hold for the job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc322i3?context=5)|It ebbs and flows. Recess is a time to catch up with family friends as session is much more demanding. It also depends on if your particular issues are on the floor in a given week. Obviously foreign policy/nat security are hitting it hard right now. That said, there's always mail to respond to, briefs to write, meeting to take. I'll say I am expected to answer email no matter what time, day, or vacation I might be on. 
[Completely serious question.  How much corruption is there?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc34clz?context=5)|This may sound like a non-answer but it really depends on how you define it. In general, I'd say very little but that's not to say being a high dollar donor won't get your phone call answered. Quid-pro-quo is very rare because it's far too easy to get caught. Also, the earmark ban has gone a long way to stop those kind of transactions. An individual member can no longer add a budget line on his own so it's become too difficult to secure a contract for a buddy or donor. However, money in politics can still buy you a voice to make your case and for some members that might be enough to convince them to go their way. Either way, a member is only taking a call or meeting if that person represents a particular constituency in their state. 
[Thats interesting, outside looking in Quid-pro-quo seems the most fucking common thing ever, at least on issues that voters don't care about (which it seems to me, is like all of them\).  I mean everything from allowing TV commercials from big pharma, food subsidies, cotton subsidies, random ass subsidies, copyright extensions every time micky mouse is due to go into the public domain,  to allowing bonuses after the bailout seems like its Quid-pro-quo to me.  I guess my question is how are these things not quid-pro-quo?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc35xq0?context=5)|Some might call those giveaways, others might call that good for business/economy. I'm not saying I agree with this but many people feel what's good for business is good for 'Mercia. They may argue that protecting Disney profits, protects the economy. Every policy is good for someone, Rs will argue that it trickles down D's will argue that that's bullshit. 
[I can see that to some policies, but, I'll take food subsidies and copyright extension.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm fairly certain that no serious researcher has ever made a convincing case that copyright extension, or food subsidies, or cotton subsidies to Brazilian farmers, have been a good thing. You ask a libertarian economist, a Marxist economist and a main stream economist, you'll get the same answer when it comes to long copyright protection and food subsidies: that they both are terrible.  When you say every policy is good for someone, thats strikes me as favor trading, as protecting Disney profits is certainly good for Disney, but if a senator were to ask almost any economist, they'd tell you its bad for the American economy.  Do senators actually believe that arbitrarily protecting a certain industries profits is good for the economy? Do they ever ask economists or political scientists for their input? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc36i6p?context=5)|Not to simplify too much but if said business is in your state and employs a large number of constituents then they become a priority. It's one of the faults of geographical representation. I'm not saying it's right but on most issues the district or state comes before country. This is also way big business or defense contractors have a factory in every state. 
[As an average citizen what hope can you give to me that these people actually do care about my time and want to represent me the citizen? I know all we see is the bad in the media so that's why I'm asking if you could shed some light on the good.  There were control tower furlough for pilots occurring throughout the states for weeks. A three-day weekend was coming up for congress and that issue was passed/funded in hours. This just screams to me that it's something THEY cared about because it wasn't being touched before hand with such urgency. As opposed to something the people may care about.  I don't want to list the examples out, but I can if it helps. I'm not here to play the blame game I'm just curious as an average citizen and seeing situations like this occur where should I find hope and light in that this system is working to better my people and my community instead of their bottom line and buddies?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc38n1q?context=5)|All I can say is that most members are good people trying to help in the best way they think is right. The problem is that everyone has a different opinion on what IS right. I've been around awhile and i really don't have a cynical view of the vast majority of members who I disagree with. They just believe in a system of values that run contrary to mine, but are no less dedicated to making this country a better place.
 |As for the FAA furloughs, that was unfortunate timing. A fix had been in the works long before that weekend. It was one of the problems with sequestration that most realized we had to fix before cuts went in to effect. Problem is other things took precedent on the legislative calendar and the fix was pushed back longer than anticipated. Basically one senator put a hold on the bill so we had to wait out the 30 hours of debate post cloture. This pushed the whole thing back despite the fact that an overwhelming majority believed that air traffic controllers are necessary, budget be damned. we were hindered by our own rules and everyone looked bad a s a result. (not to diminish the very real consequences of those directly effected.)
[Well, I guess that makes it slightly better then out right corruption.  Hooray!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc36wnx?context=5)|Just enough to make it near impossible to regulate or  enforce. 
[Also, do you expect there is a career path you can/will take  that will cause your salary to significantly rise that doesn't have to do with lobbying?  Also also, did they just let you start bar tending after graduation, or did you have to become a barback first?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc37v6k?context=5)|Honestly, not really. You can make money consulting. But that's just telling people how to lobby. I still have a sense of public service and still enjoy the work despite the negative approval and lack of benefits. I realized I wasn't going to be rich awhile ago, but I live a comfortable life and that's good enough for me. That may change if I have kids but I'll cross that bridge when I come to it.
[What are your general duties as a staffer for a senator? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc32859?context=5)|I'll speak for dc because that's what I know. The state offices a re a different game.
 |DC staff are in three camps. Admin, press, and leg. Each have their hierarchy but admin keeps the office running from a practice side, press communicates the policy, and legislative creates the policy. All of this is done with input from the member but a good staff knows the member's position before he/she does.
 |For leg, I'd say 60% of their time is spent dealing directly with constituents. Not all of this is answering phones or mail, a lot of is meeting with various groups advocating for a specific policy. It's then the job to communicate that policy to the senator. This is what lobbying is. People tend to worry about this but it should serve some comfort that no staffer or member would take a meeting unless that group has a direct interest in their state. It's not worth their time or political capital to work an issue that is into important back home. 
[I realize you work in the Senate and not the House, but if you could wave a magic wand and accomplish one of these, which would you choose and why?  100% publicly financed campaigns.  House districts that are not gerrymandered (as close to 50/50 dem/gop districts as possible\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc354j9?context=5)|I can't have both? District lines are more difficult to fix because each state has their own process. Publicly financed campaigns also have issues as SCOTUS affirmed that donations are part of free speech. I do think donations play an important role in determining viability but the regulation (or lack there of) needs a drastic overhaul. Stricter regulation would have an effect across all federal offices so I guess that's my answer but the district map is why the house is a complete clusterfuck of radicals on both fringes. 
[Scotus hasn't struck down donation limits (yet\). They've said that the first amendment protects unlimited independent expenditures however.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc39tlh?context=5)|Exactly, and until they do, we should be placing strong limits on all forms of political donations, no matter the classification of the organization. 
[Do you feel your boss is in trouble in his/her next election cycle?  If so how do you plan your attack in order to win re-election?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc39r0y?context=5)|The benefit of the Senate is that they have a six year term. This usually translates to six years of job security post election. The house has it worse (at the staff level at least) as they never feel safe. Working in two year incriminates makes it very difficult to get settled. How do you buy a house or have kids with the fear that you may be out of a job in two years?
 |As for going in to cycle, an incumbent has to rely on their casework more than their policy positions. A senate office performs a lot of services for constituents in trouble with federal agencies. Their performance in helping individuals translates to votes and good will word of mouth. This is where the notion of 'congress sucks but my guy is one of the good ones' comes from. 
[In your opinion, what is the best way to get stuff moved or noticed by a Senator, like for example the opinion of the brewing circumstances in Syria? Is writing letters actually any good or is it all fruitless?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc37msr?context=5)|Answered in more depth elsewhere but snail mailed letters of a personal nature and phone calls are your best bet. be polite, notify the staff ass that you are a constituent and ask that your response be recorded.
[Does the graft go through you, or do you hire the people the graft goes through?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc3mdyz?context=5)|We have highly trained monkeys for this as they have no legal standing and can not be prosecuted. 
[I listen to a show called No Agenda and one of the hosts like to say that Congress is like Hollywood for ugly people. That is, a lot of the members really love the public attention and feeling like a celebrity. Do you think that's true?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc392n6?context=5)|Was that divorak or curry? there's some truth to that but any sense of importance wares off quickly. You find that attitude among the least influential, interns mostly. There are a few members who reach a national spotlight and you can see them get hooked on the attention (Schumer comes to mind). We call them camera chasers and they are largely ineffective as a result. They tend to know a little about a lot but are an expert on none. Honestly though, with approval ratings where they are, any sense of adulation evaporates quickly. 
[That's reassuring to hear. I think how you treat your staff says a lot about you as a politician.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc37e2h?context=5)|Very much agree. 
[What is single most funny thing about your job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc3lf5n?context=5)|Tourists. It's very odd to work in a national landmark. The vast majority of tourists forget that this is first and foremost, a working office building. This makes for some very strange interactions. The Japanese tourists are extremely curious and don't seem to have any boundaries. They will just open doors, walk in to our offices, and just start taking pictures...
[Do you have binders full of women?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc3p8r8?context=5)|They were all confiscated after Romney let that cat out of the bag. 
[Is House of Cards a good depictions of the goings ons of politicians in the US govt.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc320s3?context=5)|Way to sensationalized. A lot of the details are right, badges, process, hallways, etc but no single member is as smart or conniving to pull off those kind of maneuvers. That said, most of us love the show despite Chris Cillizza's views, and wish we had that kind of power. 
[Too. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc32xhv?context=5)|Upvote.
[Does your boss know the difference between the Soviet Union &amp; Modern Russia? Was he even aware of the  10:1 cuts to tax increases deal offered by the White House?  Does his love for God come before lawmaking based on rational science?  Has he ever apologized to a corporation who was caught red handed committing a crime?  Does he know that Slovenia and Slovakia are two different countries?  Is he high or low on the list of those that receive earmarks?  Can he name the party that PM David Cameron belongs too?  What percentage of information is provided to him by lobbyists vs say the CBO?  Does he have more than one image consultant on staff?  Do lobbyists provide him with pre-planned message materials?  Did he vote to make pizza a vegetable?  Does he believe that the Speaker and the Majority Whip are even in control of the House Republican Caucus?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1lv6vf/iama_staffer_for_a_us_senator_ama/cc32hca?context=5)|Yes.
 |No? i think i know what your referencing but believe your numbers are wrong.
 |No, rationality comes before god with my guy but you are right to say thats not the case for all. 
 |Not that I'm aware of.
 |Yes.
 |Individual earmarks were banned in the 111th congress so that list no longer exists. For better or worse, the executive now determines how their appropriations are spent. congress has very little say in what any one project receives in federal support. 
 |Yes, Conservative.
 |CBO only reports on how much a particular legislative action will cost the government. The vast majority of background or research is done by his staff via the congressional research service (an arm of the library of congress). Actual drafting of legislation is done in consultation of the Office of Legislative Counsel. Lobbyists provide background but most take it with a grain of salt. 
 |No, unless you mean his press office. Most Senators have a communications director, press secretary, and deputy press secretary. They field all press requests, issue releases, and try to communicate the senator's message. A campaign may hire such a consultant to help and awkward candidate communicate with the public but usually if you are running for senate, you already have those skills. 
 |Lobbyists, no but the party will provide talking points on a specific issue or message guidelines on what they want members to push. Rs tend to be better at the unified front than democrats but this has changed in recent years. tea party doesn't play nice with the old guard. 
 |Kind of a red haring as thats not exactly what the vote was about but no, my boss was against relaxing nutrition guidelines for school lunches. Regardless, these were only guidelines and help no weight as states still determine their own school nutrition requirements. 
 |House is the house but the general sense is that the GOP is becoming far more fragmented. They used to be a very tight ship from a party perspective but cracks have formed. Not to mention that Cantor has been holding a knife in the back of Boehner for quite some time.

1lwhn4,362,2013-09-07,I would like to tell you all about Unger's Paradox. (Something to think about for those of you who are struggling.),ShaggyTheJesus,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1lwhn4/i_would_like_to_tell_you_all_about_ungers_paradox/,"I think Unger's Paradox perfectly represents this challenge. 

Say you empty a 50lb sack of beans onto the ground, those beans will form a heap. Suppose someone then take one bean off the heap and places it onto the ground a few feet away- how many heaps are there? It seem obvious that the single bean on the ground is not a heap, while the large grouping is still a heap. We reach the same conclusion if we add a second bean to the same spot, and a third, and a fourth. In fact, it seems we could keep moving beans from the heap to the non-heap and never reach the point where we can say, ""This is the bean that makes all the difference!"" There will never be a point where adding a single bean will turn the non-heap into a heap, or when taking away a single bean will make the heap stop being a heap. 

I think it's important to keep in mind that while 90 days is admirable, there is no single day that determines your success with this challenge. There will be no single day that you will suddenly wake up a motivated, charismatic, and confident individual. It's the little things that add up. 

To relate this back to Unger's Paradox, say you earned a bean for every good act you did for yourself. You woke up in the morning and went to the gym- one bean. You didn't watch porn- one bean. You went out with friends and let yourself have fun- one bean. You approached a stranger and said hello- one bean. You helped an elderly neighbor with some chores- one bean. You keep going to the gym- more beans. You haven't PMOd in a month- more beans. You keep approaching people and saying hello- more beans. You get a haircut and some new clothes- more beans. You haven't PMOd in 3 months- even more beans.You approach a girl and ask for her number- loads of beans. But there will never be a single act in which you earn enough beans where you say, ""Thank god, now I have a heap.""

Suppose someone who was like you when you started observes your newly acquired stack of beans. He would think, ""Hey, that guys got a little heap of beans going.""

Keep going. It's the little things, right? At this point you have a six pack- lots of beans. You go on your second date with that girl you approached and kiss her- tons of beans. You finish the year with a 3.9 GPA- truckloads of beans. You go on a date with your now girlfriend, ending up losing your virginity to her- swimming pools of beans. You graduate with a double major and an internship in your desired field- canyons of beans. You can now run a mile in under 7 minutes- oceans of beans. You fall in love- at this point your running out of things to hold your beans. All the while, you've just been adding beans, one by one. 

Say that guy sees you again now. What does he think? ""Wow, that guy has got an incredible heap of beans!""

Don't compare your day 20 to someone's day 90. Your writing your own story here, and results WILL vary. So just relax, take it day by day, bean by bean, and before you know it, you'll be the guy with the heap. 

Stay Strong Fapstronauts!"

About a year ago I started getting gall attacks and ended up going to the ER twice in the same week. Since I had no insurance I ended up with a bill that was about $5,000. I recently managed to save enough to pay off a settlement offer that was just under $3000. I still have about $700 to go for a few tests and crap though. I no longer have any money saved and I'm barely making it with what I get paid but to be honest I was relieved that this big bill was taken care of. But recently a school debt caught up to me and it's accumulated interest so it's up to $7000. If you're reading this you're probably thinking I'm very irresponsible, and maybe I am, I don't know. A few years ago I was left with no option but to enroll in a medical course otherwise I would've been kicked from home. I reluctantly signed up and had to get a few loans. I completed the course and took up an internship position at a clinic. I loved working there but once my internship was over, they didn't have the funds to employ me. I went back to school but they refused to help me with work placement even though they had said that was part of their job. I failed to come up with anything else for about a year and finally found work as a caregiver. I don't make much especially now that my work hours have been cut but I'm still stuck with this $7000 bill. Soon my employer will be going to mexico for six months so i wont have any money coming in. I'm just stressing out and havent slept in three days since i cant stop thinking about this. I honestly don't know what to do."

1lwcld,3,2013-09-07,Advice for landing an Internship,sadmanABC,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/1lwcld/advice_for_landing_an_internship/,"Hello Internet,
I am a sophomore at Stony Brook university studying Business Management with a concentration in Finance. It's September right now and I want to start looking for an internship for the summer( yes I know it's a bit early but I want a head start). I have a few questions that I need answers to,
1) How much experience is required to land an internship at a bank? I have only one professional experience- i've interned at my dad's firm in Bangladesh over the summer but it didn't require much finance-related work, i mostly did scheduling and managed a small miscellaneous expense ledger-i have a few other volunteer work that i did over the years and two private tuitioning jobs.
2)Where should I start looking?
3) My GPA for the first two semesters were 2.9 and 3.2 respectively. I plan to get a 3.5 or higher this semester. How much will my low grades hurt my chances?
4)What are my chances of getting a paid internship? Assuming I do, what do they usually pay in finance related work?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated! If you are someone who's been through a similar situation please to share your experience, and if you are a potential employer HIRE ME! 
Oh and one last question, how much does a degree in finance pay at times like this?

Long story short, I share a name with a person that has a decent rap sheet and is currently wanted for felony charges. I don't know the guy and we're not related, I had no idea he existed until I googled myself a few months back. A google search for our name yields many more results for him than me. Upon further examination the man clearly isn't me, but I'm worried an HR worker might come across the results and immediately toss my resume.

Is it worth putting something at the end of my resume like ""Please don't confuse me with the wanted felon, we are NOT the same person"" or should I just trust whoever's in charge of background checks to be smart enough to not confuse the two of us?"
1lwbg2,2,2013-09-07,Is it a good time for me to get an OkCupid account or should I wait until I have my life in order?,singerinasmokyroom,OkCupid,https://www.reddit.com/r/OkCupid/comments/1lwbg2/is_it_a_good_time_for_me_to_get_an_okcupid/,"Hey, guys

I'm a 26-year-old guy living the Silicon Valley and I'm considering getting an OkCupid account, but I'm wondering if now is the right time. I'm currently wrapping up a Master's degree, I live with my parents, and I'm searching and interviewing for jobs. Unfortunately the Master's and the job hunt are taking longer than I had hoped and until I get a full-time job, I can't really move out of my parents' house. I do have a source of income, but it's an internship.

I also don't have much of a social life. I had friends in college, but since then, I've pretty much just been by myself. Occasionally I'll meet up with people I know, but it's much less common than it was in college. In fact, if you look at my Facebook profile, you'll notice that there are hundreds of tagged pictures of me from my college years (2005 to 2009) and only three or four from the years since then.

So I'm wondering if it's really worth it for me to try to get an OKC profile. I've heard that it's pretty rough out there, especially for guys, and I'm not sure how excited a girl will be about the prospect of dating a guy who

1. doesn't really have much of a social life
2. still lives with his parents at the age of 26
3. is still an intern and doesn't have a full-time job

Even if I were to get an OKCupid profile, I'm not sure how I'd really put it together. I don't have many recent photos of myself because, again, I don't have much of a social life so I don't get many photos taken of myself. I'd feel pretty stupid taking selfies because I've always associated them with duck-facing douchebags. Professional photos might end up costing money and they also seem artificial and fake. Plus, I tend to get shy around cameras and I'm, well, quite self-conscious about my appearance.

I can say that I'm a bit more confident about, say, my ability to hold a conversation. I do take pride in my intellect, my ability to put thoughts into words, and my sense of humor. Plus, I've learned a lot from browsing this sub and /r/cringepics about what *not* to do when it comes to dating and OkCupid.

Still, I feel conflicted. I'd like to set up an OKC to get a girlfriend and, yes, even make friends. I also feel like now isn't the right time. Part of me even thinks that dating and relationships aren't important because there are more pressing issues in the world that I should be focused on like global warming, war, and erosion of rights and liberties. That part of me compares dating, relationships and sex to distractions like iPads and Miley Cyrus twerking. 

But I'll be honest. Loneliness is starting to tear me apart. I thought I could handle it until a few days ago when I just broke down crying in front of my parents.

So, any advice? What should I do?

TL;DR: I'm 26, unemployed, live with my parents, and have very little social life. I'm also lonely and I'm considering getting an OKC account. But I'm not sure if it's the right time to get an OKC account because I don't know how much being jobless, living with my parents, and being almost friendless will influence how a girl sees me. I'm wondering if I should hold off on the account until I get my life in order. But damned if I'm not fucking lonely, and I really would like a girlfriend."

Thought about making a throwaway but for some reason I hate that idea. Eh.

I live with my parents. So does my brother, who is also out of college. I've had jobs and internships and moved away for a few months at a time but never really got my own place. Now I'm back, unemployed (just lost my local part-time job a month ago) and facing the same eternal dilemma: I can't get a job until I feel better, can't move out until I have a job, and won't get better until I move out. My relationship with my parents is pretty toxic (and a major part of why I hate my life right now), and it's not likely to improve until I leave. In fact, neither me nor my life will get better until I leave. Finally decided to just move out and finances be damned -- but now I'm back to an even worse catch-22 that I've been trying to avoid.

None of my friends needs a roommate. I'm stuck figuring out which would be worse: living alone (no no no) or living with stangers (dear jesus no). At times I've had people I know agree to be my roommate but when I actually start talking about looking for apartments they back out, which has of course made me even more paranoid and self-hating. I've put messages out to all my friends, and all their friends. I will move to Singapore, to Moscow, to fucking Antarctica if someone I know needs a roommate down there. I just *need to get out*. I need to get out and I have nowhere to go. (And you know every time I think that my brain loves to respond, ""you know a way you'd never have to worry about having nowhere to go ever again? If you were dead!"")

Last week I had a friend say he wanted to move out ASAP too. I told him, I'm looking for immediately, urgently, like right now, and he agreed. This week he told me he meant as soon as he finds a job in the area he wants to move to. Who knows when that will be.

So yeah I think this might be what despair feels like."
1lw7dd,5,2013-09-06,How to get skills and experience to get an entry-level job,flipstables,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1lw7dd/how_to_get_skills_and_experience_to_get_an/,"It's the chicken and egg problem, right?

*How do I get skills and experience to get a job if I don't have a job that would have trained me in those skills?*

Ideally, you would want a coop, internship, or class to help you transition into the working world.  But in case you already graduated or aren't going to college, you can still teach yourself.

**Teach yourself the skills and make your own experience.**

There are a ton of free online classes on a variety of subjects.  There's also guides, books, forums, subreddits, and other free resources.  First you teach yourself the skills that are valuable.

The second part is to make your own experience.  How?  Build something and showcase to other people.  Find a problem to solve and figure out a solution using the new tools that you have.  Reach out to non-profits and ask to apply these skills.  Go to networking events (meetup.com) and see what other people are doing.

This process is cyclical.  Once you start making your own experience, you will encounter a new problem or new project and you'll have to hit the books again.

Also, document the process.  Throw it up on a blog or tweet about it.

This stuff can absolutely go into your resume.  Just because it's not *professional* experience doesn't mean it doesn't count as experience!  An entry level resume with these projects are a hundred times better than an entry level resume with nothing on there.

Now, is this better than professional work experience and skills gained through more formal channels?  Probably not.  Ideally, you would have a job in a similar industry and you would get cross-trained or able to apply your new learned skills professionally. But if no other option is available to you, then this would definitely be helpful.

Good luck!

**Edit: Obviously this doesn't apply to all fields, particularly licensed professionals.  If you want to be a lawyer, you can't just teach yourself law and then practice it.**"

My university has a major called Electrical Engineering with Specialization in Intelligence.  During my freshmen year, my plans were to work for the government (or a place like Boeing, Lockheed Martin), so this degree sounded perfect.  Around sophomore year, my plans and goals changed, so I decided to change my major to just Electrical Engineering.  I was already on my way to having a Math minor, so picking a new minor isn't an issue.  But I was only one class away from having another minor in Strategic Intelligence, so I thought, ""Why not?  It can't hurt.""

However, I did a short study abroad type thing, and I really, *really* loved a few cities we visited.  I have a list of a few cities I would like to live in, and I plan on applying for a few internships in the next couple of weeks.  But I'm worried that if they see a minor in Strategic Intelligence, they might assume I'm a spy or something.  Typing this out, I feel really stupid.  And I'm probably just being paranoid (intelligence classes will do that to you), but still.  They might think it's weird and just skip over my application.  Plus, depending on how deep their background checks are, they might see that I've already talked to a few government entities...but probably not.

Most of the companies I'm applying to are global companies, and they're only in countries who are ""friends"" with the US (England, Germany, The Netherlands).

Okay, seriously...typing this out makes me feel much better (because of how stupid it sounds).  But since I spent a few minutes typing it out, I'm submitting it anyway.  Feel free to leave a reply with your thoughts on my situation...or any other situation you want to talk about.  How are classes this semester?"

A good friend picked up sam and is taking care of him.  He seems a bit traumatized, but is happy!

TLDR: i'm away on an internship six timezones from home/boston for 3 months; 2 weeks into it the petsitter said she has had enough and wants my dog picked up

http://imgur.com/OdpTZLX

Sam is a beagle mutt.  He was a rescue from a shelter where he was caged for a year.  We've had him for 4+ years and love him unconditionally.  He loves fetch, sleeping under the covers (in bed), and stealing any/all unguarded food.

I landed my dream internship in hawaii, and convinced my fiancee to come with me (gonna get married after the internship).  I spent over a month looking/finding/talking to petsitters.  Eventually deciding on one in NH (prices were 30-70% better in NH than in Mass.).

Brought Sammy to the sitter for a meet/great a few weeks before departure... all seemed well... dogsitter had a big yard, other dogs, and not bothered by a beagles howling etc.

Drop off Sammy, 80 lb's of food, $30 of new toys, and fully payment for the 3.5 months.

2 weeks go by and the sitter emails me that Sam has terrible anxiety (separation issues)- wont stop barking and pacing.  My poor buddy!  I do research and give the petsitter the go-ahead to give him benadryl.  No word from the sitter for another week.

Then she contacts me that he needs medication for the anxiety- that he started acting up (peeing/pooping in the house), showing his teeth and growling (very unlike him).

This freaks me out.  I call the vet but she wont prescribe anything until she sees him.  I frantically call my friends- to arrange for $omeone to drive him to the vet and back.  2 dys go by and i think i can get someone to do this early next week.

Today i get an email from the sitter that shows a wall that Sammy scratched up and ruined.  I apologize to her, i really do feel bad for the petsitter and for my mutt.

Few hours later i get a text from the petsitter.  She has had enough and wants the dog picked up asap- cant afford to leave him alone and have more of her home destroyed.  I feel bad for her, i truly do, but this leaves me with little option but to beg on facebook and start looking at prices for flights back to boston (so that my fiancee could go be with him while we figure out a better solution).  

Yay being 5000 miles away, feeling helpless sitting in a cubicle..."

I hunt, and I'm obsessed with fishing- all methods, all seasons, all the time. But then a couple years ago, a friend in MO took me out and we stuck some suckers with his hawaiian sling, and I was addicted. We're going to be doing our first real freedive trip in a month- Lake Norfork in October.

Equipment- I have a hawaiian sling and a new, cheap, mako 3-prong pole spear. Got a 3mm farmer john spearing wetsuit and gloves, plus knife, stringer, flag&amp;float. Got my scuba mask, snorkel, and fins (atomic aquatic split fins). Renting a boat with fish finder, trolling motor and anchor from the resort.

Training- I'm scuba certified (but excited to freedive). I've been doing static apnea tables, and my personal best static apnea is now 3:10 (up from 2:40 2 weeks ago). Stationary bike for 25min of interval training, or target heart rate of 175, 3x week. Went to the 9' pool today to work on my entry, found my equalizing needed a lot of work, but it's good now. I've also done a lot of reading on SWB and samba, including in-water rescue.

So, down to the meat of it- what am I missing? I'm heading to Norfork Lake, Arkansas first weekend of Oct to target walleye, striper, crappie, and catfish. Probably going to be hitting 25-35 fow looking for boulders, ledges, and brush, but I'll talk to the resort owner (who spears with tanks) for more info. Picking up a lake map next week.

Sorry for the long post, but I want to best advice I can get so I don't waste the trip."

The second place, which happens to be a company I already work for part-time in a non-professional capacity, called me yesterday and said they were willing to offer me a trial/temporary position to test me out.

I was ecstatic about that, but I told them that I was still waiting to hear back from another position, and I'd let them know by today if I could commit 100%.

So, I've still got a long way to go and a new fight and challenge every day... but even without the ""super powers"" kicking in yet, things are already looking up a bit. Even if I do eventually relapse (hopefully not any time soon if at all, though I'm not the best judge of my weakness), this is an incredibly important growing season for me that nofap is only one (admittedly important) part of.

Fight on with me, fellow fapstronauts! Each moment is another step forward!"

Possible reasons? Well, I might have taken this internship away from his buddy that interviewed. What do you recommend to do in this situation? I have been keeping my mouth shut and biting the bullet about the situation. This internship will end in a few months. I figured it is best to try and leave on neutralish terms when this ends?

I go to a top 10 program, graduated undergrad with upwards of a 3.6 (from the same school), and I have a good deal of internship experience in my field...but I've had two semester-long design projects during graduate school that both went *very* badly. I ended up with A's in both classes, and I've had other, smaller-scale design projects that have gone much less disasterously, but I get the sense my performance on the longer-term projects is going to be much more important to employers. The thought of having to mention these projects in an interview or on my resume is a huge source of anxiety for me, and I was hoping I could get a clearer perspective on the issue from the community here.

First, how much trouble am I actually in? How much weight do employers put on this kind of stuff? Am I blowing this out of proportion?

Second, should I even put this stuff on my resume? I'd like to at least mention them, because I did learn a lot from both projects, but I'm afraid that's asking for trouble if and when I get interviewed.

So, I will summarize my situation. I kind of fucked up HS. Didn't completely fucked up: my city has 2 major universities, one is very good in the charts, one not very good. 

I didn't get the grades for the better one (not by far) but still I didn't make it, and I am going to the other.

Now, I want to maximize my future possibilities as much as possible, and since I am fortunate enough to not have to pay rent (staying at home) and not having to worry about paying for food, I don't want to just sit around and do nothing, I want to study, but I also want to get work experience, so hopefully after my bachelor's I will also have a few internships that I (hope) will make up for the worse university's reputation.

I know the market is competitive and even unpaid internships are hard to get, but I am ready to put a lot of effort into this.

How do I go about and do this?

I was thinking of e-mailing/showing up in person at HR of relevant companies in my degree and asking if any intern is needed. 

Is that a good idea?

Any advice is greatly appreciated.

Thanks!"

A little background: I'm a recent MBA grad with a degree emphasis in Accounting from a respectable local university. I graduated Summa Cum Laude with my B.A. in Business Admin and have a pretty much impeccable educational record. I won a competitive internship with the Government last year and then obtained a contract position in an analytic role with the Government as well. That was last year.

Fast forward to now. I was recruited into an accounting position and I hated. I was a general ledger monkey and it was a total waste of my technical skills. I applied for a position with the Fed and have obtained a phone interview with the HR rep. Obviously this is the ""are you a douche are not"" interview, but I'm concerned about interviews after that. Namely, what types of questions should I ask, or what will they ask me? 

I'm a little excited because I know several people who I would adjudge to be more qualified than myself who did not get selected for interviews. I have about a year total of analytic experience but the job description actually states they are looking for people with 2-3. So, what to do?

I tried to get an internship this summer and was rejected for interviews by each place I applied to with the exception of an LED assembler position.I asked my dad who is an electrical engineer if I should take the interview and he said to not do it, as it would be a waste of my time.

Well since I couldn't get an interview, my dad said he would teach me some stuff. It's been 3 months and he doesn't really teach me anything. Just stuff which I've already known because he thinks I'm a complete imbecile. He gives me projects which I do, sometimes I get stuck and don't know what to do. My dad prettyy much just shits on me about everything. About how I haven't learned anything all summer, and with only 2 weeks left until my senior year starts I too can say I haven't really learned anything. My dad really just says a lot of negative stuff about me, such as how I'm a lazy bum and shits all over me. I know he is trying to do this for my own good but it's disheartening for me when he complete shits all over me. I make a mistake and he will keep on harping me about it. I can't deal with it and it's pushed me further away from him as a son. I'd rather have him punch me in the face rather than him shitting all over me.

He has plenty of tools. Oscilloscopes, FPGA, I have programs like LabVIEW and Matlab. He doesn't teach me any of this stuff and I'm forced to learn it all on my own. I'm not even close to the sharpest crayon in the box, but I really need help learning this stuff on my own and he refuses to help me, then proceeds to shit on my when I get stuck.

When I try to do my own little side projects at home. I tend to get stuck many times and often times I have no idea what the hell I'm doing. However, when I'm a school I'm completely focused all the time and always know what to do.

In the end I still see this as my fault as I've practically wasted my whole summer doing absolutely nothing for 3 months.Is there anything I can do to learn as much as I can before I go back to school in 2 weeks?

1lzq4x,1,2013-09-08,Roommates.,[deleted],Complain,https://www.reddit.com/r/Complain/comments/1lzq4x/roommates/,"I'm going to break this down into a couple of different stories without a lot of back story because if I don't it's going to be ridiculously long and my life isn't THAT interesting.

1. Last summer my roommate (wasn't at the time) was obsessed with this guy. They were banging, but it was clear that he just wanted to bang and she REALLY wanted a relationship. She was obsessed. She is an idiot and doesn't use condoms most of the time. She's on birth control but has serious issues actually taking it everyday at the same time. So, that happens.
2. Now we're roommates. She goes to a Christmas party and get absolutely ridiculous drunk. I end up having to go get her and she's balling her eyes out and I can't really figure out why. I'm with my boyfriend, we get her up to her bed, he goes to the living room and I sit on the bed with her. We'd gotten into a fight earlier that night because she was already plastered when I dropped her off at this party. When she's drunk she likes to text the kid she'd been obsessed with the over the summer. So, I'm kind of trying to figure out what's wrong and she starts telling me I haven't been there for her and all this stuff. Now, I'd been in 18 hours of classes and working basically full time all semester while having a boyfriend and actually hanging out with her a lot so I didn't really know what she was talking about. Finally she says that she was pregnant with obsession kid's baby and had an abortion - via the abortion pill - back in November. Didn't tell me. And now she's sitting her trying to make me feel bad for not being there for her. Bitch.
3. I don't think she had said abortion/was pregnant. I watched her take like 16 negative pregnancy tests. She went to the doctor. That was negative. THE ONLY PERSON WHO TOLD HER SHE WAS PREGNANT WAS A PSYCHIC. She didn't have any of the normal signs of pregnancy. I know people can have false negatives and all that. I know some people don't show signs of pregnancy. But, still. Too many things pointing to she wasn't pregnant. Also the weekend she supposedly took the pill she was drunk allllllllllllllll weekend. Maybe you can drink after taking that pill. I don't know. But somehow I think it's HIGHLY recommended you don't. 

Things like this happen quite often, but on a smaller scale. She gets REALLY angry at any guy she is talking to or dating for THE SMALLEST OF THINGS. He doesn't text her back and she knows he isn't doing anything? ANGRY TWEET SESSION COMMENCE. 

4. So, this summer she starts dating this guy she works with. He is doing his internship here and is gonna move back to Florida in August. She's completely aware of this when they start dating. One week in and they're gonna get married according to her. After like 2/3 weeks they have talked about helping move him back to Florida. He makes sure they ALWAYS use a condom because he's a good kid. One night she basically forces him to not and the next days he's breaks up with her. Because she said she wouldn't have an abortion if she ended up pregnant and he was all NO KIDS FOR ME WHEN I'M 21 THANKS.
5. They get back together a week later.
6. She's still fucking crazy.
7. He dumps her.
8. A week later she tells him she thinks she's pregnant.
9. SHE'S OBVIOUSLY NOT. BUT HE'S A GOOD KID SO HE BELIEVES HER. They go to the doctor. She's isn't. Duh. He's all peace out you crazy bitch and doesn't talk to her again. He moved back the last week of August.
10. Let's recap. This relationship lasted a TOTAL of about five weeks. And my roommate is balling her eyes out all the fucking time because he was the one and he dumped her and oh my god my future husband left me.

In between Christmas and this boyfriend she had two other guys she kinda dated, nothing really came of it and everything was fine. There was one guy who she actually really like and I was a huge fan of him because he made her more sane. But he was picking between my roommate and another girl - he chose the other girl. They broke up. My roommate and her boyfriend broke up. Fast forward to now and she ""still isn't over"" her boyfriend and this other kid is trying really hard to help her and stuff but she refuses to give a crap about him and I feel really bad for him.

So, there's all that.

Also, ""we"" have a dog. It's pretty much her dog, I'm certainly not taking her when I graduate and move away, my roommate knows that. But seriously, she does not take care of this dog. She thinks napping with her is spending time with her. Refuses to take her to the dog park unless someone else is going with her. Decided paying for doggy day care would be better. Even though she has plenty of time to go to the dog park, she sleep instead. I don't know how to be like, HEY TAKE CARE OF YOUR DOG OR I'M SELLING HER.

Also, she leaves the AC on full blast literally all the time. I get it. It's hot. The dog is here during the day so we can't turn it off. But turn it up so it's not so goddamn expensive. I do this. But I'm not around much so it doesn't take a huge dent off our bill. 

Basically, my roommate annoys the crap out of me and I need to bitch.

1lzo7n,7,2013-09-08,"Do I abandon ship, or compromise severely?",HansBricker,Filmmakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/1lzo7n/do_i_abandon_ship_or_compromise_severely/,"*throwaway account for obvious reasons*

The headline is a little bit simplistic, but I suppose that is the core conundrum.

First, let us introduce the the context.

I used to intern for a well known comedy theater company in an European city. With them, I carved out a unique position for myself: I produced, wrote, directed and edited zero-budget videos that would advertise their upcoming shows and more. Through favors, and friends, I created work that looks and sounds professional and I am quite proud of. 

It was a fruitful relationship as they had a hungry filmmaker eager to create, and I had their connections and audience, even allowing me to parlay my work onto as a television ad (for their show) for a month. It was very exciting and though I had some regular intern type duties as well, I ingrained well with them and we left on a very positive note. It was also, I should mention, a paid internship. Not much, a couple hundred a month, but still valuable.  

In fact, my exit interview including an offer for a bunch commissioned work, most of which I have already slogged through. A lot of it editing things here and there but not nothing.

As such I have maintained a decent relationship with them. However, now with my latest and seemingly biggest piece of work to date coming up, I am struggling with the value of what I am putting together.

Simply put I accepted to create video content for a haunted house type show. My original proposed budget of €6,500 got shot down. €2,000 is their limit. 

Their allocated budget of 2K for video is part of a much larger chunk which is going towards the whole Haunted House experience itself. 2K is video, the rest is the rest.

When I negotiated with them the fee for my music and sound guys, I was under the impression that the €800 we agreed upon would be taken from the ""rest"" budget pile since they will also be producing sound for the ""show"" itself.  Now I am told only €200 will be part of the rest, the other €500 is taken from our 2K.

We managed to negotiate an amazing fee of €900 for a RED Epic as well as a lighting kit through friends. €900 + €500 = €1,400

We are now left with €600. 

Though we were told catering would be covered by them, they now consider it still to be taken from the 2K. Catering is about €300 for two days, Transportation €220. That's €520.

I am now left with €80, and nobody gets paid anything, including me. Already I was asking for my cinematographer, producer, and others to do this as a portfolio project, something I didn't want to do in the first place. The only thing that quelled my soul doing so was that I believed we were truly going to make something ""worth"" a portfolio piece and it's guaranteed to get a decent amount of exposure. (e.g. press premiere etc.) 

I know I can't do the shoot we planned on doing for €600 let alone €80. 

I feel I am left with two big tough choices. 

B) Toss the storyboards, script and hours we've already put into it and start over. Kill our darlings. Abandon renting the RED, shoot on DSLRs and completely revamp and rewrite the project as a one day shoot and be ready to go by our original shoot day, which is in about two weeks.

In the spirit of full disclosure, I was originally going to ask for an €800 fee for writing, directing, editing and producing peripheral material for elsewhere in the Haunted House. Now it is clear that whatever fee I request it is coming directly from the 2K budget. 

A) bandon ship and use the energy and people I have on doing something for ourselves directly. It seems like the only way I can create a video I think is worth creating at this stage is if I eat my fee. 

However, I have other projects lined up I have an committed producer for a web-series I am writing and will be directing.  That same producer is also keen on helping me get some short films made, and I have a crew interested in putting their time into that as well.

These will not be paid, but the web-series alone will seemingly have an actual working budget of around 20K, and possibly more as we find more investors. I also have a potentially paid writing gig for a separate web-series as well. My point with all this is that I don't seemingly *need* this project to get my foot in door, nor do I need to initial investment to make something since i can find that elsewhere. 

Since I can't make the project I want to make in any sense of what was developed is it worth it to develop a ""high profile"" piece, locked down to the parameters of a Haunted House video, that provides no pay, on a shoe-string budget and not necessarily what my crew and I want to do?

Or should I suck it up. Take €500 for myself, coerce a crew to do the rest for ""exposure"" and their ""portfolio"" for what is essentially a commercial product, and create a much more simplified ""scary"" short. 

Or, most insidious, keep even more for myself and create a bunch of *creepy* videos using archival footage (as what has been occasionally suggested by the boss man commissioning the whole shebang).

TL;DR:
I am being asked to create a commercial piece of work for €2000 not including my fee, should I do it? "

I just wanted to share how this week was to me, I plan to do this every week in order to be able to look back at it when I am feeling bad (and thus feel better).
Short introduction: I am a 19 years old guy, living in the Netherlands. For my studies I am  right now doing an internship and in order to pay for my studies I teach a course at the university. I have been doing pmo since I was 12 and my addiction was that bad that I did it twice a day on average. I am quite social anxious and I always take comments from people about how I do things personal and i think about it the next few days. I see getting rid of this habit as a way to improve myself, and if I am lucky I hope to get more confident about myself, but this is not the main reason I do this. Last I heard some people getting rid of their acne, what would be quite nice if that would happen to me. 
Now that I have introduced myself, here is my report of the first week. (Note: this is my first attempt) The first 2-3 days were easy, I had enough other things to do, I worked, did sports and had fun with friends. In order to distract myself busy I decided to start driving lessons, go coach people who are new to my sports (rowing) and apply for a committee. After the easy first 3 days, I started to get more emotional, both in a positive and negative way. I mean that I enjoyed things more than I did before, but also that when i had some disappointments i felt worse about it than i did before. Next to that my work started, I had to teach again like I did last year. It felt much better than ever. Before I was afraid to stand in front of the class and explain the exercises, but now I really enjoyed explaining it to the students. This weekend has been the toughest so far, I am in a constant battle of doing other things instead of M. I try to keep my mind of it by listening to music and just keeping busy with other stuff. 
Thank you all for reading this! I would love to hear comments/tips;)
All the best and stay strong!"

1lzcel,0,2013-09-08,I [M23] am starting to get serious with a virgin [F19] but I am invested in another girl [F21] I won't see until next year. Do they need to know about each other?,dustyfingerzzz,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1lzcel/i_m23_am_starting_to_get_serious_with_a_virgin/,"So I had a fling with this girl Mandy [F21] back in January when she was on holiday. It was very brief, very passionate and since then, we've kept in touch over skype/snapchat/text etc. She lives in Australia and I live in the US so we've talked about making plans to see each other. Since she's still in university and will be for the next few years, I'll only get a chance to see her in April of next year. If I was living in the same place as this girl I would date her in a heartbeat.

We've had a talk about what we expect from the other person in terms of commitment etc. I've done long distance before and I told her that I'm going to need to get some action with other girls if we wanna make this work and my feelings won't change for her. I'm no player but if I had to wait over a year before I can kiss someone I'd be very unhappy and sexually frustrated.

So at the beginning of the summer at a party I made a move on a very cute freshman, Helen [F19]. The next day however, she had to leave on a study abroad trip. She had a summer internship back in her own state so I didn't see her but we've kept in touch and now she's back for the fall semester.

Helen's living on her own and I've been spending a lot of time with her these last few weeks. The first night I got her completely naked in her bed she confessed to me that she was still a virgin. Now I really like this girl and I would love to see where our feelings take us. I'd love to be her first but I know that she's going to expect some commitment first and I'm fine with that.

She knows that I may not be around for too much longer since my career plans and family obligations will have me out of this city before the year comes to an end. Since I know things are going to end too short with Helen due to circumstances, my goal is to leave this girl better off than how I found her.

The advice that I need is whether I need to tell either of these girls about each other. The next time I see Mandy will be long after Helen and I are over. I do feel like Helen has a right to know about Mandy before she loses her virginity but I don't know how I should explain everything to her.

I have strong feelings for both of these girls and at this point I haven't done anything to shit all over everything yet.

**With all this in mind, both of these relationships could naturally play out and I could be the only person burdened knowing this.**

TLDR: Kept in touch with a girl on holiday who lives elsewhere. I won't see her until next year. At the same time, things are starting to get serious with another girl who told me she's a virgin. I'd like to date both of these girls since they won't ever coincide. Do these girls need to know about each other?"

Second of all, I have NO IDEA how to dress for cold weather - I can get around in Alabama when it's cold, but clueless how to stay warm further north.  And if I can cannot stand to be cold in Alabama, I need a lot of warmth assistance.

So, I would LOVE some help figuring out:

1) Where the HELL can I find nice, reasonable, plus-sized professional wear THAT IS NOT MATRONLY (I am only 25, and find that most plus-sized professional clothing is made to suit people 20 years older than me - which would be awesome if I were 20 years older).

2) What KINDS of clothes should I consider for a cold climate?  I heard someone say snowboots, but most of them I find look like I need to go duck huntin'.

3) WHERE ARE BOOTS THAT WILL FIT MY AWESOMELY - AND TERRIFYINGLY - LARGE MUSCLE-Y CALVES

4)  If it helps you - I am a size 14 on top, 16 on bottom, very hourglassy and obviously there is more time at the bottom of the glass.

Ya'll - I need help.  Thanks for reading!

1lz1ks,2,2013-09-08,Excuse to leave my internship?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1lz1ks/excuse_to_leave_my_internship/,"My college requires a mandatory internship as a graduation requirement. I am currently doing one, but I'm extremely unhappy for reasons I will highlight below. 

Firstly, I was hired as an IT procurement intern, but I have not done anything related to that and it's been almost 3 months since I started here. My supervisors, although good employees, are weird when it comes to me. No one tells me if I'm doing something wrong on spot. They complain to the head boss, and then he calls me in a couple of days later and tells me that I was doing something wrong (which can be something as trivial as reading CNN or NYT during my lunch break).

Moreover, I have to complete my hours even if I do not have anything to do. So basically, if I've completed all my tasks and there's nothing left to do, I have to sit my ass down in front of my computer and pretend I'm doing something, else someone will complain to the head boss that I'm 'demotivating the entire team'. 

Once, someone told the boss that I had a fight with another employee. He called both of us to his office, and turns out someone does not know the difference between a friendly argument on the modern economic system and having a fight. Both of us were equally surprised that someone could be this stupid. 

Anyway, shit like this has put me in a really bad mood. I am from a different country than the other employees, and although I've worked and studied with people from different cultures before (and honestly, enjoy it) this has become a bit too much. 

I do not want to copy/paste data from one Excel file into another without being explained what the data is for. I'm here to learn, not to be a cheap laborer.

So, what excuse do I use to leave my internship that does not screw up my recommendation letter from the head boss. He is a nice guy actually, and not like my direct supervisors. 

TLDR: I hate my internship; what excuse do I use to leave it on good terms with my boss?  "

I'm really excited because I got an internship offer from the company I have been hounding for the last 2-3 months. I'll be working on one of the R&amp;D teams next summer and am really looking forward to it.

However, I want to see if I can get more out of this opportunity. My Embedded Systems Prof. offered me a research position starting January 2014, and he gave me the freedom to choose a project to start on. How feasible would it be to create a collaboration between the lab and the company? I think it would be great if I could work with the tech and do research on novel uses for it. 

What kind of issues can I expect? Who would essentially ""own"" this research, the company or the lab? The company already has another partnership with a Neuroengineering prof at my school, so that's where I got this idea. 

Any thoughts would be great as I am pretty new to the research game.

Thanks!"
1lyt4p,22,2013-09-08,[Challenge]7 more weeks for more discipline,amaik,getdisciplined,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1lyt4p/challenge7_more_weeks_for_more_discipline/,"Hello folks,  
  
The first week is done, or nearly done if you still have to tackle your task. I just finished mine and want to share the toughts that popped up in my mind this week.  
Since it was just one task difficulty was low and I managed to act every day without procrastination on my mission, focusing 90min on my musical projects.  
On Friday i came home very late from university and I was nagged by thoughts like: ""Just do two units tomorrow and skip it"" , ""not this evening your tired and can't cnoncentrate anyway"", etc...    
But knowing about all of you going through the challenge with me there was no way in skipping my job. That was the point I realised how much we can benefit from taking challenges together. It really motivates knowing about others doing the same stuff even if I never met anyone, and probably never will consciously. The internet really peaks in matters of advantage here. Did you have any similar experiences?  
Second thing is: 90mins are a lot of time. It happend that I have an internship at university and need to work from 9am to 6pm. When i created the challenge I wanted  to add another 90mins in the second week but now I think it's too much. So my new challenge is very simple : drinking one big glass of water every morning after waking up. Summed up my challenge for week two is:  
  
    
* 90mins of focused work on music projects
* drink a big glass of water right after waking up   
    
Another thing is that someone asked me what to do when he/she failed on one day and as a result **I will expand the rules, if you fail one or more days you do the following** :  
  
* First: resist to beat yourself down. It's scientific proof that beating oneself down in a willpower or discipline affair you end up continuing to fail, though you are more likely to succeed if you're kind to yourself.  
  
* Second : stay on track. I can't force you, but I assume you want to increase your discipline.  
  
* Third : Don't increase your mission counter. If you failed in week one you keep doing the same thing in week two without adding more missions.  
  

And that's it. If this is encouraging someone to fail, something is gone very wrong but I hope this helps people to stick to our mission.  
That's it from my side and I'm keen what your experiences are, share them in the comments together with your new mission and  I encourage all of you to stay on track and benefit as much as you can from this challenge.    

Furthermore for those who want to join,
[look at this thread for the rules.](http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1limyv/challenge_8_weeks_for_more_selfdiscipline/)  
Just one topic if you're joining now: Don't start with 2 tasks, just start by one and increase weekly when you succeded every day. You end up with one less then those started in the first week but, who cares.  
  
So far. Remember to share your views in the comments.

1lyrls,3,2013-09-08,[Help] Is this anxiety? What's wrong with me?,[deleted],Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1lyrls/help_is_this_anxiety_whats_wrong_with_me/,"Hi everyone. I've been having some problems and I know there are many knowledgeable people on this sub, so I hope someone can help to shed some light on my problems for me. I really appreciate any insight anyone has to offer, and I want to thank you upfront for even taking the time to at least read the following.

**1 - Background**

First of all, my background. I believe I've had mental health problems my entire life for various reasons (eg, long history of physical and psychological child abuse unto me), but for the most part, I've been able to cope with them just fine. To an outsider, I probably appear to be a well-adjusted, successful person. I excelled in college and went straight to a top law school, where I did well at least in terms of getting valuable internships. It's easy for me to talk to people and make friends. I have a great girlfriend who's just a terrific person.

But under the surface, I was suffering (the symptoms of which I'll describe later). So I decided to go to my university's (of my law school) counseling office for help. I had a few sessions and was eventually prescribed lexapro and klonopin. 

For various reasons, probably chiefly that I really don't like law (or law school) and because of the state of my mental health, I took a leave-of-absence from law school and returned to my parents' house, where I am right now.

**2 - Why I'm going to reddit instead of to my doctor**

I actually *do* see my doctor for these problems, but I haven't ever been completely forthcoming with him. Why? Because I'm afraid the symptoms I have are those of a crazy person and I don't want the doctor to just dismiss me as a loon who needs to be drugged, or as someone who needs to be institutionalized. So I figured here on reddit, under the veil of anonymity, I can finally be totally forthcoming without fearing repercussions or feeling embarrassed.

I'm an analytical person and I don't want to just be given some drug. I want to have a full understanding of why my brain is operating the way it is (because I know it's not operating appropriately).

**3 - Problems**

So here are the problems I told my doctor about:

- I get really irritated at literally everything. I'm not a violent person by any means, but I feel like I'm seconds away from snapping if something rubs me the wrong way.
- I don't give a shit about anything. I mean I really just don't feel anything. If my father died tomorrow, I probably would just start thinking about the hassle of dealing with the funeral, etc. If I got a $1,000,000 check in the mail, I'd probably just say ""meh,"" and go back to browsing the internet. Doing *stuff* feels like a chore. I just want to lay in bed and sleep all day.
- Speaking of which, the only thing that really brings me any pleasure whatsoever is sleeping. And in addition to that, smoking or drinking.
- I feel like everyone is watching me. And I feel like everyone who knows me is thinking negative things about me or laughing at me. I feel like I can read the thoughts of other people and I get the sense that they're scrutinizing me.

OK, so here are the problems I *didn't* tell my doctor:

- I constantly have fantasies of brutally attacking or killing people. I mean maiming them, like curbstomping them, or torturing them, like tying them down and slowly cutting them to death. No one in specific, and I've never taken any sort of action to bring these to fruition, but still. 
- Sometimes I get so mad it brings me to the brink of violence. For eg, one night my girlfriend said something (completely benign by the way), and I just suddenly got so mad that I felt my arms quivering as if I were about to reach over and start strangling her. The feeling of rage almost overwhelmed me.
- I always feel like I'm on the verge of being attacked. All the time. It's hard to describe, but imagine you're in a dark alley and you are completely sure a mugger is following you. This is the feeling i have, but everywhere I go, and even in the safety of my own home.
- I always feel bad late at night before bed. It's hard to describe, but imagine you're sick with a bad flu and you've just received a cancer diagnosis. There's this sort of 'all-over' feeling of ""bad"" in addition to being mentally defeated/fatigued. Honestly, it kind of makes me think about killing myself just to get rid of the ""bad"" feeling. I'm sorry I'm describing it in such abstract terms but it's a very vague sensation and difficult to put into words. 

**4 - caveat**

I really want to fix my brain. I've tried all sorts of various techniques (eg, meditation, focusing on proper breathing, forcing myself to look at things in a positive light, trying to just chill-out if something gets to me). But nothing's really worked all that much.

I've never hurt anyone, physically (literally, I really haven't). But here's the thing - as I insinuated above - I feel like I'm always on the brink of doing it. Just the other day, someone on the road made me mad and so I followed him for a quarter mile, blaring my car horn the entire time. The rest of the day, all I could do was fantasize about carrying a lead pipe in my car so I could have rammed his car off the road, pulled him out, and bash his face in.

So ... yeah, I realize that these sorts of thoughts are completely abnormal and unhealthy. But the thing is, they intrude into my thought pattern almost no matter what. 

I've never harmed my girlfriend either physically or psychologically. I can say that in complete truth. But as I mentioned above, I at times have had the thought of doing it, and it really troubles me since it's not right to have those thoughts.

**5 - conclusion**

So that's the long and short of it. I'll answer any questions anyone has. And I really will consider any advice you all have, so please, feel free to be candid with me. Thanks again."

I have no idea what this guy is thinking! I met him when I started working 4 years ago (internship of a few months) and he was my coworker, we hung up all the time and I am very grateful to him for helping me a lot during my internship. We lost contact except some emails for new year. At that time I thought he was kind of the ""forever alone"" type but he was very funny and smart.  
  


This year he visited my city for work, so I made him visit the city in the weekend, it was fun to catch up with him after so long!

After that things became weird... he began to send me very long and awkward emails. I answered shortly saying : can't he download a chat application, I don't like writing long emails, but he said no.  

  Selected extracts :    
""I send you several photos of my visit to your country, visiting with you : unforgettable, I have all the memories engraved, we do that again when you want ;)""
""also I send you 3 pictures that represent my hobbies : biking, music etc[...]""

I thought... ooh ok he is very enthousiastic! Then :

""Hmm maybe my last mail was a little inappropriate, maybe it is too hot here, I wanted to say I had a really good time and I would like to see you again. Do you plan to stay here long? I also liked this that ...[...]""

""I am very tired my doctor said I had chronic tireness""

""can we skype soon for [something we talked, he wants to hear about my job because he is unemployed and looking], I set up a date in the calendar""

""are you ok for this date? did you receive my call?""

There are much more!! I stopped answering but it keeps coming ...

:( I feel bad not answering to him because I thought he was a fun guy but these emails are really really weird for me and I don't know what to do!! I really don't want to skype with him for the moment... what should I do??

Also I have a boyfriend, and I leave thousands of kilometers away from this guy.

Thank you!

1lymgb,1,2013-09-08,Would it be safe to say the hardest part of running a business is entirely dependent on who the owner is?,[deleted],Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1lymgb/would_it_be_safe_to_say_the_hardest_part_of/,"This is just my personal observation. I come from a family of business owners, there are probably about 10 people in my immediate and extended family that own businesses.

It seems like the problems that people have aren't unique to the field in which their business is in, but they are unique to the owner.

My dads biggest weakness is hiring the right people. There is a high turnover rate because he tries to make guy with a marketing degree do telesales, and an engineering intern build a lab he's not qualified to build.

I would not say that these are problems unique to industrial hygiene, they're unique to the owner.

My aunt runs a psychology office, and has no freaking clue about any mental illness other than cause and effect ones. By cause and effect I mean, ""this happened and you are this way now because of it"". Like PTSD. She has no idea about psychosis or anything like that and (thankfully) refuses to treat those people.

While this problem might be unique to a psychology business, I doubt it's a common problem. She is the root of the problem because she doesn't understand certain mental illnesses that as a psychologist she should understand.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems to me that when running a business, the biggest roadblock you will ever have is yourself. It looks like the key to running a business is to not be egotistical and realize when you're doing something wrong and not repeat that mistake.

Probably easier said than done because nobody likes to admit they're doing something wrong, especially if they've been doing it for years. "
1lylg9,1,2013-09-08,"Lost in college, should I take an unrelated internship?",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1lylg9/lost_in_college_should_i_take_an_unrelated/,"I hope to explain things simple as possible and get the point quickly...

Basic background:

* Junior in CIS (closest subreddit I have to ask this question)

* Many internship interviews later with various companies (Apparently I suck at interviewing), I've received an offer to work with one of the top non-profit organizations, very, very well known. 

* Honestly surprised I landed it considering it was only 1 phone interview and I don't think I spoke very well. 

Problems:

* Not sure which field to enter after college, somewhat interested in Systems Analyst or Big data/Business intelligence solutions, but really I have no clue. 

* This internship feels like the jack of all trades. According to the description I'll be doing help desk support calls, QA testing, Project Management, hardware and software upgrades. I hear knowing a little bit of everything is bad compared to being specialized in one sector. Also it's kind of unrelated to my major because I DEFINITELY do not want to do technical IT work post college (sysadmin stuff - it's fun in the spare time but not a career thing to me)

* Just started a help desk position last month at my university. Very chill, I get to sit around and do homework/do whatever for pretty much 95% of my shift. More administrative work than help desk, but I still do some phone tech support. Supervisors are some of the coolest guys I've met. 

* Internship pays more than the current uni job, but I'm assuming I will actually have to work (this is me just being a lazy bastard) **and I'm afraid of burning bridges considering I just started a month ago.** They only have 2 student workers, me (mainly mornings), and another guy who does afternoons. 

* I'm still waiting to hear back from another company that I interviewed with for a data related internship in the health care field. Had 2 interviews and he followed up asking for my references which I think is a good sign. Very relaxed office environment and small team, not a well known company.

Sorry if this is a jumbled mess, but what would you guys recommend doing? This is a very great organization, but I'm not sure if it's worth doing the internship for 1 semester.

So Alice and I ""ran"" the 5k. Her husband pleaded out with ""I'm tired"", an excuse lamer than FDR, but I bit my tongue and let it slide. After all, I can't lose the weight for him, and if you'll remember from Phase I, he has to be *self motivated.* About .001 miles into the race I noticed that Alice was already red and sweating. 

""Alice,"" I ask carefully, ""How much cardio have you been doing in preparation for this?"" She glances at me sheepishly. We have worked out together a grand total of three times the entire summer and have been apart ever since. Because she wants to lose weight/get in better shape to go to NYC (and to run this race without dying) I have been assuming that she would exercise. ""I haven't done any exercise at all^teehee"" she replies to my horror, and we finished the 5k almost dead last, just in front of the children and grandmothers. I barely got Alice to jog any of it. What should have taken around 40 minutes (that's being generous) took us an hour. We headed to a local restaurant for lunch after I proclaimed that I was starving, and Alice said ""Well, since you're getting so much food I will too."" While I ate a large salad (with bacon!) and an orange, Alice consumed a chocolate donut, ravioli, bread, and a bag of chips. When she noticed me staring at her plate she shrugged and said ""Well, I probably burned off some of this during the 5k!"" My prediction is that she goes to her internship the same size as she is now."

The thing is that over the course of this year I've superseded them in skill level and they ask me questions about the software, ect (not trying to sound narcissistic).  The only thing that I'm lacking is construction management experience since my projects are just going into them right at the moment.  

I feel frustrated because I'm tired of seeing nice designs have their budgets exceeded with unnecessary purely aesthetic pieces thrown in their but if my boss doesn't agree with something I would like to do they say ""it's not in the budget"".  I feel like I've gained all the experience I can from this firm but I can't seem to find anything at any other firms in the area since I just have a BS Arch going against a M.Arch saturated job market.  Even though I only have a BS, I feel very competitive against the students that I've met from visiting/going to parties at schools in the area and seeing their work.

The long and the short of it is I am trying to get a job doing almost anything. I have spent a day here looking at a lot of other peoples resumes. Frankly this is the first time I have had a chance to observe how other people have created and formatted their own resumes. Prior to this my resume was very short and mostly blank white paper. I had only looked at standard resume formats offered by university's student career services.

How do I break this down to one page? I feel my resume is too wordy, too busy, and too cluttered. It should be reformatted. What is a good tried and true way to organize the information on this resume. I welcome any and all comments, suggestions, and advise. 

I have a job interview this Wednesday for an Insurance Agent position. I was contacted for this after posting my resume on Monster.com. I know nothing about selling insurance and I hate commission jobs so I really am reluctant to do this.

I will also apply for a seasonal help position at a specialty goods Big Box store and to a local supermarket's Pharmacy Technician position. I know I don't have ANY retail experience or good customer service experience in retail but I have experience working with a lot of different types of people. That should be worth something right? 

Please give me advise. 

I would also like to add that my university's career adviser for the College of Social Science was unhelpful and useless. There was hardly any useful advise she gave me that was not intuitively obvious and she was reluctant to openly and honesty discuss with me the reality of the current job market for history majors. It was sad watching both her and my Academic Student Adviser dance around that huge elephant in the room as if it did not exist. I will not go on to study History or pursue Education at the graduate level as the thought of taking out more student loans terrifies me and makes me sick. I have also ruled out teaching at primary schools because I never wanted to do that in the first place. 

I would also like to add that I did have a chance at an internship. I was program through my university were I would a boat load of money to live for a summer in Boston doing something for someone in exchange for academic credit. All expenses added up the cost would be at minimum $8,000 and probably close to $9,500 when it was all said and done. The only way to pay for me to pay for this was to take out more student loans which is foolish, foolish, foolish. "

1ly3to,3,2013-09-07,A sacrifice worthy of our Lord Gaben?,PeachesComeFromACan,pcmasterrace,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1ly3to/a_sacrifice_worthy_of_our_lord_gaben/,"Story time /r/pcmasterrace

So I have been a long-time master race member.  I have been building gaming PC's for many years both for myself and friends.  I have converted peasants by offering to build their shrine and teaching them the ways of our Lord. I have happily done this for friends at no charge; how can you put a price on enlightenment?  

Now, I do not consider the donation of my time and knowledge to be a sacrifice.  It is our sacred duty to bring the light to those who are willing to seek it.  However, my most recent attempt at conversion resulted in a great loss on my part.  On to the main tale...

So my now ex-GF (not a bad breakup, will explain) was always a peasant gamer.  She has been a 360 gamer with this current generation of peasantry.  I had told her of the ways of Gaben, and she would occasionally begin to show signs of a desire to rise above her peasant past.  This brings me to my sacrifice.

I had a glorious shrine.  I built it roughly 5 years ago.  955BE OC'ed, 8GB DDR3-1600, 240GB SSD, aftermarket fan on the CPU, full tower case with added fans, and two Radeon 4890's in crossfire to provide the true power.  Top of the line when it was constructed.  I also have a Sager notebook with an i&amp;-3610QM, 8GB DDR3 ram, and a GTX 670m.  I bought the Sager to take with me when I traveled for an internship last summer. 

Recently I had to move across the country for grad school, which was the reason for the aforementioned breakup.  A few weeks prior I decided I would make a grand sacrifice.  This was the ultimate sacrifice and the decision was not an easy one.  After much deliberation, I gave my glorious shrine to my GF so she could begin her ascension.  I still have my Sager notebook that can handle anything I need to play, but the loss was a large one. 

I may build a new shrine in the future, but grad school has limited my available gaming time.  For now, I am content with gaming on the Sager.  I of course still use my gaming keyboard, mouse, and a proper 24"" monitor.  

What do you think /r/pcmasterrace?  Was this sacrifice worthy of Gaben's praise?  Have I done the master race proud?  Have I shown my true devotion to our Lord and Savior?"
1ly3ju,4,2013-09-07,"Facing serious anxiety for the first time, I think I need advice",SoManyMilesAway,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1ly3ju/facing_serious_anxiety_for_the_first_time_i_think/,"I recently graduated college where I was very comfortable, had many friends, and was very successful. College was easy and very enjoyable for me, I understood college and had little responsibility outside class and a part time job. You could say that I was a very social person who rarely missed out on a weekend of fun. I was always a huge procrastinator but was able to maintain a high GPA and relatively low stress, relying on my intelligence and ability to present myself well. 

I took an internship after graduation this summer with a very successful company and they recently hired me on full time, the catch being I had to relocate to the Twin Cities from another large Midwest city. It is a very good job, earning $70,000 a year, impossible to pass up for someone straight out of college. I do not know anyone in the Twin Cities and my job has be working from home without any direct supervision so I do not have very much communication during the day outside of calling on clients. 

Ive never been completely alone in my entire life, I've always had a least one friend who I've been able to lean on. I don't have that now and I think that may be the catalyst for my anxiety. I've always had friends or been in a situation that has allowed me to make friends. I am not in that kind of situation right now, I don't even have ""coworkers"" that I can go get drinks with after work.

I also am just bombarded with work but I am shutting down. I find myself feeling unprepared to enter this new stage of my life, which has led me to just procrastinating all day. I am definitely under performing in my job and am scared my supervisor will figure me out soon. Everyday I tell myself to suck it up and get work done but I'm just not able to do it and constantly get distracted. I just do everything I can to avoid being productive. I constantly have a sick feeling in my stomach. And my anxiety is getting worse with each day.

I am not sure if my anxiety is coming from my work procrastination (I've always had a degree of ADD and struggle to concentrate on things) and I need to resort to a ADD medication such as Adderall to keep myself on task or if my anxiety is causing my procrastination and I need to seek help professionally. My brother suffers from social anxiety and temporally had to drop out of college because it got so bad for him. I am scared the same thing is happening to me. He has learned to work with his anxiety due to my mother's amazing support and some very high quality therapy work. 

I know the best thing I can do is to tell my Mom I'm struggling because I know she'll support me and help me get through this but every time I come close to telling her I can't. Shes already had to deal with so much with my brother and things are finally getting better with him. How can I dump this on her now. I'm supposed to be the son who has everything going for him, the one she doesn't need to worry about. I cant tell her because I'm embarrassed what she'll think of me, I'm embarrassed what my Dad will think and I'm embarrassed what my brother will think. Everyone has this perception that I have control over my life and I feel pathetic that I don't.

I just want this feeling of anxiety to go away. Being new to this feeling I'm just trying to get advice from people who have experience with anxiety. I'm not even sure if that all made any sense but its all I could get out right now and I cant bring myself to reread it. Thank you in advance for any help you can give me."

1m2c8d,15,2013-09-09,I think we should drastically cut welfare in the US. CMV.,AntiSpec,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1m2c8d/i_think_we_should_drastically_cut_welfare_in_the/,"My mother came to this country with two kids, no money and couldn't speak a word in English. We originally lived in a roach infested apartment in a not-so-great neighborhood. She worked night and day in a factory equivalent to a sweat shop for minimum wage. She moved up the ranks to become manager, with that, we managed to move to a better neighborhood and afford a car after three years in America. Soon after she started a business and we were able buy a summer house. Six years later, we moved again to an actual house and bought another car. She still works day and night, even on weekends. During this adventure, she only needed welfare for the first six months we moved to America.

Now for my part, seeing my mother work this hard, it inspired me. I got a job as soon as I was of age and it only took me a week. I worked hard and got a few raises, several dollars above the minimum wage. I left the job when I started to attend college but worked other small jobs here and there. When I needed money again, I went out looking and again I got a job within a week doing deliveries. I worked hard and received raises, earning a bit more than double the minimum wage. When I looked for internships in my field, I got one within one month (with no connections).

My entire family and friends have similar stories to my mother and I. We worked hard and got what we deserved. Yet, people are still on welfare and in the same position for couple of years. Some have no intent of making better of themselves. When we were broke, I got robbed by someone who had better shoes than me and I only had a dollar on me. I have no sympathy to anyone who doesn't apply themselves. Why should I pay for their leisure? 

Some apply for welfare when they have kids. Why should I pay for their kids when I'm waiting to be financially fit to afford them while they just didn't use a condom or think of the consequences? We all went to the same schools and had the same opportunities, yet I get punished for succeeding when others haven't even tried? I go to school two hours away from me and some people aren't willing to do 30 min commutes.

From my point of view, the world doesn't owe anybody a goddamn thing. CMV"

Ideally I'd love to get into TV or movie production starting as a PA where I can show my worth and learn from well established professionals. I'm an exceptionally hard worker when given a task, especially when that means I'll get to learn something new. 

I do have some experience with production from college and through an internship after graduation. While in school I was a part of the University Student Television Network where I worked on a sports related series (think ESPN, but lower production value). After college I began my internship at the marketing department at a local hospital. My job there entailed writing, filming and editing educational interviews with patients and employees to be placed on the company's website.

Like I pointed out in my title, I'm willing to move anywhere for the right opportunity. I don't particularly want to move across the country for a short term contract. If however, that contract work lead to a long term deal, I'm certain that I would prove my worth, so I'd be more than interested.

Over the past summer, I've tried to develop a somewhat zen/Taoist stance on my own personal interests, and have come to get over doubting myself so much as to what I feel like doing. I used to be very impulsive and quick to start new projects as a kid, but over the past few years I've by and large very aimless and apprehensive in starting anything for inability to see any greater unity or purpose behind any of it. I realized that I often defined my ideas more in terms of pre-existing ones and chalked that up to their being completely sentimental and unsound, but then began thinking I ought to simply do things because I've said that they interest me. It's led to a realization that as one develops more familiarity and momentum with what they're doing, they start to think less in terms of precedents, kind of like learning a language, one initially is mostly taking rules and literal translations of words at face value, but over time they become more inclined towards the general flow, nuance and natural style present in the way they work. I know I'm sounding really vague here, that's because I'm recounting an experience with getting back into level design for games and not wanting to use very particular, technical examples.

But now it's time to go back to school! I'm in my third year of college and have realized I'm no closer to realizing what it is exactly I should major in spite of any alleged personal development I've had on the home front. As INFPs, we're conscientious enough to do relatively well in most things we apply ourselves to, until we become familiar with them. When I was simply taking introductory classes in most-of-anything, I could take the work seriously by simply viewing it as a means to an end (the end being completion of general prerequisites in college). Then I get enthusiastic, consider declaring a minor, look at higher-level courses, try to imagine what I'd actually be doing working in that field, and it becomes a question of why should I bother? History, religion, philosophy, I like to read about them but perhaps the creative in me ultimately feels as though there isn't anything truly unique I could contribute to these fields of study. I know these things take time, but I feel as though I'm more genuine when I stick with writing and game design, though these things too I know would ultimately not give me total creative control were I to try and pursue them professionally.

So I'm completely stuck as to what I'm supposed to ""get over myself"" on.

Again, you ought to simply be content in doing things because you've said you've set out do to them. That's great for my personal projects. But in school I simply feel as though I'm expected to go through the motions, towards some ideal end, and there's always the talk of networking, acquiring internships, and all of these other things that I feel won't serve any purpose whatsoever except in the future, when you're looking in hindsight and creating a linear narrative of causation as to how you've arrived at your current position in life.

Firstly, I don't know what my position in the future will be, so it all feels like blind, irrational actions and measures rather than a ""means to an end"" which I can convince myself is something I've chosen voluntarily to accept and move forward with. Ultimately I suppose I could tell myself that no differently from how I tell myself to finish a personal project because I simply said I'd do so.

My dad (an INFJ) has had a very serendipidous life himself, from studying architecture -&gt; art -&gt; repo man and assorted other temp jobs -&gt; photo retouching -&gt; graphic design, and we've talked at length about this sort of thing and he says that all I have to really be concerned with at the moment is what I'm going to do next. That college is the ""means to an end"" for, in the short term, having a fair amount of options open and a means to make a living initially.

But when I contrast that ""taking it easy"" in college building some crude semblance of a resume and getting to know people (rather than being stuck drifting between some - in the short term though, perhaps more immediately gratifying - minimum wage jobs) with any other possible path I could've taken, it's sort of like ""for what reason should I expend any more money and energy in something I might not intend to stick with?"" If my agenda right now is to have enough money to not-die-of-starvation, I may as well join the army or something.

I continue to work on websites and game levels because I enjoy doing so, though I could never be consistent from one day to the next in telling you what is exactly that makes me feel so engaged and accomplished. But the working world is just on this entirely separate level of consideration that has never really crossed my mind. Life never ends - you could make a choice with something as arbitrary as a coin toss or the I Ching, but it doesn't really matter, you have no idea of knowing whether you'd objectively be better off had you taken the other path. There will probably never be a point in my life where I'll say ""I've finally arrived"" - so again - why do anything, or make any distinction between choices beyond personal or pragmatic considerations?

I'm probably not making a lot of sense at the moment, but I suppose what I'm saying is that I'm having difficulty maintaining a work ethic with anything in the longer term. I'm taking some classes this semester that interest me, but what honestly are they representative of? Is it really good enough to just say ""this is a way to pass the time completing requirements for my minor while simultaneously being enthusiastic about the nature of the work?"" If that's really all it is, why am I even in school and taking classes in the first place when I could find equal contentment in sleeping under a tree?

I think about most everything that's open for study in college, and as soon as I tell myself the class sounds interesting I also begin thinking about how I'd weave it into the BS-laden narrative of my cover letter as to how it's representative of my greater nature and interest in culture, ideas, and humanity at large. Suddenly my program of study is no longer for myself but damage control for how I go about pitching myself to employers. I don't like that one bit. Why do anything?

Some internal, personal goals are needed, except I don't trust myself enough to be even remotely on the mark with the geniuneness of those, either."

This is my first post here, i've been a lurker for a little while now. My question is this: What kind of withdrawal symptoms do you think I am going to experience....

I started using 30 mg oxy (blues) last spring here at college. One would do me over pretty good and it wasnt too bad of a habit. Towards the end of the semester I would be snorting one (sometimes two) a couple days a week. 
When summer rolled around I was lucky to receive an internship in my home city. I didnt have to pay for rent (since I was living at home) and most of my expenses like food were paid for. So my paychecks from this internship went strictly to blues. I would say over the course of the summer I was using about 90mg a day or every other day.
When I came back to school this fall my friend/dealer stopped selling blues and offered up fentanyl powder instead. He said this would help curb and withdrawals I would have from the oxy. 
Now obviously this isnt pure fent, my friend told me it was cut with suger or some other type of filler, but I have been doing about .1 of this a day or every other day.
My last dose of fent powder was Friday and Saturday I was fortunate enough to get an Opana 15 which I snorted. This held me over for about a day. 
When I dont get any fent/opana/oxy after about 48 hours I start to feel really tired, lethargic, anxious, just overall not good.

So finally my question is: after all of this over the past few months, how severe do you think my WDs will be if I stopped cold turkey? Do you think I should try to find a sub strip? Or would that even be necessary?

I look forward to hearing your responses!"

However, I just recently took the GRE as an undergraduate senior and I'm not too happy with my scores of 153 in both quant and verbal. This equates to 53% in the quant portion as well as 58% in the verbal. I have to wait roughly two weeks before receiving the written grade.

My main question is whether or not I will be disqualified upon applying to phd programs based upon the GRE. At the moment my overall GPA is a 3.6 with a major GPA of 3.7, I work as an organic chemistry TA (2nd year), general chemistry lab assistant (2nd year), had a summer internship at a pharmaceutical company, and have been performing research at my university for 9 months now (It will continue until I graduate this may).

Will these credentials weigh more than the GRE score or am I pretty much screwed? Any feedback would be really appreciated!

UPDATE: Hey there, so if anyone is ever in the same situation as my own and happens to stumble across this post, I just wanted to let you know that I was just accepted to my first chem PhD program and it was in the top 15% of graduate chem programs in the USA.

I'm a post-audio engineer in NYC. I've been in audio post production for 5+ years now, been working for the same company since I was an intern, now I'm a re-recording engineer and sound designer. I have a lot of experience in recording VO and ADR, sound effects and sound design, dialogue editing, and mixing for film, documentary, and television. 

I've decided that I hate working for a big company who pays shit, and have enough contacts to start doing freelance work, so I'm going to be taking the plunge within the next month or so.

I have an editing setup at home, but hope to take my skills to other studios around new york city for mixing, sound design, and recording.

So, I'm wondering what are some solid steps to take to becoming a successful freelance engineer?

1. Should I start an LLC?
2. What's the best option for health insurance?
3. How do taxes work (assuming I'm a work for hire, based on the type of job needed). Do you pay at the end of the year? What percentage of my income should I expect to pay?
4. Should I join the union?
5. How do you set your rates? Do you have a fixed hourly rate, or do you adjust per job? Luckily, I have a copy of my company's billing, so I have an idea of what kind of money gets generated here, so I have a good platform to start with.
5. Anything else I should know that doesn't get talked about much, or something that you learned the hard way?

Any and all advice is appreciated. I hope this thread does well and we get good discussion about the scary world of freelance engineering.

We've had mutual crushes for the past two years, though we didn't know about the other person's.  We broke up for a number of reasons, the biggest of which was distance (NY to FL) and her wanting to focus on school/building up a professional life via contacts, internships, and whatnot.  Those I completely understand (being a senior in college and having a solid professional foundation), but the part that burns through me was a comment she made about maturity/incompatibility - she changed a lot over the summer (she was abroad; we stayed in _very_ good contact, though), changed quite a bit, but tried hiding the changes from me when she came back.  New-her didn't give me an opportunity to adapt to the changes, and cut me out as a relic of her past.

Again, I completely understand the necessity for splitting up due to the distance and her reprioritization, but her comments as to our sudden incompatibility, lack of commonalities, and how I didn't change over the summer while she changed a lot (again, changes which she went through efforts to hide) - hurt and are confusing.

I have most of my situation figured out, in that it's very clear to me what I need to do, but I want advice from this community anyway. I'll try my best to keep the details short, so please ask plenty of clarifying questions.

*Background*: My girlfriend and I have been dating for almost one year. We met in college when I was senior and she was a junior. She is on a paid internship with a major pharmaceutical company in another part of the state I live in. I currently live at home and work in a part-time retail job as an assistant coach for the high school I went to.

---

Here's the sparknotes of our situation:

I have struggled with an eating disorder, anxiety, depression, and suicide attempts over the past four years that have limited my success. 

I met a girl at the beginning of my senior year, we fall in love.

I failed out of college 9 months later.

Girlfriend is successful.

I need to go back to finish my degree; in a point of transition.

My intent has not been backed by action. Partly circumstance, partly my fault.

Girlfriend sees this, doesn't feel as in love with me as she used to.

She says the distance between us has brought out these issues.

Other minor issues between us like the social faux pas I commit.

She says ""I am all talk,"" that she needs to see the progress, that I have all these great plans, but I don't execute them, et cetera.

In her own words: 

&gt; ""At some point in the last two weeks I feel like I removed myself from you, I don't know why. It might be because I don't like feeling sad when we're apart and I want to protect myself from that feeling, or because I'm at a point where there are so many opportunities ahead of me and I don't know where my life will take me and I'm afraid that I'll end up somewhere where we aren't together and I don't want that to hurt me either. So instead of accepting the fact that the future is uncertain but I can still live my life the way I want now I'm building up my defenses for the future.""

&gt; ""To answer the question you always ask me, there are things I don't like about you. I don't like how extreme you are in certain cases. I don't like when you don't know how to act in a social situation. I don't like when your actions don't match your words. However you are the only man that has ever gotten me to open up as much as I have with you. You are a guy who I feel like I can have a fight with but work it out and be ok. You don't make me feel bad about myself. You value a lot of the same things I do, and I think that the person I want to be is the person you want me to be also. I know that there is no person in the world that is perfect, but I think it's important that you can identify what is important and what isn't. I think that the things I love about you are the important things. I do think about what it would be like to be with someone else, someone who's different, but that doesn't mean I don't want to be with you, and sometimes I have a hard time with that. [My name] I love you and I miss you...""

---

How do I tell her that improving my situation is not entirely under my control, that I can't make companies hire me? 

How can I reassure her that I am now doing everything I can in spite of my struggles and lack of progress? 

How should I explain to her that this is difficult and that none of it is intentional?

She said she doesn't want to set any kind of hard deadline, but she says she can't wait much longer for me to come around. 

What kind of deadline should I set for myself? 

If it means the end of our relationship, how should I handle it?


**tl;dr**: I have some personal issues that have limited my success and are now affecting my relationship. What should I do (or not do) to save my relationship?

I come seeking the advice of the masses. It seems more often these days that people are finding the right answer and getting the help they need from social outlets so here is my shot in the dark.

I just graduated college this last December and am staring down the massive debt that is student loans (about 60k). Thankfully, I was able to get an internship at a company that matured into a full time position but sadly in this economy it’s not quite enough to dig out of the abyss that is earning a 4 year college degree. I have plans/dreams like most other Americans. I want to pay off my credit card debt, get out of these personal loans, pay off that dreadful auto loan, live the American dream and buy a house but most importantly I want to put a ring on the love of my life’s finger.  When the cards fall it’s a sad day knowing that the hard earned money I have from this wonderful post bachelors degree job just isn't enough.

So, I ask you oh wise and benevolent Redditors, what sort of part time or side jobs would you recommend to someone who works a steady 8am to 4:30pm looking to bring in some extra income? I am not afraid of hard work either; I served in the US Air Force for 6 years so I am ready to make that sacrifice. I currently work in the IT industry as a Software Tester and there in lies my strengths but I want to put in the work to get out of debt so doing something like over night stock or loading garbage on the weekends is defiantly on my radar. 

TLDR; what would be the best part time job to search for so I can get out of debt faster?

I'm a Junior Mechanical Engineering student (3.1916 gpa) studying at Michigan State with a few questions. First off, I'm out of state, I grew up and live in south central PA and plan to return there to work for at least this upcoming summer when I intern. That brings me to my first question. When is the proper time to really start looking for internships for next summer? Right now? My school has a career fair at the beginning of October and a summer internship fair in February, I'm seriously considering attending the October fair, not to look for jobs, but to just practicing chatting with the recruiters and networking...since I have 0 experience doing so. But I'm fairly certain I won't be finding any internships down around my hometown area. I did just recently sign up on LinkedIn, ASME, and my school's career website and uploaded my resume. I've been looking everyday on those sites for job listings. Also, I want to do something with my spare time this/next semester, whether it's a research position or some sort of job, anything to build my resume. What suggestions do you have that would look good on my resume and help me gain some experience? My only work experience has been on our family farm for 8 summers working for my dad. Also, since that's my only current experience, do you think that's enough to land an internship if I can't find anything to do between now and next summer? Sorry for the long read and possible jibberish, I had a lot I needed to ask and didn't want to forget anything. "

1m15xp,219,2013-09-09,Please be careful regarding Lol-Class and other coaching sites.,natelikewhoa,leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1m15xp/please_be_careful_regarding_lolclass_and_other/,"Hey all. I've seen a couple threads and heard some feedback from friends about Lol-Class and other coaching sites, so I thought I'd weigh in.

I'm not trying to be super negative, but I just want people who may be a bit more naive when it comes to the internet and businesses in general to understand the reality of coaching sites and lessons.

--&gt; There is no concrete system backing up your transactions.

What I mean by this is that there is no accessible (read: cost-benefit net positive) legal system or regulatory body directly enforcing your transactions. Technically when you engage in e-commerce with a business there are legal actions you can take via your local courts/their courts, but let's just leave it at this: It will never be worth your time.
Unless you recover your funds through community outrage/customer service, it is unlikely you will have a recourse/remedy.

--&gt; These sites are not invested in heavily, nor are they accountable.

Lol-Class and many others like it before have lots of pro names on the site, ""partnerships,"" sponsors, etc.  Think about this: There is no primary company here. This is not ""CLG Lol-Class"" or ""CRS Lol-Class."" The pros are not beholden to this site.

If they fuck up, the worst thing that will happen is that their manager, or the admin for the site might angrily skype or text them. It is not their priority, and it will not ever be so. Don't expect this to be a situation where a business is at the mercy of the consumer, and will operate above board at all times.

If ""major"" online/scene-based organizations/businesses like WCG, ESL, Own3d, and many many others will fail to follow through on payments or services, then there should be no surprise when a fledgling coaching site does so.

--&gt; The Income-Reliability paradigm, and why it matters to you.

An important aspect of e-sports and internet endeavors in general is the idea of an Income-Reliability paradigm.

Think about when you visit a brick and mortar (meaning IRL concrete location for a business) outlet or facility. These places have responsibilities, from local government ordinances to federal tax and employee benefit laws to deal with.

Thus, these businesses have to hire people according to the level of the business's income that they feel will fulfill the Income-Reliability paradigm. Even a McDonald's store will hire decently capable and intelligent managers because of the income potential for the store. These people are reliable, mature, etc.

Now consider an internet coaching site for one of many competitive video games. As this is a fledgling industry, this site will never captivate a qualified business professional's full attention, nor will it have an inherent guaranteed reliability, due to the lack of actualized income.

Even if a lesson fills up every 2 days, and the income gross is $1,000 to the site, the split of this money is still meager. To a recent college grad, young intern, or low-status web developer, this may be an appealing part-time job, but most of the income and interest is derived from the interest in being a part of the ""scene.""

Simply put, there isn't enough money in coaching league of legends through a website to make someone really accountable to the level of reliability and maturity you'd want from someone taking in your money.

--&gt; Full Disclosure:

I've personally experienced problems from both the consumer side of these situations, -and- the coach/instructor/business side.

In the SC:BW/SC2 community I had firsthand knowledge of the utter mess that scheduling these lessons was, the terrible logistics in place for connecting coaches with students, and the lack of any semblance of maturity and accountability of the people running the site.

In the League community, when I first resumed playing actively (been around since beta) about 1-1.5 years ago, I was a Silver scrub trying to get a lesson through a site claiming to employ/represent Aphromoo and many other pros, only to find out the site was complete bullshit and had no authority to represent the people it did.

I was then bombarded by the site's manager and a community figure (to remain nameless) accusing me of libel (written form of slander) and many other things. As a law student I had to explain to this person over skype that I was not going to accept their laughable legal terms, and that their business practices were shoddy at best.

---

Conclusion:

I hope Lol-Class does well. I only even wrote this post because I visited the site to check out their offerings.

I just want people to really understand the risks of paying someone over the internet for a service that outside of community outrage and reputation, is not really accountable to anyone.

I know there are a lot of really young summoners and redditors, so I hope this helped in some small way."
1m149a,6,2013-09-09,[Question] Looking for paid apprenticeship in marketing in Paris.,tama_gotchi,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1m149a/question_looking_for_paid_apprenticeship_in/,"Hello r/jobs.

I'm hoping someone can help me out with my query.

I studied media in college and spent a year after I graduated teaching business English in Paris (after receiving the CELT qualification). Since then I've done some internships / work experience with various media outlets.

I had to stop though as not getting paid for working really hard is damn frustrating. I found a job teaching English to students and I really enjoyed it, unfortunately it just didn't pay me enough to afford moving out from my parents place.

So now I'm in the Middle East, still teaching. I took the summer to think long and hard about what I want and where I want to be (I'll be 27 when I finish this school year). I've always been interested in the world of advertising and marketing. Both my sisters work in marketing and they agree it would suit me quite well and think I have the potential to be quite good at it.

I have a few weeks of holidays throughout the school year and I intend to find work experience in marketing during that time as I don't have the money or time to go back to college to do a course.

My SO is French and planning on moving back to Paris next summer. He'd like me to go with him. I would like to go with him too but I'm very aware that things may not work out between us, and where does that leave me? I have thought about this a lot and I'm basically making 2 plans for the end of the year (one for staying here if things don't work out, another for what happens if I go to Paris).

I know from living in Paris previously that it's possible to do a paid apprenticeship or ""stage"" - one month of lectures, one month of work, being paid for your time the whole way along. This is obviously the ideal solution for me. I was looking some things up online and read somewhere that any apprentices must be under 26 (I tried looking this up further to no avail).

I have contacted an old student of mine from Paris who was working in marketing for her advice but I'm just looking for as much information as I can find.

I will have a decent amount of savings when I leave here and I have so much teaching experience I know I won't have a problem finding a job teaching (if I need the money), I know I'll be able to keep myself going while living in Paris for a little while - but, I'd like to get going on my ""career"". I don't want to be a teacher and I fear that if I do much more of it I will just find myself being a teacher and that'll be it.

I have an ok level of French at the moment and I'm starting lessons soon, my SO is also helping me out with French (watching movies / TV shows with me etc) so language shouldn't be an issue, also, I'm European so I won't have a problem with visa's or anything.

**TL;DR Possibly moving to Paris in June 2014, looking for an ""in"" into marketing / advertising. Can anybody point me in the direction of a paid apprenticeship / internship in those areas? Any other words of wisdom or tips are most appreciated!**"
1m0ztr,2,2013-09-09,Today was...different...,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1m0ztr/today_wasdifferent/,"TL;DR I'm over my life and everything attached to it.

My mum wrote a note today. I didn't read it. I was talk it was a suicide note by my dad. My mother has had a long history from depression. She has taken more depressive medicine in her entire life more than I have saved $100 dollars.

My mum also just went for a walk and went missing for 6 hours.
All this just because my dad is an asshole. She obviously has mental instability but he prods her with emotional abuse constantly. Sometimes, I'm just so angry as this asshole of a father. Demeaning her in front of guests (Oh my wife sleep talked the entire night hur dur that is more important to her well being)

Another few things to top off my life, I cannot find a job. Got rejected for an internship that was VOLUNTARY. Why? It is like getting turned down for the 100m sprint because you don't have a proper hair cut....

My life is a mess, the only thing that is stopping me crying or feeling anything is weed. It numbs the pain. Even entirely."

It usually ends in both sides crying especially because we are drunk most of the time arguments happen. These arguments don't feel like the ""helpful"" ones that every relationship has, it's like to the point when one little thing starts a big thing and goes around in the same old circle. We are both under stress (I'd like you guys to say who you think has more stress in your opinion)


 **Me**: no money/looking for employment/bored because of no job/hassled all the time about getting a job. I am constantly looking but I won't settle for a minimum wage job just to ""have"" a job. The industry i'm in is just hard to get your foot in the door but once you are in its much easier. Luckily my family is slightly above middle class so they spot me money time to time.


**Her**: Has some money but also has a 50k debt on the way from grad school, She is not rich but her aunt is well off and loaned her the money so she will have to pay it back with 0% interest. She is a social worker and just started her internship this week + grad school. Says she is extremely overwhelmed and needs my love + support. (Which obviously I do but there's one part I will go over were it gets tricky)


**The tricky part about supporting her is this**, She had an adderall addiction I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT ADDERALL but from just googling and reading it looks like it can fuck you up. I am helping her through that (She use to take 160-220+ MG a day) She cut clean and her doc lowered the amount she has 90-45 but not that MG, I know shes not taking the dose she should but she gets mad when i start getting on her about it and i only see her F/Sat/Sun. So its like i don't wanna be the bad guy every weekend bringing that up. Tricky part #2 The past few weeks she been having ""panic attacks"" she will legit think she is gonna die holding her neck, saying she can't stand,shes gonna pass out etc. Sometimes she will text me at night saying the same thing. For the first 20 minutes or so I am supportive and try to calm her, when it goes longer then that I start to get mad because it's like ""Ok you think you're gonna die? Let me take you to the hospital then"" And she just says something like no i just need to rest or whatever and its like OH YOU MEAN WHAT IVE BEEN SAYING FOR 20 minutes, that you need food/water/rest and to stop thinking about it! Like how do I handle that i don't have the most patience in the world?



**tl;dr**: How do I handle arguments where I KNOW I'm right, Do i just let her ""win"" the little ones? Or defend my self all the time If I believe i'm right. I tried doing the ""Yup, No you are right"" and that doesn't work either. Also any advice on the problem above the tldr?"

It's the last place to turn to. I need 875 for rent but im gonna go ahead and sell my laptop so that should get me a couple hundred bucks. I could just use the computers at school, I dont really NEED a laptop so no problem. Therefore I need 700 dollars to cover the rest. I will be able to pay this back in 2 installments October 10th will be 400 and Nov 10th will be another 400. Yes I am willing to pay 100 in interest but if you can loan this to me with no interest or little interest I would really be grateful and thankful. If you want to know exactly how it is I got here then please read on. If not, then thank you for stopping by.

My fiancee graduated from college this year. She got her bachelors in accounting. She was offered a good job before she finished school as a paid intern but turned it down because she felt that finishing school was important. We have been making it through me doing computer jobs and her working a normal job(not her career) as a customer service rep. So she finally graduated and everything is great right? Wrong! The best job she can get right now is a 13 dollar an hour job, 45 minutes away. Which means I have to walk the kids to school every morning 35 minutes and pick them up after school another 35 minutes. But she needs the Accounting Experience so she takes it. We don't have money for a babysitter so thats me right now. Im a house dad. I clean and cook and do the laundry. I clean the restroom and keep the kids happy till mom gets home. She just started work and a couple weeks ago she tells me ""hey can you do what you have to do to pay the rent for Sept. I wont get enough on time to do it. You have to do whatever just make sure you get that rent."" So im sitting there like HOW the hell am I supposed to do that? But she's already stressed out and crying because she really thought getting a degree would be the key to a good life. Its the same life with a degree guys. Same life with a framed piece of paper. So I tried doing everything I could. I did a few computer clean ups and used that money for groceries, the light bill and shampoo and a good stock of toilet paper/tooth paste. Here I am September 9th and I got my Notice to pay or quit on Sept 4th. That was a 3 day notice. They are telling me that I will be out of time on Tuesday. Tuesday is my last day. I cant be a baby sitter, go to school and work a job. I cant do it. I keep asking myself what could I have done to prevent this?? 

How I am capable of paying this back:::
My fiancee is gonna continue to work and finally get her first few checks. So that will hold us off for Octobers rent Nov, Dec, etc... The way that I will get you the money back is on October 10th I have a check coming from school. I get it every Feb/March and every Oct/Nov. On the 10th it never fails. In this year ill get it Oct 10th and Nov 8th because the 10th of Nov is on a Sunday. So they give it to me the working day previous. I get 500 on Oct 10th and 500 on Nov 10th. That is how Ill be able to pay you back.

I am willing to scan you my ID, school ID, location, email, we can Skype if you want. Whatever you want but my fiancee cannot know that I took out a loan. She will only hurry to pay not thinking of what we need to do to sustain the household. I cannot have her stress out over this, she's already working a job she hates and is already all messed up because graduating from one of the best Accounting schools California has, was NOT the golden ticket she thought it was. She's gonna gain her experience and try to move up that way. But this is one weight I will carry on my own shoulders. Please help if you can. Please...

Sincerely,
xcureanddisease

P.S. Alternatively if you want computer help, i can sit with you as long as you want and show you how to maintain your own computer. What it is they're really telling you at Best Buy when they mean tune up, which anti virus to get etc. I can tell you anything you want to know about that."
1m0qic,14,2013-09-09,Tired of it...,throwawayforrslashFA,ForeverAlone,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/1m0qic/tired_of_it/,"I'm 21. I've never had sex. I've never been kissed. I've never had a girlfriend. I've never experienced the feeling of mutual attraction. I go to one of the most infamously promiscuous colleges in the United States, and I still have no success (for one thing, I don't *want* just sex without any sort of romantic feeling). My college friends are also FA, pretty much. My high school friends aren't, and I feel like I annoy them when I try to talk about it. I feel like every time I do, I hope for some kind of answer outside of what I usually get, but that never happens, and it's kinda douchey of me to expect it to.

I feel defective.

I'm a senior in college. After this semester, I'm hoping to get an internship out of state. After that, I want to teach English in Japan. So why do I even bother? If anything even happens, it'll be a three-month relationship with some chick I prolly just met, which will inevitably end awkwardly when I'm all like, ""welp, it's time for me to be off to do my thing and then I'm going to Japan. Buh-bye"". So I should just extend my being alone until I'm *at least*, like, 23 (language barrier and not having any friends in the area is certainly going to make things difficult).

I don't even know how to meet people I'd be interested in and who would also be interested in me, man.

I dunno why I'm coming here. Maybe to get it offa my chest. Maybe just to talk. Maybe for whatever answer I'm hoping for. Not like I'll get much help here, though.

Sorry if I come across as an asshole for that last sentence. I type this and feel like a cliche neckbeard loser. I'm not, exactly. I shave on a regular basis, I feel gross if I go a day without showering, I'm a bit overweight, but not nearly as much as I used to be. I don't dress very well and I have stubborn annoying acne that isn't horrible, but is present enough just to be a pain in my ass. I dunno if I'm even typing coherent English, at this point. I feel like venting. I don't really care about the repercussions.

I'm done for now."

1m0my4,1,2013-09-09,I ruined college for myself. [Rant],[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1m0my4/i_ruined_college_for_myself_rant/,"I was never a very social person. All through elementary and middle school, I just felt different from other kids. They would all play together and I'd just kinda sit off on the side by myself. But in high school, this all got a lot better. I joined marching band and made several good friends there, as well as a lot of acquaintances that I was friendly with. I also had several friends in many of my classes. I was in AP and honors classes and while I still had depressive episodes every now and then, I was overall a very happy person. That all changed when I went to college. 

I had a full-time job the summer after my senior year of high school at our family's business, so I hardly saw any of my high school friends over the summer. I saw a few of them before I left for college, but that was it. 

I moved to Michigan for college thinking I was going to do what I did in high school when it came to making friends. They would come naturally in my classes and extra-curricular activities if I worked hard and did my best. So I was hopeful moving in. But as soon as my parents helped me move into my dorm and left, all of the feelings I had from middle school came right back up. I quickly became very hardened and grew very cold. I kept my dorm room door closed all the time and barely said a word to my roommate (our rooms were adjoined, where his room was connected to mine, so he would walk in off of the hallway to my room and then through another door to his room). Same thing in my classes: I never talked to a single person in any of my classes either semester. I joined the LGBT student organization that semester and found the people in it to be very pretentious and exclusive; I met no friends there either. 

Instead of trying to transition into my life out of state, I desperately tried to get back the life I was living in high school in Illinois. I clung to my home state like glue. I went home as often as I could and tried to rekindle as many of my high school friendships as I could (which was actually quite successful). I spent the entire year holed up in my dorm room, only leaving to eat and go to class. I did everything completely alone. At the end of the year, I was so happy to be able to say goodbye to college for the summer and move back home. But when I moved back home, I started working full-time again, which meant that I barely got to see any of my high school friends there either. So I spent that summer almost as depressed as I was during the school year. 

That fall I move back to college expecting the same thing as the year before. I won't put the whole thing into great detail, but I joined another activity that I served on the executive board of for the year. While it was somewhat enjoyable and I got a Presidential Volunteer Service Award out of it, I still didn't meet anybody that I ""clicked"" with. I also lived in the aviation dorm, which is my major, so I thought I'd make some friends that shared my major. Nope. Still couldn't leave my door open, too afraid to. Occasionally I would eat dinner and play cards with a couple of people that were in that previously-mentioned activity and also lived in my hall, but that was as far as it went. I had friends that I could rely on for anything back in Illinois, but here, there was nobody I could lean on. I tried to join our aviation social fraternity, but my social anxiety forced me to drop out of the pledge class after the second meeting. 

I had to stay for two months into the summer after school ended that year to take a class that was only offered in the summer. I didn't have any friends to share an apartment lease with, so I had to rent one by myself for around $550 a month. For those two months, I went back to being just like I was during my first year: completely withdrawn and isolated from the outside world. I still knew nobody in any class I'd ever taken at the college, and the people that I sorta knew from my dorm moved back home for the summer. Since I didn't get hired at any of the five jobs I applied for, for the rest of the summer, I moved back home and worked full-time again, but I made a huge effort to spend time with as many of my old high school friends as possible. I felt like I had abandoned them moving away to college, so I wanted them to know I loved them. They were all I had at this point. 

A week ago I moved back here to college. The same thing is happening as the other two years. I'm renting the same apartment so I don't even get to see the few people I knew in the dining halls anymore. I've spent the first week of school shut up in my apartment. The rush week for that social fraternity is this next week, but I just can't make myself pledge, even though I know it'd be a valuable experience. I'm just too anxious, and I feel like it's not worth it since I'll be graduating this spring. I also dropped out of that activity I was on the board for my sophomore year. 

Reddit, I just feel like I've hit a dead end in life. I just want to be as happy as I was in Illinois. I went in to college with 20 credit hours of AP credit, I took 19 hours/semester my first year, and I was scheduled to graduate in 3 years, so I think that fostered a ""get-in, get-out"" attitude about college for me. Also, I stopped seeing my psychologist once I moved out of state, so I turned to alcohol during my second year of college to try to relieve my depression and anxiety. Hell, I'm writing this after polishing off a bottle of wine in the past hour. I'm watching other students make lifelong friends, get jobs and internships, and go to parties, and I'm just sitting on my couch getting drunk and watching TV. All I think about is moving home, but I don't know what I'll do there, either. I hope some terminal illness will put me out of my misery, life just sucks too much for me to go on like this. I just want to pull my comforter over my head and forget about everything outside my apartment. I really want friends, but I'm too depressed to leave my apartment and too anxious to go introduce myself to people. 

So that's how I wrecked college for myself. I fucked it all up. Some of my high school friends say ""just throw yourself into a group and talk to people and meet them"" *but i just can't do that.* I don't know why but I just can't. People told me all through high school how much fun college was going to be, and now all I want to do is get out. I used to be a smart, bright, and motivated student, and I've turned into a lazy, stupid drunk who's too much of a pansy to make any friends. What happened to me?

Sorry for this massive wall of text, and sorry if I rambled through a lot of it (I've had a lot of booze), but it felt really good to get this off my chest.

Today, September 9th, is the day that he was supposed to start his internship. He was supposed to be here, in my bed with me, getting a good night's sleep (or not...) before his big first day at the office. 

I miss him, and just thought some of you could understand the loneliness that comes with being 6000km away from the one you love.

1m0hf9,1,2013-09-08,"Work Experience, Age",wertexx,Chinavisa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Chinavisa/comments/1m0hf9/work_experience_age/,"Hello,

Pretty much straight after I graduated (at the age of 22 ) I came to China to work for a investment/consulting company. They employed me as an intern on F (business) Visa, since I didn't qualify for a work permit (22y/o, 0 work exp). Well, I have been here for 7 months now and they just keep renewing my F Visa for 3 months every time...

If i plan to stay in China long term and want to obtain a work permit, is the way everything is going right now sounds right? Does my current work experience counts as I'm working on F visa? ( which, technically, is illegal? ) And since I need to be 24 or 25 + have 2 years of working experience in order to qualify for work permit, I should just keep extending my F visa just like that, until the time comes?

1m0ehu,0,2013-09-08,Should I accept this internship?,[deleted],sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1m0ehu/should_i_accept_this_internship/,"I hope to explain things simple as possible and get the point quickly...

Basic background:

* Junior in Computer Information Systems at a big university

* Many internship interviews later with various companies (Apparently I suck at interviewing), I've received an offer to work with one of the top non-profit organizations, very, very well known. 

* Honestly surprised I landed it considering it was only 1 phone interview and I don't think I spoke very well. 

Problems:

* Not sure which field to enter after college, somewhat interested in Systems Analyst or Big data/Business intelligence solutions, but really I have no clue. 

* This internship feels like the jack of all trades. According to the description I'll be doing help desk support calls, QA testing, Project Management, hardware and software upgrades. I hear knowing a little bit of everything is bad compared to being specialized in one sector. Also it's kind of unrelated to my major because I want to enter the business side of IT, not the technical after college. 

* Just started a help desk position last month at my university. Very chill, I get to sit around and do homework/do whatever for pretty much 95% of my shift. More administrative work than help desk, but I still do some phone tech support. Supervisors are some of the coolest guys I've met. 

* Internship pays more than the current uni job, but I'm assuming I will actually have to work (this is me just being a lazy bastard) **and I'm afraid of burning bridges considering I just started a month ago.** They only have 2 student workers, me (mainly mornings), and another guy who does afternoons. 

* I'm still waiting to hear back from another company that I interviewed with for a data related internship in the health care field. Had 2 interviews and he followed up asking for my references which I think is a good sign. Very relaxed office environment and small team, not a well known company.

Sorry if this is a jumbled mess, but what would you guys recommend doing? This is a very great organization, but I'm not sure if it's worth doing the internship for 1 semester.

I *would* have picked it up, but Carlos was on his way over (more on that later, listeners) and I *had* to make sure my house was presentable. A phone call would have taken just too much time. Anyway, she did leave a message, which I'll play for you now:

""Cecil, it's me. Listen, I have to tell you--""

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

    &lt;noticeably worse quality audio&gt;

Well, listeners, I'm not sure how much of that message went through. About three words in, blood started pouring out of my microphone! As far as I can tell, trying to salvage it would be a lost cause, but what kind of radio host would I be if I didn't have a backup lying around?

^^Oh?

Daniel, our newest intern, just handed me a note saying that ""almost none"" of Dana's message was actually broadcast. Luckily, I do have a transcript of the message, which I can read to you.

""Cecil, it's me. Li`&lt;cough&gt;`"" Excuse me. `&lt;loud coughing&gt;`

I'm sorry, listeners. Almost immediately after beginning to read, I started choking on blood. Don't worry about me, though, it can't be my blood. My blood is red.

Anyway, I suppose I should let you know that Dana really had a very important message for all of you, a message that would change each and every one of your lives, possibly forever. I only wish I could tell you what it was.

And now, sports!"
1m0azk,4,2013-09-08,Trying to pinpoint what's wrong....please bear with me on this tangent.,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1m0azk/trying_to_pinpoint_whats_wrongplease_bear_with_me/,"I could write a very long (for the internet) and detailed summary about what I've been experiencing, but I'll try and sum it up in these three phases. What I really want to talk about is drugs, notably uppers vs. downers, their effects on us, and what that could shed light on as far as mental illness:

* This time, 2 years ago, I entered a deep depression that lasted until winter. Not so much sad, but felt blank, joyless, and had no determination. Main problems: Staying in bed WAY too long, withdrawing completely from my friends and the world, and having horrible cognitive problems (critical thinking not so there, memory off, brain fog, feeling like I lost all of my creativity and wit). Felt completely better around the new year.

* This time last year, I start having panic attacks. Thought I was dying, became hyper-vigilant and obsessed with my breathing. That went away by Fall semester, yet I was left with obsessive thinking, hyper-vigilance, and an even worse-than-last-time episode of losing my normally strong cognitive skills. Had to drop classes and great internship because I couldn't write a simple e-mail. I couldn't put together the words in lecture. Needless to say, my usual decent social and leadership skills were gone.
 **So** I saw a psychiatrist and tried Lexapro for about 1.5 months. Did nothing. Then we tried Klonopin and BOOM, it helped massively. I never felt sedated or slowed down on it, but on the first or second dose my thoughts just came together. This time around I was avoiding people on even worse level, but when the benzo kicked in I could instantly return to being myself and be social. I had just about all of my mind back. Note: I got off the SSRI when this happened. And this change was around winter time, again, like the previous year. Spring comes and I'm at my best again.

* Now we're at the present and still take the Klonopin. My anxiety/obsessive thinking seems to be under control, yet I feel very much like I did two years again. I'm sleeping in very late and turning my phone off to avoid my friends. Not talking to my family again. I feel very apathetic, have no drive, and just don't feel smart or like myself again. I'm seeing a new psych (moved) now and he's still trying to figure me out, so in the meantime I'm curious to hear your opinions, suggestions, or similar stories. I basically don't know what's wrong with me, though I do believe there's some sort of imbalance happening that should be corrected by a medication. I'm just clueless as to what that could be. **This is where that drug talk comes in.**

My drug history has always been more or less normal. Cigarettes, weed, and booze... BUT I have gone through periods of consuming all too much. This wasn't an addiction to a specific substance. I've had the same problem with just craving unlimited amounts of coffee or food or staying awake. I'm under control, but I don't think that craving should be there still. I also have to assume it's related to this depression/anxiety/unknown thing wrong with my brain.

This summer, I was prescribed opiates for a car crash and wow, THAT is what I thought an antidepressant or adderall was supposed to do. Opiates (vicodin/oxycodone) seem to have a paradoxical effect on me. Instead of making me drowsy, they'd wake me up. Weed would do this to me as well, but the opiates just made me feel perfect. I know they were getting me high, but I think there's something to the fact that they'd wake me up, make me much more talkative and let my thoughts connect and flow a million times better than when depressed. They made me feel just how I want to be. This also included me not having any cravings for too much food, coffee, or alcohol (not that I was going to mix anyway). I also used Tramadol after the true opiates, and while it didn't get me that ""high"", all the positive effects I wanted remained. It's what I'd imagine an ADHD drug should do, tho I've tried Ritalin/Adderall before and they just made me anxious. This, once again, gave me a lot of energy, focus, and constant sense of well-being.

Anyway, I know I'm rambling and I really shouldn't go overboard with all this information. I don't imagine everyone in this subreddit would have exactly the energy or focus to want to read all of this and respond. I think you'd probably get the gist with what I wrote (my history, my reactions to certain drugs, etc.) I truly don't know what could be the right thing to help me. I'm taking 5-htp now (in about 2 weeks) and I've had some good days, but overall I don't think this is what I need. What I feel like I need in my head is a drug for ADHD, yet my drug experience seems to show otherwise. I understand it's a much more complex issue than just that though. Just looking for any insight/guesses/things I should bring up with my doctor next time I see him. I'll also be here to answer any questions or clarify things for any responses that show up."
1m0aat,1,2013-09-08,Need Advice: Job offer entails interning for first 5 months to get through a 'hiring freeze'?,PlusMinusZero,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/1m0aat/need_advice_job_offer_entails_interning_for_first/,"I need some feedback on my situation to make sure I'm not being taken advantage of. Please forgive my cryptic description. I am graduating in December with a BSME with a ~3.9 GPA and 2 years coop experience. I have soft offers from my coop company but it does not fit my long term goals.

I have always dreamed of working for Company X. At the beginning of Summer I interviewed and received a job offer from this company. In the interview I informed the HR rep that I was interviewing for a second position within the same company. This was encouraged and he verbally told me he would delay the offer deadline. A few weeks passed and the second interview was cancelled due to 'restructuring.' I immediately contacted the HR rep. He informed that my offer had been affected but there was a group advocating to honor the offer. I confirmed the restructuring and hiring freeze existed with my contacts. 

Some time later I received the same offer with the start date delayed 5 months and an offer for an internship position during the interim. The company can only accommodate undergrad interns. This requires me to delay my graduation even though I have finished all of my courses. My pride says delaying graduation to intern is almost insulting.

Is this a typical strategy for a company to navigate a hiring freeze? Aside from a signed offer, what is stopping them from doing this to me again after the internship?

TL;DR: Have job offer for dream job from company that's in a hiring freeze but requires delaying graduation and interning for 5 months."

I'm graduating college this year, with a (useless) degree in Cognitive Science and Anthropology (with Public Policy and Childhood Studies minors). I went to college expecting that I could go to graduate school afterwards, but I recently learned from our Career Center that this isn't really an option (unless I am able to get someone to cosign loans, which I'm not). I'm from a very poor family and the first person ever to go to or graduate college, so I went in thinking that I would study the things that I loved and was good at because I've already been poor and doing it again wouldn't be that hard.

I don't necessarily regret my choices, but realizing that grad school isn't an option is hard. I have a relatively nice resume, but the job prospects are pretty bleak. I do have some marketing experience, so that could be useful, but I can't help feeling depressed that I can't actually pursue my dreams (public policy/social work) except for part-time internships or activism.

After I had this idea I looked if there’s any company/organization that does this already or similar and didn’t find any that do this in a world scale. I had been looking in many organizations that act worldwide and a lot of them don’t even share the knowledge they have to others countries that could be used in others communities. 

My idea is to create a big open database where people would search for solutions and contribute with their knowledge where others might have problems. Where it would be possible to team up with people from all over the world for a cause. The final result of each project could be a case study, or just to know someone in the world did something similar of what you are looking do and be able to get in touch with this person would be great. 

I don’t know any person IRL that knows how to program, and has the same motivation as /r/socialpreneur to change the world.

(info inside),[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1m02mm/im_offered_two_possible_paths_two_follow_i_dont/,"So, after having to drop university because of economical problems, I'm pursuing a technical degree in coding.

The thing is, in my country, I can follow two different  paths:

- One: the ""classical"" path: It's going to be 2 years of classes in a technical school, followed by a 3-months internship in a company. It is assumed that the internship is only part of the studies and will NOT lead to a job after it's over.

- Two: The experimental path, that is being tried inspired by the european models: I'll have the basic formation (about 3 months) in a technical school, but from then on I'll just be learning inside a real company, for one year and a half.

Things to consider about the ""new model"": 

- I'll be paid during that period of formation that happens inside the company. But not a lot precisely.. about $400 a month for a full time schedule. I can probably earn the same amount with the classical system plus a part time job.

- Although I can't know what company will be assigned to me, I know that the applicants with the best CV's  do their company time in Microsoft, which I guess it's a huge plus (and I'm fairly certain that, being bilingual and with 2 years of university I'll probably be in the top). However, I've also heard about a lot of people who end up stuck in companies not-related to CS, making powerpoints or learning COBOL for a whole year.

- The ""new system"" doesn't offer me any holidays, while in the old system I'll have 3 months of holidays in the summer + some more days during Christmas.

- In the end, both systems give you the same technical degree; no future employer is going to know which system I used to earn it. Although, I can probably add the name of the company where I studied in my CV as an internship or something like that.

What would you do in my position?"

I do know that a lot of careers in industry require that you have public accounting experience or that it will give you much higher earnings potential down the road, but would it really hurt me that much if I worked at a small, ""lower-tier"" public accounting firm to get this experience as opposed to a Big 4 firm? Would there be a huge difference in earnings potential?

Additionally, as a junior in college, would it be much less difficult to get a summer internship at a small, non-Big 4 public accounting firm, or at least get an interview?

I hope you're having a good day. I've been mulling over posting here (or any suitable subreddit) about my current issue of finding employment outside of what I've studied. I graduated in December 2012 with my Master of Educating in Counseling and Personnel Services. I specialized in Clinical Mental Health and even completed a year and half internship with a local community mental health agency working in public schools. 

After a lot of looking inward, I learned that I truly didn't want to be a therapist for a living. It's not that I don't care, but I can't see myself being caught in the endless burn-out cycle that the profession puts you through. I still enjoy the work and wouldn't mind volunteering in it. 

While I interned working with students, I really enjoyed the academia part of helping students explore learning. This has help me set my focus on higher education and potentially becoming an Academic Advisor. All the components of a therapist, but for school, is the way I see it. I definitely know I have the skill sets to succeed in it but I'm having great difficulty landing a job. 

I've joined advising organizations, made some connections with former alum in similar roles, and researched what it takes to become an advisor.

What am I missing? Also, given my degree and this discipline, what else can I do? 

I'm willing to fill-in blanks and answer any questions folks might have and also put up a current resume for review."

Lots of thanks to everyone, especially to /u/TheVaporChef and /u/VaporCory",Bahamut966,electronic_cigarette,https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/1m4q5b/its_been_a_trip_lots_of_thanks_to_everyone/,"I finally got a job.  It's a paid internship, but it's more paid than I've been in a good, long time!

I've said that I've been unemployed for the last month and change after graduation and working management at the camps I went to as a kid.  They say you work at camps because you love them; if you work there for money you're an idiot.  It's true, I'd have made more money with fewer hours working at one of the kitchen's I'd been in during the school year.

I've also had to cope with going long distance (1k+ miles over the summer, now only 300) with my long term girlfriend, and I started watching my checking account drain after getting my car maintained and gas to get to her.  I've moved back in with my Dad to find a job and to live with him for a while, along with some family drama surrounding that.

You guys kept me sane.  I got into rebuildables because I was out of money, and had to save what I could.  That's been unbelievably rewarding.  I also take a lot of joy out of being able to help people, and being able to help out in this small community has made me feel really great, just by answering questions.  Boredom is a killer during a job search, and there's only so much time you can spend in front of a computer screen looking for work.  I was decently off the mark sometimes, but I'm glad to be able to do what I can, and try to mark when corrected.

I was able to place an order at The Vapor Chef, which would have to last me a good amount of time.  I was really excited to try some new flavors, but couldn't afford to try most of them.  /u/VaporCory sent me a message after I made a post asking for opinions and he hooked me right up with Slartibartfast, Deep Thought, and Beeblebrox.  They're all fantastic, and Slartibartfast and Beeblebrox will definitely be ADVs into the future.

/u/OsirisOrion, you're getting some of my paycheck, too!  I've been talking you up where I can, so I'm excited for payday to come to me!  Same goes for Seduce Juice, and Gremlin Juice.  And definitely TVC is getting some.  For the rest of my life.

I have you guys to thank, every single one of you for keeping myself together when it was getting really tough.  I don't even have enough money right now for an oil change, but this is the happiest I've been in a long time!  Sorry if this is a janky reading post, I'm barely keeping it together just in thanks to you guys.

TL;DR I'm finally employed, you guys kept me sane and are my favorites forever."
1m4oov,1,2013-09-10,ALD pay questions,[deleted],lightingdesign,https://www.reddit.com/r/lightingdesign/comments/1m4oov/ald_pay_questions/,"I recently did an internship with a well-known LD in my area, and after the internship (3 months) ended, he asked me to stay on as his assitant LD.

His offer for the next few shows was rather low (about $150 a show) and he fully admitted he knew he was going to be paying me shit, but the budget for these shows was near max and he is basically paying me out of pocket to be there. At the beginning of 2014 he said we can re-negotiate my pay as he would love to pay me what I deserve for my work.

I currently create/update cue sheets, take worknotes and distribute them, work closely with the BO to help them learn the cue timings, pick up paperwork for him if necessary, as well as general grunt work such as wrapping cables and lugging lighting fixtures around. I'm sure there are more things, but basically I'm the assistant and whatever he doesn't feel like doing I jump in and do.

As far as experience goes, I did shows in my high school for 5 years (kept helping with shows there for 2 years after I graduated) working light/sound. I am enrolled in college fulltime, although I took this semester off do to money issues with a scholarship that needs to be sorted out. I can read music, have a working understanding of Lightwright and most consoles. I'm currently studying up on Vectorworks, as that is the LDs preferred CAD program.

My main question, now, is once January rolls around, I have NO idea how much money to ask for. Not even in a general sense, so any information will be greatly appreciated"

I will be pursuing a second bachelor's in ME (first was in microbiology) over the next two years. I believe the general consensus in this sub is that an engineering student with experience is the best engineering student. Thus, I went out and nabbed myself an internship at an aerospace PMA/machine shop. It's a rather small FAA certified repair facility, around 10 employees with ~$1.2m/year in revenue. I'll be shooting for ~12hr/wk during school and ~30hr/wk during breaks. However, herein lies the dilemma.

With minimal coursework under my belt, how can I make the most out of my time at the shop? What sort of things will I be able to learn, and how can I position myself to ask the best questions to further my development as an engineer? Can I expect to have networking opportunities? I was informed that my initial chores will be tasks such as deburring, since I know literally nothing, but once my work is done I'll have free reign to ask questions/watch.

This shop uses solidworks + mastercam, so naturally I will be pushing hard on this front. Any advice, however, will be greatly appreciated!

edit:
Oh wow, thanks for all the awesome advice guys! So many seemingly small things that wouldn't have come to mind apparently make a world of difference."

:--|:--
[What percentage of your readers vetting submissions are high schoolers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4co4/we_are_the_editors_of_the_paris_review_the/cc5nz1t?context=5)|Our interns and readers are mainly college (and grad-school) grads, and, in the past three years, they've spanned an age range of some twenty-five years. The high schoolers (there have only been two in recent memory) have been some of the best.
[As a student writer in college with a growing portfolio of creative short stories, what are the best ways for me to improve my chances of publication (content aside\), be it a well-written cover letter, a correctly formatted submission, or a mailed (rather than e-mailed\) submission? In other words, what do you guys like to see?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4co4/we_are_the_editors_of_the_paris_review_the/cc5mu8o?context=5)|In all seriousness, content is king. The cover letter is very much secondary (keep it short and sweet). We only accept submissions via postal mail.
[Also, publications like The Paris Review can make (or break\) a young writer's career. How do you balance choosing submissions between emerging and established writers? Do you guys (like the New Yorker\) prefer established to emerging writers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4co4/we_are_the_editors_of_the_paris_review_the/cc5mu8o?context=5)|There's glory in discovering a new writer, but we've certainly never turned down good work from an established author.
[Yes! My quote is deemed a classic!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4co4/we_are_the_editors_of_the_paris_review_the/cc5nwjw?context=5)|YOU are a classic, /u/Scramisaur.
[How do you (as readers\) define the difference between genres (poetry, fiction, CNF\)? Do you think the lines between genres can/should be defined? Have these lines always been well defined for you? Are these lines still extant for you (if they ever existed\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4co4/we_are_the_editors_of_the_paris_review_the/cc5n4w6?context=5)|It has to do with whether they hit the return key.
[What trends in recent poetry and fiction do you find yourselves rejecting, not just as editors, but also as readers? In the recent Refinery29 story, Lorin says, “I would describe my look as ‘realistic.’ Low on whimsy. Low on flash. It may be coincidence, but that describes my taste in fiction and poetry, too."" Is that true for the rest of you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4co4/we_are_the_editors_of_the_paris_review_the/cc5n99w?context=5)|""I personally dislike speculative fiction, alternate realities, and so forth."" —Sadie.
 |""Suburban malaise."" —Justin.
 |""I kind of like suburban malaise, but I wish I'd said my look was Adlai Stevenson."" —Lorin.
 |""Oh, I also hate the obvious specter of childhood sexual abuse hanging over domestic stories."" —Sadie.
 |""I'll pass."" —Clare.
 |""Oh, and I hate magical-realist food fiction."" —Sadie.
 |""Actually, I hate bored narrators. You can say that about me."" —Clare.
[What is magical-realist food fiction? Is that like when a character eats way too much and is unrealistically slim?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4co4/we_are_the_editors_of_the_paris_review_the/cc5q0o6?context=5)|""No, that's what we call 'every network sitcom.'"" —Sadie.
[I've only recently begun to get interested in The Paris Review, mainly because of your digital/social media presence, which I think is tremendous (great work, Justin\). Do you see this becoming more important in the future? Do you think you'll ever be ""online-only?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4co4/we_are_the_editors_of_the_paris_review_the/cc5n5f0?context=5)|We'll never be online only.
 |Thank you for the compliment! We also like Justin. —All the editors except Justin.
[Which literary magazines and blogs do you read?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4co4/we_are_the_editors_of_the_paris_review_the/cc5n42f?context=5)|A handful of our favorites: [Foxing Quarterly](http://www.foxingquarterly.com), [n+1](http://nplusonemag.com), [The White Review](http://www.thewhitereview.org) (founded by a former Paris Review intern), [The New York Review of Books](http://www.nybooks.com), [The Public Domain Review](http://publicdomainreview.org), [The New York Tyrant](http://www.nytyrant.com), to name just a few.
[What is the average number of words your staffers read before they determine if something is slush? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4co4/we_are_the_editors_of_the_paris_review_the/cc5n658?context=5)|The salutation. (Anything that doesn't come from an agent is technically ""slush,"" which isn't a pejorative.)
 |If you mean, How much of a story do we read before we reject it, then, as a general rule: first five pages, last five pages.
[What is the average number of story submissions you receive during a given review period? How do you whittle down the number of entries into a manageable number and then settle on which to publish?  Do you as editors look for what is trending (in terms of genres and current fads, I doubt this\) or simply go for what you deem to be the best of submissions you receive?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4co4/we_are_the_editors_of_the_paris_review_the/cc5n6ix?context=5)|We receive somewhere in the ballpark of 15,000 submissions a year. (We're expecting that to double thanks to our AMA.) Our interns screen the unsolicited submissions (the ""slush"") and pass the good stuff along to the editors.
[Hemingway, Capote, Nabakov, Ellison, all greats who wrote for the common man and did not focus (too heavily\) on Manhattan and its insular sensibilities. Much of what I've seen recently in the Paris Review seems very esoteric and geared toward the Union Square lit scene. I'm concerned that it could be a bit of an echo chamber sometimes. How do you keep the common reader, that book lover from Decatur, interested in picking up your stories? How could you better serve them in the future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4co4/we_are_the_editors_of_the_paris_review_the/cc5pdb6?context=5)|""It's funny; I don't think of Nabokov as addressing himself to ""the common man."" But I'm not sure who that common man or woman is supposed to be.
 |""We publish what interests us. It's not clear to me who else's taste we could consult. In general, writing speaks to writing. Echoes are not necessarily to be avoided."" —Lorin.
[As a publishing/journalism industry hopeful, I'm curious about your career trajectories. How did you get where you are now? (&lt;I know Swung_by_Seraphim asked a similar question earlier, but wait, there's more!\) What were your entry-level jobs? Did you take unpaid internships?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4co4/we_are_the_editors_of_the_paris_review_the/cc5nc6s?context=5)|""Clare and I are both former (Paris Review) interns. That was our entry-level job."" —Stephen.
 |""My first job? I was an editorial assistant at a publishing house."" —Sadie.
 |""I was a part-time secretary at Publishers Weekly."" —Lorin.
 |""Advertising."" —Justin.
 |""This is my entry-level job."" —Hailey.
[In answering another question, you mentioned that publishing something from the slush pile is rare because literary agents are very active in representing new writers.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4co4/we_are_the_editors_of_the_paris_review_the/cc5oxhz?context=5)|A story, as such, might not be worth an agent's time, but it's often the best way for an agent to pick up a new writer.
[I was told that short stories aren't really worth an agent's time. Has the state of publishing changed that? How important is short fiction now versus the good ol' days?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4co4/we_are_the_editors_of_the_paris_review_the/cc5oxhz?context=5)|It depends which good ol' days you mean.  In the twenties and thirties, for example, short stories were the best way for a writer to assure a steady income—after Hollywood. That's changed over time; now most writers make their money in Hollywood or by teaching.
[, I'd like to say that I understand the need to digitize. While I love to collect the printed copies, the app is sleek, easy to use and classy as hell. But what I'm curious about, is the significant increase in The Paris Review's social media presence in the past year. Is this an attempt to appear more accessible? Target a younger audience? Establish a brand identity? Turn the spotlight around? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4co4/we_are_the_editors_of_the_paris_review_the/cc5na6b?context=5)|Glad you like the app!
 |At the end of the day, all of our efforts are directed toward finding new readers for the magazine—and putting out consistently excellent writing online, as well. We don't distinguish between media in that sense.
 |As a print quarterly, we face the obvious hurdle of coming out every three months, and our online presence (via the blog and via social media) is a way of both keeping in touch in the interim and showcasing work we believe in.
[Any truth to starting out as a CIA front?  If yes, has anyone written about those days?  If not, how did the rumor get started?  Either way, whats the best ""on assignment"" story that didn't wind up in the interviews?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4co4/we_are_the_editors_of_the_paris_review_the/cc5oq17?context=5)|Carolyn Kellogg did a good job of laying out the facts in a [recent LA Times piece](http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/jacketcopy/2012/05/salon-cia-paris-review-be-skeptical.html).
[After being drawn in by the whole CIA front concept, I began to enjoy the interviews in chronological order and am now a loyal print subscriber. Thanks for all the great work you do. Looking forward to the fall issue.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4co4/we_are_the_editors_of_the_paris_review_the/cc5oq17?context=5)|For a more imaginative take, check out Toby Barlow's [Babayaga](http://www.amazon.com/Babayaga-A-Novel-Toby-Barlow/dp/0374107874).

(That happens a fair amount and is always a drag.)
[What are your ""new artists to watch"" at the moment?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4co4/we_are_the_editors_of_the_paris_review_the/cc5mytz?context=5)|There are a few new writers—new to us—in our [new issue](http://www.theparisreview.org/current-issue): Ben Nugent, Andrew Martin, Bill Cotter, and Christine Smallwood (though we've long been admirers of her nonfiction). Ottessa Moshfegh won our Plimpton Prize last year, which is a $10,000 annual prize for new writers published in our pages.
[Can I get one of your rejection cards? Even they are legendary.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4co4/we_are_the_editors_of_the_paris_review_the/cc5nmum?context=5)|Submit something that starts with the closing of a car door. We'll go from there.

[What are your thoughts on New York as a literary center? Is it tough to afford living in the city as a writer or editor?

[How, as editor, do you maintain the delicate balance of operating within the Plimptonian model while at the same time infusing The Paris Review with new energy? TPR is so much marked by tradition yet at the same time it must also reflect the times...The digitizing of the interviews, for example, was a brilliant decision on your behalf because it allows TPR's past to live within the modern framework of the digital age.

I had 3.5 GPA. In January, I started studying for and eventually taking the CPA exams. I have 2 down and will hopefully complete the next 2 by the end of the year.

I started job hunting recently, but jobs seem scarce. I didn't network in school. Yes that was a big mistake, but it's done and I'm trying to look forward now. My parents pushed me to do well in school and didn't encourage me (even discouraged me) from doing any part-time work. Their reasoning was that it was important to do well in school in order to get a good job. That was probably true in their day, but times have changed and work experience is extremely valuable, of which I have none.

I've had two interviews recently. 1 didn't work out and I'm still waiting to hear on the other one. Where do I go from here?

Would it be worth it to go get my Masters and actually do it properly this time (network, internship, talk to professors, etc.)? Should I continue my job hunt and hope something goes through? If I decide to go for my Masters, then I need to start studying for the GMAT ASAP."

It seems everyone who comes through here working on a unionized feature treat us like dirt when all we want to do is help you with the order.

This has also been my experience being on set and going to networking mixers. If you're union, you treat those who are non-union as if they're meaningless.

Seriously, today I ask a buyer who needed help if she needed help, and she looked me up and down gave me a nasty look and said ""Not from you."" And I just said All right, and walked away. Come to find out she went to my boss and complained that the ""short ugly guy"" kept bothering her. The other intern saw the whole thing and backed me up, but seriously I was just trying to help.

I understand they're busy and don't want to be bothered, but come on, there's no reason to go out of your way to be a dick.

Is it an ego thing? Do they think they're better than everyone else? What is it? Am I alone in seeing this?"

**Education**

I graduated with a degree in Business Finance from Univ. of Central Florida in Orlando. I finished with a 3.1 gpa, which is not the best but I have been working full time throughout my college experience because I had to support myself. I took a few Real Estate, Investment, and Banking courses for my electives. 

**Work Experience**

As previously mentioned, I have had a job for the past 5.5 years working for a family owned restaurant/catering business, with the last 3 yrs being full time. I have been fully involved in every single aspect of the business (except for actually cooking) which includes invoices, inventory management, training, managing the front of house staff etc. 

I also had an internship in the Financial Systems department of a big company in the summer of '12 doing things such as pivot table work, financial reports, working with Peoplesoft/Oracle software and various excel work. 


My main problem here is that while I do currently have a job which pays decent, I am growing annoyed with the restaurant business and would like to begin my career in the financial world. I got into Finance because I am really good with numbers and I originally thought banking was a solid career path but I am not too sure now.  I have been searching the alumni boards, all of the job sites as well as linked in, and attempting to network but I have no luck. Should I be doing something different or specific? I have considered looking into going back to school and trying a different degree or maybe an MBA but $ is a big issue there.

I'm aiming mainly for digital marketing, social media, account management, and media planning entry level jobs.

For my internships it feels hard to really put a powerful bullet point without being too general or specific. Due to the nature of my work experience I have had to wear a lot of hats at each position.

Then there's formatting...and what to include. From the places I have visited that I had interest in the majority of them said to include hobbies/interests to show if you're a more cultured person. Makes sense to me if I wanted to go into an agency since you have to deal with multiple industries, but I have had debates with my peers about it.

Thanks for any help guys.

&gt;Recruitment

&gt;[COPMANY]

&gt;My name is [MYDOGGEORGE] and I’m a senior at the [SCHOOL] and expect to graduate in May of 2014 with a BS in economics, BS in mathematics, BBA in finance, and minor in computer science. I am interested in pursuing the [POSITION] at [COPMANY] and I’ve enclosed my resume and background information below.

&gt;Over the course of my college career I’ve been enamored by financial markets. I’ve dedicated much of my course work to studying financial theory and I’ve devoted my free time to observing and trading financial markets.  My fundamental knowledge and technical skill allows me to make quick, educated decisions and my passion makes me highly motivated and inquisitive; I strongly feel my background will complement [COPMANY]’s training program perfectly. 

&gt;In the past two years I’ve held highly autonomous positions as an intern and web developer for my university’s college of medicine.  Through these positions I’ve worked with executives, deans, and department heads and I’ve gained the ability to work efficiently and competently in a fast paced, high pressure environment.  I started my first job at the age of 15 and I’ve held one ever since; I’m a dedicated, passionate, loyal employee and I take great pride in working to improve myself every day.

&gt;Over summer break I built a fully automated analysis platform that lets me back test and simulate a live trading environment.  My program is written in Python and uses Yahoo! as its primary data source; I collect minute data via Yahoo!’s API and 15 minute data via my live environment.  I’ve also built VBA macros that allow me to interface and view my data, back tests, and simulated portfolios.  My program has been operational for two months and my YTD return is 2%.

&gt;Over the past three years I’ve maintained a modest buy and hold portfolio where investment decisions are based on industry trends, company fundamentals, and portfolio management; my YTD return is 11%. Since late June I’ve actively paper traded via Market Watch and experienced YTD returns of 16%. 

&gt;Trading is in my blood and competition is my fuel; given my background in economics and finance and my quantitative and computational abilities I am a particularly good fit for a career at [COPMANY].  I welcome any opportunity to discuss my qualifications with you and learn more about [COPMANY] at your earliest convenience. I can be reached at [PHONE] or via email at [EMAIL]. Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

&gt;Sincerely,

&gt;[NAME]

He's known about it for most of the time. I found out a month ago that he's recently developed feelings for me too. I was so happy I could cry. The unfortunate part is we've both moved to different cities ($1000+ round trip flight apart) for internships until the end of the year. 

I found out 'A' liked me when I was talking about a fellow (B) I was going to ask on a little date, I liked the idea of having a travel buddy and at the time I was trying to get over 'A' because the last year had be miserable for me, wanting more than a friendship and knowing it wouldn't happen. 'A' started saying things out of character, things about going for it while I'm here and not worrying about my feelings for 'A' because we'll be fine. So I worked up the courage to ask him if he liked me, he does, but didn't want to say anything due to the distance etc. 

Anyway I've been seeing this fellow, 'B' here for a bit. I've hung out with him 3 or 4 times maybe. But I guess my feelings for 'A' were manifesting more than I thought and I think I came off as very much into 'B' when I honestly thought I had a reasonable attitude about it. I guess I should have talked to him about it more. He knew I wasn't here past the end of December, he seemed okay with it. I think I was too pushy, too affectionate too early, too horny. So 'B' calls me after work to break it off. I suppose I saw it coming but it still hurts, I was looking forward to spending some time with him while I was here. I shouldn't have been as forward, I liked him, and I sort of just went for it and I think he was just going along with it because why not. I don't know why he didn't want to go along with it any more. He said he didn't really have feelings for me. I guess I appreciate the honesty. 

Meanwhile I'm still thousands of miles away from 'A', feeling as lonely as ever. I have so few friends here and I really enjoyed spending time with 'B'. I just feel lost, helpless, lonely. I'd love to get on a plane right now and leave but know I cant, know I shouldn't. I'm not heartbroken just so pissed at myself for ruining the sweet, simple thing I had for such a short time. 

Fast forward to January. Who's to say that 'A' won't have gone back on his feelings? Emotions aren't logical and it's just as likely that his feelings for me could go away in the time thats left apart. 

There's nothing to be done it seems. I guess I'll have to suck it up and be friendlier with girls, keep in touch with my friends, hope that 'A' stays interested, get over 'B' and look forward to my life back home. 

How can I stay happy for the rest of the time I'm here? I don't want to fall into a miserable loop of oversleeping, overeating, crying into beers by myself at the bar.  

If you read this far, thank you."

I've been in a long distance relationship with a girl that I have known for many years now. Over the past year or so things became more heated and we really did strive for a relationship and it did develop into a very nice one. Going back to the start of this year now I had wanted to surprise her by visiting her, I live in London and she lives in the U.S. However, being a student this was not very feasible for me due to other commitments such as a job over Summer that I could not just leave &amp; problems over expenses of just magically flying out there.

Winding forward, I confessed my love to her only 24hours ago and she is suddenly having second thoughts over a long distance relationship. Everything we once had has been shattered all of a sudden. We made plans for her to visit me over Christmas, and she still plans on doing so even after what has just happened; hopefully to help solidify our feelings together once more but I fear that is too late. 

She has entered university as a freshman, I can't leave her alone in that place until then. 
So my question is, how on bloody Earth can I fix this? 
My only solution is to ruin all of my future savings and take them out my savings account and get on a plane ASAP after I finish my internship this Thursday/Friday as I have 1week remaining until university starts again once more for me. Alternatively, does anyone know a way for me to fly from London to Ohio at a relatively cheap price of some sort?

Thanks everyone, I really appreciate any help you have to offer right now as I am so down and depressed over this all."

1m4bn7,2,2013-09-10,College senior looking for honest advice on steps to take with December LSAT &amp; Graduation looming.,[deleted],LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/1m4bn7/college_senior_looking_for_honest_advice_on_steps/,"Hello everyone! I'd just like to start off saying that I've been subscribed to this subreddit for a couple of months now and I've seen both constructive/helpful as well as harsh/jaded advice given here, so I am prepared to take both. That being said, law school is a definite in my future plans so I would appreciate not being deterred from it nor insulted about it. 

I'm a Political Science major/Legal Studies minor at a non-prestigious public university in Southern California where I will probably graduate with a mediocre GPA (between 3.1-3.4). I transferred mid-semester my freshman year from a more prestigious private school because staying there would have drained all of my parents' school savings for me &amp; I would graduate from this CSU debt-free. Despite my GPA, I've managed to get a number of great internships (through good interviewing/writing skills) that have helped shape what kind of law I want to get into and have gotten some really great connections from it.

I've recently made the decision that if I don't get a 165 or above by the February LSAT that I won't apply for law school this cycle. My goal is to get into a T1 school in the SF Bay or NY/New England area (I have serious problems with SoCal &amp; have no interest to stay in the area after graduation) and  unless there's a possibility of a really great scholarship, it just doesn't seem worth settling for only a possibility of job placement. 

My question for you gunners is if my LSAT goals aren't met, what kind of jobs would you suggest I look into to stay in the field while working on improving my score? I would really like to move either to SF (where I'm originally from and have connections) or NY (where I would eventually like to practice). Also how worth it is it to get a Paralegal certificate? UC Berkeley (which is close to my home) offers a 6-month paralegal certificate program. 

Thanks again!

TL;DR - Mediocre UG GPA polysci student, won't apply to law school without a 165 LSAT score so looking into post-grad options in case that doesn't happen by February."

Pros: disposable, available just about everywhere, can use all you want in one day.

Cons: slightly more expensive than leap card

Leapcard

Pros: New and shiny, slightly less expensive if only using two trips per day

Cons: why didn't we just emulate the Oyster system?, fiver deposit on card, not everyone lets you top up. 


Is there some magical reason I why people are using the Leap Card for buses? Fair enough, it's great for trains, but not much else I think!

Also, I've only to go from Stillorgan into the city centre (€2.40). Weekly rambler would you think?

They seem to be the only ones who can give me useful, practical information on my particular niche. I tried to keep this post as short as I could. I am a biomedical engineering rising senior concentrating in biomechanics and interested in medical device R&amp;D. I go to Drexel University in Philadelphia. Because of a severe acute mental illness and some unfortunate circumstances, I was unable to get very much at all out of Drexel's co-op program that for most people settles the issue of the internships one needs before pursuing a full-time engineering position. Essentially, I have no industry experience and my GPA is still between 2.85 and 3.0. Despite this, I am determined to become a successful engineer, and I want your advice because I'm not entirely sure that I'm doing everything I should be. I graduate next June and I've decided to start looking for work now.

I have MEM/field related coursework like CAD and mechanics of materials. Skills include Solidworks and other CAD programs, MATLAB, statistics, carrying out experiments, and communication from being a math tutor. My biggest problem is no industry experience and no machining or manufacturing skills(besides using a drill press). I am currently volunteering in a gait analysis lab where I'm helping to create a piece of equipment for foot torsion testing. I thought it might be a better idea with my history to ease into a career with an industry internship after graduation instead of trying to apply for ordinary full time positions. However, I don't know how plausible this is. I've heard hearsay that internships are for undergrads only(and I've seen some job postings that state this).

So far, I have put together a list of 30-40 plausible companies from all over the country. Within a week or so, I will begin to reiterate my resume, create a generic cover letter that can be altered for each company, and then I will begin contacting them. I may or may not be able to get the machine shop here to let me in for a few days to show me things; I don't know if they will allow that. I'm working on creating something well done in Solidworks so as to show an interviewer, and will be working on a senior design project this year. Can someone tell me if there is more I can or should be doing, and put to rest my confusion/anxiety over looking for internships for after graduation?

1m456y,5,2013-09-10,Hi ladies. Feeling depressed. Stressed and anxious about life. Venting.,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1m456y/hi_ladies_feeling_depressed_stressed_and_anxious/,"Sorry in advance if this is disjointed and will probably get long. I have a lot within me and I just want to get it out. 

It's only been the last two months or so, but I notice I have been feeling deeply depressed for a few days to a week out of the month. I keep track of the days of my period as well as the 1-3 days where I could possibly be ovulating. I'm not supposed to ovulate for another week. I wouldn't say I am clinically depressed but often get very sad, weepy, and have feelings of hopelessness/worthlessness, which don't seem to line up at all with when I ""should"" be PMSing. I never really understood when PMS should occur, because I personally interpret PMS as every day I'm not on my period (aren't women's bodies always gearing up to menstruate? Maybe this thinking is a little ridiculous). 

I don't believe these feelings are entirely hormone related but inflated with the combination of my life circumstances. I recently graduated from college with no job and 20k of student debt. This stresses me out tremendously. I am living with my boyfriend who is financially responsible for everything. We both live comfortably on his salary but I feel guilt stricken for letting him carry all the financial weight. We have a wonderful relationship and he wants me to get a job purely for my own feelings of self worth and productivity. He doesn't push me but whenever he asks if I am looking for a job and my answer is 'no,' my feelings of worthlessness spike and I spiral down. 

I will spare most of the details but whenever I even think of job searching, a wave of anxiety comes over me. I know this line is cliché, but I don't know how to market myself, let alone my strong suits. I don't feel like anyone would want to hire me. I didn't love my area of study in college and felt like I picked it merely because ""I needed a major."" I feel as though I learned nothing tangible. I did not have an internship. I made no contacts. I received a BA in a science field, as opposed to a BS, which makes me feel even more like a failure. 

Lately I have been trying to be honest with myself about what kind of job I want. I don't want a job related to my major. But then that leaves me with a big fat question mark in my head for any type of job at all. I've already done retail. I worked in a casino for 2 years while I was in school. I recently looked at jobs on a casino website and got the (bad) chills just navigating around the website. I never want to go back to that. My mom was a substitute teacher for a while and I am considering doing that. My boyfriend keeps telling me to volunteer at an animal shelter or with park services or something just to meet people, but I can't even bring myself to fill out forms or make a phone call. I get anxiety. I close up and off and it isn't healthy but I just don't know what to do. 

Which brings me back to this depression. Thinking about how I have 20k in student loans which I am supposed to start paying back in November freaks me the fuck out. My only plan is to have them deferred. That is it. 

On one hand, I am desperate for social interaction. I moved about an hour and a half from my home town and, not that I had many friends there, I have zero here. On the other hand, I love my quiet apartment and being alone. (My boyfriend works about 70 hours a week). I need to start making money to pay off my debt, but I have these mental breakdowns when I look at everything I have to do in order to find a job. I look at all of you beautiful women and I don't know how you do it. I see all these ""I'm off to an interview!"" posts and I just feel crippled inside. 

I don't know what to do.

I have lost all motivation I once had to do well in school. I have lost motivation to actually do work, I don't want to do jack shit, and I'm failing to see the point of college. I don't know what I want to do in life.  It seems like everyone around me has that one 'big thing' that they're all working towards and I don't. It's sad. I'm also graduating a semester early, and I don't know what I want to do after I graduate. My student loans are piling up, and if I don't find *something*, they will become a massive problem. My interests are far and few and I don't have very many hobbies.

When I first entered college, I had this big dream that I was going to do well in school, network, do internships, and bam, end up with a decent-paying job after I graduate. Thus, with lofty expectations set, I set out to do well in school and basically get shit done. But that was then. Now, I just find it really hard to give a fuck about anything. Everyone around me seems happy and I wish I could be like that too. Everything in my life seems to be tough right now and all I want right now is a break from everything."

So my boyfriend (Male/27) of 1.5 years may be getting an internship over in Germany for anywhere from 2-6 months. I'm (Female/28) finding myself uneasy and sad about this possibility. I am happy that he might have an opportunity to see another part of the world, and get to work on a project within his field of study. However, I also find myself feeling anxious, scared of the unknown or what could happen while he's there that could hurt our relationship, etc. So I guess my question is, what should I try to help myself move past these feelings and just be happy for him?

Currently, my biggest client (well over 50% of my income, which is actually not a fun position to be in as a freelancer, I am finding) is a law firm for whom I do web content writing and social media. I became the defacto ""web guy,"" ""computer guy,"" and ""marketing guy,"" even though I'm on a part-time contract basis.

I'm trying to find someone to take over many of my duties, which can legitimately and fairly be done by people who are cheaper than I am, but the lawyer really wants to hire an intern and ideally pay them nothing. I'm pushing for $10/hr, which I still feel is low, but he's resisting.

He would still be saving money, as I would be taking a massive paycut and focusing solely on creating/editing/curating content--with a per-word rather than an hourly rate, which is my preference; I would end up making more per hour and have the freedom to pursue other clients--but he has basically decided that if I won't do it he won't be paying someone else to do it, but he still wants it done (also refuses to hire me full-time or to hire a full-time marketer that isn't me, which is what he really needs to do and which I've told him several times).

I'm currently a Junior at a very good school for computer science (think top ten for CS and Engineering) with a 3.3 GPA that is considered above average. I'm currently a computer engineering major. My school prioritizes hardware for CompE, but I'm heavily interested in software. As a result, I've just got intro classes with C++ and Java with some hardware experience.

I'm currently on my last term for coop with a very unsatisfying company. I was hoping for a fulfilling software position, but I started early with a less than ideal company doing defense contracting. I love software, but I barely do software here. Now that I'm finishing my coop, I've really put myself out there and marketed myself to some competitive companies.

Right now, a very promising midsize software company is interested in me for an internship. However, they are reluctant to do summer-only internships for anyone that isn't extremely qualified. They have told me that they are really interested in me doing a Spring term with them so they can train me to do intense work in the Summer.

I think this is a very exciting idea. However, I'm already on my third term as a coop, and I'm already looking at 4.5-5 years in school as a result. If I take this internship in the Spring, then I will continue to work until next Fall before starting classes again. I'm afraid this will kill any academic momentum I have left, making school burnout a big issue for me. I'm just now getting to the point where I'm wanting to finish up my degree and get on with college.

**TL;DR I'm already finishing my third work term in my third year of college, and the company I'm extremely interested wants me to work two more semesters with them as soon as I finish this one. Is it worth taking a full year off school to work?**

Feel free to ask me any questions"

1m3l2p,1,2013-09-10,This summer has been brutal (rant inside),[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1m3l2p/this_summer_has_been_brutal_rant_inside/,"I'm a 20 year old male college student and I want this summer to end. It wasn't been as bad as last summer, when my older brother got into a motorcycle accident that nearly took his life, but still pretty bad. Not as bad as last winter, when me and my family were still learning how to take care of him, now partially paralyzed and in chronic pain, but still bad.

My mom got into a car accident a week ago that could have easily killed or paralyzed her, too. It brought back painful memories of waiting in the emergency room, expecting the doctors to come out and tell me my brother wouldn't wake up. Luckily that didn't happen, she was able to walk out of the hospital and is largely recovered, but that hasn't made me worry any less.

It all would've been fine if I had plans, but I wasn't able to get a job or an internship. My dad has asked me repeatedly why I didn't make any plans this summer, and it doesn't seem like he understands how hard it is to get a job in my hometown. We have one of the highest unemployment rates in the state. I applied to a dozen places and didn't get a single call back. I feel fortunate to have a job waiting for me back at college, because if I didn't I would probably feel even more like a loser.

I wish I had more friends. It feels like my hometown friends have forgotten me, but that's unfair. They're busy with their own lives and it's not like I was asking them to hang out every weekend. We have gotten together a few times, but not nearly as often as I would have liked, and I hate this feeling that we're drifting apart. They're some of my oldest friends, and the only ones I have here, and I love them. I wish I had the courage to tell them that face to face.

I am lonely and I want to get into a relationship again, but it's been nearly four years since my last one. Dating is difficult and hooking up is even worse. I haven't had sex in nine months and every time I get close to it, I clam up and get terrified and back out. Unless I'm drunk or high, but then I can't orgasm, which is a different kind of disappointment.

I've been depressed on and off this whole summer, and have been falling back into bad habits. I'm honestly surprised that I haven't started smoking again, but that would ruin my running, which is the only thing that has been keeping me back from a nervous breakdown. Even with exercise, I still sleep half the day, sometimes more.

The worst part about all this is that I'm scared of going back to school, happier as I am there. I'm starting my third year and I've been on academic probation before. I've been diagnosed with ADHD and it's all I can do to pay attention in class, and many times I don't even show up because I can't gather the motivation. I sometimes fall into the worst downward spirals, especially when none of my roommates are home, and I get suicidal thoughts. I once caught myself searching the apartment for pills, I'm not even sure how it started, and I had to take a long walk to calm back down.

I'm just so tired."

I'm in fucking Sydney, Australia.  It's such a beautiful place, such an interesting city. I am in the middle of a once in a life time experience for which my parents have spent over $20,000, just so I could take classes on the other side of the world for four months. And I am miserable.  I am alone. I am withdrawing from the world and on the brink of falling into the familiar abyss of darkness that is depression at its cruelest.   

I thought that it was over. I was so, so, so foolish to think that the depression was gone.  Because why would it be? What have I done with my life to make it go away? I got an internship (unpaid) I got decent grades (still down from last semester) and I made some friends (one actually).  I still have no group to call my own.  I still have no traditional ""college experience"".  I still am seemingly incapable of forging lasting connections with people because my anxiety and low self esteem tell me no one would want to be around me.  

Why did I think anything would change? The problem is me, not my location. Transferring schools didn't help, so why should going to the other end of the earth would? I can't outrun myself. I can't escape me, no matter how hard I try.  I wish I could be anyone else. Anyone. 

No, actually. Do you know what I want? I just want a fucking friend. I want someone to listen to me. I want a hug. I want to be told I'm not a failure.  I want someone to tell me to stick around and hang out.  I want someone to miss me. I just want a hug. I said that already. But I really want one. I just want to sleep. I want to not be tearing up right now.  I want to not have asked my roommates if they wanted me to leave the living room now that they're home. Because who fucking does that? Who hates themselves so much that they think that their mere presence is bothering other people? This is why they hate me. 

I'm sorry for all of this. I'm sorry. I shouldn't post this, but I'm selfish and it makes no sense and I'm sorry. There's nothing any of you can do to make it suck less, and I know that. But I just wanted to get this all out.

Advice?,Istome,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/1m3h1x/life_altering_career_decision_advice/,"Hey guys, I thought maybe some of you could give me a bit of advice, since I'm about to start make the biggest decision of my life and I have no idea what to do.

I graduated with my ME degree in 2012, but I didn't really want to stay in my hometown and get the typical engineering job for the area. I had three internships during school, one at Volkswagen doing carbon fiber research, one at a German university doing carbon fiber research, and one (unrelated to ME, but still engineering) power quality internship at my local power utility. I graduated with a 4.0 and a bunch of honors, had a few good job offers, but I knew I wanted to work in the automotive field and that I definitely wanted to get my Masters. So I packed my bags and moved to Germany to get my Masters in Automotive and Mechanical Engineering. Now, I'm about to start my thesis at Mercedes-Benz on laser welding.
 
But now I should start looking into applying to jobs for post graduation. I have no idea what I should do. Should I stay here and find a job or go back to the US, and if I go back to the US where should I go? I like it well enough here in Germany, I have a great girlfriend (which makes it even harder to chose), I have great friends, I like the culture, but my German skills suck. I've only been learning the language for about a year, but I don't see myself ever becoming great enough. Just due to the language alone, I don't believe I'd be able to advance my career as far or as quickly as I could in the US. Besides that, there are other reasons that make things complicated and just a pain in the ass, such as all the bureaucracy I have to go through since I'm a foreigner. Plus, I'm positive that I could make more money in the US. 

All of my experiences have really been related to R&amp;D, which I enjoy. I'd like to think that I'd be good at and enjoy a job in design, but I'd hate to realize that I don't like it after I get a job. I've looked into car companies in the US. I'm really interested in Tesla and Ford. But I don't know if it's worth it to come home or not. I don't even know where to start. Any and all advice will be greatly appreciated!"

Are you working in a position that you've always wanted? Are you actually challenged by your job? Do you feel like you can make a difference in someone's life? How is your quality of life post-graduation? Are you driving fancy sports cars? Got an above average home? Taking a lot of extravagant vacations? Wife and kids? 

I ask this because I have been getting immensely disappointed in myself recently. I am just a sophomore taking Gen Ed classes at a local community college. I plan on transferring to a 4 year institution next fall to pursue my BS in ME. I reside in southeast Detroit. Not too far from Chrysler, Ford, and GM. Probably an hour drive to them. There are also defense firms like General Dynamics and BAE Systems very close to me. I DREAM of working in the automotive or aerospace industry. I have been applying for internships nearly everyday in the past 2 months. No positive responses yet. Although I am discouraged, I refuse to give up. A friend of mine who lives in Ohio told me he had an uncle who works pretty high up at Lockheed Martin and that I should post my resume on their careers page in hopes of possibly pushing it forward. I haven't gotten any word from him, so I am coming to the conclusion that I may have been denied. 

Please offer me the best advice you folks have. It really could make a difference in my life."

It was for the fire fighters benevolent fund, but in the 8 years of doing that I went from just being little kid who'd help the adults by grabbing water or tools to helping with the design, building, promoting, operating, and breakdown with a team of 15 people. Also along with that I started doing theater in 7th grade for a local theater company and have been helping build sets for them since, In high school I joined the Drama guild. Through that I learned how to run and operate sound and lighting systems, rigging, plenty of backstage dillemas. Once I came to Orlando for my freshman year I just did school until March when I got an internship with New Atmosphere productions located in Sarasota where I learned how to set up stages, scaffolding's, lights and sound systems and generators. Did that until they had to go out of business this summer. Now i'm back in Orlando looking for any work (even if it doesn't pertain to this) but if it does it helps have resume ready. Never been more eager to work."

1m2wsc,17,2013-09-09,Recent story regarding my student loan. Curious what Reddit thinks.,tepknish,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1m2wsc/recent_story_regarding_my_student_loan_curious/,"I'm a 30 year old on the east coast of the US from poor middle class parents who couldn't afford to send their 2 children to private schools. Naturally, we both went to private schools. For me, 5 years of undergrad resulted in a whopping 127k private loan and 20k fed loan. The second mistake (the 1st is obv), was choosing the fixed interest rate of 10% over the flex rate upon consolidating when I graduated in 2006. That gem of advice came from my ex-gfs' father, who was a hardcore finance guy. Parents paid most of accruing interest while I was in school; that's all. 

Until a few weeks ago, my balance was 118k. Miraculous, I know. I'll explain in a bit. Recently, I was able to moonlight for a lot of extra loot. I decided I was O.K. with my checking account minus 10k. I called my student loan company; discover is the manager, not the original lender. I asked all the right questions. Person on phone estimated my new minimum payment would be $92 less than what it is. She said glad I called, a request to adjust min. payment was necessary when making  a large principle balance payment, but just a formality. I said okay great. At the same time I finally switched over to automatic deduction for the .25 interest rate benefit. Had to wait since I was in deferment for grad school (yes, I have a federal loan for grad school). Checked online a week later, principle balance was 109k, minimum payment was unchanged except for the $23 deduction from the int. rate change. I called, and actually got the same adviser I got from the 1st call. She said she thought it was a mistake, since the entire 10k wasn't processed, some went to current int. balance. She said check back in a week. After the holiday, I called again and got a smart adviser. Basically she admitted that I was told the wrong thing, twice. My request to adj min payment was denied. It was really never an option, as per my loan agreement. Min. payment is only adjusted after deferment or at the loaner's discretion. I asked for documentation of the first convo (she was obv able to view it) and she said she wasn't capable of sending. I wanted all 10k to go towards the principle and pay the interest balance like normal, that also was never an option, despite what I was told. I asked if I could submitt another request to adj. min balance or submit some kind of waiver/request...I was just making shit up. She said no. 
Has this loan company done me wrong? Obv they don't care about how much diff in my month to month finances a payment reduction makes. I  know in the long wrong I will pay less interest, but I really wanted to reduce my min. payment so I can afford things normal people have like a house or an engagement ring. That 10k would of eliminated an entire fed loan I pay ~$75 a month on. Is there a bureau I could report this to? Or, am I at fault for not really knowing the terms of the loan despite what I was told on the phone?
If any of you fine people have any advice on my loan in general I am all ears. I am looking into getting a loan with a lower interest rate from wells fargo to pay off this one, but I was denied before and it seems they r the only ones that offer those type of loans now. I make too much $$ to qualify for income based payments; the upside of my story I alluded to earlier. 
As an undergrad, I had the wherewithal to procure an internship from the father of a fraternity brother. This put me on the path to a rare, lucrative, satisfying, cutting edge and well paying career that somewhat makes up for the price I paid. I'm an embryologist; I make babies in a lab. AMA-lol. Being a scientist and helping couples is great, but I would trade it for little debt and a desk job. 

Thanks!

Someone who worked at Bad Robot while LOST was being made is also a Bills fan, and posted on the same football message board I used to. Every LOST season, we'd end up with a 100+ page thread with all of the LOST fans discussing the show. After the finale, our guy was finally able to contribute, and provide some insight from his perspective. I've had it saved and send it to friends as they finish the series. I've found it helps explain a lot, so I thought I'd post it here since I see a lot of ""Just finished series, have a lot of questions"" posts.

NOTES:
1. He was NOT a writer for LOST
2. This is not official Bad Robot canon or explanations. Just his perspective.

This is a copy and paste from the board, so the ""John"" he refers to was another poster who had a lot of questions, not John Locke. Also, ""Flocke"" was our name for Locke/MIB.

Enjoy!...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Good stuff on here! I can finally throw in my two cents! I've had to bite my tongue for far too long. Also, hopefully I can answer some of John's questions about Dharma and the ""pointless breadcrumbs"" that really, weren't so pointless ...
First ...

The Island:

It was real. Everything that happened on the island that we saw throughout the 6 seasons was real. Forget the final image of the plane crash, it was put in purposely to f*&amp;k with people's heads and show how far the show had come. They really crashed. They really survived. They really discovered Dharma and the Others. The Island keeps the balance of good and evil in the world. It always has and always will perform that role. And the Island will always need a ""Protector"". Jacob wasn't the first, Hurley won't be the last. However, Jacob had to deal with a malevolent force (MIB) that his mother, nor Hurley had to deal with. He created the devil and had to find a way to kill him -- even though the rules prevented him from actually doing so.

Thus began Jacob's plan to bring candidates to the Island to do the one thing he couldn't do. Kill the MIB. He had a huge list of candidates that spanned generations. Yet everytime he brought people there, the MIB corrupted them and caused them to kill one another. That was until Richard came along and helped Jacob understand that if he didn't take a more active role, then his plan would never work.

Enter Dharma -- which I'm not sure why John is having such a hard time grasping. Dharma, like the countless scores of people that were brought to the island before, were brought there by Jacob as part of his plan to kill the MIB. However, the MIB was aware of this plan and interferred by ""corrupting"" Ben. Making Ben believe he was doing the work of Jacob when in reality he was doing the work of the MIB. This carried over into all of Ben's ""off-island"" activities. He was the leader. He spoke for Jacob as far as they were concerned. So the ""Others"" killed Dharma and later were actively trying to kill Jack, Kate, Sawyer, Hurley and all the candidates because that's what the MIB wanted. And what he couldn't do for himself.

Dharma was originally brought in to be good. But was turned bad by MIB's corruption and eventually destroyed by his pawn Ben. Now, was Dharma only brought there to help Jack and the other Canditates on their overall quest to kill Smokey? Or did Jacob have another list of Canidates from the Dharma group that we were never aware of? That's a question that is purposley not answered because whatever answer the writers came up with would be worse than the one you come up with for yourself. Still ... Dharma's purpose is not ""pointless"" or even vague. Hell, it's pretty blantent.

Still, despite his grand plan, Jacob wanted to give his ""candidates"" (our Lostaways) the one thing he, nor his brother, were ever afforded: free will. Hence him bringing a host of ""candidates"" through the decades and letting them ""choose"" which one would actually do the job in the end. Maybe he knew Jack would be the one to kill Flocke and that Hurley would be the protector in the end. Maybe he didn't. But that was always the key question of the show: Fate vs Free-will. Science vs Faith. Personally I think Jacob knew from the beginning what was going to happen and that everyone played a part over 6 seasons in helping Jack get to the point where he needed to be to kill Smokey and make Hurley the protector -- I know that's how a lot of the writers viewed it. But again, they won't answer that (nor should they) because that ruins the fun.

In the end, Jack got to do what he always wanted to do from the very first episode of the show: Save his fellow Lostaways. He got Kate and Sawyer off the island and he gave Hurley the purpose in life he'd always been missing. And, in Sideways world (which we'll get to next) he in fact saved everyone by helping them all move on ...

Now...

Sideways World:

Sideways world is where it gets really cool in terms of theology and metaphysical discussion (for me at least -- because I love history/religion theories and loved all the talks in the writer's room about it). Basically what the show is proposing is that we're all linked to certain people during our lives. Call them soulmates (though it's not exactly the best word). But these people we're linked to are with us duing ""the most important moments of our lives"" as Christian said. These are the people we move through the universe with from lifetime to lifetime. It's loosely based in Hinduisim with large doses of western religion thrown into the mix.

The conceit that the writers created, basing it off these religious philosophies, was that as a group, the Lostaways subconsciously created this ""sideways"" world where they exist in purgatory until they are ""awakened"" and find one another. Once they all find one another, they can then move on and move forward. In essence, this is the show's concept of the afterlife. According to the show, everyone creates their own ""Sideways"" purgatory with their ""soulmates"" throughout their lives and exist there until they all move on together. That's a beautiful notion. Even if you aren't religious or even spirtual, the idea that we live AND die together is deeply profound and moving.

It's a really cool and spirtual concept that fits the whole tone and subtext the show has had from the beginning. These people were SUPPOSED to be together on that plane. They were supposed to live through these events -- not JUST because of Jacob. But because that's what the universe or God (depending on how religious you wish to get) wanted to happen. The show was always about science vs faith -- and it ultimately came down on the side of faith. It answered THE core question of the series. The one question that has been at the root of every island mystery, every character backstory, every plot twist. That, by itself, is quite an accomplishment.

How much you want to extrapolate from that is up to you as the viewer. Think about season 1 when we first found the Hatch. Everyone thought that's THE answer! Whatever is down there is the answer! Then, as we discovered it was just one station of many. One link in a very long chain that kept revealing more, and more of a larger mosiac.

But the writer's took it even further this season by contrasting this Sideways ""purgatory"" with the Island itself. Remember when Michael appeared to Hurley, he said he was not allowed to leave the Island. Just like the MIB. He wasn't allowed into this sideways world and thus, was not afforded the opportunity to move on. Why? Because he had proven himself to be unworthy with his actions on the Island. He failed the test. The others, passed. They made it into Sideways world when they died -- some before Jack, some years later. In Hurley's case, maybe centuries later. They exist in this sideways world until they are ""awakened"" and they can only move on TOGETHER because they are linked. They are destined to be together for eternity. That was their destiny.

They were NOT linked to Anna Lucia, Daniel, Roussou, Alex, Miles, Lupidis, (and all the rest who weren't in the chuch -- basically everyone who wasn't in season 1). Yet those people exist in Sideways world. Why? Well again, here's where they leave it up to you to decide. The way I like to think about it, is that those people who were left behind in Sideways world have to find their own soulmates before they can wake up. It's possible that those links aren't people from the island but from their other life (Anna's parnter, the guy she shot --- Roussou's husband, etc etc).

A lot of people have been talking about Ben and why he didn't go into the Church. And if you think of Sideways world in this way, then it gives you the answer to that very question. Ben can't move on yet because he hasn't connected with the people he needs to. It's going to be his job to awaken Roussou, Alex, Anna Lucia (maybe), Ethan, Goodspeed, his father and the rest. He has to attone for his sins more than he did by being Hurley's number two. He has to do what Hurley and Desmond did for our Lostaways with his own people. He has to help them connect. And he can only move on when all the links in his chain are ready to. Same can be said for Faraday, Charlotte, Whidmore, Hawkins etc. It's really a neat, and cool concept. At least to me.

But, from a more ""behind the scenes"" note: the reason Ben's not in the church, and the reason no one is in the church but for Season 1 people is because they wrote the ending to the show after writing the pilot. And never changed it. The writers always said (and many didn't believe them) that they knew their ending from the very first episode. I applaud them for that. It's pretty fantastic. Originally Ben was supposed to have a 3 episode arc and be done. But he became a big part of the show. They could have easily changed their ending and put him in the church -- but instead they problem solved it. Gave him a BRILLIANT moment with Locke outside the church ... and then that was it. I loved that. For those that wonder -- the original ending started the moment Jack walked into the church and touches the casket to Jack closing his eyes as the other plane flies away. That was always JJ's ending. And they kept it.

For me the ending of this show means a lot. Not only because I worked on it, but because as a writer it inspired me in a way the medium had never done before. I've been inspired to write by great films. Maybe too many to count. And there have been amazing TV shows that I've loved (X-Files, 24, Sopranos, countless 1/2 hour shows). But none did what LOST did for me. None showed me that you could take huge risks (writing a show about faith for network TV) and stick to your creative guns and STILL please the audience. I learned a lot from the show as a writer. I learned even more from being around the incredible writers, producers, PAs, interns and everyone else who slaved on the show for 6 years.

In the end, for me, LOST was a touchstone show that dealt with faith, the afterlife, and all these big, spirtual questions that most shows don't touch. And to me, they never once waivered from their core story -- even with all the sci-fi elements they mixed in. To walk that long and daunting of a creative tightrope and survive is simply astounding.

And awesome stuff, as always, from everyone on here over the past few years! You guys rock!

1m2rpf,1,2013-09-09,I (26M) am having trouble reconciling what happened and how to move forward with my ex (25F),giants87,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1m2rpf/i_26m_am_having_trouble_reconciling_what_happened/,"Fellow redditors - I need some help. I wan to know if I am the douchebag, if I was unreasonable, if it was both, or if it was my ex… or both of us… really anything. I want some clarity outside my own mind. This is a long story - so if you are wiling to read it through, I appreciate all comments.

I (26m) recently broke up with my ex (25f), and we dated for four years. In the beginning I found out some things about her that led me, a rather insecure and at times extremely anxious person, to have a lot of trouble as our relationship grew throughout the years. She cheated on all her exes, she visited her exes while with me, and it never sat well with me. But she was great, so I tried to look past it.

Year one: generally it was amazing, we were both on cloud 9 together from what I remember. Aside from a hiccup with her ex within the first couple of months, I eventually came to completely trust her.  She had the most beautiful smile, would greet me with eyes that just felt like home, and made me feel truly special, wanted. I would drive in just to take her to college classes, even on days I had none, and wait around on campus. As I said - the smile she would greet me with was heavenly. I miss it to this day. I moved in with her eventually, and we were inseparable.

Year two: I graduated, and I found she was spending a lot of time with a guy I was not comfortable with. It got the the point that I put a key logger on my computer and saw how she was CONSTANTLY flirting with him (hey hottie, cutie, etc) - it bothered me. I asked her to stop, she said she would - but didn't. Even took him to the mall when she was only going shopping at VS, but ""he never came in with her"" so it was OK in her mind - it never was in mind.  I was starting to work 230+ hours a month and felt she was unhappy, and i started to get a burning to go after that long lost high school girl - so I broke up with her, I paid her back for the trip she took us to in Hawaii 9 months earlier, and I gave it a shot - it went nowhere. Eventually, me and my ex grew back together. I am not proud of what I did, but I felt she was unhappy with me - I didn't know the pain that i would cause her, but from what she told me it was overwhelming. I never found the right way to apologize, even though I wanted to and tried to.

Year three: We were good, but it was never like the first year again. My trust in her was fading from run ins with random guys she would always have, and the VS mall guy still in the picture. Otherwise - a pretty uneventful year, until the end. But I'll bunch that into year 4.

Year 4: I had a VERY rough year - I spent two to three days a week with my grandpa as he was getting blood transfusions for 6-8 hours a day, and the rest of the time trying to help and find a job as I was unemployed at the start. In december, my grandma and grandpa went to vegas and my grandpa immediately had a heart attack leaving him in a vegas hospital for 10 days. Me and my family flew to vegas the next day to help, I would spent nights sleeping on his hospital floor because otherwise he would wake up calling us because of his dementia, forgetting where he was and why. I felt I was doing the right thing for my family, and didn't mean to neglect her. Eventually, late Spring hit - my dog died in my arms outside of a vet, my cat was put down, and my grandpa eventually died. I never found a way to cope, and I think to this day I refuse to allow myself to accept it. And I resent my ex - she wasn't ever there for me. Instead, she started going out with guys behind my back, not saying a thing, until 2 AM or beyond. Twice I caught her doing this, I went to her house and waited for hours until she got home because of my terror and anger - I didn't want to lose her too. I eventually broke when she threatened to leave, I spent three nights in a mental ward for suicide watch, and was finally let go to my family. I had to realize she wasn't all I had left, and that I had to create my existence outside of her. But I wanted her in my life, and we reconnected again.

She started school at a new college in September, and I found a job near her (a 40 minute drive to work). We moved in together. Things were very bad from the start - that trust I had of her was still slowly crumbling.  The second week she took a guy home to her hometown, took him shopping at a mall, out to eat, walking in a park, and to her house. I got a new cat that day (I love animals, and was ready for a new one finally) - and she was ignoring me. I was at my sisters, 40 blocks from her house - so I drove over, and saw he speeding off later learning there was a guy hiding in her passenger seat. The same guy that she invited over two days later and cooked a breakfast for after I left for work.  I think this is where my trust in her truly shattered. We argued, we fought, things were terrible - she moved out. She whispered in my ear as she left ""Is it real yet?"" - those words still sting and frustrate me to remember.

Well - we reconciled, we were OK. I moved into essentially a frat house to stay close, I waited for her to call for help, to go shopping, for anything as I was displaced from my friends and family and hoping to reconcile with her. Eventually, summer comes, and I told her I can't do nearly 11 hour days any more (8, +1 hour lunch, +1.5 hour round trip driving). I moved closer to work, and told her I wanted her with me. I gave her the offer of you just buy our food and I'll cover the rest of the rent and bills. She turned it down, she didn't follow through to come visit me on weekends as she promised - and I finally threw in the towel. Then she comes back, saying she would split all bills even just to be with me, that she would unlock all her accounts to show I could trust her (I couldn't trust a word she said at this point, my paranoia was taking over). I said no. I said we weren't healthy for one another, we need to grow apart and let it go.

I was doing good, eventually she would text me saying she cries herself to sleep every night, she misses me, she will wait for me, etc… it tore at my heart. But I remade my Facebook awhile back, and the other day I finally clicked on her picture - to find that she had been out with the same guys from before, that nothing in her life had changed. I grew so furious, enraged… that she would pry at me saying such things while still doing the exact things that drove me to lose my trust in her.

I want to make a few things clear - 

Her guy friends were always NEW, they weren't more than a week old generally before she was off with them without telling me their name or a thing about them. I used to say her response to my questions were ""fuck you deal with it.""
I reacted with rage sometimes… and it wasn't pretty. Not violent, but the things I would say were at times terrible.
I am afraid of driving home to my parents, because I got a new car and don't want her to find me. She sent me a message a couple weeks ago ""your parents look happy"" - And my parents were home. It struck me as odd.
At one point she told me how I was threatening to leave almost monthly - and I look at it as ""and you never tried to change or see why, just cover the issue with a smile or words that would melt my firm stance against you every time""

I couldn't find a way to look beyond how she could so quickly meet and go off with guys without telling me a thing about them. I couldn't find a way to forgive her, I honestly felt cheated, worse than if it were sexual. I say this because I thought she was my best friend, that we would talk about everything - but she hid these guys from me, and protected them from my questions by never answering if I persisted. Now she has my computer, iPad, printer, my engagement ring, another ring, and earrings - and won't even return the engagement ring. It frustrates me, that she would keep my stuff that she has no right to hold onto. Especially as she always brags about her money, and put me down for not having as much as her or her ex (he was a pharmacist, she's a pharmacy intern / pharm.d student who is/ will be making a lot)

Am I the asshole? Did she purposefully play me?
How do I let it go? I thought I was doing so well until the Facebook event, seeing she was playing with me with more lies.

I feel like I've lost the ability to trust people close to me as a result. My fuse to anger is… incredibly short lately. I just want to laugh and make people smile, I thought I found my true self again, then this past week with those images I completely lost it.

Any opinions, questions - on me, or her, or anything - go ahead. 

Sorry, no tl;dr - theres too much on both sides for me to accurately shorten this."

Would love some outsider input.",FlamingTong,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1m2rfv/me24m_with_my_ex_21f_small_things_temporary_large/,"Hey all!  This is my first post in /r/relationships, so here goes.  

My ex and I started dating in June of 2013.  I know this is recent, but we have known each other since January 2013 and had great chemistry but both chose to ignore it as we were both with other people at the time.

By March, I had broken up with my then-girlfriend (of 4 years), and was just getting back from an insane Mexico trip with my guys.  I had a great time and was gearing up for my last term at university.

Me and recent ex had been involved in a group project together.  We were the only two committed workers of the group and did the majority of the work together while other group members surfed the wave we had manufactured.  This showed us a lot about each other and our work ethics and priorities.  We 'studied' together for that class and spent a lot of time together talking instead of studying.

We decided to give it a try in the second week of my final term in college.  She had *just* broken up with her then-boyfriend.  It was great very quickly, and we both said things like ""I haven't ever felt like this before"" and ""I didn't expect this"".  Things you want to hear.

I had gotten a job in January of 2013.  This job was, at the time, going to take me to a city over 1300 miles away for good.  I knew I was leaving for said job soon and this new girl knew this the entire time as well.  Then, all of the sudden, my job informs me that I will only be *training* 1300 miles away, then I will be moving back closer and it will take 12 weeks to finish training.  The distance between me and new girl is only going to be 3 hours driving after my training as opposed to 15.5 during.  We decided that something like this connection we had doesn't come often in a lifetime, and that it was worth it to be together.

So we went for it.  I am currently in my 10th of 12 weeks of training in the city 1300 miles away.  The distance was fine for a while, and we've been able to see each other twice.  One thing that has gotten in the way is different forms of communication: now that her internship was over (as of August 2nd), she texted me all the time.  She wants me to call and text every break I have in work otherwise she doesn't feel like I care about her.  I have spent hours on the phone with her reassuring her how important it was to me that we get through this time apart and how much I care.  I wanted to talk once a day, preferably at night, and talk about everything in our day.  This way, we have things to talk about and the conversation doesn't get stale.  She feels that this is me not caring about her enough to be in constant communication, and says she feels like she is bothering me and always the one to initiate our communication.  Really, the opposite is true because all I want is to make it so we are still really into each other even though there is a harsh distance between us right now.

The only thing I have a problem with is how we communicate when we each go out.  I have had bad experiences in the past, and therefore it is important to me that we each tell the other one *if* we're going out, and whenever we're back home and in bed we leave a message for the other one.  It isn't important *who* we're going out with or *where*, but just *that* we're going out.  It makes me feel that even though we are each out, we are thinking of the other one.  I have expressed this as important before we started our relationship, and have always lead by example when I am going out here.  She feels that this is controlling, and I feel like her wanting me to call/text ALL THE TIME is controlling.  

Anyway, I am willing to try.  I don't want her to feel like the only one who initiates communication, and basically I want to try the things she expresses as important to me. 

So I do it: I text her in the morning before work, and also during my breaks I get.  It takes her *hours* to text me back even though I know she doesn't have any responsibilities right now, and this annoys me because it felt like she just wanted me to always be initiating communication and so she could take it for granted and feel like someone is infatuated with her.  So we talk about this and it turns out apparently she wasn't trying to do that.  Whatever.  I'm over it.  But then another night out passes, and she goes out without letting me know she is and I find out the next morning.  I'm hurt only because I wanted to do the things she expressed as important and she couldn't do the things for me that I expressed as important.  So we talk the next day and she doesn't seem like there is any fight in her as far as wanting to give those things which are important to me a try.  I break up with her over the phone that afternoon.  

This isn't our first breakup mind you-- we broke up before but it was her with me and it was because she thought I was mad that she blacked out for her 21st birthday, when really I was worried when she was unable to call or text me when she was home.  It wasn't that it happened the one time on her 21st birthday (we've all been there), it was that I have had bad experiences with that happening frequently in the past and wanted to ""nip it in the bud"" and explain to her why this type of communication level is important to me.  She broke up with me and at the start of the next conversation we had, and by the end she said she felt ""180 degrees differently"", so we were back together.  But she was headed to Vegas and I didn't want to hear about shit so I told her we should take a break.  This break was because the situation hurt me, because I always wanted to work through issues and be together in the end of them.  It showed me that one of her outlets was to let this go after everything we'd said to one another.  She basically showed me that breaking up was something that had entered her mind as a possibility, and the same wasn't true on my side.

When she broke up with me, I fought for us.  I explained to her everything and told her my actual motives, and that's when she felt 180 degrees differently.  When I broke up with her, I think, deep down, that I wanted to see if she would fight for us if the situation were reversed.  When she didn't really fight for us it propelled me to continue the breakup that morning.  It felt like, deep down, she was getting what she wanted and I didn't want to deprive her of that.  

Now she is mad because I tweeted some shit when I was out after that afternoon, but really my colleagues made me go out with them because I was confiding in them and they didn't want me to just be sad.  She said it showed a lot that I could just go out after a monumentally bad day like we had, and that it wasn't something she wanted because she had stayed in and just been sad for two days.  I told her that people deal with things differently.

I am now alone in this big city.  I had those colleagues until a few days ago that lived here as well and were training along with me, but they have left as they started their training before I did.  She is still in the college town where we met, and has many roommates and a strong support system to rely on there.  This is enabling her to not have as much of a problem with No Contact, and she has many things to occupy her mind.  The opposite is true for me.  I am making friends and have had success with a few girls down here but I put a stop to it before it goes anywhere (as in, if we were still dating I still haven't cheated on her).  The No Contact is hurting me deeply.

I have expressed to her that I wanted to talk in-person to see if there is really nothing left.  I am coming back to where she lives for a friend's wedding, and we are talking the night afterward.  I don't know where she stands and what she wants to do, but I told her she can have a free 'out' and not talk to me in person if that is easier, which would give me closure and start my 'moving on' process.  If there is nothing left then I know that this just isn't what I thought it was and I can deal with that.  But she wants to talk.  I don't know what to make of that, and I want to ask her what she truly wants from this talk in person as our conversation won't be for a week-- and this week by myself is wearing hard on me.  I don't know what to ask her, and I'm giving her time to think about if she misses what we had, because a lot of the time I think things are ruined because you don't give the other person enough space to understand their true feelings.  So NC is definitely happening, but let me tell you readers that this shit sucks.  Any/all advice and thoughts are appreciated, and especially just having people to talk to and bounce ideas off of is something I really could use right now.  Thanks a ton for reading this whole novel on my life.

I got an internship where my friend works. Bad news is that I do not have appropriate work clothes.


My current job is a student work and my previous jobs were working as a teller and waitress. For those jobs I wore black pants and black or white button down shirts. 



However at this internship which I will start in the  end of September (assuming I get my paperwork/drug test in desired time frame). When I went for an interview, the current workers are all really dressy and high maintenance. I feel like I don't belong there. I feel like I should be a door holder. I am business (finance/marketing) intern in the retail/fashion industry. In ways I feel like I don't deserve this internship. 


I get paid once a month and I would like to have some work clothes before I start my internship which will end in June. I had an extra $20 which I decided to use towards r/randomkindness. I am sending people postcards and other things. Stamps cost $9. You can check my history, I had thank people who helped me out.  I would happy to send a thank you letter to all that help out.



Here is my wishlist.  http://amzn.com/w/1V5SPLLNKABLE If you have gently used belts or scarves, I would be happy to take them too. I am dress size of 0-4


Edit: I realize that there has been a scam alert/awareness going on. Let me know how I can prove to you or make you feel better helping me. If you would like me to make another wishlist someone where else I can do that too.


EDIT 2: If no one is willing to help me out. Can I get some advice what to do or where to look. I am so confused.  I have very little self confidence and I am shy at asking that's why I resort to reddit. 

If anyone wants any slave-labor let me know. 
I am willing to work for it. If you trust me, I can buy you a pizza once I get a paycheck from this internship.

I'm texing up my resume, and was hoping to report on some work I did this summer at an internship.

For my summer work, (I worked at a mobile marketing firm) I developed a predictive model to quantify the unsubscribe rate that we would see following sending a message blast.  In mobile marketing, subscribers can text ""STOP"" to unsubscribe from lists, and I looked at the different things involved in predicting these unsubscribe rates.

I framed my problem as a multi-class problem, where each class corresponded with rates of list unsubscribe rate (for example, 0 was no unsubscribes, 1 was 0-.05% of the list would unsubscribe, etc etc).

What metric should I report when describing my results for my resume?  I achieved 85% accuracy with Random Forests for the multi class (91% for a two-class formulation!).  But is percent accuracy a good metric?  

If possible, I want a metric that anyone would be able to understand. So in this way, I am attracted to raw accuracy.  So I'm unsure if something like sensitivity/specificity (does this even work with multiclass) would be appropriate

yes I used cross validation and split up my training and test sets following rigorous methodologies

tl;dr Is classification accuracy (as a percent) a good way to report results on a resume?"

My name is XXXXXX XXXXXXand I am a student interested in the possibility of internships with XXXXXXXXXXX. 

To tell you more about myself, I am a sophomore student at Arizona State University's Tempe campus. I am majoring in Digital Culture with a music concentration. Digital Culture is a new major that opened up at ASU last year when I was a Freshman.

The reason I want to explore internship opportunities with XXXXXXXXX is because I have a true admiration for the excellence that the company delivers in its products. It is a dream of mine to land a career with the company when I graduate, and quite honestly, I haven't the slightest idea of how to start that dream. Hence, I am contacting you. You are the closest chance I have to get close to the company. 

It seems like a longshot, and sometimes my dream seems harder and harder to grasp. However, I am also starting to notice that there are two barriers I have when I break it down. These.two barriers I believe are language and education. I realized that if I set my mind to it, I can get over through these barriers with time and dedication. 

What I am asking from you is for any guidance you can give me to reach my destination. If this means taking a starting position in your store, or even an unpaid internship, I'd be more than glad to take it. If you would like more information about myself, or my education, feel encouraged to ask. I just want to get my foot in the door with this company, and I hope you can help with this.

Thank you for your time,

What do you guys think? Is there something I missed? Something I should add? What would you guys think about incorporating an invite to a coffee date or something like that?

If my previous post was any indication, I was in a bad spot and losing hope fast. I came to you all for advice, and to my surprise a good number answered the call. I took everything said in that topic to heart, and within two weeks I had landed a psychology-related job in a nearby city that pays enough for me to live comfortably and is freaking FUN for me! Some advice that really helped me...

* Read ""The Defining Decade: Why Your Twenties Matter"" by Dr. Meg Jay. Someone suggested it to help me avoid my ""retail job fatigue."" It was both an interesting read and a perspective-changer for me. I'd suggest it to anyone who is struggling with a job hunt in the twenties.

* Look for work in your field. I was so busy looking at high paying jobs way out of my area of expertise that I completely missed a lot of good human services jobs. It's also much easier to interview for said positions when you have a wealth of knowledge from school to utilize.

* **CHECK CRAIGSLIST!** Less people use it, most areas have it, and your chances of getting a job are significantly higher there!

* Anything beats retail. Even if my job paid half as much I would still take it, as I'm getting training and experience that REALLY beefs up my resume. It also exposes you to networks and you can work your way to even better things.

* Find an internship, the earlier the better! I **wish** I had done this, as it would have made things much easier for me.

* However hopeless your situation seems--do not give up. Every dog has its day.

Again, I have to thank everyone for the input and support I received a month ago. Without you guys, I would still be working ~25 hours a week for pennies in a dead end job. To those reading this that are in the situation I was, definitely read the comments in that last thread. You'll land *something*, maybe even tomorrow!"

In general, if there are any local opportunities you are aware of, I would be incredibly grateful for your referral. I am looking to assist in any project related to the Earth Sciences. I am particularly interested in Coastal Geology and GIS (I completed a Certification in GIS, though I may need some refreshing). My employment history lacks field experience, though I have completed a decent number of field courses and labs.

PM me if you know of anything. Thanks so much!"
1m7i87,5,2013-09-11,A help request from a business student!,SavingPrivateDick,mining,https://www.reddit.com/r/mining/comments/1m7i87/a_help_request_from_a_business_student/,"Hello, r/mining!

I'm an accounting student who recently interned for a social development dep't for a mining company in South Africa (I live in Canada).


I picked up interest in mining and in the local community that mining companies create. Also the influence that mining companies have in the world market is also very interesting. I'm exploring my options and mining is definitely up there.


Unfortunately, not many business students go into mining. As far as I'm concerned, there are no info sessions, and no recruiting events that happen in my faculty. I checked the Rio Tinto website, and it has positions open for Canada- Summer Internship, but I have no idea who to reach out to to get more information on that (no HR contact). I don't know if its within Canada, and most importantly, I don't know how to contact anyone, or to network in order to stand out!


Is there anyone out there that headed into mining with their business degree? I'm stuck between an internship at a public accounting firm or at a mining company, and I'd love to find out more information on mining before I make my decision. 


Q's:
-How can I get information on a faculty with no mining relations?
-Is it even possible for a Commerce student to get an internship with a mining company?
-Whats the general guide to conduct yourself in mining recruitment? (I know in a public accounting recruitment event, no one ever talks about accounting, but what they do outside of work-basically shooting the shit)

Thank you"
1m7hdf,5,2013-09-11,Do I have PTSD?,[deleted],ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1m7hdf/do_i_have_ptsd/,"I signed up so I could post this question... I'v been reading a lot of posts on this forum and have started to wonder if I have undiagnosed PTSD.

About a year ago I was arrested because I assaulted a paramedic during a panic attack. I was having a panic attack and the police and paramedics were called. They treated me like I was a violent mental case and restrained me, which resulted in me becoming defensive and ultimately combative when the paramedic involved physically restrained me in the ambulance. I have little memory of the actual event, but the legal process (which ultimately resulted in a dismissal) was extremely stressful. The whole legal situation took over a year to resolve itself and during this period I was constantly faced with the possibility of a felony conviction. I was a college senior at the time and had a fairly prestigious internship. Although I somehow managed to get ""A"" grades in my classes and ultimately graduate, I felt ashamed about what had happened and quit my internship.  

Since my arrest I've struggled with motivation and have experiences a high level of anxiety and anger towards police officers and EMTs. 

It's almost to the point where I don't want to leave my house. I have been drinking regularly and even though I don't like it, I feel like I need to. 

My psychiatrist and therapist (two different people) haven't suggested PTSD, mainly (I think) because I am so good at composing myself in public. At home however, I can't sleep. I regularly recall the events that lead up to my arrest, and my anger flairs up every time I see a police car or ambulance. I'm not holding any conscious grudges against those involved, but my anxiety and anger towards these folks seems uncontrollable. 

I don't know how to shake this off... Is this consistent with PTSD or am I just obsessing over the situation?

""Ok"" *he looks it over* ""well do you have any questions I can answer?""

And this is where the train goes off the rails. I already have any information I want from researching them on the internet, so I always just ask them to tell me about their intern program. Well after 2 years, I already know how every company handles interns. I can't imagine proper eddiquette being to reply ""nope, I'd just really like a job, thanks""

The other most common question is ""tell me about yourself""

What the hell are they looking for from this question?? I usually just ramble about my interests for a couple minutes and let the conversation trail off.


Any and all advice fro what I can do to maximize my benefit from attending the event.

This is a business I have been testing the validity of, and am in the process of coming up with a minimum viable product (basically a wordpress site with forms)

The idea is that college students need work experience and money, and small businesses need marketing work that they do not have the time, resources, or money to pay a professional for.

The result is my idea of a StudentFueled project - something like a short term paid internship.  A business submits a form of their basic needs and budget, and students submit proposals with ways they can accomplish these goals for said budget. The small business picks a winning proposal and hires the students.

I would make a percentage of the final payout to the students.

I have already ran a few of these projects, and they worked out quite well for everyone - but now need to get more students involved in this chicken &amp; egg scenario.

Let me know what you think of the business - the site has plenty of things to pick apart but the goal now is to get students to sign up and receive alerts when projects are posted.

Thanks,"

I just recently discovered this sub, and could really use some guidance.

Apologies for the wall o' text but I feel context is important here.

So if you've got a few minutes, please give this a read and let me have your two cents.

**Where I've been...**

In the mid to late 2000's I was a successful salesman in the custom home market.  I sold building materials to contractors and made a decent living.  When the recession hit, I got nailed hard and lost my job and pretty much everything I had ever worked for.  I spent a couple of years ""in the bottle"" and more or less gave up on life.  Had to sell my house and move back in with my parents, who lived 500 miles away, for a while.

After a couple of years of wallowing in my own self-pity, I turned over a new leaf, cleaned up my act and enrolled in community college to pursue an associates in Computer Science with an emphasis in programming.  I decided rather than give up on life, I would go back to school and re-tool,hopefully set myself up for a new career. 

**Where I am now...**

I am currently in my third semester and have one more to go in the spring.  I am on track to have finished the associate's by May 2014.  I have a 4.0 GPA.

I'm just now getting into the programming languages this semester...
I am taking introductory courses in Java, Visual Basic, C++, SQL and a Web Development course.  At the moment I am two weeks ahead of everyone else in all my classes.

In previous semesters I took Database Management, Into to programming, intro to networking, and intro to computers.



**Where I want to go...**

Since I have no family, girlfriend, few friends, and don't own any property, I eventually want to get a gig that allows/requires me to travel.  I've always been a bit of a loner and like to travel, so the prospect of living out of a suitcase and hopping from hotel to hotel across the country actually appeals to me.

I want to work in development, but am open to the prospect of system admin work as well.

**Finally, the question...**

So... next semester I have to find a co-op opportunity, and even though that is still several months away... I want to get the ball rolling now if I can.  I'm hoping a good co-op can help me build a portfolio of work and can eventually allow me to transition into an actual career.

What's the best way to go about this?  Should I send out resumes and a cover letters to everyone I see? Should my cover letter just express my desires and a brief history of where I've been and where I'm going?

I know a lot of people also suggest building a website in lieu of making a resume, but I have no idea what to put on said website.  I mean my silly little assignments in Java, C++ etc so far are... well... just *dinky*.  I mean, they are very basic programs and there's not any ""meat"" to them.

I've looked on job websites at internships such as [this one](http://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=e498292c840e5cee&amp;qd=prVELsR6uh2dVYzQOB8jJ5amS7-BGIz_hqmou3SerZRkALqSkdqZLCty44fpCsy2nVpoYYgNsAIaRlYsDcO26bzak1KA3b4VoRhuded2n92Ir-swnCv91OsO5is0__06M2NeQbstNxO2U6DdKRN-7NiMwx1qqBX4KNTNrt_SjMjhJZoSEMVZCKocGeAwl1zwkpXg1_9ztdJ_-j9Z9Yc2sixB_63DCqyZZYZPu5b7rpc-Jj_wPZiYcvcxlGPPdOOGkFIxeY5TFDSaM3JLpQIS2lFwBAdAj9yQVK_0AlC_Ceb8yqJyMzImEAtRW-zm93CRLZihwUX_pZfykAS2GqcpPniOIP1cRG2nqlD7wQnuNOfFfZurA7UlodPXHa6IFPhgKxV0jXWzcY32HPY54-Y_zvofwevYbqo7jc_i3kbBRH5enaDRyC5_VpYbEg1fETvuRflZAHg0uQO2VFP1pcnPZUJnYiySb7cUIlPvs-dHBe1_oYEx6ZRBiseqeOz-n7SfGht4YDvpn7RpXXpyurbPlw&amp;chnl=eng&amp;rjs=1&amp;atk=18477obqh19v24mr&amp;utm_source=publisher&amp;utm_medium=organic_listings&amp;utm_campaign=affiliate),  but I feel like I'm not qualified to apply for co-ops like that one because I haven't had Javascript or C# yet... also I've never used Github.  Am I not ""far enough along"" yet to start applying for internships/co-ops?


... Jesus I typed a lot.

Here's a **TL;DR** - 30 something, lost job, career, life in the recession.  Battled alcoholism for a while, went to meetings and got sober, enrolled in community college for 2 year associate's.  Need to find a co-op for the spring semester.  Now... What should I do?  Am I being naive about my career goals?

Thanks for reading all of this."

-I do have one dim prospect of getting the debt collector job back, due to a change of circumstances too complex to go into here.

My school does not have a film program so I'm majoring in the closest thing possible; cinema studies and an individualized studies program which allows me to make a senior thesis film. Everything I know about film and filmmaking up to this point has been self taught through books and the web, watching a lot of films, watching directors commentaries, watching BTS, and most importantly, making films myself and finding myself on a lot on professional sets as a PA. I'm shooting a short film end of this month, a large scale production involving SAG and a lot of people on set, and, I'm not gonna lie, this is my first time on a serious project of which I'll be directing and I am incredibly nervous. I am breaking away from my usual filmmaking with couple of friends and using the Drama majors. 

That said, I am thinking about my future and I am really scared. Reality is hitting me hard and fast. What will I do after I graduate college? How am I going to pay back the thousands of dollars of student debt? I don't have a lot of experience in a different skill or trade, hell, I've invested so much time into filmmaking that I don't know anything else. Then there's the whole passion thing, which I don't feel like it's necessary to get into. But I AM really passionate about film.

 I'm trying to pile up on any unpaid internships for the moment, relating to the film industry, whether it be volunteering at a film festival, a casting agency, whatever. 

My main goal is to become a film director. Other career choices I have considered were DP, Writer, or Editor, but mainly being Director would be the dream. I know that it is a long and difficult road, and I know that I am still young. What should I be doing to achieve what I want? For the professionals out there, what did you go through and how did you get to where you are now?

edit; I also do some freelance videography stuff too, but my main focus is on narrative filmmaking.

I could get plenty of jobs, but how would I even know where to begin? I don't care about the money or the prestige. I just want to figure out what I want to do. I'm so envious of my friends who have their shit together, not because I'm jealous of their money or experiences, but because they have a next step.

I have finance friends, and they're lucky because they know they need to do internships and finish their degrees to get jobs. I have a hippie friend who is mainly interested in traveling the country and seeing music festivals, and so he sells shit on Etsy and drives around the country meeting people. 

It doesn't matter that I have no interest in biology, finance or being a hippie; at least my friends have a next step to take, even if that next step is difficult, time-consuming or expensive. I don't have a next step to take because I didn't plan right; I guess I thought I'd ""know,"" but the moment never came, and here I am with degrees in basically worthless subject matters.

I have been struggling with mental problems (depression, anxiety, paranoia) throughout my whole college career. I was lurking this sub, and saw the multitude of career help oriented posts. When I lurked inside the thread I saw that most everyone who responded was very over-achieverer like with the number of internships/research they did as an undergrad. That's definitely a quality I want, but have trouble initiating. I am almost done with my degree, and I still have no idea what field I want to pursue (my issue is that they are all interesting...). Now since the realization is setting in even if I figured out a career I would want to do I won't even be able to compete with the applicants- for grad school, internships, jobs. I haven't even been able to get a job (partly due to my issues with people). 
The reasoning behind me wanting a career to do with animals might be viewed as sort of insane but I am sure lots of people feel the same way as I. I feel closer to anything that’s not a human. I feel like humans ability to think and process kind of over rides the simple beauty of life. The only time an animal caused me pain is when I did something to make it act that way (stepping on my dogs tail = bite, or playing with a wasps nest = stung), however humans cause pain all the time whenever they please. Sure it’s myself allowing myself to feel the pain, but others provoke it. I missed the time to find friends in college where people were open, and yet again they cling onto their groups they formed 2 weeks into the beginning of college.  
Enough with my insane ramblings, and let’s get to the point. How am I supposed to compete with those who are genuinely brighter, more ambitious, and have the ability to sell themselves more?   When compared to my class mates throughout the 3 years of labs, and lecture I was always one of the last people to finish lab, one of the last people to turn in tests, one who spend the most time studying (within the group of people I interact with in class-lab partners neighbors) just to end up with mediocre grades compared to my peers. My assessment of these events may be partially skewed but I am certain with my amount of free time I should be obtaining A’s in everything or at least B’s, like I said I am not that bright. It could be my mental state is hindering my intellectual growth but..  If I could express my connection with other living things it could be a great selling feature (or really bad if someone thinks it’s stupid to be more connected to another species than their own) for me if I was ambitious and believed I could do some things. Alas, I am not ambitious and frankly I am pretty scared.  
How would I be able to convince someone to give me an opportunity when I have trouble believing I would be the best candidate for the job? So it stems all back to how can  I become one of the best candidates for a job if my grades aren’t that great,  if I have little connections with professors (I have issues with talking to these ""people"" since they are in control of your grades. If I have a bad interaction they might grade me more harshly.), if I haven’t had internships, if I haven’t participated in research?  So how can you get those opportunities if you are no longer an undergrad? Also what I think might help is how do you gain confidence in yourself if your results prove the opposite?

I apologize if this read was painful for you.

Tldr: Sorry idk how to format as I am mostly a lurker. How do you gain the experience you need to be a good candidate for a job in this field if you missed your opportunities to gain experience as an undergrad? Feels like that ship has set sail without me.

I got 2 job offers, and I am having trouble deciding between them. Here is a pros/cons list I made, I hope it can paint a picture of my situation:

**Job A**

* A remote position
* A bit higher pay
* Since it is a remote post, I am not required to relocate, and am able to keep expenses low
* I don't know much about the company, but from a brief interaction during the interview, it seems like a relaxed company, and have some challenging work (mostly contract works).

**Job B**

* On site-job
* The pay is a little bit lower
* I would have to relocate (but they would take care of the visa), and it would increase my expenses, but its nothing significant.
* I did an internship here for 6 months almost 2 years ago, and I know the people and the culture well. They are nice people, and I enjoy spending time with them. The work consists of mostly government contracts, but they are also working to get their own products on track.

Now, more about myself. I am currently single, with no real commitment to where I currently live. I live in Asia, if that matter.

As I see this is as my first job out of school, I would like to use the opportunity to learn as much as possible about the industry from the job, but I don't see myself staying in either company for more than 5 years. I don't see much in the way of moving up the corporate ladder, as both companies are rather small startups.

Where I live, the tech scene in basically doesn't exist, which is why I feel moving to where Job B is can be beneficial to my overall growth. On the other hand, I am pretty sure I would like to work on my own project with the intention of maybe growing it into something that can sustain my lifestyle, which can be helpful if I am working remotely with flexible hours.

Basically, I would to use my first job as a stepping stone to what I do in the future, and to find out what I would like to do in the future as well, maybe start my own company, maybe to travel the continents, I am not sure. I am hoping for advice and opinions from the experienced redditors, what would you do if you were in my position? Is there any angle that I am missing? Is there anything else that I should be considering?

I never thought I'd post here someday but here I am. 

Okay so I'm French, studying in France until December, and my girlfriend is from South America. She was an exchange student at first and didn't have any trouble to get a student visa. However, her exchange ended in may, and she immediately started an internship which will last until Christmas.

We have been together since March, and things were going alright until she renewed her working Visa last week. Basically she wants to go back to her country for X-Mas but she also wants to stay in France, for me, which raises two questions :

* If she doesn't get a job that extends her working visa, she'll have to go through the process all over again.

* If she does get a job, she'll certainly have to come back to France sooner than she planned

I'm proud that she wants to go through all this pain in this ass for me. But on the other hand, my country bores me and I need to get out and see for myself if the grass isn't greener elsewhere (on a job point of view).

I don't know how I should talk about this to her. I'm kinda lost and I need to talk about this to someone..

I'd really like to live and work in the UK for a while (not sure how long, but at least 3-5 years, with the eventual intention of applying for naturalisation/citizenship). 

Can anyone who's moved from the US to the UK or knows about the process/visa/etc give me any advice? I've looked into the Tier 2 visa options, but if anyone has done this process and has advice to share, I'd really appreciate it.

Here's some info that might be relevant, and feel free to ask any questions as well:

Nationality: American citizen

Age: 21

Education: 

* Currently 4th year student at an American university; will graduate May 2014 with BA in Business and International Relations

* For my 3rd year (Oct 2012 - June 2013) of university, I studied at a well-known and highly regarded institution in the UK

Job history/skills: 

* Past: two 3-4 month internships with technology companies doing technology writing (basically writing ""how to"" guides for using the Company's product/code/database/tool/etc) with reliable references

* Current: Year-long internship (ending in May 2014) with a technology company creating technology documentation/best practices and sales strategy

Savings: a little over $30,000 [plus potential parental support :)]

Language skills: English and conversational Spanish

Criminal convictions: None

Are you willing to consider alternative destinations? No

Temporary or permanent? Permanent

Reason for moving: Really enjoyed living/studying in the UK last year and could realistically see me making a life there. Fit much better with the cultural/societal values and customs of the UK than the US (Several people thought I was joking when I told them I was American!). I also have a large network of friends and colleagues who live in the UK and could potentially help me find a job there. 

****************************************

What are my best options for living in London upon graduating university? As this is my last year at university, I'm investigating recruitment options with companies in the US and the UK. Will UK employers even consider me as an American/recent grad?

The company for which I'm currently interning also has offices in London,  and I do like the company, so I wouldn't mind staying with it. Would it be easiest look for jobs in London with this company or take a US job with the company and then try to get a transfer to London a bit later?

I do have the option of going to London in December this year for interviews, if that would help.

I'm also open to the option of completing a master's degree in the UK and looking for a job from there.

Sometimes people might be surprised at how things end up being the way I wanted - and I even get surprised myself - but it is only because I've carefully planned on any possibility.   
Good and bad. Kind of having plan A to Z if you might say so.  
However, despite of all the plans, I can end up in situations that I never even expected or thought about (an AZ situation? Maybe a XYZ? Something else really) which makes me enter in panic because I cannot counter them.   
I get trapped in a turmoil of thoughts and despair because I was stupid enough *not* to think on that possibility and thus not have anything for said situation.  
  
Now that such explanation is out, allow me to explain the title.  
Ever since I was little, I had planned my life. . kind of.  
I had decided where to study, what to have and skills to achieve.  
I managed to graduate from the University I wanted and without debt, I consider myself smart and blah blah blah.  
My parents support me - even though I can find them a bit annoying and conservative. . only sometimes - and I have friends who also support me.  
  
Thing is, right now I am at a stage where things seem to go not as planned.  
I couldn't get a job just after graduating and it took me 2 years to get the one I have. My average pay is roughly 120 USD a week as an intern (before you start with your pitchforks, I don't live in the US or any of the so called '1st world nations') which is less than what I might need to move out from my parents home (which I had planned to do so by the age of 25.. which would come around in November).  
I have planned to create a business with the money I'd be saving with my job but with groceries and other things I could buy, it's not really worth saving or anything that I could save would not be enough.  
I'm also a . . well, just look at my username. I'm supposed to be drawing but I am not exactly the best artist. I pretty much consider my art half assed shit. My writing isn't better given the ESL status.  
All what I wanted at this point of my life: a good job, a nice place to live, being able to have time to draw/write and be myself can't be so because .. well, I don't know.  
  
I know I should be grateful to be living with my parents at a nice home and have a nice place to stay.  
I know I should be grateful I earn enough money to spend and hang out with people, eat and buy the food I like.  
I know I should be happy that I'm doing something in my life.  
  
Thing is, I'm at a point of despair: I don't think I will accomplish any of my goals.    
All that preparation from back then - the school, the classes, the extra books I read, the skills I learned, etc - are worthless and useless.  
I feel worthless, pretty much. I can't even earn what a regular Engineer in this city earns.  
I'm stuck. I wish I could do more and slowly I am starting to feel that 'adult decay' I feared since I was little.  
  
That decay were they realize their dreams or goals can't be true and you are better off accepting your fate and shut the fuck up.    
  
""This is reality. Reality is shit. Stop whining and take it like a man. Fuck off already. Nothing you did could prepare you for this shit.""   
  
Somebody mentioned already that I should move out of my area of comfort but, since I'm too scared to do anything due to my unpreparedness and phobia of failing I don't know what to do.  
  
I am not alone but I feel alone.  
I just wish I could do more and earn a bit more.    
See if my dreams can come true.

 I study in a very specific field with a lot of work, but very few employer. You usually get most (if not all.) of your offering trough networking. For one specific company the competition is going to be very hard an d everybody is throwing themselves at that position.

 I had an inside tip that they are looking to hire two persons of my promotion, needless to say that they are going to be way more applicant than available position.

One person said that her father use to work for that company and she basically has a free pass in the interview process and she is sure that she is going to be hired right after her internship. I personally think that, even tought she is not that bad in school, she is very (and i mean very) annoying to work with.

I don't need to go into detail here, but let's just say that she is the coworker no one wants to have next to his desk but won't screw up enough to be fired or let go.

 I may have an inside reference in the company to, but it's very limited and his not something i can really count on. Yet it is an option to keep in mind.

If i go to the internship at the company or if, at the very least, I am consider for an interview how can I prove that i'm the better candidate and, in the long run, i'm the more fun to work with.

 I just don't know how to approach this situation at all and I will take any advice.

I was on an internship and traveled home on the weekends. I left early Monday morning (Up at 3 to leave at 4 to get there by 8AM) like I had the many times previously. 

I got through the first leg of my trip fine, listening to music as I always did. The same for the second leg of the trip (roughly 50 and 100 Miles respectively). The beginning of the third leg is when I started to get tired. My eyes got heavy but I pushed on because I figured I would wake up more as the sun came up (it was summer so by 6AM it was bright). 

For just a second, I closed my eyes and fell asleep. I went from the right lane to the left, and was stirred by the sound of the rumble strips on either side of the highway. By this time is was too late for corrective action to remain on the highway, and my car went off the road onto the downward sloping grass. I was immediately fully awake now, hearing thousands of tiny rocks and dirt being kicked up by my car wheels going 75. 

I was lucky though, I maintained enough mental control and didn't slam on the brakes or swerve. I calmly steered back toward the highway and sure enough, the car started to go back. At this point the back end of my car began to over-steer and exceed the front end so I'm now traveling (60?) sideways. It wasn't until this point that I thought I was going to die. I uttered but one word through the whole ordeal: ""Shit"". As I continued sideways, I knew I was going to flip once all four wheels hit the highway. The front two were already squealing and I knew the back two were only milliseconds behind. Then my life was saved by a mile marker. I slammed into the mile marker with the rear drivers door of my car. This completely counteracted the momentum the rear had gained over the front end of my car and jerked me back on a straight track, now traveling roughly (30?)

Once on the road, I came to a stop and got out. I wasn't shaking, or anything. But I was awake then. I inspected my car for flat tires, cracked rims but nothing. Nothing but a large dent in the side of my car from the mile marker I had knocked over. 

Since that time, I obviously have not driven while tired, taking a break and stretching if I even got a slight bit tired. The other side effect is that I am now questioning my life; am I on the path I want to be? Am I in a relationship that is good for both my girlfriend and myself? Are we heading the same direction? What is it that I want in life before I die because I only get one chance, and I nearly lost it that morning. "

It's a god awful class that's only 50 minutes long and the tests make up 70 percent of the grade. I did so poorly on my first test that I 'd need to make an 85 just to get a 71 in that course. It's the first class I've ever dropped and I feel really shitty about it. I'm a transfer student so the little inconsistencies in my schedule made it so I could only take 3 classes my first semester here and now I'm down to two

The thing is I'm not sure if it's the professor or the subject matter. I'm OK at math but this 50 minute long lecture format just isn't working. The professor is notorious for failing students, turning classes of 30 into classes of 10 with only 4 taking the final.

It doesn't actually affect me in terms of how quickly I graduate since none of my comp sci courses actually need this class as a requirement. In retrospect I should have just taken discrete math and been done with it. I think what I'm probably going to do is take that discrete math next semester along with more comp sci classes and the last two classes I need to finish up my minor and then try to work an internship over the summer. I'm just really stick of being a student, I had to take a year and a half long break to save up tuition money so I wouldn't graduate with any debt but I don't want to graduate before I'm 24 and I'm afraid that because of my age, as silly as it sounds, prospective employers will brush me over for the 21 or 22 year old graduates.

Not even the institution I did my practicum for - where, I should add, my supervisor said I was the best intern she' had - called me back when I applied for a low-level position there.

This latest particular rejection was disappointing because I felt the interview went well and that both the organization and the position were so closely tied to my area of interest. It would have been an amazing place to grow professionally and I would have been able to make even more contacts. It was an international opportunity which was exciting too.

Now I feel like I'm back at the start.

I spent 6 years in school to become involved in this field. I know it's a bad time - because funding has been slashed to our field and people are getting laid off all the time. But, still, the knowledge that I can't even get an internship is so heartbreaking. It really was bottom of the barrel in terms of entry level. How do I keep applying to things knowing I can't even get something as inconsequential as an internship level position.

I'm starting to worry about feeling bitter.

I just wanna focus on my defence but I feel like I'm going crazy about yet another disappointing rejection. I'm 24 and I'll be moving back in with my parents at the end of the month because I can't find work. I feel like I haven't accomplished anything in life and I made all the wrong choices."

I'm not sure whether I have a question, just need to write out my thoughts, or what... but I could use perspective on my situation. Sorry for the wall of text!


So here's the situation. My ex and I dated for a few months short of 3 years. We met in college and had a fun and loving relationship. He was my first serious boyfriend, my first love, and we had (have) a ton of common interests and had really great times together. Things weren’t always perfect, and we broke up twice before. The first break up was after a year of dating, he wasn’t sure he wanted to be together, didn’t want to miss out on the college experience (and other girls), whatever. We ended up getting back together after a few tearful conversations. Things were going pretty well, and we ended up breaking up a year later because neither of us wanted to do long distance while he was away for an internship over the summer. Well, we wound up talking almost every day and got back together soon after he moved back. 


Things again were great between us after that, until I got closer to graduation. I graduated in May, got a great full time position in my field right after graduation, and he has another semester left in college. I started to feel like our relationship was like a ticking time bomb, because I was so uncertain about what would happen when he graduated. We both agreed we wouldn’t want to do long distance, but we did talk about eventually being together in the same city, depending on where he found a job. Even still, nothing was certain and we hadn’t fully committed to staying together after college. I hated feeling like our relationship had an expiration date. 


Fast forward to 2.5 months ago, he visited me for a weekend (he was living in a different state for the summer for another internship. We agreed to give a LDR a try this time). That Sunday he tells me that he has decided he wants to go to grad school after graduation, and would most likely move to a different state (Colorado or somewhere on the West coast) for school. He also says he isn’t sure what he wants out of a relationship. I tell him that I don’t want to delay the inevitable, and that we should break up since he clearly doesn’t see a future with me and we were headed for a break up come December anyway. It was a REALLY hard thing to do. The breakup was incredibly difficult and it hurt so badly to know he didn’t want to include me in his future plans. I maintained NC except for a few conversations which happened several weeks apart. I spent the time since the breakup thinking critically about the relationship, working on moving on, and trying to better myself. 


Recently, he’s moved back to town to finish school, and last Sunday we ended up at the same friend’s house to watch football. We ended up talking about school, work, life, etc. I handled it totally fine, but the next day all the emotions rushed back to me. Yesterday we met up to talk again, this time about the relationship instead of just catching up, and it’s left me feeling very conflicted. He told me that he is sure that he wants to be with me, and is worried that he will end up not moving away and that he’ll have screwed everything up by breaking up over a move that never happened. He still seems unsure about his own future, but now somehow is so certain he wants to be with me, when several months ago he was uncertain about what he even wanted from the relationship. I told him that I thought we should continue to be apart, work on ourselves and think about things, and that we should revisit the conversation in a few months. That’s the jist of the conversation. 


So, I am conflicted because I was feeling okay about the break up, I had accepted it…but now I know he doesn’t want to be broken up. And I’m not sure if getting back together in a couple months is a good idea, considering our history of breaking up and getting back together. Granted, we are older now and more mature, but I’m worried I’ll get hurt all over again. 


I hope that makes sense. If I left out any important information, please let me know. I’m just really confused. I am planning on continuing to do my own thing for the next couple months, but I want to know if I am doing the right thing to consider getting back together. Thoughts? Opinions? Thank you for reading.

Anyways my TA's are encouraging me to go to the career fair next week even though my experience is non-existent. If I just put high school activities on my resume and tell the people at the career fair that I'll have taken three CS courses by the end of freshman year will I have a chance of at least landing a internship at a start up? Here's a [list](http://cns.utexas.edu/images/CNS/Career_Design_Center/PDFs/Fall_2013_Expo_Employers.pdf) of companies that are coming to my school. Any help is appreciated!

I'm trying to apply for a software dev/GIS internship before I graduate... It's more focused on GIS over programming stuff since most of the jobs I am applying for will incorporate both..

Thanks!

How would you all suggest I do so? Should I call? Who should I call, the recruiting manager or the partner who called me and gave me the offer? Is it less professional to send an email?

To clarify I have two internship opportunities for next summer. I worked for the firm that I am declining last summer. I just want to try a different environment and a different service line before I commit. Any advice you can give me is appreciated.

One of the thing I've been noticing is that there seems to be a good amount of legal opportunities that seem well within reach; they are just extremely underpaid. 

For example in one local county there are 46 assistant DA positions for the Spring! I am awear that the starting salary is only $36,000. However I'm wondering of instead if you think about this as a paid internship it doesn't sound that bad. Working in a DAs office is not the dream job at Ropes and Grey, or Derp and Derpina, but it's also not as demanding. 

For full disclosure I'm still a 2L. I've just been thinking lately that maybe for most of us we need to put in our dues at places like District Attorny offices and public defenders to be able to eventually land our dream jobs. 

This very well may be the wrong way to look at it. I'm curious to see what you all think. "
1m69hf,1,2013-09-11,Needing stimulants to do anything.,Soup501,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1m69hf/needing_stimulants_to_do_anything/,"My story is kind of a long one, but I'm going to try to condense it and make it a bit readable to see if I can get some meaningful responses, as I really need them.

My history with depression/anxiety is a long, winding, exhausting one. 

I remember the day that it started, I was on my road bike, on a long sunday ride that usually turns out to be a grueling, tough ride. I had noticed that I was not able to breathe in fully and take a long, satisfying sigh as I was usually able to do whenever I needed, this was my first sign.

Later that day, I tried to have my usual Sunday afternoon nap, but I was not able to fall asleep and noticed my heart beating faster and a lot harder than usual. It was a weird feeling and an odd incident since I was always able to nap like a baby after bike rides. This was my second sign.

Later through that summer (which was the summer of 2011) I noticed that I was developing anxiety, was not able to sleep consistently, noticed my heart pounding through my chest for no reason, being nervous about insignificant things and the such.

I was prescribed Xanax to help with my sleeping (which helped, but gave me nightmares and I was nervous about getting dependent on medication) but stopped after a month or so of taking it at night to sleep.

Then came the depression. It slowly built up, and it came out of nowhere. I had nothing to be sad about, I was doing well in school, I had a beautiful girlfriend that deeply cared about me, my parents gave and still give me support whenever I need it, and I have two brothers which I love (but we're not extremely close, I guess you could say.)

I was getting sad for no reason at the most random times. I would get excited about doing something, but then when I had the chance to do it, I was not excited to do it anymore and would cease doing said activity.

The biggest example of this was my piloting lessons. I currently have 36.4 hours toward my Private Pilot License and my goal in life was to end up being a Commercial Pilot flying airliners for one of the major airlines, and I was dead set on it. When I first started taking lessons, I was extremely excited, and couldn't wait for the next time I could step foot into the little Cessna 172 and continue the training.

Eventually though, that excitement turned into more of a chore, something I forced myself to do, realizing the depression had turned it from a hobby, into something I thought exciting, and when I was actually flying the plane, wanted to just stop and go home.

This depression crept into every aspect of my life, including my girlfriend, my family life, my social life, everything.

At one point during last summer/fall(2012) I was finding my brain exploring thoughts about - ""How fucked up would it be if I shot myself?"" and I would picture myself holding up a gun to my head and thinking ""Fuck, that would be crazy, fuck that.""

Even though I could rationalize to myself that it would be incredibly stupid to shoot myself, I couldn't explain why these thoughts were creeping in to my head.

Along with those thoughts, thoughts like ""You should break up with your girlfriend. You're not going to marry her, you could find someone better. Break up with her."" were constantly in my head, and I had no explanation as to why. I was extremely content with my girlfriend, we were one and the same, we understood each other, we enjoyed each other's company, but for some reason, when I was doing something not even remotely related to her, these thoughts would creep in time after time.

Finally, we come to the title of this post, and one of the reasons why I'm asking for help here.

I find myself needing stimulants to get excited about anything, or even be able to force myself to tolerate doing something, be it school, home work, talking to my family, communicating with my friends, anything.

I was doing an IT internship at the Department of Veteran Affairs in DC this summer and found myself needing to hop myself up on coffee to go talk with a user that needed help, or to get the energy to keep working every day.

Now, after school or work, I find myself rushing home for no reason, because once I get there, I'm back to being extremely anxious and depressed because I haven't hung out with friends (granted, they're busy with school and their social lives too), I have no one to talk to (my girlfriend decided that she had had enough, and she has way more than her fair share to deal with regarding her family situation as well, so I can't fault her)

It's like I want to hang out with friends or research an interesting programming or computer science subject, but when I actually start doing it, I get anxious/depressed enough so that I want to stop doing it and just go back to bed or do nothing.

This needing an external stimulant to feel regular, happy, or motivated has been going on for about a year now, and I'm sick and tired of it. I want to be able to wake up, feel like going for a run or to the gym, and keep motivated throughout the entire workout or run, and not feel like just giving up, going back home and doing nothing.

This need for an external stimulant has caused me some problems with alcohol, meaning that I tend to overdrink to ""try and keep the buzz going"" which often leads to drinking a little too much, or when I stop, I come back down to earth to the same depression and anxiety.

I am currently on paxil and have been on it since February, and it has helped me sleep, and also suppressed a lot of the anxiety part of my condition, but not completely. I still feel depressed a lot of the times, or lacking motivation to do anything, while toning down a lot of the other emotions such as happiness, sadness, etc. I feel like I am a robot who is just 'eh' about everything, not happy, not sad, not excited, just not having any emotions.

I have visited my school's psychiatrist and I was visiting her once a week before my summer internship, but I have not been back since school started. I'm still not sure if it helped or not. It helped being able to talk about what I feel, but some of the suggestions she was giving me, my brain categorized as being 'dumb' and 'useless' so I quickly forgot about them after the session and thus never implemented any of the techniques she had suggested.

Can anybody give me some other advice that I can use to get me out of this seemingly endless hole that I am in? I know it's mild compared to what others are going through, but I just can't stand this 'eh' feeling any more."

Anyone want to impart wisdom to a confused math student..??,ab1618033,femalefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1m683g/first_time_posting_anyone_want_to_impart_wisdom/,"Hello r/femalefashionadvice! I am in DIRE need of advice.

I am in my senior year of college, and I have come to the sudden heartbreaking realization that my major is NOT what I want to do in life. (What a convenient time, I know. -.-) I was originally a mathematics major, but I spend every passing moment out of class (and sometimes in..hence my mediocre grades) on fashion blogs, lookbook.nu, etc. However it had never occurred to me that others aren't as obsessed as I am, and normal people don't save endless clothing sets or outfits to their phone gallery to browse through later. 

I've decided to dive headfirst into fashion, but I have absolutely no idea where to start. So far I've created a lookbook.nu account (after 6+ years of creeping) and put together a few sets on Polyvore (the collage tool is amazing, and the worst thing I could find before exams D:). 

For those of you working in or towards fashion, what do  you do or aspire to do in the future? What skills do your career entail, and what are the upsides/downsides? Most importantly, what advice do you have for someone with absolutely no fashion experience on my resume and is desperately searching for internships to figure out the rest of my life!?

I would seriously appreciate any kind of advice here, the more honest, the better. I'm sure I'm just one out of millions with the omg-I'm-entering-the-real-world type crisis, but if you could help a lost student regardless, I will be eternally grateful!

1m6759,2,2013-09-11,Getting back into a specific engineering sector after years away,thwg0809,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/1m6759/getting_back_into_a_specific_engineering_sector/,"I had the most excellent timing of getting out of undergrad in 2008, studied Civil with a focus on structural. The prospects were few and far between, so I stayed in and got my MSCE with specialization in structural the next year. I looked for structural positions as my main focus, but zilch. I ended up taking a job in the oil field, and two years later took a job in project controls for an civil/environmental firm. I hate being an accountant. I had two great structural internships during school, but frankly haven't touched code or a design program since '09.  

Now I'm really trying to get back to structural, but I am having a hell of a time. I've gotten a couple calls, but I can't get around the fact that I'm 4 years removed from the work I'm applying for. I spin it with ""although it hasn't been structural, I have stayed in engineering positions."" (Between you and me, that's bullshit, but the word engineer has always been in my title, so it works with recruiters) Even applying to entry level positions, I can tell the concern is it's just been too long to get back in it. I have no doubt I'll pick it back up fairly quickly, but I know I'll be rusty for a bit. 

Has anyone had success getting back into a design role years removed? Any suggestions for convincing companies I haven't forgotten 5 years of my life just because I haven't practiced lately?"

[If you don't mind, how much do you make? Do you get as many hours as you'd like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4tys/iama_costco_food_court_employee_ama/cc5swp4?context=5)|I don't mind at all. I just started so I'm at the base pay of all employees, $11.50 an hour plus time and a half on Sundays. They are required to give me 24 hours a week as a part time employee. Costco is the job paying my bills while I pursue my real passion and they're nice enough to work around an internship like thing I have somewhere else. They personally give me too many hours right now but once we get the even newer folks trained I'll have it a little easier and they'll get the hours I don't want as much. 
[I got a question, why does the food court only accept cash?  How did you get your job there? did you just walk in and apply or did you know someone right there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4tys/iama_costco_food_court_employee_ama/cc5u8x6?context=5)|It only accepts cash or check because we sell things really close to not making any actual profit in the Food Court. The primary role the Food Court is there is to be a good face for the company. We'll sell you a hotdog and soda for $1.50, same price since 1991 btw, and make 8 cents per sale, just so your last experience before leaving is one of a pleasant cashier treating you well and giving you a good deal. At least, that's the spiel my boss gave me. But yeah, the credit card companies take a percent of all transactions, though minute they would really cut into our profits. My boss showed me the sales charts for a few weeks and explained this to me and showed me that they pay us around 25-35% of the profit for the week.
[*They do drug test btw.*  That's disappointing. Costco seems like a good company otherwise.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4tys/iama_costco_food_court_employee_ama/cc65vir?context=5)|It was a saliva test in my state and super easy to pass. They don't test randomly after that one.  
[Costco hot dogs: Awesome or really awesome?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4tys/iama_costco_food_court_employee_ama/cc5s0us?context=5)|I like the Polish sausage more, there's more flavor. 
[What's the best thing about working there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4tys/iama_costco_food_court_employee_ama/cc5tlzj?context=5)|I don't want to sound like a commercial but I can't one best thing. The pay is great for a starter job, $11.50/hr plus 1.5 times pay/hr on Sundays. The [benefits](http://www.costcobenefits.com/) are awesome. Plus the people I work with are cool, my boss is pretty nice.
[What's the worst?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4tys/iama_costco_food_court_employee_ama/cc5tlzj?context=5)|The worst is definitely how busy we are. Where Walmart would put 6 people and pay them $7.50/hr Costco puts 3 or 4 and pay them what they do and give them what they do. It's worth it but tiring. Plus personally I have been so busy I haven't had much time to spend with friends due to them scheduling me around an unpaid second job in the field I'm actually passionate about, theatre.
[How difficult is it to get a job there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4tys/iama_costco_food_court_employee_ama/cc5tlzj?context=5)|I've been told it's tough but I somehow lucked out by jumping on at the beginning of a big hiring spree my local warehouse went on for some reason. There is a 90 day probationary period where they don't have to give you warnings before choosing to let you go but I made it passed mine. Then you're basically there as long as you don't do anything terrible.
[What are your opportunities for advancement and how much of a raise do they come with?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4tys/iama_costco_food_court_employee_ama/cc5tlzj?context=5)|I'm not too sure about this but all of my managers and supervisors all started at the bottom of the totem pole like me. Every 400 hours or so I get a pay increase of 25¢.
[Would you eat there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4tys/iama_costco_food_court_employee_ama/cc5s23k?context=5)|I do. 
[You may kiss the bride.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4tys/iama_costco_food_court_employee_ama/cc5zlao?context=5)|[I'm so happy](http://cdn.alltheragefaces.com/img/faces/large/happy-cuteness-overload-l.png)
[Why the fuck is your poutine so goddam good?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4tys/iama_costco_food_court_employee_ama/cc5y7hl?context=5)|Goddamit I wish we had poutine in my food court. Or my country.
[I'm telling you get your ass to Canada and have some. Come to one in BC and I'll buy it for you!!! Is out of this world good!!!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4tys/iama_costco_food_court_employee_ama/cc5ypr1?context=5)|If I ever go there I'll let you know haha. 
[I always hear people say Costco is awesome to their employees. I think you actually answered what your hourly is, but you also mentioned time and half Sundays and other benefits. What is your actual take home and how many hours do you work a week for it? How quickly does your pay move up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4tys/iama_costco_food_court_employee_ama/cc5zch2?context=5)|I get paid every 2 weeks. We had a couple weeks were my boss needed me to do nearly a full 40 hour week and I made $824 that pay period.
[Why did you guys get rid of the pretzel? :(](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4tys/iama_costco_food_court_employee_ama/cc5usot?context=5)|I didn't. 
[I guess the combo will do for now.. but i really do miss that parmesan pretzel. I cant believe costco could have taken it off the menu seeing how many times i used to buy it ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4tys/iama_costco_food_court_employee_ama/cc5w6t3?context=5)|You can leave a comment in the member comment box by the door asking for it back people do read them. 
[I personally don't care for the hot dogs. They are too red and my brain thinks ""dye, chemicals, nasty.""  I do, however, want to know: (1\) why are the churros are so delicious? Don't deny that Costco puts an addictive chemical in their churros that makes ya crave them fortnightly.   (2\) What customer pet peeve sets your teeth on edge?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4tys/iama_costco_food_court_employee_ama/cc5uv2f?context=5)|1) I don't know haha. I've yet to buy one.  2) There's one guy that keeps asking for whipped cream on the coffee drink and I keep telling him we don't have that. He calls me by name when I'm in the back making pizzas even, saying I told him there was whipped cream to my boss. It's annoying. I don't like overtly rude members either. 
[How do you know which hotdog has been in there for 3mins and which one has been in there for 3hrs?? don't they all look the same??](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4tys/iama_costco_food_court_employee_ama/cc64j0a?context=5)|1st, they have to be in the water for at least 5 minutes to be up to proper temp.
 |2nd, the newer ones and older ones are segregated with a metal thingy.
 |3rd, no hotdog should be in the water for over an hour but that's one of the loosest rules.
[Do you have poutines in the American Costco food courts? They are my favourite shared lunch here in Canada. Just enough for two and loads more curds than anywhere else.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4tys/iama_costco_food_court_employee_ama/cc5y6uk?context=5)|No but I really wish we did now. 
[How is the pizza made?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4tys/iama_costco_food_court_employee_ama/cc5uykh?context=5)|We get frozen dough balls and put them in containers with olive oil, let them thaw by the ovens. When we need to make a pizza we press the dough out with an automated press, then we stretch it onto a pan, dock it (poke a bunch of holes in it) then sauce and cheese it. After that it depends on what you order. Everything is precisely measured. 
[What kinds of pizza do you have and in what portions can I order it? I know of: cheese, pepperoni, sausage, veggie, combo, and 1/2 pizza divisions. Is there anything else I'm missing out on? Is there anything else that can be ordered another way that I don't know about it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4tys/iama_costco_food_court_employee_ama/cc5yokq?context=5)|That's the only kinds of pizza you can get. You can get it in 3rds as well. In the morning, in order to have 2 big slices of each we make what's called a ""Tri-Pie"" which is 1/3 cheese, 1/3 pep, and 1/3 combo. You can get caesar dressing on the side with your chicken bake. You can get sauerkraut for the hot dogs. You can ask for a yogurt cup for water if the small ones are too little. 
[Thank you!! followup: the chicken bake already has caesar dressing baked into it right?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4tys/iama_costco_food_court_employee_ama/cc602gh?context=5)|Yup yup. 
[My wife gets a side of kraut for her slice of cheese!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4tys/iama_costco_food_court_employee_ama/cc631us?context=5)|She's what we in the industry call, ""A Freak"". Haha nah I'm just kidding, whatever floats her boat.
[In the chopped onion dispenser, do you guys chop the onions yourselves or do you just load up bagged pre-chopped onions from the chopped onion factory?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4tys/iama_costco_food_court_employee_ama/cc5w56y?context=5)|We use bagged but we've run out by accident and had to chop them by hand after buying them in store. 
[You guys are so awesome. I've completely eliminated super market shopping because of how great Costco is. The best part is how people that work there are actually working, and not being useless sacks of shit like in my supermarket.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4tys/iama_costco_food_court_employee_ama/cc692ui?context=5)|How does the management interact with employees? They're great. They are always happy to answer questions and work things out with you. They've all been at the bottom of the totem pole like you.
[My question is - what's the behind the scenes environment like? How does the management interact with employees? What part of the store do you work in? Where would you want to work? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4tys/iama_costco_food_court_employee_ama/cc692ui?context=5)|What's the behind the scenes environment like? Just like any other job. We joke around and get our work done.   What part of the store do you work in? Like the title says, food court.  Where would you want to work? I have a second unpaid job with a theatre company and that's my true passion. Costco just pays my bills and nicely works around the theatre schedule. 
[How much flavoring does the pizza sauce have? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4tys/iama_costco_food_court_employee_ama/cc5vmz5?context=5)|I'm not sure. I just mix two bags with warm water. 
[Wha'ts your salary? how old are you? hows hte background check at costco?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4tys/iama_costco_food_court_employee_ama/cc651ls?context=5)|11.50/hr, 23, I'm not sure because I had a good background.
[Did you get fingerprinted?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4tys/iama_costco_food_court_employee_ama/cc67ehc?context=5)|No. 
[Does your food court have the french fries? Best quantity and quality for normal fast food fries in my opinion. So disappointing that a lot of food courts don't have it :(](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4tys/iama_costco_food_court_employee_ama/cc61ie0?context=5)|Nope. I wish we did so I could have some but glad we don't so I don't have to prepare them. 
[What are your long-term career goals?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4tys/iama_costco_food_court_employee_ama/cc6d3gv?context=5)|To one day own, write for, and perform in a theatre company. 
[This thread is making me want to drive to Costco just for lunch. But I don't have any cash so that's gonna save me the trip for now.  Do the non-employee food sample presenter people resent the actual employees? (Since they don't get paid as well or get benefits.\) How's the relationship there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4tys/iama_costco_food_court_employee_ama/cc676ck?context=5)|Excellent... mwahahaha the plan is working. But I don't know. They always seemed nice to me.
[Do they really look after their employees as well as Reddit thinks they do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4tys/iama_costco_food_court_employee_ama/cc666uv?context=5)|I've only been here since May but I'd say so.
[Can I eat at the food court without being a member?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4tys/iama_costco_food_court_employee_ama/cc6fla8?context=5)|No. 
[I'm surprised by this answer. I'll ask a different way: Have you ever required anybody to prove they were a member before selling them food? Because I've never been asked to show a member card before paying at the deli.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4tys/iama_costco_food_court_employee_ama/cc6sc21?context=5)|We don't check your membership card unless you're paying with check. But you shouldn't be using the food court if you're not a member. Similarly to what I said in another post, the food court is the least profitable department but has the highest number of sales. It is meant to be a service to our members.
 |Edit: typo.
[Don't worry about the rant. I don't understand the hate that you guys get. The Costco food court always has a non-stop queue of customers whenever I go. Do you guys ever have little traffic? (Maybe weekday working hours\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4tys/iama_costco_food_court_employee_ama/cc6qscr?context=5)|Thanks. We have slow days on occasion but have to fill the downtime with cleaning and prepping and what not. 
[I eat a slice of pizza (or 2\) every time we go there. I just wish you guys had a meat lovers type pizza like Sams Club. Can you make that happen?!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4tys/iama_costco_food_court_employee_ama/cc67nih?context=5)|Put it in the suggestion box. You can order a whole pizza with just pep and sausage. 
[Why aren't there churros on the menu anymore?! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m4tys/iama_costco_food_court_employee_ama/cc67ieb?context=5)|They're still at my store.

So I currently got an internship on a tropical island a few hours of Australia. I'm trying to decide whether or not to buy a PS3/TV to put in my room for my days off/night times.

Thing is its unpaid internship with a chance of a job at the end of the 12 week intern period, although not guaranteed. So what might happen is I'll have to move off the island with all this stuff.

How much should I leave for myself? My parents have ~35k saved for me through RESP (university fund) and are planning to bring it up to 50k at the end of this year. 

I have set my mind on attending university for Computer Science, and the school I am planning on going to has the best co-op (internship) program in the country. It will be paid, and I would be able to use the money from there to pay off expenses and debts. I am planning to live as frugally, but healthy as possible in university.

Almost 2 years ago I did an internship at company A where it was my first proper job that was in line with my career. I had tons of fun because I was doing real work on real systems

At the beginning of this year I felt like a new endeavour and went into a graduate position at company B

After 9 months of work, company A approaches me and offers up a 25% pay rise and a week of extra leave a year. I decide to leave and rejoin company A because:
 
* More pay
* more holidays 
* more relaxed dress code
* I had fun when i was there
* more international opportunities
* training and development was on par or better with company B

Ive been at company A for a week and I'm hating it. Even after the first few hours I was hating it. I had never had a boring day before i went back to company A, and now i realise how much more enthusiastic i was about the projects at company B. I still acknowledge that company A will put me in a better position to move sideways, upwards and overseas; but im unsure if pushing through boredom is worth the potential internal career development. It really took working at company B to realise how mundane the work at company A was.

Now, company B quite liked me. Before I left, my manager told me that the door was always open (in fact, he waged with me that i'd be back after 2 months). I want to move back, but I feel like i'm letting company A down AND grovelling back to company B after leaving them so early. 

Can anyone give me some advice? I don't want to hear how stupid I was for leaving in the first place, I just need some advice from people with similar experiences (or knowledge in the matter) and how it might affect my career in the future.

We got off to a good start, flirting together and stuff, holding hands for a long time, but never really doing anything past that. While we go to the same school, she's at an internship away from campus for this semester. 

I know the smartest thing for me to do is just do my own thing since she's having fun at the place she's at, too, but I really like this girl a lot. The night before we left to go to our separate places for the semester, we flirted with each other a lot. Here's the thing though: a friend I know is really close friends with her but he's also close with me. I told him to kind of help me out but he let slip to her that I'm into her, so she knows that I'm into her now. 

My question is, what do I do in this situation? My plan was to just forget about her for now and try to make moves next semester when she's back at school but now that she knows that I'm into her, I'm not sure what I should do. I guess it doesn't really change what I should do? The good thing though is she didn't seem to be annoyed or disgusted when my friend told her that I'm kinda into her. I guess this is a good sign? Should I just not text her at all and just wait until next semester to have any kind of contact with her?

TLDR: Girl I like and had relatively good start with is away for the semester, but knows that I like her because of my friend accidentally slipping that I'm into her. She doesn't seem to be against the idea of us dating however from her reaction to what my friend said. What should I do? Should I just not make contact with her and wait until next semester when she comes back to make any kind of moves? "

I've had a really great streak this past week, I've had 2 k-closes, and 3 new girls numbers, 2 of whom I've been texting pretty successfully. This one I am much more invested in but can't quite figure out on my own.

She lives in my cousins' dorm across the hall, so I approached her when I was visiting. Her door was open so I knocked on it and went in to introduce myself. Not many important details of the conversation but I kept it light and funny, talking about where she lived and throwing in some contextual jokes, talking about her major and teasing her. Leave to do my own thing with the cousin. Come back later and get her number.

Text a little bit the next day, just talking about how I got this interview for an internship and about her job, and how much she has to read for it, etc.

Today I text and ask her if she'd like to go to a salsa lesson in two days at this cool bar I've been going to the past couple weeks. Before knowing the time she says she has a student org meeting so she wont be able to. I do know she's really busy with school, and it is legit that there are a ton of meetings that day since it's the start of school.

In my response I was trying to show that I definitely desired her to come, still show that I'm not dependent on her outcome, and make her more secure that she doesn't have to risk being alone at some unknown bar with a guy she just met. I said how that's too bad she cant come, and that I'm still going to go with some friends so if she'd like to stop by later in the evening for open dancing she can. 3 hours later she says ""Okay!"".

Where do I go from here? I'm sure I'm not out of the game yet, so do I just wait for her to make contact at this point? Do I invite her to some more casual date after Thursday?

**TLDR**- Cousins dorm, number close, text for day 2, logistical failure w/ questionable IOI's."

I was super proud I didn't have any errors until I realized that the title says he's (20f). He's a guy, sorry about that!

My ex and I dated for 3 years. He broke up with me last February because of us moving too fast and me being too clingy. We went about 2 weeks with no contact, and we've been friends with benefits ever since. Before we agreed to this, I made sure to establish that I'm _not_ just a piece of ass, there are no other people we're interested in, and that we both still have legit feelings for one another. I love him with all my heart. He has told me he still loves me. He sleeps over about twice a week, we get together for lunch at least once a week, we text every day, and we help each other with homework. There are absolutely no secrets in this ""relationship.""

So when I asked him why we're not official, he said he's in his last year of college (3 years instead of 4) and that he wants to focus on schoolwork, his internship, etc. He's always been very honest and blunt with me, so when he tells me there's no one else and that he's not just stringing me along, I believe him. I told him I don't like feeling as though he's not proud to be with me, and he said it's not that at all. 

I also addressed whether he's worried the end of our 3-year relationship would repeat itself - whether nothing would change and the same ending would happen. He said no, and I think I believe him. Since he broke up with me, I've become a lot more independent, and I make sure not to be overbearing with my sentiments. I'm confident that if we get back together, it'd be much healthier and happier than before. 

I don't know why the label of boyfriend/girlfriend is so important to me. It's not the Facebook status. It might be to reinforce the idea that he cares as much about me as I do about him. I want him to be mine, just as much as I'm already his. We're already pretty much dating; I don't think anything would change from what were doing now, so why the heck not?

Is his reasoning respectable? Am I overreacting? How do I accept what he wants and not let it affect me so much?

*TLDR-* My FWB doesn't want to make it official. I want to better understand his reasoning so that I can accept it."

I'm currently at a branding agency as an intern and I have to say it's a really chill atmosphere in a place with a rather impressive portfolio, but the work seem mostly ad work on a day to day basis. I've never really heard anything good about advertising in my experience.

I feel personally (could be possibly deluded) that I have more to offer than being spoon fed design choices like I've seen around the office, contrary to what it seems to be in advertising. It could be a false assumption. I know straight out of university I won't be in a position to have unlimited power, but it makes me question the nature of different sects.

Just wondering if anyone had any thoughts or experiences."

I'm posting this here too because (at least in my world) a lot of SAP Contractors moved from India to the US to contract/work here on SAP and IT projects.

I figure that /r/SAP might be able to help me answer my question/problem below.


---

Original Post: 

I'm 25, no kids/pets and have a serious GF. Both of us are US Citizens.  

We have talked for a while about moving and working overseas. Where doesn't really matter, we just want to go explore the world. I understand that we have to get visas and may need to learn the language. This is something that would need to be planned.  

Me: Currently, I work in IT as a Business Analyst for a very major apparel/equipment/sporting goods manufacturer and have about 2 years of experience doing so. I have experience in BI, Data Warehousing and am currently working on an SAP Implementation and the development of a world-class B2B Sales Portal. I'm adept at gathering requirements, writing/reviewing functional specifications and other facets of a Business Analyst.
I'm trying to work into a Project Management role eventually.  

Currently, the company I'm working for has no opportunities to work abroad the same/similar role, so I'd likely need to resign.  


I'm open to contracting (I did right out of college) as long as the money is right and the contract length is sufficient (&gt;= 1 year)  

The GF: Almost done with her BA in Human Resource Management, she's currently a technical recruiting intern for a major architecture/engineering firm.  

Where do we start? How do you go about looking for jobs overseas? Give me the 101 course. Everything I've found so far is for teaching English or for another non-professional type of job (no offense).  


I'm hoping someone who has worked abroad can chime in and help me out.  
  
Thanks Reddit."

1m54yf,1,2013-09-10,Government jobs and criminal records...,[deleted],legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1m54yf/government_jobs_and_criminal_records/,"Let me preface by saying that I DO have a criminal record. I've been charged twice with possession of less than 50g of marijuana, with the second offense being during the time of probation from the first offense. For the first offense (committed in October 2010, charged February 2011), I was charged with a fine of roughly $715, mandatory drug counseling, and a year's probation. For the second offense (committed in May 2011, charged August 2011), I was charged with a fine of roughly $715, mandatory drug counseling, a year's probation, and a six-month suspension of my driver's license. Keep in mind that these are both misdemeanors and will be able to be expunged no earlier than August 2017. This all happened in the state of NJ.

Now, the rest of my life is going by fine. I went into my college's career center for a resume critique, and the guy was extremely impressed and told me it was one of the strongest resumes he had ever seen, and said that I will have absolutely no problem getting my foot in the door for most companies. I'm graduating in May with a degree in bioengineering.

One other topic he brought up was a job with the government. I actually had an internship with a government agency over the summer, which DID involve a government-issued background check (which I obviously passed well enough). The career counselor focused mainly on the FBI, telling me that my qualifications are absolutely perfect for the type of people they hire.

Now, my question is: How much of a hurdle will my criminal record be in getting a job as a civilian FBI worker, let alone a full-on FBI agent (which wouldn't happen for at least 3 years of working as a civilian)? I'm honestly expecting it to be a complete roadblock for me, but maybe I'm wrong. I know that the FBI will have access to my criminal history forever, even after it's expunged. What could I possibly do in the meantime to make this career possibility any more feasible?

And, please don't answer unless you KNOW you are knowledgeable on the subject. It's just that whenever I bring this up around people they try to act totally knowledgeable about it, despite never doing any real research or studying on it. I know a lot about this stuff already, but it would be nice to get a second perspective."
1m54iy,0,2013-09-10,My Boyfriend's Huge Secret,bfsecret,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1m54iy/my_boyfriends_huge_secret/,"I want to start this off by saying I love my boyfriend. Very much. I am so glad I met him and can't imagine myself with anybody else. He is my WORLD. This confession relates to something I found out about him that nobody except his family knows, and something he keeps close to his heart.

We are both 22, 21 at the time. I met my boyfriend a little over a year ago, during the second semester of our sophomore year. He was an Indian man raised in Chicago and Atlanta. He had broad shoulders, a good physique (he worked out a good bit), and dressed amazingly (my very first impression was that he was gay). We met at a small party of friends and mutual friends and immediately clicked. I have since had the most amazing year of my life. He has the most amazing family and they treat me like one of their own. Getting to the confession - my boyfriend has an e-diary; he has kept one ever since his elementary school days. He is not shy about it, but he is adamant that nobody sees it - it contains some of the most private and deep secrets of his life. He keeps the diary in a portable hard drive that is only accessible through a password. The diary plagued me with curiosity because I felt that I didn't really *know* him. This was my ignorant brain thinking that a year was enough to truly get to know someone. Anyway, one day we were smoking marijuana at our home, and having a generally good time, laughing and voicing our thoughts, I see something on my boyfriends open phone - a string of letters and numbers that look like a password. I have no idea why this stuck to my mind, but I spent the next hour fixating on that code and memorizing it. 

The next morning when I woke up I realized that I still remembered the code. In fact for the next 6 months I was able to recite it by heart. A few weeks after that night, my boyfriend (in tears) told me that he had to go to India to visit his dying grandmother in the hospital and help take care of his grandfather. He insisted that I not go, due to college and my hospital internship. I reluctantly agreed, and we said our goodbyes at the airport the next day. It was extremely emotional and many tears were shed - his grandmother was one of the most important people in his life and this marked the longest we would be without each other for the first time in our relationship. About a week later I was home alone when the code I had remembered suddenly came to my mind. I was bored at home and I have no idea why this occurred to me but I took his diary which he had left at home and plugged it into my laptop. I entered in the code and to my surprise documents upon documents stretching years back appeared in front of me - I had access to the diary. I feel horrible about what I did and the knowledge that I had betrayed his trust has caused many sleepless nights. I love him the same, but it feels like I have known him for much longer that I have - I feel almost as if I had grown up with him. 

His diary started out childish and slightly negative as he had started writing his diary when he was 11 years old, forced to do so by his father during a very lazy summer as an attempt to fill his son's time with something productive. They had surprisingly good grammar and writing style - my boyfriend has always been a gifted writer and overall intelligent person. They began not as thoughts, but a chronological list of the things he had done that day. They slowly progressed to more personal matters and feelings as he realized that this was a place he could vent his feelings without judgement. As he grew older he began to write about the girls he liked in school, his friends and his antics, and his lamentations about his schoolwork. He also wrote about being picked on due to his skin color and small stature, and general ""geekiness"". He began to dress differently and became more social in his freshman year, though still short and un athletic. He wrote about trying to get involved with sports and being athletic, but he was too lazy. He asked out a girl within 3 weeks of his freshman year starting - she dumped him in 4 days without explanation. He moved schools within the semester and, overwhelmed by being the ""new kid"" in the middle of the year, made no friends. 

In his sophomore year he was part of a friend group, though he was seen as the ""bitch"" of the group because of his height and insecurities about it. He also wrote about his insecurities regarding his ethnicity and lack of talents. After his ""group"" broke up he basically spent the rest of his high school alone. He was still the ""shy, short, un athletic indian kid"" that no girl would ever like by his senior year. This surprised me because as of now he is no less than 5' 10"", and very athletic. I kept reading and read that he voiced his height disparity to his parents, who consulted a doctor and bought him concentrated HGH injections. They did nothing, and he became severely depressed, suicidal, and keeping mostly to himself. He spent his freshman year alone. 

He began to read about ""height lengthening surgery"" during his christmas break at home and approached his parents with the idea. His parents flew him to India during the summer and had the extremely expensive surgery done in a state-of-the-art hospital. He spent the next three months in India, and the remainder of the year recovering. He began college again during the second semester of his freshman year, telling everyone outside his immediate family through a Facebook post that he had gone to India due to a death in the family, and stayed to take care of them, and was continuing college in the fall. He viewed this as a new start, and those around him and those that he met reacted positively to the now taller man, and he used the motivation to become extremely fit. He was now a completely different person, getting attention from girls and being respected by his friends, citing a ""late growth spurt"". He wrote about his insecurities and depression disappearing. When we met two years ago, he was confident and comfortable with himself, nothing like the man writing in this journal. I do see my boyfriend differently, but I love him just the same and do truly feel like I know him and am closer to him. For the last year, however, what I did plagues me and I feel extremely guilty, though I do not want to tell him I know so much about him and betrayed his trust like I did. 

This wall of text was my way of blowing off steam about my guilt and if you've read so far, thank you so much. I'd really like to hear people's thoughts and opinions on what I read.

TL;DR: Over a year ago I read my boyfriend's diary about his previous insecurities about his height and physique, found out he had height lengthening surgery a year before I met him - I am the only soul who knows besides his immediate family. I am still plagued about what I read."

I've been doing some research on the topic and can't seem to find an exact answer. I know work permits/visas require that the employer can't find anyone else within the country. And a schengen visa won't apply as that's only 90 days (I had one of these a few years back when I studied/interned in Austria). So, I guess my question is... is getting a visa/work permit even possible for me or am I doomed to turning down the job if I get it?"

[What kind of data do you expect to still gather from Voyager?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9wke/were_scientists_and_engineers_on_nasas_voyager/cc75fww?context=5)|We hope the sun will cooperate and tease some more plasma oscillations out of the interstellar medium.  We expect to see their frequencies increase to as high as 3.5 kHz, meaning a still higher density.  Bill.
[How long do you expect you'll be able to communicate with it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9wke/were_scientists_and_engineers_on_nasas_voyager/cc75fww?context=5)|In today's press conference ([Link to www.ustream.tv](http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/38651239)) project manager Suzy Dodd explained this timeline: In 2020, the team will begin shutting off the remaining science instruments one by one to use the remaining power most efficiently. This will go on until 2025. After that, we _may_ get engineering data back for another 10 years. -- @stephist, JPL social media.
[Granted it'll be a while before it gets close to anything, but what else in the universe lies along it's current trajectory and how far away is it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9wke/were_scientists_and_engineers_on_nasas_voyager/cc75fww?context=5)|DIRECTION OF VOYAGER 1 Voyager 1 is escaping the solar system at a speed of about 3.6 AU per year, 35 degrees out of the ecliptic plane to the north, in the general direction of the Solar Apex (the direction of the Sun's motion relative to nearby stars). Voyager 1 will leave the solar system aiming toward the constellation Ophiuchus. In the year 40,272 AD, Voyager 1 will come within 1.7 light years of an obscure star in the constellation Ursa Minor (the Little Bear or Little Dipper) called AC+79 3888. DIRECTION OF VOYAGER 2 Voyager 2 is also escaping the solar system at a speed of about 3.2 AU per year, 48 degrees out of the ecliptic plane to the south toward the constellations of Sagitarrius and Pavo. In about 40,000 years, Voyager 2 will come within about 1.7 light years of a star called Ross 248, a small star in the constellation of Andromeda.  EMF 
[I understood some of those words.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9wke/were_scientists_and_engineers_on_nasas_voyager/cc75p1i?context=5)|Sorry.  The waves we found that told us Voyager was in the interstellar medium are triggered by solar activity, like flares and coronal mass ejections (big explosions), that move outward until they reach interstellar space.  If more reach where Voyager is, we'll see more of the waves.  Bill 
[Ah thank you for the dumbed down explanation. What is the application of this kind of knowledge? Understanding how particles move through space?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9wke/were_scientists_and_engineers_on_nasas_voyager/cc75xci?context=5)|James Van Allen once told me that the pursuit of knowledge was a sufficient answer for questions about applicability of space exploration.  It's all about understanding who we are, where we come from, and where we're going.  We're all the stuff of stars, and now were actually examining that 'stuff'.  Bill.
[Is Voyager still able to capture and send photos back to Earth?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9wke/were_scientists_and_engineers_on_nasas_voyager/cc75fzj?context=5)|The Voyager camera's were turned off after the image of the Pale Blue Dot Valentines Day 1990.
[EDIT: The Pale Blue Dot shot is my favorite picture taken from space. I would have sent a satellite up for the sole purpose of a picture of Earth like that. It gives you such a incredible sense of scale. Here is the picture for anybody who hasn't seen it and the Wikipedia Entry  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9wke/were_scientists_and_engineers_on_nasas_voyager/cc75su2?context=5)|The cameras were turned off to save power and memory for the instruments expected to detect the new charged particle environment of interstellar space. Mission managers removed the software from both spacecraft that controls the camera. The computers on the ground that understand the software and analyze the images do not exist anymore. The cameras and their heaters have also been exposed for years to the very cold conditions at the deep reaches of our solar system. Even if mission managers recreated the computers on the ground, reloaded the software onto the spacecraft and were able to turn the cameras back on, it is not clear that they would work.  Also, it is _very_ dark where the Voyagers are now. While you could still see some brighter stars and some of the planets with the cameras, you can actually see these stars and planets better with amateur telescopes on Earth.
[Are there any members of the team who have been working on Voyager since the beginning of its development?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9wke/were_scientists_and_engineers_on_nasas_voyager/cc75egk?context=5)|EMF There are two engineers in Mission operations that have been with Voyager since 1977.

 |Tom Krimigis.
 |Matt Hill: I'm NOT one of the originals.  I was one year old when the Voyager project officially started in July of 1972.  I'm privileged to be working on the same mission that I grew up watching fly by the giant planets as a child!!!
[Can you hear me major tom?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9wke/were_scientists_and_engineers_on_nasas_voyager/cc76cfe?context=5)|What is the question? Tom Krimigis.

Are there people devoted to constantly checking on this data? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9wke/were_scientists_and_engineers_on_nasas_voyager/cc75fzh?context=5)|It consists of 0's and 1's. Yes, there is (old) hardware and software that extracts data from the instruments. The instrument teams have their analysis software to apply the calibrations and other corrections that turn the raw data into scientific quantities. You can find the output almost live on the web, e.g. at [Link to voyager.gsfc.nasa.gov](http://voyager.gsfc.nasa.gov/heliopause/heliopause/v1pgh.html.bkup)

[, let me say, your work is very interesting! For my question: what current/future mission are you all most excited for? Oh my God 4 replies! This never happens. My day has been made!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9wke/were_scientists_and_engineers_on_nasas_voyager/cc759or?context=5)|I'm working on Cassini (Saturn) and MESSENGER (Mercury. They both are exciting but not like Voyager!! Tom Krimigis.
 |Great question! With respect to Voyager's current science, there currenty is NASA's IBEX mission, the Interstellar Boundary Explorer. It is in Earth orbit, but it pictures the global interaction of interstellar space with our heliosphere in energetic neutral atoms. With this global map and our bold Voyagers, we learn a lot more than with the Voyagers or IBEX alone.  It might be followed by a future mission called IMAP, which would give better images than IBEX does. (Kind of a Hubble for observing eneretic neutral atoms out there.) This one was recommended by the National Academy of Sciences. Arik Posner.
 |I'm also working on Cassini, but also Van Allen Probes and Juno.  All are terrific missions, but Voyager is in a class of its own!  Bill.
 |Matt Hill: I work on New Horizons (Pluto in July 2015!) and Cassini at Saturn.  Also I'm working on the Solar Probe Plus mission which will be going within less than 10 solar radii from the Sun, much closer than any other spacecraft.  Launch is around 2018...but it will take several years to get very close.  Very exciting to work on all of these projects!
[They want the sun to do things to the space soup, they also hope it vibrates.  How's that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9wke/were_scientists_and_engineers_on_nasas_voyager/cc75x7i?context=5)|You said it better than I... Bill.
[Has the method of receiving and sending signals to/from the Voyager probes changed much since they have first launched? If it has, would it still be possible to communicate over such large distances using the initial 70s equipment?  Assuming the probes never run out of power, for how long or how far could you still pick up transmissions from the probes?  On the wikipedia page, it says that gyroscopic operations will be terminated in ~2016. Does that mean that it wont be able to point its antenna back to Earth in case it comes out of allighment?  Now that Voyager 1 has reached interstellar space, do you expect any further changes to the environment around it or would it be pretty much constant, unchanging stream of data untill the probe powers down?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9wke/were_scientists_and_engineers_on_nasas_voyager/cc758nl?context=5)|The DSN technology has made major improvements to their hardware and software.  The voyagers use the 70 meters and 34 meters and arrays of both.  Andrea: Education and Public Outreach  -EMF There are tow operating modes for the voyagers: Inertial (gyros) and celestial (sun sensors and star tracker). The nominal mode, 95% of the time is celestial mode, the other 5%, inertial mode is used too perform spacecraft maneuvers so in short once the gyros are off for good, the voyagers can no longer perform maneuvers and the spacecraft will remain in celestial mode.
[Once the Voyagers run out of power and stop transmitting, will we still be able to detect them? Or will they be forever lost to us?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9wke/were_scientists_and_engineers_on_nasas_voyager/cc75ckn?context=5)|I am afraid not. No signal from the spacecraft really means no signal. -EMF 
[How long will it take for the power to run out? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9wke/were_scientists_and_engineers_on_nasas_voyager/cc76km4?context=5)|We have power to run the spacecraft and all the science instruments until 2020 at that time we start science instrument shutdown and about 2025 the last instrument will be shutdown.

[What kinds of data do you hope to see in Voyager's remaining years?  Also, is there a definite cut-off date for the project, or do you anticipate being able to continue as long as Voyager can communicate back to us?  Thank you, and congratulations!

The problem you point out is that there are several definitions of the solar system. Here we refer to the heliosphere, which is much less ambiguous. I found an old NASA press release from ~30 years ago that mentioned Pioneer 10 leaving the solar system when it passed Pluto's orbital distance. (Pluto was still a planet then.) And yes, Pioneer 10 would have been the first one leaving the solar system if you choose this definition. Arik Posner.
 |Actually, the Voyagers are moving faster than both Pioneers 10 and 11.   Both Voyagers have passed both Pioneers.  Further, Pioneer 10 was moving more-or-less in the opposite direction from Voyager 1.  Voyager 1 exited the heliosphere (not solar system) near its closest point to the sun; Pioneer 10 is going down the 'tail' of the heliosphere and probably has a very long way to go to exit.  Both Pioneers are now silent.  Bill.
[I'm curious, is there any way for y'all to tell if objects such as asteroids have come close to hitting/damaging voyager at any point?

Similar impacts were also observed at Uranus and Neptune.  These are small enough they do no real damage to the spacecraft.  Bill.
 |We didn't get hit so far, otherwise we would have being damaged or even off the air! And, since we passed the asteroid belt many years ago, the probability of getting hit is exceptionally small.

This was only possible when an eruption on the sun in March 2012 resulted in a ""solar tsunami"" that traveled out to Voyager 1 in April 2013 and caused the plasma to oscillate so that it could be observed by the Voyager Plasma Wave Sensor.  We found that the plasma was 40 times denser than that inside the solar bubble, as was expected for plasma in interstellar space.  Ed  [edit to fix year from April 2014 to 2013.

One of the obstacles is cost, though, which make other heliophysics-rlelated missions more attractive at the moment. One of the future missions recommended by the National Academy's Decadal Survey will address some of the questions of an interstellar probe mission, the Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe. It will map with high resolution the interaction of the interstellar medium with the heliosphere in the ""light"" of energetic neutral atoms. The beauty of this method is that neutral atoms are not influenced by ubiquitous magnetic fields in space, so one can create a map of the global interaction from near Earth. Nonetheless, an interstellar probe would give us plasma composition information, something the Voyagers are not capable of. Arik Posner.
[Given in the next 10 years Voyager will be almost completely shut off, what's in store for the Voyager team? Is the team's work at NASA completely focused on Voyager, or are people working on multiple projects?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9wke/were_scientists_and_engineers_on_nasas_voyager/cc75isf?context=5)|Matt Hill: Most or all of us have multiple projects.

[How long before Voyager 2 exits the solar system? I understand that V1 cannot turn around and take a family photo, but could V2 take one?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9wke/were_scientists_and_engineers_on_nasas_voyager/cc75l5j?context=5)|Depends on whether the boundary is at the same distance in the south ecliptic where voyager 2 is as in the north. If so, it will be another 6-7 years before V2 gets there. If the boundary is closer, say by 10 AU, then it will only be 3-4 years. Also, V2 like V1 cannot take a family photo-the data rate is not sufficient, the software has been removed and the instrument has been turned off. Tom Krimigis.
 |Tom Krimigis.
 |We're having a debate about when Voyager 2 will cross the heliopause into interstellar space (not exit the solar system).  Voyager 2 crossed the termination shock (where the supersonic solar wind slows down) closer to the sun than where Voyager 1 crossed it, indicating a distorted boundary.  So, it could be that this could occur within a few years.  But, Voyager 1 is already about 20 AU further out than 2 and moving faster.  Who knows?  Bill.
[What an amazing time to be alive! ... What are your plans for when V'ger returns to attack starfleet?

 |Matt Hill: The Voyager aspect of my job is a lot of working on a computer.  I have to use software, some I wrote, some others write, to process data.  I do ""by hand"" processing with code and occasionally with a calculator and pencil/paper.  Make a bunch of plots...some are production plots that are automated or semi-automated and lots of them are special one-offs.  At this point I think about the science.  I put together presentations to show my colleagues and write papers.  That sort of thing.
[What kind of data do we get from Voyager?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9wke/were_scientists_and_engineers_on_nasas_voyager/cc75blw?context=5)|Matt Hill: The science data that Voyager returns currently breaks down into the following:  energetic particle measurements from two instruments (LECP and CRS), magnetometer data from the MAG team, radio plasma wave data from the PWS team, plasma data (on Voyager 2) from the PLS team, and ultra violet spectrum measurements from the UVS instrument (currently responding to penetrating particles).
[Do you ever feel partial to a Voyager probe over the other? For example, someone's desk has a placard that says Voyager 1 rules while Voyager 2 drools.

Good question. Most are impartial, but there are a few stalwarts who prefer one over the other. Having two spacecraft is great, and allow for serendipitous work. For example, Voyager 1 discovered the volcanoes on Io, and Voyager 2's sequence was adapted to take advantage of that discovery. -- @stephist.

For example anything like dead/cold planets or stars? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9wke/were_scientists_and_engineers_on_nasas_voyager/cc75fdp?context=5)|Voyager 1 will be measuring this material from other stars. As it moves further and further away from the heliosphere, it will become more accurate in characterizing our local galactic neighborhood. Voyager 1 does this with energetic particle, plasma wave, and magnetic field instruments. When Voyager 2 arrives there in a few years, it will add the critical plasma (velocity, density, temperature) measurements. Plus, having two out there would give us an idea how homogeneous interstellar matter is. Arik Posner.
[Now that Voyager is in interstellar space, what will it study and document?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9wke/were_scientists_and_engineers_on_nasas_voyager/cc75gxd?context=5)|Matt Hill: One of the things I'm very excited about is studying galactic cosmic rays.  We thought they would be smooth constant and look the same in all directions (isotropic) but the rather they are quite variable and are showing anisotropies (different intensities in different directions) larger than any galactic cosmic ray anisotropies measured in space.
[Great work guys! Thanks for all the cool science.  1\) Have you guys seen Kerbal Space Program? I regularly have some ""unplanned deviations to the mission"" and end up turning a satellite into a deep space probe.

[Great Work guys! Fantastic acheivment for all mankind!  I'm sure there are a number of instruments that you wish you could have included on voyager to help the mission, even in the seventies, which one in particular do you wish you had at your disposal all these years? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9wke/were_scientists_and_engineers_on_nasas_voyager/cc75srj?context=5)|Matt Hill: Well, based on current technology we would LOVE to have an instrument that measures ""suprathermal"" particles in the range between plasma and energetic particles (~1-30 keV or so).  In the heliosheath suprathermals including particles known as pickup ions carry most of the pressure and control a lot of the dynamics. And we couldn't measure any of it.  Future mission concepts like Interstellar Probe would be well instrumented in that energy range.

 |The plasma density (as determined by the plasma wave instrument)  is quite clearly interstellar. Without that measurement, we would still be debating, I would think. It would have helped us to have a working plasma detector on Voyager 1, but we still consider us incredibly lucky to have a working spacecraft at all at that distance.

There is the Solar Probe Plus mission currently in development that will presumably be the fastest. It should go as close as 10 solar radii above the photosphere. Launch is near the end of this decade. But in terms of leaving the solar system, Voyager 1 is the fastest. With a lot of help from Jupiter and Saturn.

The high resolution plasma wave data is recorded on it a couple times a week (all of 48 seconds each time) and played back a few times per year.  Interestingly, the lowest playback rate is 7,200 bits per second, but the fastest telemetry rate to the ground (using 1 70-meter and 1 34-meter DSN station ganged together) is 1,400 bps.  So while the first 800 bytes are being transmitted, the next 4000 fall on the floor.  While this sounds like a waste, those 800 bytes are really precious!

- Graduated Dec 2012 with Accounting and Finance. 3.49 GPA.

- Passed 2 CPA exams.

- 138 hours.

- Trying to get into public accounting.

For various reasons, getting into public accounting is difficult for me. I didn't network much in school (due to things I won't get into here,) and didn't do any internships. I feel like the the biggest thing setting me back is the lack of work experience and good references.

I might have an opportunity to work a 6 month contract job (that might turn into permanent) in accounts receivable. I'm thinking this will be a good resume builder and would help me eventually get into public accounting. While doing the job I could finish up my CPA exams and start taking classes to meet the 150 hour requirement.

Experis is helping me get the job. Am I shooting myself in the foot by taking this job (assuming I get an offer?) The way I see it, this would be good work experience to put on a resume and I can always get into public accounting in the future. Reading this subreddit though, I get the impression that everyone thinks that if you don't get into public accounting right out of school you're done for."

What I didn't tell him was that sitting there with him watching a harddrive imaging screen load was the highlight of my week. 



I just wish I was one of those kids content with getting a C in class, and lived with their rich parents, that their worst worry was whether or not their dad would buy them the next new iPhone, college was paid for, food was on the table, life was easy. But no, I'm stuck here. 

I'm sure this is an incoherent mess, but I just wanted to talk to someone."

I am doing one, but things have become quite complicated. Initially, for about 3 months, I got very little work to do, primarily because another intern (who had been working there before me) got the bulk of the work. I wanted work but they were reluctant to give it to me because the other guy was familiar with it all, and it would have taken a long time to explain everything to me. I was hired as an IT procurement intern, but I did not do anything related to it at all. I became tired of the working culture; I had free time, lots of it, and whenever I did not have any work, I read some articles on CNN or NYT. No one, including my direct supervisors, ever objected on spot or even mentioned it to me but a few days later the VP of my department would come and tell me that 'I was demotivating the entire team with my attitude'. I honestly did not get it, I did not get much work, and when I was done with it, I still was supposed to pretend I was working. Anyway, I decided to put up with it. I now only read the articles during my lunch break. 

But then someone told the VP that I had a fight with a colleague. No such thing happened, we were merely discussing some economic theories and took opposing viewpoints. Both of us were equally surprised when the VP asked us about it. I was angry, but I didn't put up a show and swallowed it. 

The annoying stuff did not stop then. They brought up all kinds of stupid things. All employees have to complete a set amount of hours per week, which are tracked. Some days I would leave an hour earlier because I had excess hours on my account, and because there was no work assigned to me. Again, someone would tell me a few days later that I left early on that particular day. I would explain my situation but that person would reply saying that I am an intern and it doesn't matter and blah blah blah.

Well, I decided to quit my internship as soon as sixteen weeks were over. I've got 3 weeks left to that, but then yesterday the other intern left because his contract was over. Now they gave everything he was doing over to me, so now from doing nothing at all, I'm swamped with work. But, I have no motivation left to work, and frankly very little respect left for the corporate culture. I had rather study for the next couple of months, and work on a business plan (I want to be an entrepreneur). 

Moreover, my landlord told me that I have to leave at the end of this month (which coincides with the last week of my internship) because she is selling the place (we had a clause in our contract which allows this, if told a month in advance).

Reddit, how do I leave my internship without making them screw me over in their recommendation letter, or firing me when I tell them I want to leave due to issues with finding a new apartment nearby? 

TLDR: I hated my internship because of the working culture, and the fact that another intern (who started a few months before me) got all the work and I was left staring at my computer screen all day. After this went on for 3 months, I decided to quit after 16 weeks, but the other intern left, and now I got all his work. 

However, I now have some problems with my accommodation and I doubt I can find a new place nearby in the next couple of weeks. How do I politely leave my internship without pissing them off?"
1m9zjt,2,2013-09-12,Just found this subreddit and I'm amazed by how many others there are...,[deleted],raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1m9zjt/just_found_this_subreddit_and_im_amazed_by_how/,"I spent most of my childhood and certainly all of my teenage years wondering what I had done to deserve the way my Mom treated me. I assumed I was just a bad daughter and that I kept making mistakes I must be punished for. I just read so many of your stories and while I feel an overwhelming wave of sympathy for all of you, I am simultaneously relieved there are others who have had equally insane parents. As I get older (I'm almost 22), I talk about my Mom less and less to people because I want to move on with my life and start feeling less like damaged goods. I also worry that people think I am looking for pity or that I'm making everything up for attention. I have so much baggage as a result of my Mom's emotional, verbal, and physical abuse but I know for sure I will never be like her. Since this subreddit exists, I'd really love the opportunity to just vent and get things off my chest in a place where other people understand. 

Some of my Mom's more famous moments:

* She made me feel absolutely worthless all the time. Nothing was ever good enough. I worked my ass off all the way through school (straight-A student) to get perfect grades. I remember coming home in Grade 6 and being enthused with the 86% I got on my Social test because it was the highest mark in the class. She glanced at it and then said, ""What happened to the other 14%?"" I was devastated. Lots of times in school I would cry if I got anything less than 85% because I was so worried about what she'd say. When I graduated high school, they had an awards night where I received 7 different scholarships and a service award from the school. My mom promised me she would be there and asked me to reserve a seat. She didn't show up. 

* She constantly belittled me about my inability to make friends. I was quite shy and awkward when I was younger and it took me a long time to figure out who I wanted to be. She would go on rants about how I was too weird to have any friends and would list all of the reasons nobody would want to be friends with me. On the rare occasions I had friends over, she would spy on us and after they left she would come yell at me for the way I acted with my friends.  Or, she would just say she didn't like any of the people I hung out with. As a result, I never invited people over anymore which gave her further support for the ""You have no friends"" argument. 

* I played basketball and baseball every year even though I hated the girls on my team because I overheard my Mom telling her friends that she was embarrassed by what a quitter I was and that I wasn't as athletic as my brother. I busted my ass to get on the junior basketball team in my high school. I hated the practices, hated my teammates, but I worked SO hard to make it (I was about 5 feet tall and 90 pounds). She never came to a single game the entire season.

* By Grade 7, I was extremely depressed because I was teased a lot at school and because my Mom was so mean to me. I wrote an e-mail to a friend at school saying I felt like killing myself. The school monitored our emails, so naturally they forwarded it to my parents. My mom confronted me and said that if I was going to have such a big pity-party, I should just kill myself or maybe they could just send me to a mental hospital. 

* I had absolutely no privacy. My bedroom door had to be open at all times unless I was changing. When I was out, she would go through all my belongings and snoop around my room. She put a keylogger on the computer and hacked my Facebook so she could read all my messages. She once pushed me over and stole my purse and proceeded to read all of my texts out loud in front of me. 

* On multiple occasions, she slapped me across the face, dragged me by my clothes, pulled my hair, and she even tried to choke me *more than once*. 

* If I cried in front of her when she was yelling at me, she would slap me and tell me to cry harder. Sometimes she would make me sit in the kitchen and tell me to cry for 10 minutes or else I wasn't allowed to leave. If I didn't cry when she yelled at me, she slapped me and accused me of ""pouting"" or not listening to her. 

* Told me she hated me. Told me she wished I had brain cancer. Told me I was the reason my parents divorced. Told me I was the reason her life was ruined. Told me my Dad didn't really care about me. 

Okay, I'm done now because I've already said a lot and I could probably go on forever. At this point in my life, I'm in my final year of a combined degree program (Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Education) with nearly a 4.0 GPA and I'm completing a teaching internship at a junior high. I try to be as helpful, supportive, and caring towards my students as possible in case any of them have home lives like mine. This is why I am a teacher - to show these kids that someone will always give a shit about them.  "

Both positions seem very interesting to me and I don't know what I want to do quite yet post graduation. 

Also I feel like I'm screwing company A over, I got to know the guy pretty well and he's pushing me in the very first offer email telling me to drop off these forms by Monday and congratulating me.

1m9vda,6,2013-09-12,My mother is severely depressed and I'm having trouble dealing with it. How can I help her?,frustrateds0n,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1m9vda/my_mother_is_severely_depressed_and_im_having/,"My mother has been severely depressed for going on 10 years or so now. It kills me to witness the way she lives her life and I don't know if I can handle it for much longer or how I could possibly help. I'll try to give you as much backstory as possible without this dragging on too long...

My mother used to be the go-to woman in our family. She was the rock that mothers often are. She had a flourishing career in real estate, tons of friends, and was reliable and forthright woman that everyone in town knew and loved. She was in great physical shape as well. I was a in high school during this time, my sister was out on her own (still in town), and my father was a corporate 9-5er with many hobbies. We had an average middle-class happy life.

Somewhere around this time, something slipped. I was just starting to break out of my shell at this point so I was often out with friends and didn't really see what was going on at home. The real estate company my mother worked for (owned by my uncle and cousin) crumbled due to some bad business practices, and there was a lot of bad blood and drama in our circle of friends and family. It was also around this time that the market was about to crash. My mother found a job at a different agency, but I noticed her starting to sleep all the time. I also started to notice her acting a bit loopy from time time to time. I knew she was on medication for a back injury, but I would later find out that this had become a bad addiction to heavy pain killers.

Other things I started to notice was my mother gaining weight. Lots of weight. Her eating habits were not what they used to be. I attributed most of this strange behavior to what I thought (and was told) to be my mother going through menopause. Bill collectors also started calling the house more and more. I knew my mother who handled the finances wasn't the most organized when it came to paying their bills on time, but my parents made good money, and a bill was never left unpaid, albeit maybe late.

Fast forward a little bit and I go off to college. Not too far from home, but not close enough for me to commute. I find out my mother left the real estate agency, but I cant seem to remember what reasons. Otherwise, things seem to be fairly consistent at home to what they were before my left. Until one day out of nowhere my mother tells me that they are planning to move into an apartment. I later find out the house was foreclosed on, but these were happening left and right in America, so I didnt really ask questions. A whole saga of finding an apartment ensues, and I help them find a place. They had bad credit, but my father made good money so I didn't think they would have too much trouble. They ended up in a decent yet sorta sketchy part of town. It actually was the neighborhood that my mother grew up in, but it had gone downhill in recent years.

I spend summers at home, working at an internship, and spending little time at home, but I begin to see more changes in my mothers habits. At this point she hasnt worked in a couple of years, she is sleeping till noon, and cannot be anywhere on time. She often goes to take care of her very elderly mother, but between that, doctors appointments, and the occasional trip to the grocery store, she spends most of her time on the couch watching court tv. 

I know she was getting therapy during this time due to sever depression. I would often find her crying when I would call and check in from school. Sometimes she would just break into tears out of nowhere. Even with that though, she would miss her appointments and take her meds sporadically.

When it came to some things like taking care of her mother, cooking huge dinners on holidays, or doing laundry for the family, she was always enthusiastic and did it with joy. My mother has always said how she loves being a mother and doing those things do make her happy. Though, most of these things are always a project in some sort. She can never get things done or be somewhere in a timely fashion. And she will adamantly lie about this. She will say she will be ready to go somewhere in an hour and not be ready for 2, and then lie and say she was ready on time. It's quite frustrating.

She also lies about the way she treats her health. She is a smoker, drinks tons of coffee loaded with CUPS of cream. Yes cups. Her coffee is more cream then coffee. She also puts cream in her cereal instead of milk. She eats tons of sweets, and has no regularity in meals. I will watch her smoke three cigarettes in a row, then will tell me to my face she only had one and will argue that its the truth until we are both screaming. It's unreal.

Fast forward a few more years... I'm out of college with a well paying job and have decided to buy a large house for me and my parents to live in, in hopes to help us all get financially stable (I have major student loans), and get my mothers spirits up. We've been here for a few months now and if anything, I'm more frustrated with my mother than ever. The sleeping late continues, the lying, the bad eating. I try to talk with her about it and she always tells me shes going to try and get better, but nothing ever happens. 

I will admit, there is always a meal on the table when I get home (or hours after depending on what time-space demension my mother happens to be in that night), my thermos is always washed and waiting for me with a prepared pot of coffee ready to be brewed in the morning, and my laundry is always done and shirts ironed. And my mother is always excited to see me and waiting with hugs and kisses. I also have to give my mother credit for taking round the clock care of my grandmother for the last year or so just before she died in May.

But the way she lives her life and things she says frustrate the shit out of me. She has no sense of logic, has lost touch with all of her friends, and treats her body like shit. It angers me so much that my father and I work our asses off to keep this family afloat, and she spends most of her time watching Nancy Grace.

Now, I haven't mentioned much about my father or sister. My sister lives in town and is very close to the family. She shares the same frustrations as I do, though is older so I think she witnessed it progressing with clearer vision than I did. My father on the other hand, he is a clear enabler. He's not a very strong-handed individual. Loving and stern when he needs to be, but when it comes to my mother, he is always defending her actions. When he is confronted about it, he either clams up or gets super angry and nothing can be said.

My mother has had some bad shit happen to her. When she was 15 years old her sister suddenly passed away in a car accident. She wasnt abused, but had an alcoholic father. Her nephew who she practically raised fucked her over badly when the real estate company went south. And now most recently she is dealing with the death of her mother who she never spent more than 2 weeks away from in her entire life.

I know that depression is a true sickness and she isnt necessarily to ""blame"" for all these things, but I don't know how much longer I can deal with all of this. I want so desperately to help her but I don't know what to do anymore. We've tried sitting down as a family and talking about it, but she always just feels like we're ganging up on her and we get nowhere. As I was writing this my sister spoke with my mothers former therapist. She said that unfortunately it seems that my mother doesnt want to be helped - she missed so many of her appointments that she had to drop her as a patient. She also said that it may be at the point where we just need to accept her as who she is now. But, I dont know if I can do that...

Is that really my only choice? Do I now just have to accept this as the new her? She is 60 years old, I know theres only so much changing you can do at this age, but I just... aghhhhh

Is there anything I can do to try to help her out of this depression?

This was much longer than I planned, but I still feel like I left stuff out!"
1m9u4j,0,2013-09-12,I [18F] think that I am in an emotionally abusive relationship with my boyfriend [19M] but I don't want to break up.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1m9u4j/i_18f_think_that_i_am_in_an_emotionally_abusive/,"Hi everyone! I don’t really know where to begin but I’ll try to provide some background. I desperately need advice.

My boyfriend (19M) and I (18F) have been dating for over a year and a half. He goes to college in Maryland and I go to college in New Jersey.  We frequently get into fights and when we first got together we would occasionally get into fights that would be extremely serious (He would scream at me, call me a bitch, tell me to fuck myself, that he would never talk to me again, that he hated me, he never loved me, I was a waste of his life etc.). I made of point of never cursing at him because I know I hated it. Most of the time I would be the one ending the fight and apologizing. 

We broke up after Prom in 2012 because he wouldn’t let me see my friends and told me I shouldn’t miss anyone if I was with him. He repeatedly called me “a fucking bitch” and told me that he hated me in front of all of his friends. I decided I couldn’t continue the relationship and broke up with him. A few days later we got back together because he was extremely apologetic. He tried to blame it on alcohol and clubbing (we were living in Europe at the time), even though I know it was not the case.

We moved on from that and since then he hasn’t cursed at me much when we fight. There are times when he does act the same way he did at Prom, but he always apologizes. 

I thought that our relationship was doing really well and his behavior was improving until last night.

I was throwing out ideas of when we could see one another again for extended periods of time. I suggested he take a class at Georgetown this summer because I would like to have an internship in DC so we could stay together. He is an international student, so he can’t spend the summer in the USA if it’s not for school. He laughed at me and told me that I was getting ahead of myself (which I know I was, but I was just thinking aloud) and he told me that he thought we would breaking up in the spring. I told him that what he said really hurt my feelings, and he laughed at me and sarcastically said, “sorry for being realistic”. I asked him to apologize and he wouldn’t. He said “I’m not going to be sorry for being realistic. If you want that then you need a different boyfriend”.

I suggest we take a couple-day long break (this is the second time this week he told me to find a new boyfriend) and he told me that I wasn’t working hard enough in the relationship and that it would be my fault if it failed. 

The conversation continued as I told him that he was hurting my feelings and he said that he didn’t care. I went to bed and told him I didn’t want to talk to him for a day”.

This was our most recent conversation:
&gt;**ME**: Please just stop talking to me. I’m done for today
&gt;
&gt;**HIM**: Ok I will. I'll stop talking to you. Don't act like everything is ok. I'm just so pissed. It took a whole 2 days &gt;between me telling you I love you to this. I'm not telling you again Cus it messes everything up. You forget everything so &gt;quickly. That I don't know how this is supposed to work out because at the end of the day who always talks to you when &gt;your having other problems? Who always makes you feel better? Who came to you on Friday cus you had a fight with your &gt;dad? ME. But it doesn't matter to you. All it takes is a bit of uncertainty on my part and you don't want to talk. I'm stupidly &gt;trying to fix this by trying to talk. But nooooo. You're too good for that. So fine. It's your problem. I feel like such an idiot for &gt;doing everything for you. For buying your ticket to visit me in Europe this summer. For always buying everything for you. I &gt;did that cus I thought this could work
&gt;
&gt;**ME**: Stop. I'm leaving my phone in my dorm. I can't believe you just said those things to me
&gt;
&gt;**HIM**: Thanks for ruining my day 
&gt;
&gt;**ME**: maybe well talk next week 
&gt;
&gt;**HIM**: Ok. Have a nice life. I'm done. If you want to keep me you'll do what you need to do. If not have fun.
&gt;
&gt;**ME**: We should talk again on Tuesday. I have never been more hurt by you
&gt;
&gt;**HIM**: We're not talking on Tuesday. In fact were never talking again unless I hear some real things from you. I'm not &gt;going to sit around Like an idiot waiting for you to talk. If you want to fix this it's up to you. If you wait till Tuesday I won't &gt;be there. It's up to you.
&gt;
&gt;**ME**: You should reread the things you said to me 
&gt;
&gt;**HIM**: I did. You can argue all you want. You should reread it and see how wrong you are. You hit my breaking point. You've done this once before 
&gt;
&gt;**ME**: I didn't do anything 
&gt;
&gt;**HIM**: it's when we broke up. I don't care what you say you've done or haven't done 
&gt;
&gt;**ME**: Ok. Bye
&gt;
&gt;**HIM**: Bye

I think that I’m an abusive relationship but what can I do so that he isn’t so mean? I love him so much and don’t want to break up with him. Do you think our relationship is worth me trying to stay in or should we just break up?

**TL;DR**: I think that I’m in an emotionally abusive relationship, but I love my boyfriend and I don’t want to break up. What can I do to make sure he isn’t so mean or do you think we just need to break up?

1m9trl,9,2013-09-12,My college isn't letting me accept financial aid because of my PTSD. Life story of triumphs and tragedies.,missselfesteem,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1m9trl/my_college_isnt_letting_me_accept_financial_aid/,"This is probably going to be long.

I'm sitting here on my toilet, trying to think of a way to make myself feel better.  The last few years have been harder than I ever thought my life would be.  I'm proud of myself for getting through it, and lately it seemed like things were going to get better.  I've had two relatively successful semesters back in school, ended up dropping a class but I thought no big deal, if it helps my sanity then I need to do it!  When last semester ended, I was finally able to get a student job (and keep it!) and tried to save up as much money as I could.  Decided to go part time school this semester, but I didn't have enough saved to pay for it out of pocket.  Tried to get loans/financial aid.  Apparently dropping a class means you have to appeal for financial aid.  I did that, they said they needed more proof that I was fit to return to school.

Now I'm just sitting here asking myself, how do I tell them this story?  How do I let them know that finishing my degree means everything to me?  How can I get them to understand, to have faith in me?  It's such a long story, and I don't know how to tell it.

I had a pretty hard childhood, especially when my parents and I moved away from the rest of my family when I was 11.  They were very strict, as a lot of parents are, but I was also a really obedient kid.  Straight A's all through school, never got into trouble.  Still, they didn't trust me.  They both worked a lot, so I spent most of my time alone, doing chores, creating extra homework for myself (really...  I was doing calculus in 7th grade), inventing flying machines in my head, and writing in my journal, especially in the summer.  We didn't have TV and I wasn't allowed to see friends outside of school or sports.  I excelled on the basketball, volleyball, and cross country team in middle school despite my diminutive size (5'0"" now).  When I reached high school at 15, the coach wouldn't even let me try out for volleyball because of my height.  My dad called me fat and lazy, made me practice with the volleyball team, and forced me to run 7 miles a day to teach me to ""work harder.""  I was also required to practice with and compete on the cross country team.  I developed anorexia, and started having seizures.  By December of my 15th year, I couldn't do much of anything physical.  I convinced my parents to let me transfer to a bigger school with more advanced classes, but refused to be part of sports teams.  If I wasn't in sports, I had to get a job, they said.  So that summer I began my first job at Subway.  Since I was making money, my parents said I had to start paying rent.  My whole paycheck went to rent, and because I was no longer playing sports I didn't deserve clothes or spending money anyway and my free time went to chores and extra homework assignments.  On a summer day just shy of my 17th birthday, I had folded some of my Dad's clothes incorrectly.  He came home in a rage and said I didn't appreciate all that he had done for me.  He kicked me out.  Luckily I had an emergency bag packed already (this was not the first time he had threatened to kick me out) and it was summer.  We lived out of town in the woods, so I walked a few miles on a trail behind our house and camped for the night.  The next day I walked to my friend's house in the next subdivision.  She, thankfully, was housesitting for two weeks and let me stay with her while I figured out what to do.  I got a hold of my mom and she said I couldn't come home, but she would give me an old car of theirs to use.  At least now I had my paychecks.  I bought the cheapest tent I could find and commuted to work from my campsite every day.  I barely ate that summer so I could afford to get an apartment by the time fall and school came around.  Since I was a minor, I wouldn't be able to get one on my own.  An older friend I had from Subway did me a massive favor and signed a lease for me so I could have my own place.  I paid him the rent and he's still a great friend of mine.  That year in school was one of the best in my life.  I finally had some freedom, didn't worry too much about money, and answered to none but my own high standards.  I could finally hang out with friends like a normal teenager, though I was still very straight laced and never partied.  I just spent a lot of time at this basement coffee shop, reading, drawing, and knitting, and chatting with other regulars.  I still managed to get straight A's and take advanced classes even though I no longer had a computer at home.  By the summer before senior year, I was pretty fed up with working at Subway.  I knew I could do better so I applied at a temp agency where they tested computer skills.  I had learned to type really fast when I had limited time to do my assignments, and I got a well-paying temp job entering tax return data in a big warehouse building by the airport.  I was so good at it that when all the temp work was done, they offered me a permanent job at the State government office.  I took it, and finished my high school diploma taking night classes.  I ended up with a 4.0, and the recommendations of many teachers and counselors.

I had quite a bit of money saved at that point and decided it was time to head for the big city.  I moved to Portland and applied for hundreds of jobs.  I had dozens of interviews, but I decided I was only going to choose the absolute best.  I got a paid internship at a litigation research firm.  They were exceptionally nice to me and the office environment was awesome.  It was a gorgeous building and unless you had a meeting with somebody important you could wear whatever you wanted.  They offered me basically unlimited overtime at time and a half, and if you worked more than 10 hours in a day they gave you $40 per diem for dinner (which I usually saved $30 of).  I ended up working about 80 hours a week for a month, and they loved me so much they promoted me immediately, with 50% more pay.  A few months later I got promoted again, and started travelling to work on special projects.  I stayed in a spa in San Francisco for a month, and when I was in D.C. my hotel room had a view of the capitol building.  I went from nothing to more than I ever could have imagined, as a 19 year old kid.  I was the youngest person in the company, and won a bunch of awards at the company party that year.  It was mostly luck combined with a bit of hard work, but I was so proud of myself.

Then things started happening in the company.  I noticed, here and there, little inconsistencies in data.  I would mention them to the higher ups and they would say they would take care of it.  It seemed to happen only with certain cases, and eventually I figured out a pattern.  It was illegal and unethical.  I was disgusted.  I had never before put myself at risk by breaking the law, and I was somehow caught up in this unknowingly.  At that point, they were offering to pay for my tuition at school if I agreed to work part time throughout and come back after law school.  I had always wanted to go to school, but never even considered studying law.  Now I was wrapped up with a company that I couldn't stand by morally.  I finally realized why they had treated me so well.  I was naive, and blinded by the lifestyle, and they thought I would do whatever they wanted because I was a loyal employee.  I had so much money saved up, I decided I would quit and come back to my home state and go to college. I worked until a few weeks before school started and paid out of pocket for my first two years.  In those years, I worked really hard, did very well in classes, and won the campus-wide ""Student Employee of the Year"" award at my new position, and a city ""Outstanding Volunteer of the Year"" award for my work with a local organization that provides low-income housing.  My favorite professor would come visit me at work and told all my co-workers I was his ""star student.""  I was on top of the world again.  I went on a class trip with him to Latin America, where we stayed with a tribe of native people and learned their methods of sustainable farming.  We traveled mostly by boat, and a few days before we left, I got stuck in the back of the boat, where water sprayed everywhere.  I tried to keep my mouth closed but some inevitably got in.  I felt fine until I was in the Atlanta airport, and ordered my first American food in two months.  Ironically, it was a Subway sandwich.  I got very sick and couldn't keep it down before my flight home.  I figured it was no big deal and it was just shock from eat too much after a few months of different food.  I got home and was organizing a big fundraising event for an internship I had with a non-profit organization.  I felt fine for a few days, but was very busy and didn't have much of an appetite.  There was donated pizza at my training event for volunteers and I remember waiting to eat until everything was done because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep it down.  I went to the doctor the next day, and I let them know I had been out of the country.  They said I had probably just picked up a weird virus and they couldn't do anything.  I made it through the day of the event, but was supposed to head out to the coast for a three week vacation with my grandmother the next day.  I went, but I spent a week eating basically nothing.  I would try to eat a little here or there but it would just give me terrible stomach cramps.  I finally stopped eating entirely and started feeling much better.  I still had plenty of energy and in general didn't feel too bad so I wasn't too worried about it.  The day before the vacation ended I decided I was feeling well enough and ate a whole pancake for breakfast.  That was more than I'd eaten at one sitting in about a month.  I became violently ill and my grandma rushed me to the nearest hospital about an hour away.  In the emergency room, they found that I was severely dehydrated and malnourished.  They tested me immediately for giardia, expressing frustration that my doctor in town hadn't tested for it initially.  They gave me a strong antibiotic that made me even sicker for a day, but the next day I felt 100% better.  I don't remember what I ate, but I know it was good.  It changed the way I think about food forever.

A few weeks later, I went on a trip with my best friend and was so lethargic all I wanted to do was eat and sleep.  It was supposed to be my birthday trip so my friend was (understandably) frustrated that we weren't even having any fun.  It just wasn't like me.  We got back and I went to the doctor again.  Mono.  My body was apparently in such a weak state from the giardia that mono lasted about 8 months, if not longer.  I continued to go to school and work, but didn't do as well as I had done before, and by the Spring semester I decided to go part time.  I had fallen into a bit of a depression.  By the time summer rolled around, I was fed up with school and my desk job completely and got a job backpacking in the wilderness.  I had plenty of backpacking experience, but doing it alone was another ordeal.  I felt so strong at times, and incredibly weak at others.  By the end of summer, I was even more stressed out by bear encounters, wildfires, and a mountain lion stalking me, that I quit a few weeks early to go to rainbow gathering, where I thought I might find some peace.

And this is where the real tragedy of my life began.  I was in my tent at rainbow when I was raped and chased through the woods by a drunk/high dread-locked giant who kept yelling he loved me so he was going to kill me.  I spent the rainy night hiding in the woods and in the morning a friend I had made there immediately took me home.  We never talked about it.

I spent the next year jobless, homeless, taking rideshares around the country, living off what I had saved from my backpacking job.  I went by a different name, lived as my alter-ego, and somehow managed to be carefree and recover somewhat.  I came back to my town and got an internship on a farm, where I traded work for room and board.  I met a nice guy who respected me.  I was stuck on the farm because I wasn't making any money, so my boyfriend asked me to move in with him until I could get back on my feet.  I got a job at a thrift store for our YWCA where I thought I would have more resources to recover from my trauma (being a women's organization and all).  I worked there for a year and saved up quite a bit of money.  A male volunteer there, who had dreadlocks, ended up requesting to work with me on each of my shifts, and his behavior (and, admittedly, the dreadlocks) started triggering me.  One day I spotted him from my window sitting in his car near my house, and he didn't move for an hour.  It was too much for me, and I told my supervisor I didn't feel comfortable working with him.  They didn't believe me and refused to release one of their desperately-needed volunteers. I quit and got a job managing a strawberry and raspberry farm for the summer.  They were great people, paid me well and gave me a ton of free veggies.  That summer I got an awesome new apartment and applied to go back to school for the first time in a few years.  I was finally getting my life back on track.  It was a great summer until a few days before my birthday, a week before school started, my boyfriend and I broke up.  I was distraught but began school-provided therapy the day that school started.  I thought I just had social anxiety and had never told anyone about the rape.  A few weeks into therapy I decided it was time.  I was diagnosed with PTSD and we began working on exposure therapy.  My therapist at the time wasn't the right fit for me and the exposure exacerbated my symptoms, leading to me dropping a few classes (I was taking a full course load, but not working).  I stopped and tried to repair myself, but nothing really worked.  It's amazing the different ways trauma can affect you, in ways that seem completely unrelated to what actually happened to you.  At the end of last semester, I started seeing a new therapist who fits me better.  We haven't talked much about my trauma yet, but I feel like I'm doing much better in the day to day life.

However, when I applied for financial aid this semester, I didn't find out until a week ago that I wasn't eligible because of the classes that I dropped.  I have to go through the appeal process and in order to do that my therapist has to say that I've improved enough to return to school.  I talked to her earlier today, and it doesn't seem like that will happen.  I even called up my parents, to see if they could help me with the $2,000 I need for tuition.  I've never asked them for anything before, but in a way I feel like they owe it to me.  For me, it doesn't even seem like that much money, except that I have no way of getting it by next Tuesday.

Basically, all these little steps I've taken over the past 3 years have built me up to this point.  I am finally feeling much better, but to have school taken away also means that I can't work my student job, which will be another set back.

I hope everything comes through.  I'm just crossing my fingers at this point, because there's nothing else I can do.  I've worked really hard just to stay afloat these last years.  I was starting to feel like I was on top of it again.  Based on my past experiences, I know I can overcome pretty much anything, I'm just getting impatient.  I'm trying SO HARD, but it's such a slow process.  I just have to keep reminding myself to stay optimistic, to take pleasure in the little things, and not blame myself.  I'm trying, that's all I can do.

It took me a while to figure out music is my passion that I want to pursue. I played in high school band but didn't continue it immediately in college. When I finally did start taking college music performance &amp; audio production courses which I did enjoy, I had to drop out because I couldn't keep up with full-time college and full-time work. A short time later I landed and IT job and I've been in IT for 10 years since. I really can't stand what I do as a career and the 50-60 hour work weeks. Now I'm wishing that I had stuck it out with music in college when I had the chance. I've got too much debt and obligations to consider internships in music production fields and things of that nature. I could maybe work out a schedule arrangement at work where I could go back to school for music/audio if it is even worth my time. So I guess what I'm getting at is I'm wondering how many out there have had a primary job they didn't really care for and have worked out a music/recording profession on the side until they finally got to live the dream full-time? Is this even possible or is it just a dream? What steps can be taken or advice do you have to make for greater chance of success?  

I'm interested in recording my own music projects and other band's/group's projects as well. I also wouldn't be opposed to some related fields either like video game scores/foley, movie scores/foley, and live sound (with not a lot of travel).   

As a side question, has anyone in here gone to [The Recording Arts Academy](http://www.benblankmedia.com/) in Austin, TX and if so how was it?

**Word Journal - machine**


The things that interested me the most were always the things that made my life easier to manage. They were man-made contraptions that helped me finish my tasks faster and gather information.  They are all machines. 

I decided to look up the word ‘machine’ which had many definitions. One of which was a very technical definition which defined the word as “A device consisting of fixed and moving parts that modifies mechanical energy and transmits it in a more useful form.” There were also other similar ones such as “A system or device for doing work...together with its power source and auxiliary equipment” and “A system or device that performs or assists in the performance of human task.” An interesting phenomenon was that machines were not just defined as tools but the human body is also considered a machine. The definition was “An intricate natural system or organism.” Other definitions were “A person who acts in a rigid, mechanical, or unconscious manner” and “An organized group of people whose members are or appear to be under the control of one or more leaders.”
	
The Indo-European root of machine is “magh-”. Magh means to be able, have power. Some of its derivatives are may, dismay, might, main, machine, mechanic, and magic. The definitions of these derivatives span from to frighten and power. The derivatives that interested me the most were might and magic. 
Magic is defined as the art of practice of using charms, spells, or rituals to attempt to produce supernatural effects or control events in nature. If is from Old French magique, from Late Latin magic, and other words similar in spelling and sound.

Might, in The Free Dictionary by Farlex, is defined as great power, force, or influence held by a person or group. It is from Old English meaht. It is also a synonym for strength and power.
The relationship of the word might to the word machine is very interesting but not unpredictable. Today, much of the power and dominant strength of many countries and organizations is provided by the machines, such as guns, which they control. Machines give their users might. I found that the might also means physical strength which is expected as well since the many of the machines today use steel or some other form of metal for majority of its body. Metals are one the hardest substances available to us on our planet.

The fact that machine is related to magic is something that caught my eye and came as a surprise to me. Especially because machines are the main cause of disbelief in magic in today’s world. Many people use science and machines as an excuse to disbelieve in powerful beings that use magic, prime example is God. The Oxford English Dictionary defines the word magic as “To transform, produce.” The, instead of contradicting, shows similarities between the words since many of the large machines today are used in factories and everyday life to produce many new items and wells as transform terrain and other resources into buildings and others things of use to humans.

The relationship between magic and machine is also a bit logical since it is possible for people to consider development of machinery to be some sort of magic due to the lack of science and proper understanding of the developments made during the time.

The breakthroughs in machinery at the present day almost seem to be magical.

1m8vpa,1,2013-09-12,Undergraduate senior majoring in Advertising and Media Productions looking for career advice,[deleted],marketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/1m8vpa/undergraduate_senior_majoring_in_advertising_and/,"So I go to a pretty well known university with an amazing journalism program, but now that I've finally gotten to my senior year I'm feeling a little lost when it comes to figuring out what to do next. I was initially a graphic design major, but switched into advertising because I got more enjoyment out of the in-person interactions as opposed to staring at a computer screen for hours. I have experience in social media marketing and outside sales thanks to summer internships. I also have a leadership position in marketing for a fairly large student organization. The problem is that after doing my outside sales internship I kind of changed my mind about where my career was going. I just didn't enjoy my time in sales at all and realized I have some ethical issues with advertising/marketing when it comes to the clients you approach and what you do for them. More and more I'm feeling a pull towards the field of market research or sales analysis as  career options, but I just don't know where to start. Anyone who could just give some general advice regarding which companies I could start applying at or looking into I'd greatly appreciate it."

Even though I am not committed and/or attending one of these engineering schools until the spring semester should I look and apply for interships anyway? I will probably be entering in as a sophomore, with all electives, Eng Comp I and II, Calc I and II, Chem I and II, Physics I, Macro &amp; Microeconomics, and Bio I and II all done(I am currently in some of these classes).


I have a 3.9 GPA, 45.0 credits done (61 credits done by the beginning of spring semester), PTK, and 3 years of full time work experience at an asphalt plant(half the year was spent in the QC lab and half in the weighmaster tower).

If I take petroleum fluids, ordinary differential equations, fluid mechanics, mechanics, thermodynamics, and earth’s crust course (This is the suggested curriculum for Pet E sophomore students at NM Tech during spring semester, for an example), will I be caught up to other people in the Pet E program in the companies' eyes that will be looking at my resume?

Overall, I am unsure how to approach an internship, and it is hard to find advice for someone in my shoes. I really don't want next summer to be ""wasted"", by missing any opportunity to have an internship and experience in the field under my belt. How can I make the best of my situation, any and all constructive advice is very welcome.
Sorry for the wall of text, TL DR Internship advice for a Pet E majored student transferring into spring semester(sophomore year).

EDIT: On a side note the schools I've applied to are NM Tech(was accepted), LSU(Pre-engineering acceptance), WVU and UH(both I'm still waiting to hear back from). I'm currently tweaking my essay for OU."

Ik werk voor een klein bedrijfje en om kosten te besparen willen ze intern de archieven bewaren en niet meer het opslaan daarvan uitbesteden. Helaas hebben ze ook nog eens ruimtegebrek! Ik moet dus hun archief uitdunnen en dat kost nogal wat tijd. 

Ik houd nogal van IT en dergelijke dus had al een systeem bedacht om het gewoon in te scannen, de kosten per dossiers in digitaal geheugen zouden vele malen lager liggen dan de kosten zijn om dit uit te dunnen. Dat is inclusief de tijd die het zou kosten om ze te scannen en scan-klaar te maken.

Volgens de eigenaar zijn er problemen met de belastingdienst, die willen namelijk harde kopieën van de archieven. Maar wat blijkt, er zijn mogelijkheden om het toch te doen, nou lopen daar de kosten vaak op tot de 30 duizend euro voor zo'n in-house systeem. 

Ik zou zelf ook zoiets voor veel minder in elkaar kunnen zetten maar daar zijn blijkbaar legale problemen mee omdat de douane en belastingdienst dit zouden moeten kunnen controleren...

Weet iemand daar meer over? Zo ja, wat mag wel/niet? Kun je ook bronnen citeren voor me? :)

The problem is now that I have graduated, I find myself longing for a CS job but sorely lacking in practical experience. My course work has given me knowledge in statistics, biology and computer science but I have had 0 internships and have done very little project work outside of courses. How do I begin to build up this experience?

1m8o3i,0,2013-09-12,"FR (good girl, so close to going home with me) + question about ASD reframing",[deleted],seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1m8o3i/fr_good_girl_so_close_to_going_home_with_me/,"Hey guys, I haven't posted here before but I need some advice now. The reason why I post here and not on askseddit is because the question is more general and the following is just a good example case that happened today, also the FR part might help some guys out there.

The girl: Taiwanese, beautiful, health conscious (skinny, doesn't drink, exercises), self-disciplined, traditional values, dancer and does masters for teaching English, 25yo, had 2 bfs, last kiss 3 years ago, considers herself to be a ""good girl"" (hasn't had sex outside of a relationship), I met her on okcupid

She is very into me, said the compliments I gave her are the best she ever got and said I have good genes (she likes my eye color, hair, height, skin color) and a lot of other IOIs etc.

(tl;dr below)

The situation:
I'm currently in Taiwan for an internship, will leave the country on the 27th, the girl lives in a different city far away and is only here for 3 days (yesterday, today and tomorrow).

Yesterday we ate spring rolls together for lunch but I was so tired from the night before that I didn't really escalate and my tonality and posture weren't the best but she was always touching me on arms etc. and today she asked if I wanted to accompany her to visit an exhibition in a museum because her friend can't go. I know it's her frame but still agree because what do I have to lose and I haven't been to that museum yet, and I tell myself to escalate more today because I felt really bad for not doing it yesterday (but today I was also tired because last night I pulled a girl from the club and only slept ~4 hours).

It's an exhibition about Aliens, not very interesting (nothing new), but dimmed lights etc. and I escalate, and there is a dark room where one could go through a 3d maze of lazers and if one triggers a lazer it's game over (like in James Bond movies (no idea what that has to do with Aliens but whatever)) so I see the opportunity and tell her we should go through that maze, at the end I go in for the kiss, she verbally objects slightly at first but holds her mouth close to my mouth expectantly, so I kiss her and she reciprocates, with tongue (very good kisser).

Then we go out and to some private corner, make out etc. we walk around and asks me when my last kiss was, whether I lie to girls, if I still like my ex gf etc.

We continue walking around in circles and making out in between, there are no people around...

She always reciprocates when I kiss, also escalates me and moans when I make out against a wall etc.
She tells me her last kiss was 3 years ago, she has traditional values etc.

She really wants to have sex (and tells me that she wants but can't) but has this internal conflict, says it's too fast and she wants to get to know me better first, but she often says we are a great match...

I breathe slowly and tell her she should follow her feelings and that it's not wrong just because society tells her that etc. And I tell her I'm good in bed (all girls I've been with said I'm a 10 in bed) and she won't regret etc. but she is afraid that I'll break her heart somehow..

During the makeouts she always says ""this is crazy"" and shaking her body while laughing and she got very close to going home with me and asking me if I use condoms. But always objects something like ""I don't wear sexy underwear"" (""You don't need underwear to be sexy""), ""I'm not prepared"" (""What do you mean?"" She tries to explain it but is ashamed, I didn't quite understand what she meant, she said something with ""finger"" and mentioned again that her last sex was 3 years ago, maybe she meant her pussy has gotten too tight during those 3 years and she hasn't prepared it with her finger? Does that even happen? Did you guys ever come across this?). 

After I invalidate all her excuses she wants to come with me, asks me how far my place is.

Her relative is planning to pick her up in half an hour, and she wants to make a call to tell him she has ""other plans"", but then at the phone she talks for a very long time (like 20 minutes) (in Chinese of course, and my Chinese is too bad to understand) during which I kiss her, play with her hair and kiss her neck and afterwards she said he'll pick her up soon so she can't go. Then we have to go outside where he's waiting with the car.

I tell her then we meet tonight but she can't, ""then tomorrow"" - ""maybe"".


I really like her and the fact that she is health conscious and has good self-discipline and strong values etc. and if I was here longer I would want to start a relationship with her.

Btw, I'm 22, lost my virginity in July with my first gf (had her for one month) and have been practicing like mad (my friends call me ""THE MACHINE"") since I'm in Taiwan (beginning of August), mostly club and online game. (I haven't posted on seddit before because so far I learned everything from other sources and feedback from girls)

tl;dr: Awesome girl, really wants to have sex but has a rule against it and has strong values and self-discipline.


My questions:

1. What's the best reframe for this internal conflict?

2. What did I do wrong, should I have used more push/pull or something else? (so that I can do better next time) I think I could have done something better when she was so close to going home with me before she changed her mind (but what? she had to make the call).

3. How to overcome ASD with girls who really are ""good girls"" (most articles only deal with ASD that promiscuous girls put up). I'm always tempted to argue logically (I'm good in bed, you won't regret, it's a win-win situation) but girls respond more to emotions than logic. But is it unconducive to say those things? And how to convey the same message emotionally?

4. What's the best strategy to get her tomorrow? (getting her drunk is out of the question because neither her nor I like to drink and drunk sex sucks. Also she told me one of her requirements for a bf is that he doesn't drink which I like)

5. When she was on the phone talking for so long what should I have done? I know some guys would take the phone away but that would have made her mad. Also, was it counter-productive to kino her while she was talking on the phone (projects too much neediness?)

6. Did I behave too needy in general because of not using ""push""?

(The questions apply to any girl with similar background, so they are more general)

I'm not desperate for her (have other girls) but I'd like to know what I could have done better or how I could get such a girl in the future. Because the other girls I get are usually more promiscuous but I want to be able to get non-promiscuous girls in the future too.

I know you may think the best strategy would be to play longer game over a series of dates with such girls, but she's only here for 3 days and I'm only in Taiwan until 27th.
I'm sure some guys out there have gotten such girls in 3 dates or less so I'm interested in how it's possible in general.


If I were a girl and really attracted to a guy so that I wanted him for a relationship I'd probably also wait a few dates before having sex (so as not to appear easy) but if I knew he wouldn't be available for a relationship (esp. moving away so that he couldn't tell anyone) then I'd probably fuck him earlier (because then I can't hold him anyway). Is that just me or do you think it's a good strategy instead of giving a girl hope for a relationship to tell her that it won't lead to a relationship and that she should ""enjoy life"" while she is finding someone for a relationship? (She asked me what will happen after I leave, I said, she'd find someone else and be happy, and that she should enjoy life.)"
1m8nvd,1,2013-09-12,Is it me or the job market?,virtuallife,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1m8nvd/is_it_me_or_the_job_market/,"Summary of my experience, or perhaps my lack of due to lots of long bouts with no job:

1996-2001 = 2 jobs using databases, programming and general IT skills which I loved very much and paid very well. Dallas area.

2001-2003 = Out of work and struggling to get back into IT. Never made it back before breaking my neck in a 3 story fall in 2003. Moved to the Carolinas to heal up with my retired parents.

2004-2007 = Struggled to still return to IT without any success. Started community college and even contemplated getting into radiology tech due to lack of success. Still in the Carolinas.

2007-2011 = Finally decided on an Information Management B.A. after deciding Radiology was probably not a good fit, plus rumors of saturation in that job function as well. Graduated in 2011.

2011-2012. Internship programming for a local college turned into a job that lasted a year and finally allowed me to move out of my folks home.

2012-Present. The internship turned job laid me off leaving me searching again (yes, in the carolinas) for something computer related. I had been able to collect unemployment and searched and interviewed for a year with my only result being a stack of email rejection letters.  

Do I not have enough experience for even a Junior level computer job? I have been searching for everything from Help Desk at a data center to Junior  programmer to even IT Director. The last one did offer that they interviewed lots of people with more experience than I.

I had thought I could at least land something that would pay me a decent wage $15/hr or so while I gain more experience. I could have sought certifications to add to my degree while unemployed, but figured I had time later to do that once I figured out what job function I would end up in.

In the end, When my unemployment ran out all I found willing to hire me were a temp service for industrial work for $9 an hour and a call center for $8 an hour. I accepted the call center work, but I really need to make more cash than that. badly.

Is there that many people out of work with a Bachelor's or higher or more work experience that are beating me out? What gives? Advice?

Go.

I'm a double major CS/Math student w/ a 3.something GPA going into my fifth and final year. I can easily graduate in spring, and am looking to either go to grad school, or get a job. Here's the thing: I have had no internships, I don't have any solo non-school projects, and things are generally looking sub-optimal from my point of view.

I plan on working on some projects here pretty soon, so that should be taken care of.

Here's the part I need advice on. I'm considering pushing back my graduation to summer at the earliest, fall at the latest, dependent on a few things.

I have three options, as I see it.

1. Apply and get accepted to grad school for fall '14 semester.
2. Find a job for when I get out of school after summer semester.
3. Get an internship for summer '14 and graduate fall '14.

So, if option 3 is going to be there, I need to have a class left over to take in fall so I can legitimately say I'm in school. This class (I've already picked it out) is also offered in summer, so I could graduate in summer if options 1 or 2 happen.

I would prefer to go to grad school over internship or job, but I would only pay for it myself (rather than get my future employer to pay for it) if I get into a very good school. My GPA is sufficient to get into a competitive program, so I'm only a little worried about that. I can graduate in summer, so as to leave option 3 open, and start in fall.

Finding a job for after graduation (in summer) is preferable over an internship, but not as desirable as grad school. I can then get my employer to pay for grad school at a local university (who cares at that point how competitive they are), assuming my employer *will* pay for grad school.

So grad school &gt; job &gt; internship. But to leave all three open, I have to follow the above stated graduation schedule.

So am I crazy? Should I just say ""fuck an internship, its too late now"" and graduate in spring? Advice?"

Hello, I saw a decent amount of posts by you in the engineering and engineeringstudents sections talking about PE. I am interested in transferring to a PE program in the spring, and have already sent out some applications. I was accepted to NM tech, accepted to Pre-Engineering to LSU, and awaiting response from UH and WVU. I am tweaking my essay for OU, Texas Tech, and A&amp;M. Out of those schools which do you think I should attend, meaning which ones do you think I could get the most offers at internships and jobs, and who is the ""top"" in the industry.
Outside of school, I am curious as to what your typical day is like, I saw your post about you analyzing Decline Curve Analysis and cost efficiency, but do you do other things in your job. As a PE could I expect to see a decent amount of field work (other than working on an oil rig) and going to the field to look at prospects?
In light of the fact of typing this I should have asked if I could ask you some questions, so if you don't feel like responding I completely understand. If not thank you very much for your time.

Always happy to help a future PE!
As for which to attend, I'd stay away from Texas Tech. OU and A&amp;M have the best reputations, though UH, LSU, and WVU have respectable programs as well.
As for job offers, etc, social skills and school involvement trump your school and your GPA almost every time, assuming reputable school and above a 3.0.
You've seen my other posts regarding my day to day so I won't elaborate too much: DCA and project generation are essentially what I do. Field-wise, I'm a reservoir engineer, which means I do most of my work in the office. I very rarely visit the field (once per quarter, max) and even then I don't leave the field office. If you do want to see the field, look for jobs as a drilling engineer or a production engineer.
Do me a favor though, cross-post these questions to /r/engineeringstudents so everyone can see and provide their insight. If you've got more questions, feel free to dig through my comment history, as I've answered quite a few, lol.
Hope this helps!"

So I was able to find a 2-day pass for Beyond Wonderland for only $120 (compared to $170). I live in the SoCal area, so I'll be taking a shuttle (since airfares are quite costly) to get to the Bay Area for Beyond Wonderland. I will be going with my friend whom I've known since the 2nd grade back in the Philippines, and I'll be meeting up with my other friend who goes to SCU, and who's also from the same school I was in from the Philippines. My birthday is on 9/23, so going to Beyond (28th to 29th) will be a really awesome way to celebrate it, and mind you, I'm not the type who celebrates. The only problem is that my mother, who is getting more unreasonably paranoid like everyday, won't allow me. You see, she lives in the Philippines and her point is that I came here to study and succeed, and going to these stuff wasn't part of the ""plan"". I never had problems with my studies, heck, I even graduated high school with honors. In fact, I'm applying for honors classes during the winter sem, and I even applied for an internship with Disney. I am doing all that I can to do well, and I think it's fair enough that I get some fun. Out of respect and being a good daughter that I am, I recently just asked her permission if I could go, she automatically said no. I tried to talk it out, she said she didn't want to get pissed so I'd rather shut up about it. She is paranoid with the fact that some crazy shit might happen to me, like someone might put some date-rape drug in my water bottle or something. Her reasons for me not going is really crazy and somewhat illogical. I understand that she just really cares for me, but by doing so, she is locking me up from all the fun that I could have. I know, she's in the Philippines, she's miles away, so I can just escape without her knowing, right? Nope. She can FaceTime me, or even ask my sister to check if I'm in my place. The worst part is that if I do some crazy shit, she threatens me that she will fly all the way here just to fetch me back to the Philippines. This is really crazy. 
Reddit, how in the fuck can I be able to convince her to allow me to go?! I really wanna go to this so badly."

I asked earlier today here if that implied a drug test and all signs point to yes.

Long story short, I want to clear myself ASAP just in case. I am a short, skinny female with a high metabolism but I've been just about a daily smoker for like a year so that counts against me. However, I can make an eighth last me a month so I'm not smoking a large quantity. I have no idea how long it'll take me to clean out, could be anywhere from a week to a month.

This is going to sound silly, but I've been losing sleep the past 4 years over this.
When I was 14 years old, I used to visit unsavory parts of the internet (4chan) and use P2P software.
One day, someone posted child pornography.
I panicked and reported the incident to the IC3 - a website affiliated with the FBI specifically focused on ""White collar crime"" and internet crime.
After that, I try to avoid browsing shady parts of the web. I also made it a habit to report anything sketchy to the IC3. Anything from people bragging about stealing identities to threats against someones life written on facebook.
I made sure to report anything and everything in the legal grey area.

It's 4 years later. I'm a University student and planning on applying for several internships in different branches of the government. I have never been arrested. I have never been stopped at the airport for being on a no-fly list. 

Will the reports I filed effect my background check?

I've skimmed through this subreddit and found a few posts that somewhat pertain to my concerns, but I figured I'd post anyway to see if I can get some more specific feedback.

Next week I'm starting an internship at a social service agency right off Bushwick Ave, near the Bushwick/Aberdeen L train stop. My supervisor warned me about gang activity in the area and that it's something I should look out for. When I asked him for some tips, he basically told me ""You're a New Yorker, you know what to do."" While I try to be as street smart as possible (I don't listen to music while walking around, try not to be conspicuous with my cell phone, etc.), I have little experience in areas with gang-related crimes. 

Because I am a rather small white woman, this has become a bit of a concern for me. It was explained to me that while it's unlikely I would ever be the target of gang violence, it is possible to get caught in the wrong place at the wrong time. I guess what I really want to know is if there are particular times of day/times of the year that I should be wary of particular streets or anything like that. Do gang members tend to do any type of initiation in the area that I should try to avoid? Also, I know this is kind of a silly question, but what the hell do I do if I find myself near a gang fight and they take notice of me? 

I'm probably worrying myself way more than necessary, but I just want to be prepared and able to get to and from my internship as safely as possible.

-I don't switch in until Spring. 

-I started College Math at the algebra level (lowest) and I'm up to PreCalc II with A's in everything so far (Re-doing math from the beginning has helped me to get a firm grasp on the subject).

- I'm a sophomore. 

How can I start preparing for next semester now? I want to hit the ground running.
-Learn Physics? I feel this will be the hardest subject for me.
-Any other recommendations?

Internships - My school does not offer 6 month co-op programs but they do have summer internships and have given me a list of employers they work with. 

When can I start applying? Should I wait until next summer since I will have such little experience?

Miscellaneous - I'm taking a coding course this semester and find it interesting but challenging - should I continue to build this skill, will it be beneficial when applying in the future?

I am working on my Master's in Education right now. (Fun, but relatively unrelated fact, my undergrad was in special education.) My internship this year is working with high schoolers in an alternative setting! It's a fantastic group of kids and an amazing school, and I'm so grateful for this opportunity, as almost all of my previous teaching experience has been from pre-k to middle school. This school is really small (30 students!) and has a tiny, but amazing, staff of FIVE! They are a fantastic group of educators and I'm so lucky to work amongst them. They are INCREDIBLY open minded, and really just fantastic people in general.

So anyways, I'm teaching a unit to a group of eight students around the theme of ""health"". We're talking mental, physical, emotional, sleep, sex, sexuality, relationships, fitness, nutrition, the whole nine yards, plus any other topics they/I think are interesting/necessary. I have a LOT of freedom and am encouraged to try new things. I know past students in my program who've had this internship have definitely delved into sex ed and other ""controversial"" topics, but have been met with full support from both the staff and the students.

I'm really excited about the prospect of entering a field I find interesting so I didn't mind taking a pay cut, but I'm not sure if I actually have the offer or not.

There were essentially 4 stages of the application. I've completed a basic initial interview on the phone (stuff like ""what are your salary expectations?"" and ""will you need sponsorship to work here?""), a technical interview on the phone, and a coding assignment. After this, they stated that they qualified me for their internship position and told me the monthly pay. They said that if the pay was acceptable, I should let them know when I would be available for an in-person interview (which is currently scheduled for tomorrow).

My question is... basically, do I actually have an offer or not?

1mcj94,2,2013-09-13,I'm in a very tough situation. Need advice on my internship,Cyndikate,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1mcj94/im_in_a_very_tough_situation_need_advice_on_my/,"4 weeks ago, I was hired at an internship. It's a design firm where you edit wedding, model and celebrity pictures, and the place pays really well. Well, I'm an unpaid intern. The employer and I got along well, and he decided to hire me because though he had very high standards and was rejected twice, I asked him to train me up to his standards. Without an internship, I stand no chance of real employment without gaining experience. 

Basically, when I was first at the studio, I spent 6 hours going through 7000 wedding photos and selecting them, and then editing them. Some of the employees there liked how I selected photos with emotion and togetherness. They trained me on basic lightroom, just a little. On the editing side(It was the first time ever using lightroom) the employer wasn't satisfied with my editing and decided that I'd be interning at home. I was like okay.

Once a week, I get people to send me photos now and then for me to edit and send back. But the boss wasn't exactly satisfied with my editing. He didn't tell me exactly what was wrong so I can fix it. I get sent wedding photos to edit from the boss's assistant for her to critique it later. I sent photos to her and all I get from her is ""It's good."" but when it gets sent to someone else, they had a different opinion.

This week I was sent modeling photos to edit for critique. I managed to edit a couple of photos while following the instructions on the email that was sent to me. I sent some of the photos to her, not as finished, but for her to review. She said ""so far it's good, I'm going to send the pictures to Maria to see what she thinks."" and when I got the text back I get a message from the assistant that Maria{boss's daughter} suggested not to finish the photos, but to practice on the ones I already have. I asked what was wrong, and she gave me one issue that took me 15 minutes to fix. And not long after the text, all of the images from my Dropbox folder was deleted. I feel like people have suddenly given up on me.

I'm a little upset because I'm not getting enough training that I asked for. I was sent home with a few hundred tutorials that didn't help me all that much and I was asked to look on youtube and look for tutorials on photo editing. Unfortunately, I wasn't taught this at school and I told my boss that. I'm just a little irritated that I'm sending photos to people only to not get enough constructive criticism that I need to help myself improve. I know how to use photoshop and lightroom, but I'm still growing in the design field.

Honestly, I would have been fine at interning at home, if I had more sufficient training. It's like they send me photos and expect me to be perfect.

I don't know what to do at this point. I called my boss and left him a voice mail. So I'm waiting for his message. I'm going to tell him that I need to be at his studio and have someone look over my shoulder while I'm working. To be honest, this work at home stuff isn't working anymore.

Advice anyone?"

I am assisting with banding birds travelling through the area during the fall migration. I will only be here for seven weeks but I want to immerse myself in this place. Step one is getting a library card tomorrow. In the mean time, could you help me with a few questions?

1) I've never seen a firefly. Any freak chance I could see one this late in the season?
2) Where do I go for local beer? 
3) I love to adventure outside - climb, hike, backpack, you name it. I brought some of my gear and am hoping to get out before it gets too cold. Where should I/ can I go? 
4) Speaking of, anyone need a climbing buddy?
5) I also enjoy judo (particularly when gross outside). I have found a few judo dojos listed online. Anyone have personal experience with judo in the community?
6) Where can I get local grocery items? Any farmers markets, U-pick farms, community accessible fruit trees? 

Thank you so much! I hope to run into you around town!

EDIT- Went to Bells with the other interns. It was great! Thank you all so much for the suggestions and advice. I will be incorporating much of it into my stay here. If you learn of any fun events around town let me know! See you around!"

I would appreciate some feedback on my future plans!",Mesian,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1mciyk/i_have_a_general_plan_a_written_budget_and_a_good/,"I am single, live alone, and work as a Reliability Engineer.  I make a very good living, so I decided to not get a roommate.  I graduated this past May and have been working for several months, but I was an intern for a long time before that.  I have no debt (worked a total of five jobs during school, but only ever two at one time).  I had my emergency fund already stashed away during college ($8k - I live on $1,750 a month without cutting ""frilly"" expenses).

I have never been a spender.  I have lived on my own for three years, and I am very comfortable with a written budget.  I use the envelope system.

I enjoy my job, but I'm not one to stay in one place for long.  I know my company is doing quite a lot to invest in me, so I'm not going to screw them over either.  I plan on staying at LEAST three years.  At my current savings rate, I should have $50,000 stashed away between my index funds, emergency fund, and cash in the bank at the end of three years here.  That does not include the saving I have done in retirement accounts.  My 401k would be vested by this time.

At the end of three years (maybe longer), I plan on doing one of several things:

 - Go to work for an airline (worked briefly for one - I enjoyed the free flights) which is not my current industry anymore.  It would be a decent pay cut (20-25%).

 - Work for FEMA (My aunt and uncle do this as responders.  They enjoy it as a retirement job.  They are both engineers like me)

 - Volunteer someplace crazy like EWB.  I like helping people, and spending a few years with little/no pay but using my engineering skills to help others would be fun.

My current savings rate is 35% of my take home pay (not including 401k).  I put an additional 10% of my overall salary into 401k, with my employer matching 8% (they have a weird equation for matches).

 - Should I just continue working until I can retire (and hopefully retire early at this rate) 

or 

 - Should I take a few years off/pay drop and let my savings in investments compound while I do my own thing?

I have lived the poor college student lifestyle.  I actually didn't mind it.  I feel like my current 22k a year lifestyle is the dream life.  I am always feeling like I'm spending way too much.

I know 50k is nothing to retire on.  It is just a number that I am comfortable taking a leap with.   I live on about 22k a year right now.  Obviously that will go up with inflation.  

Is 50k too little to make these types of leaps?

I enjoy my work, but recently a coworker died.  We had lunch the day before his death and he told me about a dream he had to start his own company.  He planed on starting it in about three years, after he had enough to retire on.  I have a passion in aviation maintenance, but the job I wanted wasn't available.  I do really like my current job, but I would not show up if I wasn't paid.  I would come in every day to play with aircraft, regardless of pay.  And I love volunteer work, so EWB or FEMA would be great for me.

I know I have three years to decide, but I like the input of others.  I love having a plan.  I don't want to be putting too much emotion in this.

Thank you!"
1mciu1,1,2013-09-13,Help dissecting a phone interview I had on Tuesday?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1mciu1/help_dissecting_a_phone_interview_i_had_on_tuesday/,"So in a nutshell, I applied online for a summer internship for 2014 with a top-10 global tech company.

Long story short, I randomly got a call from someone within the company about 10 days after applying online.  It was completely unexpected, which I didn't mind, and it felt like it was more of a weed-out call than a true interview.  All-in-all, the call maybe lasted 10-15 minutes total.

A few days later, I get an email from someone within the company requesting a true phone interview.

Fast forward, I'm nervous as hell, and the interview starts.  They (the initial email contact and someone else) start out by asking about my prior projects, which I had no problem discussing.  Yadda yadda, we talk about stuff over my resume, which I'll skip because that doesn't really pertain to my questions.  I'll just say I think I did pretty good, maybe a 75% - 85% grade overall.  I didn't know some questions, which I politely apologized for and honestly said I didn't know. I didn't feel too bad, as I've still got 8 months of classes left anyhow.

So what I've really been thinking about (probably too much) are a few things that they said to me in the interview that lead to me thinking I've got a good chance at landing the job.  I'm sure some of you with more than 2 interviews under your belt could answer.

1. They spent a good amount of time towards the end of the interview explaining what the company was about, and what the department that I could potentially be working in was about. Normally I'd say it wasn't a big deal, but he did spend some time getting into details about how the particular department functioned, what I would be able to do, working on, working conditions, etc.  


2. At the end of the interview, they mentioned that I had applied for an internship position.  They then asked if I'd be willing to be hired straight as a full-time, recent grad, instead of the internship.  Of course I said yes.  


3. I applied for the job at location A.  They asked me if not being able to work at location A, but location B would be a deal breaker.


So after all that, am I crazy, vain, or right?  I doubt they'd hire me over two interviews, but I just want to make sure they just weren't blowing smoke up my ass.

It's a design firm where you edit wedding, model and celebrity pictures, and the place pays really well. Well, I'm an unpaid intern. The employer and I got along well, and he decided to hire me because though he had very high standards and was rejected twice, I asked him to train me up to his standards. Without an internship, I stand no chance of real employment without gaining experience. 

Basically, when I was first at the studio, I spent 6 hours going through 7000 wedding photos and selecting them, and then editing them. Some of the employees there liked how I selected photos with emotion and togetherness. They trained me on basic lightroom, just a little. On the editing side(It was the first time ever using lightroom) the employer wasn't satisfied with my editing and decided that I'd be interning at home. I was like okay.

Once a week, I get people to send me photos now and then for me to edit and send back. But the boss wasn't exactly satisfied with my editing. He didn't tell me exactly what was wrong so I can fix it. I get sent wedding photos to edit from the boss's assistant for her to critique it later. I sent photos to her and all I get from her is ""It's good."" but when it gets sent to someone else, they had a different opinion.

This week I was sent modeling photos to edit for critique. I managed to edit a couple of photos while following the instructions on the email that was sent to me. I sent some of the photos to her, not as finished, but for her to review. She said ""so far it's good, I'm going to send the pictures to Maria to see what she thinks."" and when I got the text back I get a message from the assistant that Maria{boss's daughter} suggested not to finish the photos, but to practice on the ones I already have. I asked what was wrong, and she gave me one issue that took me 15 minutes to fix. And not long after the text, all of the images from my Dropbox folder was deleted. I feel like people have suddenly given up on me.

I'm a little upset because I'm not getting enough training that I asked for. I was sent home with a few hundred tutorials that didn't help me all that much and I was asked to look on youtube and look for tutorials on photo editing. Unfortunately, I wasn't taught this at school and I told my boss that. I'm just a little irritated that I'm sending photos to people only to not get enough constructive criticism that I need to help myself improve. I know how to use photoshop and lightroom, but I'm still growing in the design field.

Honestly, I would have been fine at interning at home, if I had more sufficient training. It's like they send me photos and expect me to be perfect.

1mcbm2,0,2013-09-13,"I don't know if I'm majoring in the right thing and I don't know what I want to do with my life. Please, I need some advice. What do I do?",StarDestinyGuy,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1mcbm2/i_dont_know_if_im_majoring_in_the_right_thing_and/,"This is going to be pretty long, but I want to explain as thoroughly as I can.

So, I'm a student at the University of Minnesota.  I started out in CLA (The College of Liberal Arts), because I didn't really know what I wanted to do.  At the beginning of college, I was interested in all of these fields (and still am):

- English
- Psychology
- Elementary Education
- Film Studies
- Biology
- Spanish
- Economics
- Marketing
- Management Information Systems (MIS)
- Finance
- Public and Nonprofit Management

Sometime during the end of my first year, I decided I wanted to go into the business school (CSOM).  This was based on countless hours of research into different majors, different careers, people's perspective on different degrees, employment statistics, articles about the best jobs, etc.

I decided going there that I'd want to major in one of the business degrees I posted above for these reasons:

- Marketing: I love psychology but I want something more practical for finding work.  I took an intro to marketing course and really enjoyed it.  I'm good with people and data.
- Management Information Systems: I'm really good with technology and I find it interesting.  I like keeping up to date on the newest and greatest things.  I'm good at helping other people understand technology.  I don't want to work in programming though; I know that.
- Finance: I'm really good with numbers.  I'm a very logical and analytical person.  I've always strongly enjoyed mathematics prior to calculus 2.  I enjoy following stocks and do fairly well with them in a simulation game I play.  Within finance, I think I'd enjoy a financial adviser/planner position the most, as I enjoy helping people.
- Public and Nonprofit Management: This is actually a dual degree, so I'd have to do it with something else.  There are numerous nonprofits that I support and I'd love to be working for a greater cause.  (and again, I enjoy helping people)

Anyways, I applied to CSOM.  I didn't get in.  To keep it short, I worked my ass of the following year, got my GPA up from a 3.5 to a 3.8, and was accepted.  

I'm currently a junior in CSOM and now once again I'm wondering if I'm doing the right thing.  Should I be in business school?  Am I majoring in the right thing?

I succeed in almost all my classes at CSOM.  I've gotten a perfect 4.0 the past two semesters, which was largely made up of business classes.  One of the people I know in the career center there believes I will be excellent in almost any company.  One of my statistics professors told me I did the best in his class (around a 98.5%) out of any student he's ever had in 15 years of teaching and offered me a full-time job at his company as a Business Analyst.  Many good companies have reached out to me about their internships, saying I'd be a great fit.

So, I'm doing well in the school.  That's not the issue though.  The issue is just me thinking is this right?  Is it what I want?  What if I make the wrong choice?  Should I have gone into Elementary Education instead?  (my back-up plan if I didn't get in)

Looking at the other courses in my potential majors at CSOM, most sound interesting to me, but it's hard to know until I take them.  Based on my research, a lot of jobs in my fields sound like I'd enjoy them, but again, it's hard to know until I work there.

Honestly, I've done so much research, it's been like a full time job.  I've even complied a lot of what I've read into word documents and powerpoints for my own reference.  I've taken multiple personality tests which all say the same thing typically: education and business are good fields for me.  I spoke with a career coach who advised me based on everything to go into business now and then use my success down the road to pursue another degree and enter education if I still want to.

I just wish there was a clear way to know if I made the right decision.  Like with your schoolwork for example.  I mean, I know you won't love every class in your major and won't love every assignment right?  But I wish it was that easy.  Where it was you loved going to class every single day and loved doing your homework every single day if you were in the right field.  Then I could know for sure.

Even the jobs I've had haven't pushed me definitively in any direction.  I worked at an insurance company, which was okay, but it was mostly grunt work so I can't really base anything off of it.  It did help me decide that I don't want to work in insurance specifically.

I worked in education in multiple areas: a math teacher to adults seeking their GEDs, a teaching assistant at an elementary school for 4 5th grade teachers, and a children's summer program.  

Working with adults was enjoyable in that I loved seeing the spark go off in there eyes when they understood something and I felt really accomplished after hearing most of my students passed the test.  It was pretty frustrating working with my students who didn't care though.  Still, I enjoyed this job, as I felt like I really made a significant difference in some peoples' lives.

Working as a teaching assistant for 5th graders was fun in that it was lighthearted and little kids are fun to be around.  On the other hand, there's an incredible amount of paperwork involved (way more than I expected) and I miss having intellectual conversations with others...5th graders aren't great for that.  It also sometimes tired me out just working with the kids.  

Lastly, in terms of teaching summer classes, it varied greatly how much I liked it.  I taught Debate and Typing, both of which were fairly boring.  I taught Garage Band, which I hated because I wasn't interested in the software or area and most of my students weren't either.  I taught a gym class, which was pretty fun.  The one thing I truly loved and looked forward to every day was teaching a cooking class.  It was called Top Chef, and was basically like that show but with kids grades K-4.  I like cooking and I love those shows, so I loved this class.  The kids were super into it too.  It was just great.  So yeah, if I could find a full-time job teaching cooking competition classes to kids that paid well enough for me to get by, I think I'd do that.

Still, like I said, I don't know.  As far as I can tell, there's no clear answer to be found.  Research and data tell me I'm doing the right thing, but I'm unsure.

So please, any advice you can offer would help.  I don't know what to do."

I recently graduated with a BS Biochemistry and a BA International Relations. My ultimate goals are to return to graduate school for epidemiology and do research on neglected diseases. The only problem is right now I do not think I have the necessary lab skills or experience to get into grad programs, and I don't have a padded enough resume to work with a lot of laboratories that are doing research on these things. (I had to support myself through college, so I couldn't do internships if they didn't have an income.) Because of this, I've been applying left and right to a ton of jobs and in the past two days I've had very promising interviews for jobs with two companies I've spoken with. 

One, a bioprocess technician position, pays more, but has irregular hours and is only in an industrial setting (i.e., little research experience potential). Still, I would at least gain the ability to say I know industrial standards like SOP, cGMP, etc., and would be working with a world leader in the biopharmaceutical industry. 

The other, a publications assistant position with an open access journal, pays less, but I would expect to get more networking and hands on experience with academic publication, that might be helpful in the future while doing research. It at least might look good in applications to research internships or positions to say I know the process. I'm not 100% sure.

Which would you suggest I look into more? I know it's awfully presumptuous to think I'll get offers from both companies, but I can't help thinking I have no idea which path would be better. "

My father learning Russian, my mother Arabic. They married, and a year later I was born in Salt Lake City, Utah. My family moved every year or two while I was growing up, with my dad changing jobs often, from Spanish Teacher to IT guy and so on. I have five younger siblings, three boys followed by two girls. Each of them was born in a different city. We lived in small towns all across Utah and Colorado, as well as Tillamook Oregon for a brief time.

When I was twelve, I got my first job. It was a city-sponsored summer work program in Moab, Utah. I did a variety of jobs, from helping out at a small city-sponsored farm and orchard, to landscaping in front of city hall, to cutting down invasive species of trees for the forest service. The latter was the most common, and I still occasionally make jokes about having been a twelve-year-old lumberjack.

The two years during which I lived in Moab is also the time when my fascination with doing cool things began. Between twelve and fourteen, I went whitewater rafting and kayaking several times, played on the local baseball team, explored the hidden areas of Canyonlands National Park, rappelled down slickrock cliffs, and piloted a small aircraft on three occasions.

I breezed through high school, briefly trying myself in both football and hockey, then hit a roadblock at college when I was actually challenged at school for the first time. I dropped out twice before taking year off and coming back determined to actually attend class, do the work, and come out with a solid grade. During this transitional period I also began writing for a small website about Magic: The Gathering in exchange for store credit.

During my first successful semester at college last year, attending Utah State University in Logan, I worked part-time to pay the bills, attended school full-time and also did a part-time internship as a graphic designer for Utah Public Radio. Needless to say, things were a bit crazy.

Late last year, I received an email from my former editor, who had gone on to work for Wizards of the Coast, the company that creates Magic. He told me about an opening writing for the company's website, and asked if I was interested. After an application and interview, I was offered the job, and accepted without hesitation. The position ended up paying enough to allow me to quit my part-time job, making school life much less hectic.

Over the summer I applied for a number of jobs and internships that were either in one of the fields I was interested in (graphic design and writing) or simply seemed fun. I ended up interviewing for and being offered an internship teaching English in Spain. However, my mother, now working as an Arabic teacher, stepped in with another opportunity to teach English abroad, this one in Jordan. The pay was nearly identical, but came with the addition of room and board, so I applied and was accepted.

At the end of last month, I moved once again, this time from Logan, Utah to Madaba, Jordan, where I will be living for the next year. I am currently teaching English and learning Arabic, while continuing to write articles for Wizards of the Coast.

My current plan is to return to Logan and resume my education next year, but with the freedom to work from anywhere in the world, part of me is just waiting for something else to catch my eye. After all, who knows what cool thing I might stumble upon next?"

Now, I've always been interested in mathematics and science (namely chemistry, and physics), but the idea of being an aerospace engineer is relatively new to me. Therefore, I have a few questions about it as an academic subject and a career which I would like to ask now, before I make any major decisions (get it? major? haha).

1. Are there any common misconceptions about Aerospace engineering that prospective students should know?

2. What's the workload like for students? I assume it's massive, and that doesn't scare me, but is it monotonous? Tedious? Variable?

3. I'm just going to go ahead and assume that internships are worth it, but what should one know before doing this?

4. Is it worth it to go all out and get a Master's degree? How long does it take to get a Bachelor's?

5. What's it actually like as a career? What sort of things to Aerospace engineers deal with on a day-to-day basis?

Anything else? Is there anything I should know that I've failed to ask about?

Thanks!"
1mc7w5,55,2013-09-13,How to Network,omen2k,geologycareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/geologycareers/comments/1mc7w5/how_to_network/,"One of my biggest pieces of advices for getting a job after you graduate is and always has been to network, and to start networking before you leave university. To be honest, this applies for almost any and all professions, and it absolutely 100% applies to geology based careers. 

I can't understate it: networking is an extremely powerful tool. People that are good at networking can get jobs they would have never even be able to submit a CV for otherwise. Those who are good at networking will get chosen for jobs over other people even if they are less qualified. People who are good at networking can turn a coffee-making internship into a staff position. People that are good at networking can get past the Great Wall of HR and straight into staff positions. 

Networking is kind of a subtle art and you will need to have skills in many areas. Being able to talk coherently about a wide variety of topics, to people from all walks of life, and being able to ask questions are all things that take practice. A fantastic way to develop these skills is to join many different societies at university without taking your friends with you. Debate societies in particular can be really good for developing your 'gift of gab' and being able to think on the spot. 

However universally what gets posted immediately after I mention this is usually 'how do I network?' and so I thought I'd write up some of my thoughts and experiences. 

Note: I work in the O&amp;G industry so can only really comment on my experiences. My experiences will probably differ from others and so I welcome people to disagree with me in the comments or offer their differing advice!


**PLACES TO NETWORK:**

- Various Geology Society meetings: There are lots of societies around the world and they usually meet up once or twice a month in major cities.

- Conferences: these are great because they usually have special deals for students and even special events that help you get around and meet people. Your professors might also be attending and can help you get around and maybe even wangle getting your trip paid for! Maybe you can help out on one of their workshops? Also everyone there is usually getting boozed up at around 5pm and are much more friendly than usual. 

- Linkedin: this is a great tool to start learning about your specific interests via groups, however that said DO NOT: go on and just post your resume saying you're looking for work. DO: say you're looking for a company to do your summer project with or an internship with and why (summer project is preferred). 

Getting to one of these venues, how you're going to pay for it, which ones to go to, I will leave to the comments section, but the main thing you need to know is that there are many opportunities to network and you need to find the ones that suit you and figure out a way to get there. 

and now that you're AT one of these venues…


**HOW TO NETWORK**

- YOUR MISSION: to go to one of the aforementioned events, talk (about anything) to as many people as possible, get their business card or contact information, leave on a high note and add them on linkedin when you get home. I had around 200 contacts to follow up on after I went to a week long conference, your goal is to beat my score. 

- If you are sociable, friendly, funny or attractive, then this will be a huge advantage already. Your appearance will be 80% of their impression of you, and you can quit your bitching now because it's a fact of life. If you are fat and unattractive you will be at a huge disadvantage, and you should get an expensive haircut and wear an expensive suit to compensate. 

- Talking to people is sometimes difficult, because they're usually 20 years older than you and have very little in common with you, other than you both studied the same subject and you're both at the same event. In all honesty, many people will simply not be interested in talking to you, so if you try to strike up a conversation and it doesn't go well don't worry about it and move on. I can recall once going to a geology society meeting and being politely but firmly ignored by just about every person there… it was horrible. But don't worry, it might have been them, not you. Besides they were probably really boring and you would have hated working with them anyway. If the room is really sour then just gather up everyone else your age and go out to the nearest bar. And speaking of bars…

- DO: make small talk to anyone standing next to you in the line to get coffee, at the bar of the venue, or anywhere else you're forced into close contact with other people. In fact I got my first technical job because I made small talk to the geologist in front of me in the queue to get coffee. 

- DO: make it a point to go to every single booth at the conference and find out everything you can about that company and what they do. Those people are being paid to talk to you and this is the easiest networking available. 

- DO: talk to the people who aren't geologists. There are usually groups of people who are administrators, HR, or services people (i.e. they might supply hard drives to large oil companies or something but aren't technical) at these things who somehow get invited and are merrily taking advantage of the free drinks and food. Almost always, I have found these people to be extremely friendly and open to talking to me, and almost always, they have found out I was looking for work and helped me by introducing me to their bosses and colleagues. 

- DO NOT go around asking for jobs. Sooner or later they'll ask you what you do and you can just simply mention whatever your situation is and move on, but don't try to force it into the conversation. 

- DO: read up on the current world news (especially your industry-related news). Have something ready to say about fraccing and global warming. Spend evenings watching TED talks, because it will give you a huge spectrum of random interesting conversation topics to bring up. It is extremely refreshing after an entire day of miscible flow through fractured carbonates to have someone start telling you about the latest advances in cryogenic freezing… after all you are talking to geologists, we're very curious creatures. Being a politics junkie is also sometimes good for conversation but I've seen people go off the deep end bashing on republicans or something and looking like an idiot. 

- DONT: be so serious. You're having fun remember?

- REMEMBER: Brevity is the soul of wit: be aware of your audience and don't be one of these assholes who just wants to talk at people. 

- DO NOT read books about NLP or subconscious mind manipulation… you will probably look like a twat. Instead, listen to some high-energy music before you go into the venue, focus on being positive, cheerful and confident, and genuinely being interested in the person you are talking to. Being relaxed is important because it will cause other people to become relaxed too. But in fact on that subject…

- BE YOURSELF. The cool, calm, relaxed, confident and positive version of you is going to be a million times better than the version of you that is trying to be assertive, strong willed or whatever bullshit HR has convinced upper management you need to be to get a job there. 

- DON'T: only hang around with your uni buddies who are at the same event and are also looking for jobs. But, that said: 

- DO: always be happy to introduce them to whoever you're talking to and let them in on the same contacts as you. If they leave a good impression on whoever you're speaking to it will reflect well on you as well. In fact with the right friends you can work well as a team to meet people because you know the other person intimately. For instance 'I'd like to introduce my good friend Mark, I apologise if he looks a little dishevelled, he's just come back from a 5 month trek through the Himalayas' is an easy conversation starter and makes your friend Mark look good. Also you've just told this senior manager guy that you hang out with people who enjoy being in the Himalayan mountains, so how cool do you look now.

- DO: always help your friends get jobs. You will likely see them for the rest of your career and they will remember you helping them (unless they're an asshole). I am single handedly responsible for 3 of my friends having jobs in the last few years and it has paid me back several times over. 

- REMEMBER: people's names. There are a hundred ways to do it but it is important and it does make a difference. Having said that, don't beat yourself up if you forget one and just politely apologise and ask them their name again. 

- LUCK: is going to play a bigger part in this than you might like, but work with it and trust that things will work out in the end. Put yourself in a place where good things can happen to you. 

**USING YOUR NETWORK**

Now that you've successfully built this gigantic monstrosity of a LinkedIn network, what do you do with it? 

On the first tuesday after the event, message everyone you met saying it was great meeting them and to let you know if they are ever aware of any positions for a junior geologist, or whatever. Whereas bringing it up in conversation would have made things awkward, doing this is totally acceptable. Hopefully, someone will take pity on you and work something out. In my experience though, out of 200 or so people I messaged or contacted only 5 or 6 had any leads for me to follow up on, so don't get your hopes up and don't get disappointed if it doesn't work out.

Mention their names when you go to interviews at their companies, or even better ask them for an informal reference before you have one or if they want to get coffee while you're there. 

Even better, when you finally do have a job, imagine that you hit a wall with your work and don't know what to do next. You scan your network and fire off a friendly email to that really eccentric but helpful bearded guy who was an expert in what you're working on, and he not only sends you back several relevant papers to read but also a PDF manual in the software you're working in. BINGO. 

Find out what groups your contacts are using and join them. Ask relevant questions in message boards or look for opportunities there to do your projects and internships. 


**CAREER NETWORKING**

Just because you now have a job does not mean you can sit back and relax. I cannot understate the importance of networking when you have a job. 

Always try go for beers with your colleagues/bosses after work, even if they're in a different department to you. Always take part in company social clubs or committees. When your company suddenly has to get rid of half their workforce they'll be reluctant to get rid of you. 

Be helpful. When you notice a problem you can solve even in another department, go out of your way to solve it. For example a company I was temping at had some interns finishing their jobs doing menial work over the summer and were about to give a presentation to the exploration manager. They were really disorganised and their presentations weren't very good. I sat in and offered points on presentations and then spent an hour with one of them refining his presentation. They ended up being praised for their work. Their boss ended up hiring me a few months later over another person because of that incident. 

Branch out to the other departments of your company even if they don't do technical work. IT guys are your best friends and are almost always the nicest most helpful people I have ever met. Go for beers with them and find out what they do.  

Above all, do not just sit there and do your job and then go home. 


**SOME EXPERIENCES WITH NETWORKING**

As I mentioned, my first technical job out of university was from striking up conversation with a geologist in front of me waiting to get coffee. She recommended me to another company who gave me an interview and hired me. 

I initially turned down a job once when I was unemployed because I was waiting for an offer to come through from a more relevant job. However, critically, I suggested they talk to one of my classmates who was also unemployed and they ended up hiring him for a different and much better job. My offer didn't come through, but he had done such a good job they wanted another worker and they ended up hiring me to work alongside him. 

Out of the 200+ contacts that I made at the aforementioned week long conference, usually spending around 4 hours a day going around and talking to people, almost all of them are in my LinkedIn network, around half of them replied when I messaged looking for work, and around 5 or 6 of them had leads for me to follow up on. I ended up in my current job with one of them, after speaking to the COO of the company at his booth. I would estimate that out of the 200 contacts I made, I had around 100 bad conversations with people that didn't want to talk to me and led nowhere.

===

So! Did not expect this to be so long, but this is what I've learned from 5 odd years of my career, hope that helps someone and maybe generates some interesting comments with other people's experiences. Feel free to call bullshit on anything I've said or offer your opinions, as I said I can only talk from my point of view.

Questions about shaving and drug tests.,drugsdrugsdrugsdrug,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1mc7hc/just_got_an_internship_i_start_this_tuesday/,"I just got an internship at a large international company that you've definitely heard of. My first day is this Tuesday and I'm wondering if I can expect to be drug tested anytime soon. I haven't smoked in weeks in preparation of getting a job, so I should pass, but I'm wondering if it's safe to start smoking again. Or, at what point should I be safe? I don't plan on going to work high. I have a condition that doesn't go well with alcohol, so I just smoke when my friends are drinking (or smoking) to not feel out of place. I'm not a stoner type, though the random throwaway I used for this may suggest otherwise.

Also, I was told to shave for the my interview, which I did. I usually keep my face well trimmed. Should I continue to shave for the time being, or would it be a bad idea to come in my first day with a short beard?"

But I work at a studio in Mint Hill called Asylum Digital.  For the past few months, I have been working there under internship and just moved to assistant engineer.  I'm looking for help to build my sound reel at the studio with demos/EPs of local artists so it'll be easier to network in person and so people have access to listen to the work online (your work would be on our site).

Because this is really you helping me out, I'm waiving my engineering fees.  I'll be working for free so the only thing you'd have to pay for is the studio, which pretty much means half price (instead of $70 an hour or $480 a day, it'd be $35 an hour or $240 a day). It's not my studio, I'm only an employee, so the studio time fees are something I can't really negotiate without paying out of my own pocket.

I was hired to bring in more bands and singer/songwriters, but anybody is welcome. If you'd like to check out the studio website, feel free to visit http://www.asylumdigital.com and here are some [extra pictures of the studio](http://imgur.com/a/JbKqs#0).

I have been tasked with buying branded products for an upcoming event. The event is called ""Tech Week"", and ideally the design would like to incorporate a technical theme and these words.   There is no additional budget to hire a graphic designer or photoshop wizard, so they gave it to me (the intern with no graphic experience whatsoever).  So far, I have come up with [this design](http://i.imgur.com/M4rxm28.png), which was obviously roughly sketched out in paint.  I tried to incorporate different elements of circuitry (such as [these](http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/design/systemscontrol/electronicsrev5.shtml) ) as well as ideas of sound and programming (C#).  

This is what I need:  someone to take the design and make it usable.  I need a high-quality image that would look good when embroidered.  This means all the letters and elements would be thicker and the same size.  If you can come up with something way better than my design, I'm open to that too!!

I hope this isn't too much to ask; my boss and I have both been backed into a corner!

Thank you reddit!

P.S.  For those who are up to the challenge, I will send you homemade cookies (within the US)"

[Hi, I always liked reading your comments during your father's campaign in 2008. Thanks for doing an AMA.  Moderate Republicans like your dad and Mitt Romney have lost in the last two elections to Obama. What do you think this means for Republicans in 2016 and beyond? Will primary voters decide that they need to nominate a (truly\) severely conservative candidate to contrast with the Democrats, or do you think they'll go with another blue state governor like Christie? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mbrif/i_am_author_and_host_executive_producer_of/cc7oulh?context=5)|I want to ask you a question. What do you think the election would have looked like if Rick Santorum was our nominee last time?  The biggest problem with Republicans right now is our obsession with social issues: Abortion, birth control, marriage equality.  If we would lighten up on these issues, we would get a lot more independent voters, which is really the sweet spot to winning elections.  The idea that we are going to nominate a radical conservative who believes that being gay is a choice and there are citizens in this country that should have less rights because they love someone of the same gender will only lead to continued loss elections.   I hope Republicans choose someone more moderate in the next election cycle.  I will be curious to see what happens but I would be my entire career and everything I know about America that nominating an extreme conservative candidate would only end in failure.
[EDIT: I re-watched the interview. ""Weak"" is a better word than ""lazy"", but O'Reilly was still very patronizing.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mbrif/i_am_author_and_host_executive_producer_of/cc7ocgh?context=5)|When I go on cable news shows as a general rule,  9 times out of 10 I know what the interviewer and the host thinks of me.  I can still go on shows with people that disagree with me.  I respect Bill but I think he's wrong about this generation.  I try to defend myself and us as a generation.
[*The last generation has fucked us royally.*  That can't be said enough.  *We have a horrible environment, climate change scares me every day and I thought my apartment was going to blow away during Hurricane Sandy. We're still dealing with wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and the aftereffects of that. I personally know what it's like to watch a brother go to war and be scared that he might die. We're dealing with debts from student loans. The average student how has to return living home because they can't afford an apartment on their own. We're dealing with the aftereffects of a horrible economy.*  What politics from the last generation do you think are to blame, generally speaking? It's common around here on reddit to blame Reaganomics and deregulation and so forth. Do you have a different take? Or is that an interpretation you subscribe to? Regardless, what's the way forward?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mbrif/i_am_author_and_host_executive_producer_of/cc7p4li?context=5)|I'm not so focused on how we got here so much as how we can move forward.  I know there have been a lot of mistakes in the past and there are a lot of fingers to point and blame.  That is for other people to analyze.  
[I think you're an extremely refreshing and much-needed voice for the right.  That being said, the party you're in has a lot of modernizing to do, and the members seem to be willing to do almost anything to avoid updating many of their fallacious, anti-science beliefs.  Do you see that changing in the upcoming years? What would make republicans believe in climate change, for instance, if an overwhelming scientific consensus is not enough?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mbrif/i_am_author_and_host_executive_producer_of/cc7pj3o?context=5)|I saw a video on VICE a few days ago all about climate change.  And they interviewed the president of the Maldives, and they are literally disappearing because of climate change.  He might have to relocate his entire population because of climate change.  Anyone that does not believe in climate change at this point is unbelievably delusional and in my opinion, dangerous.  I have become more and more concerned about climate change ever since Hurricane Sandy.  I don't know exactly what the answer is (other than the obvious - recycle, lessen dependency on fossil fuels, etc) but America has got to wake up and I have absolutely no idea why it's so unpopular other than people are scared to face the harsh reality of what is happening to our environment.  Me, personally? Scares the shit out of me.  I spent the summer in NYC filming Raising McCain and it was literally the hottest summer of my life.  There were days I didn't think I could walk around outside and I grew up in the fucking desert.  It should not be this hot.  It's too hot NOW, in September in New York right now.  This is actually an issue I've become more passionate about in the past year and I'd like to do more as soon as I have time after I'm done promoting the show. 
[Meghan, I know you spent time working on SNL in college, any funny stories? Also, do you enjoy playing VIP poker?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mbrif/i_am_author_and_host_executive_producer_of/cc7ocih?context=5)|Yes!  It was a fantastic experience, but I was a lowly intern.  I worked for Lorne Michaels' assistants, and my job really just consisted of escorting guests from the ground floor of Rockefeller center to the studio and getting Lorne's popcorn and beer.  My most memorable experience at SNL was being backstage when Ashlee Simpson was famously caught lip-synching and hearing her freak out backstage after realizing that she had been caught.  It was chaos.  Something I will never forget.
 |I will be grateful for the experience at SNL because it was a pivotal time in my life, and I think everyone should have an experience where they are treated like shit as an intern because it shows you what people go through just to go get you coffee.  I'm sure Ashlee Simpson hates that I always bring up her lip-synching in interviews too.
 |P.s. Will Forte was the nicest cast member to the interns, and to this day, I will be grateful to him for opening a door for me when I was carrying a crate of beer. 
[Greetings from Arizona!  I'm not a ""job creator,"" or a ""small business"" owner, or a member of the 1 percent.  I'm a ""job performer""...just a working stiff.  Most Republicans I've met (our Governor and a few Representatives\) don't seem to want to talk to me.  They want to talk to my boss.  Can you please tell your GOP friends that it might help them around election time if they treat working people as equally important as the mighty ""job creators?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mbrif/i_am_author_and_host_executive_producer_of/cc7oomo?context=5)|First of all, politicians (my father included) do town halls all the time. I know my father did one the weekend before last.  They are open forums, anyone can go to, so you have the opportunity to speak to politicians directly.  I am not a politician, but I respect what you're saying.  Unfortunately in this country money still does a lot of the talking.  But don't give up trying to have your voice heard.  It is an important one.
[I appreciate the reply.  It is partially about access, but also about message.  The Republican Party has exalted ""job creators"" to the point where working people feel unimportant.  We get a town hall.  The boss gets a meeting.  That's a problem.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mbrif/i_am_author_and_host_executive_producer_of/cc7p4os?context=5)|You're breaking my heart.  I hear stories like this all the time.  I'm telling you don't give up and voices get heard even when you don't think they do.  I'm telling you I've seen it.  Hang in there.

[Your father recently came out and spoke in favor of legalizing and taxing cannabis use in your home state of Arizona. What are your feelings on the whole idea of states pulling themselves out of deficits by these means and do you think with education and strict laws (keeping out of people who are 21's hands\) this could soon be a model for the whole country?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mbrif/i_am_author_and_host_executive_producer_of/cc7oibr?context=5)|I'm a huge advocate for the legalization of marijuana.  I myself prefer marijuana to alcohol. And came out in support of it a while ago.  I'm glad my father is moving in the direction of supporting this issue.  Not only do I enjoy marijuana recreationally, I think it could be a big boost to the economy.  
[Hi Meghan!  I was fortunate enough to meet you with Michael Ian Black during you Book/Conversation Tour for ""America, You Sexy Bitch!""  I mentioned quickly during the signing how, as a Democrat, I really appreciate the way you've always approached and spoken about your Republican beliefs.  I think young Republicans can benefit from taking a page out of your book (pun intended\), especially due to your ability to understand, appreciate, and thoughtfully consider the views and opinions of others; which I've noticed is the biggest barrier of discussion when I'm confronted with some of my more conservative friends.  I know you receive a lot of backlash from members of your own party, has there ever been a time where you've been taken so far aback by a confrontation that you reconsidered your Republican affiliation? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mbrif/i_am_author_and_host_executive_producer_of/cc7onat?context=5)|I've never really reconsidered my Republican affiliation because on a very basic level I believe in small government, strong national defense, and the basic principles the party was founded on.  I believe that I can help reform the party from the inside out and I have a unique and fortunate platform that I have elected to use.  That being said, I spent the majority of my 20's being a controversial woman in the media.  I'm turning 29 in a month and I didn't expect my life to look like this.  The one thing that almost pushed me over the edge that sent me to therapy was Glenn Beck fake-vomiting on his show after a skin cancer PSA that I did (If you don't know the story google it).  It got a lot of media attention and it was humiliating to have my body discussed so publicly.  That's the only time I can ever really remember second-guessing what I was doing with my life and whether it was worth it.  But at the end of the day, fuck Glenn Beck.  I'm not going to let anyone turn me into a victim and I'm not going to let anyone silence me.  That's what's wrong with the media today, that women are too easily silenced. 
[You're President.  You're tired of ""Hail to the Chief.""  What song do you replace it with?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mbrif/i_am_author_and_host_executive_producer_of/cc7omke?context=5)|Hahaha! YES I am sick of that song.

[As a fellow younger generation Republican, what is it we can do to help change the opinion most people have about the current state of the party?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mbrif/i_am_author_and_host_executive_producer_of/cc7od8o?context=5)|First this is a heavy question and one I take home with me every night.  Part of the problem is the media's perception of Republicans.  Not that we haven't gotten the reputation we've gotten for valid reasons.  However there are a lot of socially moderate republicans out there but it's not as sexy or interesting for the media because radicals get the most attention and the most views on TV.  I would say to speak out, get involved, and for the love of God, use social media.  Don't give up on the party, I haven't.  I believe young people can change it from the inside out.  That being said, if the party continues its extreme trend and nominates someone like Rick Santorum in the next election, I myself would be open to voting for an independent candidate.

 |This is the thing about American politics.  We're not a dynasty for a reason.  Just because my father is a great politician does not mean I would make a good one.  America does not have royalty, and I don't think politics should reflect that.  I honestly think that I have made too many mistakes on the internet, I swear too much in my new show, I have too many tattoos, and I've had too many bad dates to ever run for office.  And honestly?  I don't want to ever have to lie in my life, and unfortunately to get elected in America sometimes you have to lie.

Unless we come around on all the issues you just mentioned and that, we can say sayonara not just to the next election cycle but every election cycle that follows that.  This party has got to evolve or it will die.  I don't have all the answers, but I know that telling people to choose between their gay friends and taxes is a losing equation.

McCain?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mbrif/i_am_author_and_host_executive_producer_of/cc7pyxx?context=5)|I can honestly say that my father turned me into a Republican.  I registered as independent when I was 18.  I thought it was a way to rebel (yea, that was my way of rebelling).  I even voted for John Kerry back in the day.  But going on the road with my dad when I was 22 right out of college and really understanding what the Republican party stood for (at least from his perspective) completely changed my worldview.  It's difficult though.  Because I live in New York City and I moved here when I was 18.  And a lot of times I felt like my personal life was not reconciling with my political life, which is why I decided to be so vocal about my support of gay marriage.  The things that I like are obviously that I get such a front-row seat to history.  I have the weirdest, craziest, most amazingly blessed life anyone could ever ask for, and I'm very very lucky.  The worst part is people really project onto you issues that they have with my dad, and they have an idea of what a politician's daughter should look, talk and act like.  It's been hard for me to come to terms with who I am and not just fall into some stupid mold.

[Hey Meghan, so what type of person runs for public office?

And all I know is that in this world, repression breeds obsession.  And I think if you're sitting around all day trying to pretend to be a perfect person, you are probably going to start getting obsessed with things that you think you're not allowed to do (or are not allowed to do).  Ironically one of the most judgmental politicians I've ever met went on to have quite a few personal scandals of their own, and the irony was not lost on me.

I think he only owns four hoodies and he wears the same thing over and over again).   It is not so much that he smelled, it was just somewhere where everything smelled myself included.  But as a general rule, he doesn't smell bad.  But he doesn't smell manly.  He doesn't wear cologne.  He smells clean, like Downy fabric softener. 
[What do you think the most annoying aspect of social media is?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mbrif/i_am_author_and_host_executive_producer_of/cc7oj10?context=5)|The most annoying aspect of social media is that every asshole conservative blogger can project onto me their insecurities about their life or what I represent to them.  My weight fluctuates like most American women, and every time I gain a few pounds, it's tweeted to me that I'm looking fatter.  That's a difficult thing about social media.  But I love the internet and I love social media and I'm so grateful I live in a time when I have the opportunity to let people get to know who I am and to connect with other people. 
[Hardest part of making this TV Show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mbrif/i_am_author_and_host_executive_producer_of/cc7pngd?context=5)|Hardest part of making this TV show was how FUCKING HOT it has been this summer.  We filmed in an artist loft downtown (the artists were in Europe all summer) and we didn't have central air.  And the unit AC they brought in we had to turn off when filming because it was too loud for audio.  If I look sweaty on the show, it's because I am.  That was the hardest part.

People are going to love this show, and people are going to hate this show.  I have absolutely no problem with constructive criticism, it's only going to make me grow and make the show better if we are successful.  This morning, reading some of the things that people said really upset me.  So much of it seems like angry people projecting things onto me personally.  I'm blonde, I'm a senator's daughter, yes you can google a lot of information about me.  It's unfair to say that I am not allowed to have the ambition and not allowed to use my voice and not allowed to question things the way I want to question them, simply because I grew up in the public eye or because someone personally does not like me.  When I get really angry I take it out on Twitter (even though it's not great and it makes my publicist cringe).  Other times I have good friends, family and honestly perspective.  SO what there's a dumb article?  One of the final episodes we just taped of Raising McCain that has really resonated with me had to do with 1 in 6 people in New York go hungry every day and one in five of them are children. I'm not going to give away too much about the episode, but I felt ignorant about how huge of an issue hunger still is in America. Those are real issues. Some asshole writing a mean article about me?

I actually disagree with you.  I do speaking tours across the country all of the time, for going on 5 years I have spoke to 100's of college students and let me tell you, they are the scariest audience because they are the most engaged, well-researched and toughest.  College students have kept me on my toes and helped me come to terms with exactly what I believe in.  I disagree with you in that I have almost completely lost faith in the generations previously and have optimism for the future because of this generation.

I wear sunscreen every day, never go in the sun (I'm a vampire) and I try to moisturize every night.  A trick I picked up along the way is when you're going out for a big night of boozing, leave a bottle of water and cleansing wipes on your nightstand so you can get in bed and drink the water and take the makeup off your face with the makeup remover.

I have been tasked with buying branded products for an upcoming event. The event is called ""Tech Week"", and ideally the design would like to incorporate a technical theme and these words.   There is no additional budget to hire a graphic designer or photoshop wizard, so they gave it to me (the intern with no graphic experience whatsoever).  So far, I have come up with [this design](http://i.imgur.com/M4rxm28.png), which was obviously roughly sketched out in paint.

I need a high-quality image that would look good when embroidered.  This means all the letters and elements would be thicker and the same size.  If you can come up with something way better than my design, I'm open to that too!!

I am really hoping to stand out here because it could mean a job offer for when I graduate.

This is a problem because the only dress clothes I have include a brooks brothers blazer that I picked up from a thrift store, and a pair of boat shoes from ebay. I have been scouring ebay for deals on shoes like A&amp;E, Church's, Bruno Magli and such but have been unable to find one even near my size. (10.5 D)

I know I want a shoe with a leather sole, and I love the Oxford style. This shoe:
http://www.ebay.com/itm/261284601234?ssPageName=STRK:MEWAX:IT&amp;_trksid=p3984.m1438.l2648

would be ideal, however I took the photo's to a cobbler and he said to stay away from it because it looked like the cracks might be deeper and pointed out that the soles had already been replaced multiple times.

I was wondering first off, what is your opinion on the shoe in question? Secondly, what other websites or brands would you recommend for me to look into? Finally, where is the best place to get a suit or two on a budget, and what should I look for besides fit (Ie. Band name)?

Since the company is fairly small my role has the potential to quickly change and expand as I learn more about the industry and the company's services. 

Since I was jobless and desperate I stated a requirement of only 15/hr plus benefits. I have been offered the job, and the benefits turned out to be kind of underwhelming. 1 week/year paid vacation. 1 week/year sick time. Holidays paid. Cafeteria health insurance. No 401k matching or anything like that. 

I'm not too certain about this stuff, since my only jobs have been part time or internship positions, with no benefits. Are these benefits good? Is 15/hr a shitty salary for a new college graduate in a scientific field? I've just been feeling like I shot myself in the foot. I have been looking up jobs with similar tasks and they pay up to 24/hr. The lack of a 401k makes me uneasy as it seems to imply they aren't intending to keep me for long, am I mistaken in this inference? Do I have any leverage in negotiating a higher salary, even though I initially stated only 15/hr? Should I ask for a raise fairly early on? If I continue my job search and get an offer for a higher salaried position, is it awful if I quit after, say, three months?

Sorry for the questions and such, I've been really nervous about all this. I'm extremely grateful for even getting a job offer, but I also want to get what I deserve. Regardless of all this salary nonsense, the job is going to look awesome on my resume as an entry level position and will no doubt open a lot of doors in the future. "

So I offered to give a 5 minute presentation on the wage gap in front of class to help my professor and make it so she wouldn't have to pretend to be showing both sides of the story.  

I think she got a little offended.  She told me that if I wanted to give a speech I should take a speech class. 

She also admonished me for speaking out in class.  If I wanted to speak in class I needed to take a class that involved student participation.  She kind of told me, in a roundabout way, not to take any more women's studies classes if I wanted to talk.  

I have been talking with some of the people at my university and they haven't experienced anything like this.  All classes they have taken allow questions from students.  It seems this situation is totally unique among classes at this university.

So I am going to drop the class.  One of the arguments made that I found very convincing is that I am basically paying her salary by attending this class.  And I don't want to support her.

But I did take some notes on what she said during an average class period.

She started the class roughly 7 minutes late to allow a speaker to try to recruit students for unpaid internships.

She then launched into a little bit about what she was going to talk about(but only after taking attendance in a 300 person class).

It was racism and eugenics.  For almost the entire rest of the class she would read directly from the assigned readings and then talk about her personal anecdotes.

For example, when reading about racism she talked about how her father was racist against the Irish.  She then read another paragraph and talked about how her father was racist against the Sicilians. Another paragraph and this time it was about his racism against black people.  

And on and on.

Then she ended 5 minutes early.

I did record some of the random mistakes she made if someone wants to hear them:

She thinks Washington DC is ""across the pond"".

She thinks that ""randy"" isn't an English word.

She does not understand eugenics or the history of eugenics.  She called eugenicists Nazis and said that Descartes was a eugenicist(he may have been(I don't know but what we were talking about was eugenics in the time period between 1860 and 1920 which is the time when it was most prevalent).

She once unintentionally advocated killing the homeless.  

She mispronounced physiognomy.

She used the term third world to describe things which it should not be used to describe.

She did not understand basic historiography.

Roughly around 50% of the time she was talking was her talking about irrelevant bullshit.  I know that she is on her fourth marriage, that she is a bastard(her word) and that she got her GED instead of a high school diploma.

And almost every joke she told fell flat.  People kind of tittered out of politeness but no more than that.

This was just one day.  If I am not allowed to correct these mistakes I cannot take the class.  It is too hard to keep my mouth shut."

I have been tasked with buying branded products for an upcoming event. The event is called ""Tech Week"", and ideally the design would like to incorporate a technical theme and these words.   There is no additional budget to hire a graphic designer or photoshop wizard, so they gave it to me (the intern with no graphic experience whatsoever).  So far, I have come up with [this design](http://i.imgur.com/M4rxm28.png), which was obviously roughly sketched out in paint.  I tried to incorporate different elements of circuitry (such as [these](http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/design/systemscontrol/electronicsrev5.shtml) ) as well as ideas of sound and programming (C#).  

This is what I need:  someone to take the design and make it usable.  I need a high-quality image that would look good when embroidered.  This means all the letters and elements would be thicker and the same size.  If you can come up with something way better than my design, I'm open to that too!!

I hope this isn't too much to ask; my boss and I have both been backed into a corner!

Thank you reddit!

P.S.  There are cookies in the near future for anyone who delivers :)"
1mbv9k,13,2013-09-13,"My ""eating"" anxiety is ""back""...felt sick monday and now am barely eatin cause I'm afraid...",konteco,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mbv9k/my_eating_anxiety_is_backfelt_sick_monday_and_now/,"Hello, gonna try to make this short guys, appreciate anyone who helps !

So, last year I joined the gym, and on the 5th month at it, I started a new diet to gain some weight, and on the very first week I had a ""diarrhea"" and a discomfort on my stomach from eatin and the things I ate(a lot of milk, oats...), guess you know where this took...wanted to know why this happened, became ""obssessive"" and bam thought I was sick and had digestive issues etc etc. Went to the doc and by the exams he said I had nothin, that it was psychological and all pointed towards anxiety...fast foward 6~8 months I grew some balls, talked to myself a lot and decided  to confront it and to overcome it, started exercising again(at home) and eatin better, I couldn't even run a little without feeling weird/sick !

So, now, September 2013, somewhat cured, I got a intern job and got back to the gym this week, on Monday, my first day, I trained ok felt nothing, was even a hell of a lot hungry after it, got back home, took a shower and went to have dinner, after the second bite I started feeling a ""heat"" coming up my neck(when we turn real red) and the food I swallowed ""floating"" in my stomach etc...I'm better now but I still have the weird ""symptoms"" towards eatin, I start eating and lose the will to eat, I am hungry out of nowhere, I drink a lil' water and feel bloated for a few mins etc...My blood probably wasn't back to the other parts of the body at that time yet especially the stomach, so when I threw some foods in there, it wanted to put out but it didn't, and now I feel a lil anxious about eating cause I don't want to feel sick(nobody does I believe lol)...And I know this ain't the exact same thing I had last year, because then I felt pain, felt full after eating just a little bit, couldn't poop properly.

I just want to know how I am able to overcome this fully, I believe I have to just ""force eat"" ( an considerable amount, nothing huge ) so my body disassociates the eating feeling with the sick feeling, right?

Thanks guys"

Some people I've talked to say its a great way to make your application stand out, and gives the hiring staff a better idea of who you are.  
Other people have said that it is completely unprofessional, and couldn't imagine why anyone would do that.

1mbo4j,69,2013-09-13,Women around me are constantly bodysnarking and caught up in fantasies of perfection. Never know what to do/say in response?,youshouldntbother,AskWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/1mbo4j/women_around_me_are_constantly_bodysnarking_and/,"I have had this problem follow me around for many years and I don't feel comfortable bringing it up with anyone I know personally, I'm just not one to burden others with work drama like this. 

I work at a magazine, and I've been in and around the magazine industry for many years now, going from clueless hillbilly girl to unpaid intern to freelancer to art director. I enjoy what I do because I love illuminating local journalism, the art of fashion, the dignity of personal style and beauty, etc... I want to continue on with my career path, and I genuinely adore all the fierce, articulate women I am constantly collaborating with. At each of the publishing houses I've been at, women run the whole show. You would think that these offices would be boiling over with girl power, but sometimes, it's quite the opposite, and I want this to change.

The problem is that, with alarming frequency, these women snark on their own bodies and the bodies of others. It's not always just bodysnarking, there's also a bit of fashionsnarking, agesnarking, socialsnarking... Sometimes the comments are harmless and meant to be funny, other times they seem to come from a place of hatred. It doesn't take much to understand that all of us are in this industry because we've been perusing fashion mags since we were little girls. I feel as though I grew up with enough guidance to not internalize the airbrushed figures, to realize that the images in magazines were fantasy, art, not replicable or relevant in real life whatsoever. Some of the older ladies, though they are strategic geniuses and very realistic leaders, still have exaggerated expectations of beauty from themselves and the world around them. 

It certainly doesn't help that I happen to have a figure that they desire. I'm one of those freaks of nature that is tall and thin without paying attention to diet or exercise. Perhaps I am overexposed to the comments about bodies because they think I am victim of the same thoughts they have. Anorexia and bulimia comments pop up every now and then, more in a joking way. One time I wore a necklace as a belt (a long one!) and over and over that day I was subjected to comments about my thinness. Moments like this cause me to stress about what I choose to wear every day. To dissuade from fixation on looks, I have tended to dress down more and more. Loose fits, pants, no heels. I want to be more adventurous in terms of personal style but I don't want to risk enticing comments. I just want them to like me and respect me, but mostly, I want them to like and respect themselves. 

I know that this sounds so lame, that being too thin a problem many women wish they had... It hurts to hear the comments they say about me, but more often it's directed at themselves, and that still sucks a lot. It's a very hard problem to fix, because it's so ingrained in this culture. Often we will be looking through collections of candid photos of events, and every other thing said is ""she looks SO fat here"" / ""omg. that dress makes her look like a stuffed sausage."" / ""that make-up is horrid"" and so on and so forth... I am at a loss for words, do they expect me to insult along with them? What I really want to say is ""That's very rude. She looks confident and proud that her event is so successful."" but that would just make them resent my refusal to play along. So I say nothing and I just nervously semi-giggle. That way I don't actively participate in the shaming but I also don't shame the shamer. How dramatic this all is... 

What can I say or do to help foster a culture of acceptance and self-love in the magazine industry? So far my strategy has been to lay low and remain a beacon of positivity and feminist solidarity, which has been effective to a degree, but I want to branch out to actively demonstrating how and why superficiality and self-loathing harms us all.

* Find out if your school has access to a ""research management tool"" (e.g. Ref Works). This has helped me a lot with making my bibliographies.  If your program doesnt, [Knight site](http://www.calvin.edu/library/knightcite/index.php) works fairly well.

So you say you're in college, huh? Let's assume you're a senior, so let's put your age around 22 to be generous.

&gt;In an AskReddit thread here you say you worked on Love Actually with Alan Rickman, nine fucking hours ago. That movie was released in 2003. Production was probably in 2002. So why was a eleven-twelve year old working on a film set?

&gt;As someone who works for a law firm, I find it very hard to believe this story. Also, he has the exact same style of writing as Ask_Me_If_Im_Racist.
Never mind the severance pay, an intern wouldn't even be asked to resign. He'd be escorted to the exit immediately.
So I second your call of Bullshit.

1mbdzg,7,2013-09-13,I (23/f) think my mother (49/f) might be a narcissist. Thoughts? Feedback?,sundayseeking,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1mbdzg/i_23f_think_my_mother_49f_might_be_a_narcissist/,"I’ve been having issues with my mother (49/f) for a few years now, and I’d like your opinion on these issues. I’ve come to believe that my mother is either a narcissist or has narcissistic traits. Here are some examples of her behavior that I believe fits the characteristics of a narcissistic mother. Any feedback on these and/or advice on how to handle this situation would be much appreciated.

**Gas Lighting:** I’ll give you the most recent example. I was over to her and my dad’s house for the weekend last week. Mom woke me up to tell me that Dad brought us coffee and muffins for breakfast and that I should go into the kitchen and eat because we were going to Costco. I got up and did so maybe fifteen minutes later and my mother came out into the kitchen. She asked me why I was eating breakfast when she told me we were going out to eat. I reminded her that she hadn’t said that. She insisted she’d told me we were going out to eat. I insisted she’d told me we were going to Costco and to eat breakfast at the house, she’d never mentioned going out to eat and she dropped it. I notice that this happens a lot, but I always doubt myself and apologize after questioning her and being told “No one listens to me!”

**No Respect for Belongings:** When I was a toddler, I had a red FisherPrice boat that was a bathtub toy. My dad, being the history buff that he is, named this boat after a World War II Japanese aircraft carrier. This was one of my favorite toys as a child. When reminiscing about this near the beginning of this year, I found out from my mother that I had a whole fleet of these boats. All named after WWII Japanese ships by my father. She threw them all away, couldn’t stand them. But the red one I remembered, and asked for, so she was unable to throw it away successfully. Initially, I thought this was funny … and then I told my fiancé about it. His reaction of complete horror made me realize that maybe this behavior wasn’t normal.

More recently, my aunt gave me some Victoria’s Secret underwear for Christmas. One thong, two pairs of normal underwear. My mom was convinced that my aunt was trying to convince me to sleep with my SO. I never wore the thong. I wore the other pairs, found them to be quite comfortable, and told my mom this. The thong disappeared and reappeared in my underwear drawer several times before going MIA. The other pairs eventually disappeared as well.

**Uneven Expectations:** My mother got very upset with me my junior year of college when I ceased to call her several times a day. For the first two years, I was an emotional trainwreck in need of constant reassurance and she was my security blanket. I would call five or six times a day and talk for up to an hour each time. By the end of my sophomore year, I met my fiancé, and my need to call home lessened. I would talk to him instead, he was better at calming and reassuring me. In addition, I had moved into an apartment with friends, got additional friends, and was in a much more supportive atmosphere than the first two isolated years. My mother was upset that I never called her, guilted me about this, but would rarely call me. Even now, I “never call” but if she needs a paper proofread or her dogs watched or even me to babysit the house so my brother won’t show up with his girlfriend, she calls. She demands. She guilts. And I do it. If I want her to call me, she won’t. If I ask her to visit, she won’t. I live an hour away, but what is too much of a drive for her is no problem for me.

My mother has been to my apartment a grand total of five times. I live an hour away from her and have been in this apartment for over a year. I’ve invited her for dinner numerous times, but always get the same excuse: it’s too far of a drive, I was up at 4am to go to work this morning, I’m tired, I don’t want to leave my dog. When she came over the last time, it was because my brother (who was visiting me) was having issues with his car and needed her and my dad to bring him jumper cables. When she and my dad arrived, she did not want to come up to my apartment, despite complaining that she needed to use a restroom. It took my dad reminding her that I have a functional bathroom to get her upstairs. When I asked, she wouldn’t do it. Later that day I badgered her for an answer on why she won’t ever come over. I pointed out how hurt she told me she was that I didn’t invite her up to my dorm room the few times she was in the area my senior year of college. I told her I was trying to address that hurt and make her feel welcome in my space, but it was hard to do that when she never accepted my invitations. She told me she was trying to give me the space to do what I wanted in life. Because if I extend an invitation to someone, that means I don’t want them to come over, obviously.

**It’s All About Her:** Tell her my fiancé and I are dating? “Why are you doing this to me!?” Tell her I don’t want to go over and babysit the house because my brother’s been unstable lately and I’m afraid of what he and his friends are capable of? “You need to just do what I asked you to do.” Question her on this? “You embarrassed me in front of all my friends, arguing with me on the phone!” and “I didn’t expect you to question me!” Talk to her about my fiancé and try to explain why I don’t think God told me he’s no? “It’s been a really stressful year. My mother is sick. My dog died. I just don’t know how much more I can take!” She cries, she complains, she tells me how “money is tight” for her and my dad. She tells me she feels like a failure as a parent because my brother has gone off the deep end (a story for another time). I feel enormous guilt. I’ve offered to pay their bills. I want to be independent so I’m not a burden. Her life not being perfect flips this “fix everything NOW” switch inside of me. And what’s even more frustrating is finding Facebook chats her complaining to my other aunt about my fiancé, the aunt complaining back (despite never asking me about him or getting to know him), and my mother telling my aunt that “it’s so heartbreaking” and she feels like a “failure as a mother”. What does my aunt tell her? “I won’t let you beat yourself up.” Just WOW.

**Doesn’t Listen to Me or I’m Always Wrong:** While finishing up my senior year of college, I was also working 40 hours a week at an internship. Between my classwork and job, I worked 70 to 80 hours a week. I felt run ragged, insane with anxiety, and like I absolutely could not handle everything going on in my life. During a (rare) phone call, I told her I thought I’d need to see a therapist once the semester was over. I said it in a joking-but-serious way. She told me not to not say things like that, that I would be fine and I wasn’t going to need any psychological help. She told me to keep my chin up. More recently, I spent a week so anxious I felt like I was bordering on a panic attack. This went on for five days. While on the phone with my mother, I told her that my anxiety was so bad I felt like I couldn’t find the off switch and was considering seeing a counselor. I should point out at this point that we are Christians. She told me not to “believe the lie of the Enemy” and went on to ask how often I pray and read my Bible. “Don’t you think it would help if you did that? Don’t you think you should? Why don’t you read your Bible and pray more? You don’t need a counselor.” While I would like to do daily devotionals, I see no problem going to a counselor … especially if my stress level is so high it affects my life in a negative way. But, I’m wrong here, clearly I just need the right perspective to look at my anxiety from. If I prayed more, if I read my Bible more, then I’d be fine. Never mind that the panic is real to me and I’m less and less functional because of it.

**Needing to Control or “Speak into her children’s lives”:** When I got my apartment, my mother made me promise not to have my fiancé stay over. I was paying for the apartment, all the bills, and have never asked my parents for money towards monthly expenses. I never tell my parents when my fiancé comes over and I live in terror of them finding out he does.

This past weekend, my mother joked about being able to push buttons on her kids. She’s done this my whole life, and it’s cute and annoying. Having a grumpy day? She’ll push the happy switch. And so on and so forth. I told her that kids aren’t RC cars and you can’t remote control them. I reminded her that kids are supposed to leave their parents and their parents are called to “train them up in the way they should go”, not control them. “Isn’t it great that I have these controls on my kids?” she says. I tell her “you don’t control me; I control me.”

**Critical:** My mother has told me I chew too loudly, don’t keep my tongue in my mouth when I take a bite of food, talk to loud, stomp instead of walk, encouraged me to “put some effort” into my hair and makeup and clothes, told me I always pick out clothes that look bad on me when we go clothes shopping, and told me that I need different glasses because the ones I have don’t look good on me. When my fiancé tells me I’m beautiful, I don’t believe him. I feel ugly and self-conscious and I hate my body. I feel like other people will not like me and I don’t fit in with them because I’m not pretty enough. My mother is confused as to why I feel this way and will tell me I’m beautiful. I don’t believe her either.

I found your subreddit this past weekend while at my parents’ house and identified with many of the posts. I spent the weekend stressed out and feeling like I was seeing things clearly for the first time. Since then, I’ve been unable to process my emotions. First I’m pure anger and hatred and I want to blow up at my parents and family. Then I’m depressed. Then I’m sad. Then I don’t feel anything. Then I’m panicked. I don’t know what to do anymore, I feel lost and helpless and I just want to run away. But I also feel like I need parental approval.

What do you think of my mother? Any advice on dealing with the emotions I’m going through. Any advice or feedback would be very much welcomed and appreciated. Thank you for listening.

**TL;DR:** I think my mother is a narcissist."

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[How are songs chosen? Is it random, or is there a intention in the way/reason they are played in a particular order?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc70v62?context=5)|There is almost always intention with the order of songs. What that intent is varies by format. A top 40 station is current, so it won't want to play an ""older"" song (more than a year old) back to back with another. The station will want to surround it a more current songs. Other things taken into consideration are tempo, genre, artist separation, mood, lyrics/message, when it played last, how long has it been since it played in this hour, and there could be dozens of other variables. It really varies by format as well as by program director.
[Why do radio stations insist on playing the same songs over and over and over again? How does the radio station benefit from it? (For example, Lorde - Royals is consistently played at least three times an hour on some stations\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc711zm?context=5)|3 times an hour on one station? Are you sure? Tell me what station if it's in the US, because I can almost guarantee you that isn't the case. Radio stations do research to find the most popular and familiar songs right now among its target listeners. They don't want to experiment much with unfamiliar music, because the average person gives a station about 3 seconds before it goes to the next station. If that person doesn't hear something that immediately reminds them how much they love that song, they are likely to move onto the next station. Radio can't do anything to get people to turn the radio on, but they can do something about avoiding someone from tuning out once they get there. Is it a dangerous mentality? Maybe. But, it has been proven time and time again to garner ratings, and that's the final objective.
[What are the criteria for a song to make it onto the radio? How do radio stations measure feedback for these new songs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc711zm?context=5)|Second question: Stations, depending on market size, might conduct testing with groups of people in their markets. They might do online music testing using their listener database, or even survey companies who have local email lists of people in the target demographic. Phone and email response is usuallly ignored because it is such a small piece of the population. If 30 people call a station about a song, so what? That station could have 200,000 listeners (in a med-large market). 30 mean nothing. Since it's a mass media, they'd prefer to go online where they can get a sample of several hundred people in their target demographic to provide input.
[What's your prediction for the future of AM radio?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc70zy5?context=5)|It's over. People under 45 don't go to the AM band (generally), and as each year passes there are that many fewer people available to listen. Radio owners are scrambling right now to protect their big AM stations by adding an FM simulcast to them in hopes of appealing to a younger audience. The verdict on that is still out in most cases, although there are exceptions in markets like San Francisco and Washington, DC.
[I'm 32 and I hate listening to music on the radio.  Radio is ok for weather, news or sports.  But the music I want to listen to just isn't played on the radio.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc7g30u?context=5)|I don't know what you mean by your question. Do you mean that young people won't be listening to FM radio? If so, I don't think so. I think radio has a real challenge to stop putting on host-less all-music formats that have no personality or content on them. Like you allude to, music is available everywhere. Radio needs to step up and start creating unique content that isn't available elsewhere.
[Do you think that in 20 - 30 years FM radio will be where AM radio is now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc7g30u?context=5)|Radio is working on this with success in some places, and will hopefully step up the pace on it.
[The fact that a radio executive with 15 years experience doesn't understand that people listen to music channels to hear music is the reason people keep wondering when radio will die.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc7nd6x?context=5)| 
[I work in radio myself.  I understand it brings in money, but it does nothing but ruin the reputation of radio as a medium. Plus, those ad spots could be used to help local businesses.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc70w51?context=5)|Sadly, they work. And if they work, ad agencies will continue to use them. Radio has done a poor job of helping advertisers make better commercials, and agencies do a generally poor job of creating good commercials. They create EFFECTIVE commercials, but often times at the sacrifice of the radio station.
 |As you said, ""it brings in the money,"" and many radio managers don't care enough to stand up against it. Or, they've been shot down by GMs who up against an impossible sales goal and can't really concern themselves with big picture thinking when it's the 28th of the month and they're only at 85% of budget.
[How do I get my song on a local radio station? Can I use my $200 condenser mics and home studio? I have written many songs and contributed hooks to breakout artists.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc71i80?context=5)|Depends on what size of a city you're in. It's much easier to walk into a radio station and talk to the program director in Casper, WY than it is in Chicago.
 |The short answer, however, is marketing. Email the song, mail a CD, email it again, drop it off at the station, make a phone call, email again. The big record labels spam the hell out of program directors on a daily basis.
 |Also, be sure to submit your song to Mediabase and BDS. They monitor radio stations, so this will help you get credit if your song does get airplay.
[Thank you! I didn't realize the big shots spammed, but I knew the likes of Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, might have dinner/lunch with an owner at least at the start of their careers.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc73viq?context=5)|Yes, labels love sending out their stuff over and over. Like everyone else, program directors are extremely busy. It takes effort to get their attention. It's so easy to get data on local sales, digital downloads, etc., so radio program directors have enough data to do their jobs without the ""help"" of labels. So, labels and indie artists need to fight through the clutter.
[How much have ad sales fallen fur to the Internet?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc6zicx?context=5)|I have not seen any specific reports/studies about how much money has moved from radio to Internet, but it is clearly a fact. National radio groups are having much more success monetizing their online platforms due to the large reach; they can get money from the national advertisers who truly budget money for online. The smaller local and regional groups are still having a very tough time getting some of that money for the opposite reason -- less reach.
 |The bigger talk in radio is about the amount of money going to mobile (versus internet). Radio has generally done a good job embracing mobile as a platform to be available for fans, however monetizing mobile is still an uphill struggle for radio.
 |My opinion is that radio needs to stop trying to get radio sales people to sell their online/mobile assets, and instead hire college graduates who understand those platforms and get them out there selling it. It's much easier to buy something from someone who actually understands it.
[Regarding audio: What's the difference between mobile and internet? Are you talking about apps for radio stations?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc71dxy?context=5)|Good question. Internet I'm thinking of web browsing from a computer, versus mobile which I think of as using the internet from a mobile device. I know they are both ""internet"", but hopefully that provides clarification to how I'm using the terms.
[I'm a twenty year old aspiring radio producer/broadcaster with a decent amount of experience under my belt and I'll be moving to London this Saturday to study radio production!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc70t9i?context=5)|Luckily, in London (and much of Europe) there are many more radio jobs still in existence compared to the US, which means you have more opportunity.
[What are your best tips in respect to breaking into the industry at a high level?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc70t9i?context=5)|Breaking in at a high level? Very few do it. You usually need to break in at a low level. Walk into radio stations, tell them you want an internship, and ALWAYS be in the building offering to help. Seriously, it's the truth.
[How are ratings calculated (is the system equivalent to Nielsen ratings on TV\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc6zvcp?context=5)|Ratings are measured electronically in larger markets, and are measured by listener recall in interviews with ratings companies in smaller markets. Nielsen is actually in the process of trying to acquire Arbitron, radio's largest ratings service.
[At least at the stations I have listened to, there seems to be much turnover in the airstaff and I frequently read about people being fired.  What are the primary reasons for the high turnover? Is it ratings, cost, or something else?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc6zvcp?context=5)|The primary reason for turnover in 2013 is typically cost, but ratings can very much play into it. Not knowing the market, station, or other specifics, it's tough for me to make an educated guess. However, most cuts in recent history are strictly cost-based.
[How does a company like I Heart Radio make their money?  I use it all the time, there is very little (if any commercials\)...I have never given them a dime...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc6zpdm?context=5)|IHeartRadio is owned by Clear Channel and all of their radio stations are there. They've also done deals with competitors, like Cumulus, so they carry those stations, too.
 |In comparison to terrestrial radio, it does not run many ads, however internet advertising is sold by thousands of impressions.
 |Example: An advertiser might pay $5 per 1,000 impressions (their ad playing 1,000 times). When you consider that millions of people stream Clear Channel (and Cumulus) stations, it really comes down to scale.
 |Like I mentioned on another post on this topic, the large, national companies are the ones having the most success monetizing internet because they have that large scale reach.
[Music has been a large part of my life since I was a young kid. My father being a DJ at a roller hockey ring. I was raised listening to EDM (electronic dance music\) with over 100+ genres of EDM.. Dubstep, Drum and base, electro, etc. I am confused as to why no one has released a strictly EDM music station. Now don't get me wrong, there are a few. BPM on XM radio for example. But let me explain, the ""beats"" played on all these stations are not up to par or up to date with any ""real"" EDM followers.When a rap star or pop star comes out with a new hit single, you better bet you're gunna hear that damn song 15 times a day for the next month... These EDM stations are replaying the same boring out dated stuff multiple times a day. I find myself asking, did the DJ just give up?  Now let's throw out a hypothetical. If i started my own station, and played only the ""top"" tracks in the EDM scene. it would be a huge hit. I speak for hundreds of people I know, if there was a station that played good EDM, it would be the main station of today's youth. EDM is the music choice of the new generation. Why is no one tending to our needs?  I understand the regulations for a radio station are quite complex , but this is a nation, a generation, looking for music with no luck. And unless I play good EDM from my phone, there is no way I'm finding it on the radio.  Why has no one does this? What would need to be done to start ones own radio station?  Would you be interested in something like this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc8owgd?context=5)|Boston has an EDM station, but I'm not sure about it's success.  EDM has a very PASSIONATE fan base, but it's not a LARGE fan base. Remember that radio is MASS appeal, and needs to appeal to as many people as it can get away with. In most markets of the US, EDM does not have a large enough fan base to justify using an FM signal on it. MANY markets have EDM stations on an HD radio channel. If the fan base was that big, HD radio would be selling a lot more radios.  EDM, just like Americana, has a passionate niche following in most of the country, which is why it's not on a terrestrial station.  Remember, radio owners are ALWAYS looking for the next big thing, so you can be sure all sorts of formats are being tested all the time.
[Hello! I was wondering what career options there are for a graduate with Visual Communications/Design and Marketing Management degrees, but a very strong interest (not experience\) in writing?  I am also really good at finding ""good music"" that should be on the radio, but isn't.  Are there online radio stations that would be open to someone to select new music to feature? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc9m5vv?context=5)|If you have an interest in writing, copywriting is a huge opportunity. Most commercials on the radio suck. Period. Radio needs people to write better commercials.
 |""Good music"" is subjective, and most radio stations are well aware of what's out there. Trust me... my radio colleagues and I are always talking about music that is ""unknown""... sometimes we're talking about a song two years before it ever makes it on the radio. Radio truly is filled with music geeks, but radio is still a business. We have to give listeners what they want, and we do research to ask them what they want. It would be dangerous to start flooding a station with a bunch of unfamiliar music just to try and be a trailblazer. People want to hear music they know. The kind of people that like to discover music are far and few between, and unfortunately don't justify a large enough % of the population to start playing too much unfamiliar music.
[Why is Sirius/XM raping my butt? And why am I enjoying it? Serious, all I want is Howard Stern. It's bullshit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc6zzoo?context=5)|I am not sure why Sirius/XM is raping your butt, nor am I sure how. It doesn't use the standard long, solid antenna.
 |People have talked about them offering a la carte, but truthfully, access to 150 channels for $12 or $16/month is really cheap. I doubt they'll ever go that route.
[Why are morning programs so annoying?  I'd rather they just play music.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc7g3m9?context=5)|It sounds like you might be in a smaller market where morning shows don't get to test their content. They simply wait for ratings, and if ratings are good then they keep doing what they're doing. Large and major markets will test content before and after using it to get a feel for what people like and don't like.
[Also, do early morning DJs not realize how unfunny and annoying they are?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc7g3m9?context=5)|There is also a subset of the listening audience (like you) who just want music. The truth is that radio will not survive by ""just playing music"" because ""just music"" is available everywhere. Radio needs to create content. Period.
[I'm talking about people like JohnBoy and Billy and Marconi the Night Ninja.  They aren't funny.  They never were.  But yet they try so hard to be.  If I'm driving and I hear their voice I turn off the radio immediately.  Seems like radio stations would want their listeners to do the opposite.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc7pewl?context=5)|JohnBoy and Billy is an extremely successful show, so while you turn it off, don't let that lead you to believe others are the same. They are in a market where ratings are measured electronically (meaning ACTUAL listening is being tracked). They would not be on the air in that market if they didn't actually have a lot of listeners.
[Do you still have the 'faith' in terrestrial radio? If I were in radio still, I wouldn't at all be worried about satellite radio. It's the digital/cellular/internetz that poses more 'threat' because the cost of entry is insignificant comparatively to satellite or the purchase that comes with a license. I just don't ever see radio going away. It's too cheap, too efficient. Too local. Too immediate. Someone will always find a way to make money with it. Maybe not (and probably not\) the big players, who are constantly trying to squeeze a few extra bucks out of it, at the cost of the very things that I think make it perpetually viable. What do you think?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc72n67?context=5)|I have a lot of faith in terrestrial radio if it remains local and therefore relevant. Terrestrial radio stations are extremely expensive to operate, which is the real competitive challenge. But the owners and stations that focus on delivering results to local businesses will forever thrive. Period. If you sell something that works, people will keep buying it. Business 101.
[I live in Europe, and listen almost exclusively to publicly funded public service radio, with absolutely no advertisements at all. The image I have to commercial radio in America is that there's an ad every five minutes, and that in an hour of radio you might get half-an-hour of actual radio content? Is my view of commercial radio even remotely correct in tersm of the number of ads?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc754x1?context=5)|The average music radio station in the US runs 12 minutes of commercials per hour max, and usually in two clumps of six minutes each on opposite sides of the hour.
 |The average talk station runs about 18 minutes of commercials per hour, divided into 5-6 breaks. 
[I'm curious how most radio stations get their music...I'm thinking more older stations before the internet, specifically would stations buy full albums (like vinyl records\), or merely singles.  Did they even use vinyl or did they use cassettes or 8 tracks?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc72jy6?context=5)|They used (past tense) vinyl. They would get their music from the record labels. The mailbox would be full with music on a daily basis. In larger cities, the record labels would personally drop the music off to the radio station. Also, before the huge record labels got so huge, local artists had better chances of getting radio play so they could walk in off the street and submit their music. Then, radio ratings came around and quickly taught radio the sad truth... the average person wants to hear the biggest songs, period. The average person doesn't care about a song just because it's local. If it's not a great song, people will let you know... quickly.
[Thanks! You didn't exactly answer whether they would use full albums or just singles though.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc73hu3?context=5)|Typically singles. That was so program directors could make sure the DJ wouldn't play some unknown album cut instead of the hit song listeners were expecting.
[Interesting...For some non single hits (thinking of Zeppelin in particular\), would the directors make their own tapes or something so they would specifically play what they wanted them to or no?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc73xei?context=5)|Well, there were of course exceptions to the rule. Sometimes a non-single would get airplay and they'd use the album. But as a practice, the single was what was kept in the studio (when available).
[So from what I gather from you, the DJ's don't really have much of a say into what gets played?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc74mkn?context=5)|No, they have not for several decades. Once ratings services started asking people what stations they listened to, it quickly became evident that stations that set an expectation of what a listener would get were the ones with the most listeners. Stations that were free form, and therefore had no clear expectation set for listeners, had much smaller listener groups. Those listeners also listened for much less time to those stations. Then, formats were born and DJs were no longer disk jockeys... they were then hosts or talent or on-air personalities. They were not jockeying disks... whatever that means anyway.
[Fascinating. How do the producers decide what's a ""good"" song?  Great AMA!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc75ljx?context=5)|Research. 
[Why isn't there sat TV for vehicles yet?  I figured SIRI would have done that years ago, primarily for childrens programming in the back seat.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc6ze7t?context=5)|I personally don't spend much time reading, but I imagine it has something to do with the amount of bandwidth it takes to send TV signals. As you can hear by listening to SIRI, they already have the bitrate/compression on audio-only channels (radio) turned way down and the fidelity is awful.
 |I don't doubt they're working on it, but this is all my own speculation/assumption. I am definitely an audio person.
[I'm a Communication major and curious how the job market is right now in radio. I do have a few questions.  Many internships for radio stations are promotional things where you have to go to events, sit under a tent and pass out flyers. Just wondering if these internships eventually lead to jobs higher up.  If I'm looking to get into talk radio (shock jock\) type work, do I still go the internship route?  I'm not going to rudely ask your salary, but is it a hefty amount for the amount of work you do?  What is your opinion on Communication as a major. Many discourage me telling me its a bullshit major, but I enjoy it.  Is the Satellite radio industry a lot more relaxing to work for rather than a local FM station?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc75545?context=5)|It depends on the size of the market, and the needs of the radio station. From my experience, interns come in and do what they're told and that's it. Sounds ideal, but you need to let it be known that you want a job. Be visible, be available, be around, let it be known what you want. Program Directors want to hire people who are hungry and passionate about radio. Just because you had an internship won't guarantee you a job. It's your foot in the door, but you need to make sure the right people know what you'd like to do. Even if they can't help at that station, they can help with others. Radio people are very well networked and connected to each other. It's a small, incestuous business.  Radio compensation is fair. Low-level executives and middle managers are paid fairly, but not excessively. Considering it is a job is very enjoyable, the compensation along with perks make it very fair. I likely won't get filthy rich in this industry, but I'll live a life I'm extremely grateful for.  It depends on your goal. You don't need to be a Comm major to get into radio. If you're asking this question based on wanting to do radio, I'd say pick a major that relates to the type of job in radio you want. Want to be a manager? Get a business degree. Want to do talk radio? Get a degree in history, political science, social science, etc. Essentially get versed in the exact thing(s) you want to do.
 |You'll probably want to create a podcast and just start doing shows. It's cheap (maybe free). See if you can build a following on one of the popular sites for podcasts like blogtalkradio.com. Build a following, get good at doing the kind of show you like doing, an then start making demos out of it. Who knows... you may find that podcasting is more enjoyable for ""shock"" content since you don't have to edit yourself.  In the sense of not worrying about ratings, yes. In the sense that satellite radio really has a limited number of employees for 150 stations, no. 
[Question about talk radio. taking their comments at face value, there are many ""liberal"" (for shorthand purposes\) talk shows that say they get great ratings, some that beat out ""conservative"" shows on a regular basis. yet there are 600 stations that carry limbaugh, 400+ for hannity, 200+ for levin, savage, beck and less than 30 that carry bill press, thom hartmann (on commercial radio, he does a pacifica radio commercial free simulcast\), stephanie miller, ed schultz, norman goldman, and mike malloy. even in heavily ""liberal"" cities there isn't one second of ""liberal"" radio.  So i have multiple questions. 1\) why aren't the radio conglomerates giving the alternative voice a chance, understandably not on the legacy main stick where they are compelled to carry those big conservative voices, but on the other lower powered station in these markets? 2\) why were these stations that were the ""liberal"" stations flipping to sports all of a sudden (and if they have worse ratings than before the flip why they haven't flipped back\)? and 3\) is it really that much harder to sell ads for ""liberal"" shows than ""conservative"" shows even if the audiences are about the same size?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc75ull?context=5)|The truth is the big companies really did try liberal talk radio. I worked for a one of them. The ratings just didn't come to be in nearly all cases. Without ratings you don't get regional or national advertising money. And considerthat many small business owners are conservative, so that shrinks your opportunity at local advertising money. No ratings and no revenue means no radio station.  I'm sorry you didn't like my comment on AM radio. You are an exception to the rule. I see ratings for a couple dozen large markets and was simply stating the truth... AM radio is primarily consumed by people 45 and older. In some cases, the under 45 audience to an AM station is less than 20%.
[Do you work for a clear channel station?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc6zzm3?context=5)|I do not, but not many people do. They are an ever-shrinking company, unfortunately. The industry has suffered thousands of layoffs over the last five years.
[Ugh, shrink on, I say.  Clear channel played a big part in killing radio.  Edit: I love the radio and don't want to see it shrink, but I do want to see clear channel ease off. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc707qa?context=5)|Their debt will catch up with them one day. That will mean they have to sell off their assets. Sadly, those assets would probably go to another monster company who will do even more cutting in an effort to finance their purchase. Sad cycle, but it's reality.
[Is it as awesome as i think it is to be in the advertising business when it comes election time? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc72zld?context=5)|For the owners, yes. For the sales reps, no. Political candidates, by federal law, must be given the lowest ad rate on the station. So, they get to run a bunch of ads, and the sales rep is getting pennies compared to what they'd get if a normal advertiser ran that many commercials.
[Here in LA we have an am Korean station that has a really cool Asian American hour but I'm sad to hear that AM stations are no good. Or would it depend on the city?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc7q4sg?context=5)|AM is not reaching young (or really even middle age) adults anymore. It really only serves niche purposes as time goes by. What you describe would be a good example of that because you can't get that programming anywhere else... most likely.
[How hard is it to obtain a radio frequency?  And is it true that in the near future aviation will go all digital and open up the rest of the FM frequency for radio?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc7v0y1?context=5)|A new frequency? It's pretty tough. You need to wait for an FCC auction (happens every 2-5 years) to bid on frequencies that they've made available. In most cases the bidding gets very expensive, and not worth it. If you plan smart, and don't mind moving, you can find some small city/community frequencies that sometimes sell for $2,500. You then have the cost of building the station (transmitter, studio, etc.), but if you're frugal you can get that all done for about $50,000 assuming you run into no legal issues.
[Let's say an artist, I don't know we'll say Taylor Swift, comes out with a new single. How is that single delivered to radio stations, how does her label make money off you playing it, how do you keep your mailroom from pirating copies and selling them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc74yfm?context=5)|This question is answered in this thread. In an effort to answer as many unique questions add possible in going to request that you read the other comments. I hope you understand. 
[When will the quality of radio for free get better in my car?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc713ug?context=5)|By ""quality"" are you referring to reception and signal strength? Or quality of programming? I need clarification of your question.
[I always wondered, A radio DJ that has a morning show from 6 am till 8 am, what does he do the rest of the day? And do they make a lot money like tv stars or doesn't the radio business pay good?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc85yh8?context=5)|The typical morning show will arrive around 4am, be on the air from 6am-10am, then work on the next day's show. A successful morning show really does have a full day. They often also spend their days going to meet clients (schmoozing) and working with charities.
[Reception and signal strength.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc735ec?context=5)|It won't. It will only get worse. The FCC is handing out more and more licenses as time goes on. They're doing this in the name of ""more voices is better."" The downside is that there is a lot more noise on the dial, so other stations won't be able to improve their power output.
 |HD Radio has better fidelity than FM, however it is not used by all stations and it generally has a shorter (distance) signal range. 
[What about remote connections? Is the Comrex the way to go, or do you just recook the audio and hope for the best? ;\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc7oney?context=5)|I haven't worked at a station in the last few years that uses anything other than mobile apps to handle remote broadcasts.
[Why do radio stations waste time by saying ""30 minutes of non-stop, commercial free radio!"" instead of just playing another song?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc7n3ro?context=5)|It's positioning and branding. They want to remind people that they are THE station that plays 30 minutes of non-stop music, so that tomorrow on their drive home from work when they keep hitting commercials on other stations, they'll hopefully remember ""this station plays 30 minutes of music, let's check them out."" That's a VERY, dumbed down version of this answer, but that's essentially the point.
 |Also, most radio markets are rated based on recall meaning people have to keep track of what they REMEMBER listening to. There are tactics (like saying 30 minutes of non stop music) that stations HOPE will cause someone to write down that they listened to said station for 30 minutes, even if it was only 15.
 |But, mostly, it's to remind you what they're known for. It's absolutely no different than the fact that Coke puts their logo on every can. Why? You bought the case, and took it home. Do they need to remind you on every can that it's a Coke? No... but it's branding. The more we see/hear/are exposed to something, the more likely we are to recall it.
[How are royalties allocated to artists/labels to which you air on the radio and what equipment if any is used to police this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc7475d?context=5)|ASCAP, BMI and SESAC collect licensing fees from radio stations. The total number of how much a station pays is a percentage of revenue. So, the more successful a station is, the more money it pays in licensing fees to those three bodies. Also, a few times a year either or all of those entities will request a full report of all songs played over a specific period of time (that the license organization determines). They use that data from across the country to determine how to allocate to licensing money to the songwriters.
 |Labels make their money from record sales.
 |Artists make their money from the record label in whatever deal they negotiate, concerts/tours, merchandise sales, endorsements, etc. and will also receive songwriter licensing money for the songs they wrote themselves.
[I don't think their are enough unbiased new stations. What is your opinion, and why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc8unv8?context=5)|There really aren't that many news stations in the country. Maybe 20 full-time news stations, and news stations aren't typically known as having bias.
 |If you're referring to newsTALK stations, then yes. There is bias, and it's conservative. Why? Because it generates ratings. I'd like to see more options on radio, but I've also tried other options myself (meaning I've put on Liberal talk, middle of the road, etc.) and they just don't work. My OPINION is that public radio serves the progressive mentality, because it's considered ""anti-establishment"" against the big conservative talk stations. Again, that's my opinion as someone who spends a lot of time listening to both conservative talk radio, news radio and public radio.
[Will Rock n Roll radio make a comeback anytime soon?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc7nf3t?context=5)|Are you referring to the original rock and roll, like from the 50s/60s? If so, no. It targets an audience that advertisers don't want to spend money acquiring. Advertisers want to reach people under 55 years old, and in general people don't listen to music that came out before they were born. Are there exceptions? Of course, but I'm speaking generally. Radio is a MASS medium, and must appeal to the MASSES, not the select niche few.
 |If you're referring to something else when you say ""rock n roll"" let me know.
[I don't know if you're still here or not, however. I graduated from college about a year ago, did an internship with a Chicago classic rock station. I'm still trying to get a job in the industry, any idea's or suggestions to help?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9bni/i_am_a_radio_executive_ask_me_anything_related_to/cc78880?context=5)|It depends on what kind of job you want. Are you wanting to be on the air? If so, see if that station would let you use a studio to put together a demo then start mailing it out to stations. You're more likely to get a start on the air in a small market. Chicago is the 3rd largest market (out of over 300 markets), so getting an on-air job there will be nearly impossible without prior experience. Go to smaller markets around you to look for entry level opportunities.

The information I've received from HR points to this event playing out the same as the intern event I attended two years ago. There were 30 or so prospective interns at the event and around 10 were hired.

This event is for a full-time position within the company. When the recruiter calls to follow up with specific details, would it be appropriate for me to ask how many people they are looking to hire?"
1mb8nf,4,2013-09-13,"I honestly don't know who else to turn to to process all this. I got into graduate school, but I'm not excited about it and no one understands.",Kalypso989,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1mb8nf/i_honestly_dont_know_who_else_to_turn_to_to/,"So I've been wanting to go to graduate school for a while, in the past two years, I've been scoring the colleges in my state and decided on three in my area in a two hour radius. 

I did a lot more research and found that one college only accepts the GRE scores, instead of the MAT scores, which I had been planning on taking (math and I don't get along). I also learned that I would have to take another full semester of psychology classes just to be considered for the program. The extra classes plus the GRE requirement caused me to cross that one off my list. It was down to do: my alma mater and a college whose reputation for the best Christian college in my state, possibly the East Coast. 

I chose that particular college because of the fantastic online program for counseling, as well as an equine therapy internship. My obsession with horses paired with my desire to help people was the right choice for the college, I believe. My alma mater, well, that was obvious. The problem? My alma mater requires an ENTIRE YEAR worth of courses before they'd consider me. I have an education background, not counseling or psychology, so they'd require me to have at least junior level classes under my best before I should think about applying. That'd put my entire plan a year and a half behind schedule.

The other college, we'll call it L, required just my transcripts and an application to be accepted. I was a little put off by the simplicity of it all. I got an email this morning saying I'd been accepted. I had a 4.0 GPA when I graduated from my alma mater, and they said they would enjoy having my work ethic in the school's program. 

I'm not excited. I should be jumping around and screaming in happiness. Did it really just take my transcripts and an application and a ten minute conversation with the director of admissions for me to actually get into an online master's program?! I'm also concerned about the stigma that will come of going to this college. I have learned from you beautiful ladies not to care what others think, and by God, I've been doing my best, but when you tell your neighbor you got into the L graduate program and they say, ""Oh... you're going there?! Why?"" It certainly deflates me a bit. Granted, they're known for bigotry, small-mindedness, and extremely conservative Christian values, but they also have one of the best online programs in the country, and I believe I would benefit from the online program. I can do it now, I don't have to take any added courses (they're all included in the program) and I can still work full time without having to drive two hours to get to campus.

I tried explaining all this to my friends, family, and boyfriend, but they're just saying that I'm in shock, that these reservations will go away in January when I start. My mom even pointed out that when I graduated college, I didn't seem all that excited about it, despite working my ASS off to get a 4.0. Ladies, have you ever had these feelings? Is this online program really worth it if I don't feel excited about it? Should I wait for another year and apply to my alma mater after taking a year of classes to prepare?

I feel like I should go here just because I have gotten in already and don't want to go through the hassle of taking more tests, more classes, and more time when I know exactly what I want to do. Ladies, your advice, support, and love have always helped me. I'm reaching out to you again..

**TL;DR: I got accepted into an online graduate program from a great college academically but are known for it's extreme Christian values and bigotry. I'm concerned about having gotten in so easily and the stigma that comes with going to that school. I need your advice. Please read the whole thing. :)**"

It sort of feels like I'm just really hungry. But then I have gas, and it smells rancid. I usually feel a bit better after I eat a bowl of cereal but I still have gas. Then when I take a dump I usually get about one solid turd and the rest is diarrhea.

 It's been getting worse. It didn't happen every morning until this week. But it originally started back over the summer. I thought it was probably just distress because I was nervous about going to intern for the first time. But then I also had problems when I was flying back from Arizona and I got motion sickness for the first time on a plane. My stomach and appetite were thrown off for the longest time after that so maybe that might have some play into it.

I just started on a new medicine for my ADD, Focalin. I started two weeks ago on that I believe so maybe that's what's causing it.

Edit: I am 16 and I've never had this happen before. And just following along with the side bar, it doesn't itch."

[Maybe NSFW, because, well, strippers.] Pt. 1",larafrompinkpony,fatpeoplestories,https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1mb7z5/at_the_joker_lounge_a_tale_of_strippers_maybe/,"Long time reader, first time poster. Despite the fact that I live in the South, I can't say that I've had much exposure to the fatlogic that supposedly pervades this region. Nevertheless, here's my salacious tale of a fat stripper and desperation for y'alls. It happened a couple months ago, but it took me a while to get together the requisite... visual aids. I'm writing this story primarily as a response to [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1ijycv/tp_thin_privilege_is_being_a_successful_stripper/) TiTP post featured here a while back.


Bit of background first: I am a stripper. I've been dancing for about 7 years now; I enjoy my job and I'm good at it. I tend to do pretty well on stage, when I meet the right crowd - I've been taking pole dance classes for the past 2 years, and have a pole at home that I practice on. Unfortunately, most people don't believe in tipping more for a good show. A national pole dancing champion works at my home club, so I really had to step up my game to make decent stage tips, though she still makes me look like a drunk sorority girl on amateur night in comparison.


Our story begins in the month of July. I just recently graduated in December with my MS in Neurobiology, and I had shit luck at finding a job. Luckily, I somehow obtain a paid month-long internship in a molecular biology lab. While it isn't what I studied at all, is at least something in my field and will give me some useful lab skills. (Like a moron, I did my graduate work in computational neuroscience, which isn't really relevant anywhere outside of academia.) The catch is that it's in a city 2 hours away from Atlanta, so I'll have to relocate to Augusta for the job. If Atlanta is the heart of Georgia, then Augusta is the armpit, and soon you'll see why.


Anyway, after a couple weeks of happily working at my internship, I got that old familiar urge to be on stage again. I missed that adrenaline rush of performing, and having people fling handfuls of money at me. (That, and internship pay wasn't really cutting it.) I did some googling, and found that Augusta has 3 strip clubs. I made my rounds and found one that'd allow me to come on in a flexible schedule. When Friday 7PM rolled around later that week, I was early to the club and eager to WORK!


Record scratch. 


This club has one main stage. It doesn't even have poles on it. There's no DJ; music comes from a jukebox in the corner that the dancers have to feed dollar bills into. That's right, we have to pay for the music out of our own pockets. There are 2 secondary stages scattered around the club, round tables approximately 5 feet in diameter with a brass pole in the middle. The bartender/manager explains to  me that this is a no-contact club (okay, cool...) where if we do a private dance, it's on top of the secondary stages (uh, okay) and that $10 of each $20 private dance goes to the bar. (WAIT, WHAT?) I tell her that pole work is my specialty. ""Oh, then you'll do well here,"" she says, smiling at me reassuringly.


By the time 10PM rolls around, I've already been on stage 3 times and made approximately $6 in tips from old men who crane their necks when they approach to tip me, trying to get a gynecological view of my ladyparts. The $6 was promptly recycled into the jukebox, leaving me with a net of $0, and I still had to yet to pay house fees. I'm sitting at the bar sipping ginger ale, pissed that I'm wasting a Friday night in this shithole. At least the other girls here seem friendly. I chat with a few of them, and they all tell me not to expect this place to be like Atlanta. Clearly.


By 11PM, business has started to pick up a little. A few regulars have come in and settled in the corner seats with their favorite dancers. A blonde dancer is sitting closely with an older man who appears to be in his late sixties. I catch her looking at me, and she gives me a desultory wave. I take it as an invitation to join them, so I make my way over. 


""Rich, this is the new girl,"" she drawls. ""What's your name, honey? I'm Sparkles.""

""I'm Lara,"" I say. ""Nice to meet you, Sparkles.""

""She's *so* pretty, isn't she?"" Sparkles says, looking me up and down. I smile modestly. ""But too skinny, don't you think? Men like to see a woman with some curves."" She giggles and jiggles her breasts at Rich coyly. Rich rubs her thigh absently, as he takes me in, close up. I'll admit, Asian strippers are an uncommon sight anywhere, but we are particularly rare in small southern towns. Sometimes this works in my favor, sometimes not.


I guess this is the part of the FPS where I describe Sparkles as a bloated scooterwhale, and compare myself to her favorably. But this is real life, and not an FPS about the beetus, cundishuns, and blud sugah, so I will describe Sparkles honestly and leave myself out of this completely. She is approximately 5'3 and somewhere in the neighborhood of 220 pounds. Her formidable stomach precedes the rest of her; her panniculus droops slightly past her mons pubis. It seems that a large portion of her body fat resides in her breasts, which are pendulous and barely contained by a dayglo orange bikini top. They rest atop of her rounded stomach like indolent, neon sea lions sunning on the shore. Her thighs are heavy, but slim down to surprisingly shapely calves. She is wearing fishnet stockings, ostensibly to help disguise cellulite in the dim lighting of the club. 


""Where are you from?"" asks Rich. His voice is low and raspy. He diffidently looks over to Sparkles before he begins talking to me. 

""Maryland,"" I reply.

""No, I mean, where are you *really* from?""

I roll my eyes. Of course I knew what he meant the first time. ""My family is from China,"" I say.

""Asian women don't have any ass,"" Sparkles interjects.

I play along, standing up and twirling around to cheekily wag my butt at them. ""I'm the exception!"" 

""You don't have much in the way of boobs though,"" she retorts. I shrug. I cup my breasts and jiggle them around a bit. ""I've got enough,"" I say. It's true. I'm not blessed, but I have more than mosquito bites. Nobody says anything for a moment. Rich's eyes are boring into my chest with laserlike focus, as though he could see what lay behind the bikini top if he just looked a little harder. I look into his eyes and give him a sly smile. I've got him entranced. A sale is imminent.


""What's that on your leg?"" Sparkles points sharply at the large bruise on my calf. She has broken the spell.

""Pole bruise,"" I say nonchalantly. ""I do a lot of pole work, and I bruise easy. I used to dance in Atlanta, and we're big on pole there.""

""*Pole*,"" she scoffs. ""Yeah, we don't really do that here. But I'm the best dancer in the club. I'm really good on the pole, and *I* don't bruise like that."" I look at her incredulously. Granted, I'm a biologist and not a physicist, but I have a fair understanding of Newtonian mechanics. Her power to weight ratio suggested that it was unlikely that she could do anything more dynamic than huff and puff around the pole. 


Rich has tuned out now, looking at one of the TVs over the bar. I make a last-ditch attempt to save my sale. ""Well, not to toot my own horn, but I bet I can show you some things you've never seen before,"" I say, looking at Rich. I gesture towards one of the secondary stages. ""You wanna see?"" Rich opens his mouth to reply, but Sparkles is faster. She grabs one of his hands and stands up. ""Come on, I'm thirsty and I want a drink."" She pulls him away toward the bar, and like that, my sale is gone.

And we'll end here, for now. But there is more to come, of course."
1mb7kw,2,2013-09-13,More advice needed,[deleted],CaptiveWildlife,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaptiveWildlife/comments/1mb7kw/more_advice_needed/,"Hey everyone,
Sorry for another post so soon, but I have a dilemma. I applied and interviewed with one zoo and am finding out within the next week (according to them) if I'll be accepted to their internship or not. I had also previously applied to a different zoo for an internship program, who I just received an email from regarding an interview. I set up a phone interview for next Wednesday.

The thing is, I have no idea if I will know about my status at the first zoo by my second interview. I figure there's a couple scenarios: if I hear from the first zoo and they say no, then it's business as usual. If they don't get to me by Wednesday then I can still do the interview with the second zoo and then just play the waiting game. But if I'm accepted then I don't know what to do about the Wednesday interview.

I really like the first zoo and got a great sense of the program from my interview, but I feel like I at least should learn some more about the second Zoe's program before I make a final decision. One thing I am considering is, if the first zoo accepts me before Wednesday, asking for a bit of time to figure out the feasibility (the internship would require me to move), but that feels a bit like lying.  I also don't know the proper etiquette for any of these scenarios. Do I tell the zoos I'm looking at both options? How do I turn something down, if necessary?

Anyways, sorry its long and complicated, but I welcome advice from anyone. I neve expected to find myself in this scenario haha. "

By getting into the program immediately after finishing my bachelor's, I had surpassed the goals I had set for myself (typically you're expected to get a master's first). I love what I study and most importantly, I hope I can get a relatively high paying job once I'm finished. This is my main priority, there were always financial troubles growing up and I was acutely aware of this at a young age and all I want is for my children to not have the same persistent feelings of guilt I had as a child. I remember constantly trying to determine how much I cost my parents to have (via food, medical expenses, etc) and thinking about how much better off they'd be financially if I wasn't around. I'm doing very well in my classes, am publishing research, and even worked on research grants developing training procedures for NASA and the Navy! In spite of being relatively accomplished for a 24 year old from an objective standpoint, I feel like I am a huge failure and am more ashamed of myself than I could describe. I've never left the country and am deeply ashamed of myself for this. Throughout university, I worked part time jobs to pay the bills in addition to two internships (usually totaling roughly 50 hours a week) in order to get into graduate school. I never had the time nor money to take a break and travel and now I feel so ashamed of myself for it. I feel like I have no amusing anecdotes to share because my life has always consisted of working or getting fucked up. I just feel like there's so much to life that I've never experienced because of the decisions I've made. But it's too late, I can't back out now. I'm committed and knew fully well that I wouldn't have a vacation for five years once I began my PhD. I am way too hard on myself for minor mistakes. If I make a minor error in my work that only takes a moment to fix, I tell myself ""See? This is why your a stupid fucking piece of shit! You should put a fucking bullet in your fucking head!"" and mentally repeat ""You should put a fucking bullet in your head!"" over and over like it's some sick mantra. I think constantly about just putting a gun into my mouth and splattering my brains all over the walls of a public restroom. But i can't do it. I have a loving girlfriend (seriously an amazing person) of six years who I intend to marry some day, and I cannot imagine how she would react to me killing myself for seemingly no reason one day. She is extremely introverted and doesn't have any friends besides people she plays online games with (I get her out as often as I can, but its usually a struggle) and I feel like my suicide would seriously fuck up her life, so I can't do it. I'm just so consumed with anxiety that death seems like the only way I can take a break. I'm just so ashamed of myself, people tell me I'm handsome or that my outfit is nice fairly often (not bragging), but I hate the way I look. I avoid looking in mirrors except when absolutely necessary and always stare at the center bar on glass doors so I don't catch a glimpse of my reflection. I am very ashamed of being from Florida and still living in Florida and am afraid I'll never be able to get a job anywhere nicer because people will hate me and think I'm a fool because I'm from Florida. I'm sorry. I know I have no right to complain and that other people in the world have actual problems. I just wanted to get that off my chest. 

EDIT: Thank you so much for the kind words, I really needed to get this off my chest. I'm going to seek professional help ASAP regarding these issues."
1mb6a9,13,2013-09-13,Boyfriend (m27) has issues with me (f25) seeing my friends,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1mb6a9/boyfriend_m27_has_issues_with_me_f25_seeing_my/,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 3.5 years and living together for 3 years. We live in the area that he grew up in and it's about an hour from a major city where many of my friends from college now live, he does not have any friends in the area and his college friends live across the country. 

Until recently I was neglecting my friendships because I was happy spending all my free time with my boyfriend. A few weeks ago he decided to take on an intern type position for a company that specializes in one of his hobbies (to see if he would want to pursue a career in that field), this work is on Saturdays. We are both normally off on the weekend so this left me with no one to hang out with on Saturdays at all. Since I did not want to be spending half of my weekend alone I used my available time as an opportunity to reach out to my close college friends and hang out with them. Now my boyfriend has never been a huge fan of my friends because they can be pretty big into partying. They like to get drunk, smoke weed and do some various other recreational drugs (but they are all very successful in their careers) and to be honest this is part of the reason why I stopped seeing them so much. However, they have never once pressured me to participate in anything they were doing and I always have a good time hanging out with them. The issue is that every time I have gone to see them my boyfriend has just become very withdrawn and upset with me for a couple days. 

What brought this issue to a head for me is that a couple of my girlfriends want to go back to our school for an alumni party in a couple of weeks and originally our boyfriends were invited, now that one of the girls bfs can't go though they changed it to a girls weekend. My boyfriend is very upset about this whole thing (even though when he was invited he told me he didn't want to go). He has already become withdrawn and upset with me over it and it feels like he has put me in a corner with no good options. If I don't go on the girls weekend my friends will be very mad and my bf said this would just make him feel guilty, if I go on the trip than my boyfriend will most likely continue his unhappy behavior for the next two weeks (and for a a few days after I get back) and lastly I told him that I would talk to my friends and ask them if he could come on the trip as well but he is completely resistant to the idea and says he does not even want to go anyways. 

I know that we need to talk about this issue of him not liking it when I see my friends but what I need is some help putting my thoughts into a coherent statement. I want to talk to him about it without trying to put guilt on anyone but rather just figure out how we can avoid him feeling like he does. I don't need him to feel over joyed that I am going to be gone for the weekend and therefore him spending it alone but just supportive of the idea and also to not make me feel guilty no matter what I do in this situation. 

Tl;dr Boyfriend is mad that I am going on a girls weekend but is giving me no good options on how to make him feel better about it

Edit: I was thinking of talking to his college friends and seeing if maybe they would come out and visit him for a long weekend while I was gone as a surprise for him but they live pretty far away so it might be a lot to ask of them and his attitude is not really encouraging me. I'm also not sure if this might backfire on me or not? "

A table with a date, and employee columns (foreign keys to the Employee table) for each support line.

Option B:

I have a couple of very good leads that look promising but I'm also unaware of any legal ramifications down the road. 

None of the people volunteering would be doing any design or coding work but there's a data entry process that has been taking me an atrocious amount of time.

The major problem I have is they will not tell me anything about what I will be doing or what product they are actually making. I have directly asked for this but they keep dancing around it using buzz words and generalities. After getting a phone offer I asked for a written offer, since I like to cover my bases, but they are unwilling to do that. They only want to do it over the phone or have me drive a few hours over to discuss which I am uncomfortable with.

My questions are:

1) Is it normal to offer someone an internship and not tell them what they would be working on or what their duties would be until they agreed to intern for 4 months or is this a red flag?

2) I read online about it being best to get a written offer but I am wondering if that is not the case since they don't want to do it.

3) The pay for the internship is pretty low, but from the discussions I've had with them make the project seem interesting and I could have a lot of different technology experience. So would it be worth it to take the low pay for several months (move away and come close to running out of money by my calculations, and they won't pay more) for the hope of getting a full time spot that pays decently?

My gut is mostly saying to decline, but my parents hate having me around so I am becoming increasingly desperate for any job and I don't have anything else close to lined up.

Thanks for any advice, I'm kinda lost here.

Update:
I don't really have the option to wait as has been made clear to me so I will take the offer and if it ends up going badly I will just kill myself."
1mat6y,1,2013-09-13,"Just Moved Countries. Lonely, Sad and Desperate.",[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1mat6y/just_moved_countries_lonely_sad_and_desperate/,"Not really sure what I'm hoping to get out of this, but I haven't really got anyone to talk to here, except for my long-suffering partner who is incredibly wonderful and loving, but who I feel so guilty about constantly unloading myself on. Bit of a wall of text, I'm sorry.

We met a couple years ago and fell in love while he was on vacation in my country. He is just an absolutely incredible person - he's incredibly loving and kind, he makes me laugh, we can talk about anything or nothing and still enjoy our time together, he's intelligent, capable, handsome, and overall just...an incredibly good man. We spent a week together after we first met, and then continued to talk regularly online after he left the country. I came to stay for six months while I was on an exchange at University, and being together was every bit as wonderful as we imagined it would be. I went home for six months to graduate, and then moved to my current country permanently to try and make a solid go of it with him. Our relationship is fantastic - we couldn't be better together, or closer. We treat each other like absolute gold and the amount of love and respect is something I've never experienced.

That's why I feel so guilty. I'm incredibly lonely here. While I was never expecting things to be a piece of cake, I thought they'd at least be a bit easier than they have been. I have been missing my family like crazy since we were very close, and it's only really now starting to sink in that I'll never be able to be close to them in the same way anymore. I feel guilty because I know that they miss me, and the idea of my parents growing old without being around to cherish time I have with them breaks my heart.

I miss my friends very much too. I am quite introverted, and while I'm fine at chatting with people on a regular basis, I have trouble making solid friends. I don't let very many people into my life in a more than superficial way, and the friends I had back home were the solid few who  I've held onto over the years. Now I have nobody.

Making friends has been difficult since we have very little extra money. We're not destitute or anything, but we are definitely struggling to make ends meet right now. I have been looking for a solid job for months now - the job I had last time I was here, even though they said they would be happy to hire me back, has been avoiding my phone calls, and occasionally messaging me to promise shifts they never deliver. I am working an unpaid internship for eighteen hours a week for nothing, while they dangle the prospect of a job in the field I got my degree in in front of me to keep me there doing unpaid labour for them. I have three other jobs, but they don't offer enough hours - each of them will give me maybe one five hour shift a week, which just isn't enough. We're barely scraping by. This means no money and so no friends, and nothing to get me out of my own little world in this country where I don't know anyone - hard to meet up with new friends for drinks when you can't afford to buy one.

I am so incredibly lonely all the time, I feel like my heart is constantly aching. I feel hopeless about the future - I have to pay $4000 for a visa to stay here and I don't know how I'm going to make the money. My family also wants me to come visit them and I am desperate to do it, but I don't know how I'm going to afford it. My dog needs surgery...my boyfriend's shoes are literally falling apart, I can't even afford a haircut. I feel like a complete failure. 

I have worked as a topless dancer in the past and enjoyed it very much, but never wanted to go full nude as I'm uncomfortable with it, and have anxiety issues that I know it would trigger - but I am feeling pressure to find some sort of job that would pay as much as that would. I just feel so much guilt and anxiety whenever I make an appointment with a club here that I wind up cancelling. But then I feel as much guilt and anxiety for the financial burden I'm putting on my boyfriend and...despair, I guess, because I'm not sure what I'm going to do or how I'm going to find the money any other way.

Again I don't know what I'm hoping for in this thread. Maybe to hear that someone has been there or something. I don't know. I just don't want to feel like this anymore. I'm normally a happy person but I can't seem to feel anything but desperation, anxiety, hopelessness, guilt and despair for the past six months. I'm starting to lose hope that I ever will.

Sorry for the rant, Reddit. Just feeling lost."

Is there a better way?",BootStiefel,Screenwriting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/1masy2/had_a_discussion_with_gf_about_writing_spec/,"I was explaining to her that there's a show on TV that I really like a ton, seen every episode (some twice) and feel like I really know the characters.  

So I started writing an outline for what I thought would be an amazing episode.  I did the cards, wrote a bullet list, wrote an outline, wrote my huge outline with big details (just my process) and now am taking it to Final Draft.

She asked what my hope was for the thing and I told her that in my heart, I feel like it would make an amazing episode, however everything I've read said that they don't make the specs they get from people trying to get in for legal reasons.  I said I'll be using it early next year for a fellowship I'm going for (nickelodeon) and if not, it might be a good sample for a manager or possibly (i cross my fingers) it could lead to a job.
She said it doesn't really make sense that I would spend so much time working on writing an episode if it was never going to air.  I told her that every script that I write comes with that risk, but to an extent, TV was different.  She asked how.
I fumbled my way through saying that if the people who work on the show and read it, they might like me and make me a writer's assistant.  I said this is the only way that I know of breaking in to TV:

1) You write a spec of a show.

2) You enter contests and try to place or You try to get it sent into said show and you might get work from there.

The intern to assistant to writer's assistant to writer route (to me) is BS.  It is DAMN near impossible to get any of these positions.  I've been trying for quite some time and can't even get a response back.  So for me, writing and having samples is the best way.

Am I wrong?  Is there a better way?  I wasn't looking to rant, but I'm wondering IS THERE A BETTER WAY TO BREAK INTO TV?!"

Paid internships or even full employment, as long as it fits my current schedule, which will necessitate something part time. I can do freelance work from home on a contract basis as well.

Skills:
My degree concentration is Database and Knowledge systems, specifically the following skills in addition to the rest of my degree.

* Algorithm design and analysis
* Software Engineering
* Digital image and signal processing: MATLAB, Mathematica, and Octave
* Data visualization
* Relational database design and management - MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL
* Java, C, C++, Haskell, Ruby, Perl 5, Javascript, HTML5, CSS and Android development

And that's just the stuff I'm currently comfortable with...plenty of other stuff in my wheelhouse.  I'm also a Linux guy, but that doesn't mean I'll be lost in OSX or Windows 8 either. The rest of the degree means I have the knowledge, skills, and math to advance myself in the field when the need is there. When I don't know it, I know where to look.

I'm in class afternoons to evenings Monday through Thursday, but I can be available any time otherwise.

I'd love a job doing design, development, that kind of thing, but I'll bug test and be a general wage slave in return for a reasonable amount of money, hours that fit my flexibility. If it's good work, then at the end of the December you've got fresh pics of a recent grad whom you've already had a chance to evaluate.

So if you want someone smart, dedicated, and well motivated by financial desperation, I'm your guy.  If you want someone you can evaluate on a trial basis before deciding to invest in him as an employee, I'm your guy.  If you want someone experience for full time work, I'm not really your guy, but call me when that guy tells you he needs someone to help out.

I live ITP near GSU and Tech, so I'm pretty much central to the entire Metro area as well.

Plus I love to cook my spare time, and a bit shameless about showing it off.  So occassionally fresh baked muffins, bagels, or ciabatta happen."

I've been working at this one location of the coffee shop I work at all summer with very regular customers Mon-Thurs, open till close (only 6 hours) and this week was my last week I'll probably ever work there regularly. 

Probably Not That Relevant Background Info: I want to open my own coffee shop one day.

Anyways, from when I was at an 8 or 9...

[This is a mocha I made](http://i.imgur.com/ylNsYmt.jpg) on Tuesday under the influence of [this little guy (C-4 and Blue Dream) rolled by your humble narrator.](http://i.imgur.com/D8xcN9B.jpg) I was probably at a 4 or 5. Maybe 6 for short amounts of time...

[Now I'm smoking this](http://i.imgur.com/zpUIpf4.jpg) out of my main man, [James Franco.](http://i.imgur.com/cyGbK1w.jpg)
Then I made what I came to see as a [tomato joint that I eat instead of smoke](http://i.imgur.com/vzBZPVq.jpg).

I want to finish my degree in religious studies, intern for The Daily Show and get hired as their Top Religious Correspondent where I would go on rants about how facts just teach you that everything you believed about God was actually probably more similar to political plays by people living centuries after the stories they were writing. You know, non-personally-relevant stuff like that.


But that's just a fun fantasy I've always had that I know I would love. But life is complicated.

(Almost sober because I need to wake up early in the morn') The moral of the story is this:
This summer has been the best summer of my life and I've smoked almost every single day after only smoking for 1/2 a year. The majority of it I spent either working at the coffee shop or getting high with my girlfriend and/or good friends and discussing life, philosophy, theology, sexuality, gender, religion, politics, family bullshit, getting way too high and falling asleep busting up laughing way too late at night on a work night, or even talking with my boss about how to turn coffee urns into bongs and now it's almost completely over.

Real moral of the story: Just fucking have fun, be smart, talk with your friends, and try to be high while doing all these things.

But I know all you cool cats already do that sort of thing ;)



TL;DR: I got super high from the dopest dope I've ever smoked and wrote about how this summer was awesome and thought provoking and fueled largely by weed but now it's over. But it's OK.

Oh yeah, and I made a new reddit account because I feel like this is a new chapter and I really hated my old one..."

1mae28,1,2013-09-12,Help dissecting a recent phone interview I had?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1mae28/help_dissecting_a_recent_phone_interview_i_had/,"So in a nutshell, I applied online for a summer internship for 2014 with a top-10 global tech company.

Long story short, I randomly got a call from someone within the company about 10 days after applying online.  It was completely unexpected, which I didn't mind, and it felt like it was more of a weed-out call than a true interview.  All-in-all, the call maybe lasted 10-15 minutes total.

A few days later, I get an email from someone within the company requesting a true phone interview.

Fast forward, I'm nervous as hell, and the interview starts.  They (the initial email contact and someone else) start out by asking about my prior projects, which I had no problem discussing.  Yadda yadda, we talk about stuff over my resume, which I'll skip because that doesn't really pertain to my questions.  I'll just say I think I did pretty good, maybe a 75% - 85% grade overall.  I didn't know some questions, which I politely apologized for and honestly said I didn't know. I didn't feel too bad, as I've still got 8 months of classes left anyhow.

So what I've really been thinking about (probably too much) are a few things that they said to me in the interview that lead to me thinking I've got a good chance at landing the job.  I'm sure some of you with more than 2 interviews under your belt could answer.

1. They spent a good amount of time towards the end of the interview explaining what the company was about, and what the department that I could potentially be working in was about. Normally I'd say it wasn't a big deal, but he did spend some time getting into details about how the particular department functioned, what I would be able to do, working on, working conditions, etc.  


2. At the end of the interview, they mentioned that I had applied for an internship position.  They then asked if I'd be willing to be hired straight as a full-time, recent grad, instead of the internship.  Of course I said yes.  


3. I applied for the job at location A.  They asked me if not being able to work at location A, but location B would be a deal breaker.


So after all that, am I crazy, vain, or right?  I doubt they'd hire me over two interviews, but I just want to make sure they just weren't blowing smoke up my ass.

Depression is something I've dealt with my whole life. I had it under control (or at least thought I did) for most of my life. The past couple months have been a serious downward spiral for me. I became a shell of myself and became a shitty human being, isolating myself and pissing off everyone around me, without ever even realizing it. I thought a lot about suicide and self harm, but it was more just wondering what it would be like. Eventually everything culminated, there was a huge blowup with everyone close to me, basically ending with the fact that none of them want me around. I tried to make things right, but basically everyone said, ""maybe down the road, but fuck you, I don't want to be around you."" I've always felt like everyone would be happier if I wasn't around, and over the past 2 or 3 days, basically all of my friends that I love or consider important have confirmed, with clarity, to me that their lives would have been easier or better without me there.

After acknowledging that my depression was a serious issue, I got on Wellbutrin. The first couple days were okay, but the past two days (everyone confirming that they would be better off without me) have been hell. My depression is in a really serious state. Where as in the past I only thought about self harm out of curiosity, I have been very seriously considering it all day and have actually been *craving* it and can't stop thinking about it. Whereas in the past it sounded illogical and scary, it now sounds inviting and desirable. That scares the shit out of me. I know it's bad and  I shouldn't, but I'm scared I won't be able to stop or control it.

I really just want someone here to distract me or to hold me, or really to honestly watch me and make sure I don't do anything stupid. I'm temporarily living (alone) away from home for a summer internship and so I don't know anyone around here, and so even if my friends didn't hate me, I have no one. I have no idea what to do. "

1ma8lp,6,2013-09-12,Want to get serious about internships this year. All advice would be helpful.,Lt-D,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ma8lp/want_to_get_serious_about_internships_this_year/,"&gt;A little about my situation:

I'm going into year 4 out of 5 in my Comp Sci BS. So far I haven't done any internships and don't have any solo side projects that I have done. 

Now, my school has a lot of career fairs and I actually went last year to one and got two interviews. However, one was very demoralizing (Interview spat out logic questions at me while only typing and never looking at me and then subtly insulted a certification I held). The other was more an informational interview and didn't have any technical questions. That went very well. 

However, I moved along in the process and was supposed to fill out a form listing experience I've had with various technologies including virtual machines, etc. I chickened out and never replied. Overall I found it to be an unpleasant experience at the very best.

Now, coming in to my fourth year I'd like to be fully prepared and present myself in the best way possible. I do have some school-related group projects that are semi-completed that I could show off. I know I need lots of preparation in order to be successful at finding an internship. I'd like to be a little selective too in that I want an internship somewhere in the San Franciso Bay Area. Also, I don't currently have a car and probably will not have one during the summer. That was another reason why I chickened out on the application process I started last year. The job ended up being on a military base and I don't have a driver's license at the moment. 

&gt;What I could use help on (questions are in bold):

I plan on preparing for potential interviews by doing the following:
   * buying interview appropriate clothes
   * practicing questions on Big Interview
   * Attending career workshops and resume critiques
**Is there any site or book you recommend for practice technical interviewing questions?**
**What can I do in between now and June 2014 to enhance my skills and my resume?**

I don't really have a set subfield in mind to focus on in the coming two academic years. Up until now I have been floating along taking the required courses. I have more of an idea of what I don't like than what I do. **How important is it to have focused knowledge in a subfield? How did you find your specialization/do you have any advice on how I would find mine?**

**Should I look into doing a solo project to build my portfolio?** I've tried starting such projects before but I find I run out of steam and get bored with the project quickly. One of the most fun parts of software development for me is exchanging ideas and implementing them on a team with others. I know side projects are beneficial to ones resume but I don't know if I'll reap the benefits of such a venture if I end up having to lie to interviewers about how I enjoyed the project and in the meantime if I have to push myself just to do it. I'm worried it will end up feeling contrived. 

I don't have anyone right now that could be a good reference for me either for my technical skills or for my work ethic. I've had a TA or two that knew me fairly well and other students of course. No one you could call a supervisor though. **How important are references for an initial internship position? What, if anything, should I be doing to make up my deficit in this area?**

**Lastly, do you have any additional advice or thoughts for me?** Comments on any or all of my questions would be greatly appreciated."

My name is Adam, I'm 19, and I am an IT student at an upstate University. I worked as an intern at a tech startup company in NYC over the summer as well as an online video game company ~~(which is pretty apparent looking at the history of this account).~~edit:forgot that I went for the throwaway.

Normally I'd say I'm an indie rock fan, but recently I've been on a rap kick. My favorite bands are Tokyo Police Club, Phoenix (saw them live at Madison Square Garden), Cage the Elephant, and the Dirty Projectors (they opened for Phoenix which was rad) and probably a bunch more bands that don't jump to mind. Rap-wise I really like Hoodie Allen (I've seen him live in NYC as well), G-Eazy, a little Kendrick Lamar (saw him live last weekend; was a banger), Macklemore, older Kid Cudi, and a few more guilty pleasure bad rap songs.

I used to watch way more TV than I do now, but Psych is probably my favorite show of all time. My family gets really into Survivor, we loved Lost when that aired, and Fringe was probably the last show we got really into. Recently I've been into Workaholics, Archer, Bob's Burgers, It's Always Sunny, and my roommate told me that he will be physically forcing me to watch Game of Thrones. Also I got hooked on Pretty Little Liars by accident and now I'm heavily invested in the series. Outside of TV, movies, music, internet life, and all that good stuff I really enjoy playing Ultimate Frisbee and finding cool restaurants in NYC. I'm a self-proclaimed spicy food champion, what I'd consider to be a professional tier Kan Jam and Cornhole player, if such leagues existed, I roll a damn good joint, and I can't wait until I can start wearing beanies again.

Online, text, kick, steam, whatever is cool for you is cool for me, I just want to meet some cool people, yadig? "

They're taking the care of themselves and the rest of the world isn't their problem.

They probably earn $50,000 per year, probably don't need to think about saving for clothes, and probably don't even think about the people who don't have money for food.

The people I see texting on their iPhone 5 probably don't even know what it means to search for months to try and get a job. 

I'm different than they are. I didn't finish college. It wasn't because I didn't work hard enough, it just wasn't the right school for me to go to.

We were roommates throughout all of college graduated and had the same classes together and shit. Afterwards we both got internships at the same company through a school club and we eventually got hired.

We have been doing shit together for so god damn long I can’t even remember its been over 8 years and we have lied with each other for the most of it. We have had our share of girlfriends (even had a threesome together couple times.) like we are the best of bros. A lot of our friends have joked and said we were gay for each other and all. We are both good looking guys.

Me and my bro would often say things like if you were a girl I’d marry the shit out of you and a bunch of other shit like that. Recently though my bro moved into his girlfriend’s place and I was a fucking wreck without him. After 2 months he broke things off with her because he wasn’t feeling right. I had a girlfriend at the time but I was depressed coming home to not having anyone to eat with doing shit by myself.  

We talked about this shit and he said he missed being roommates and all. We have jokingly talked about getting married and adopting kids while still sleeping with girls as weird as that sounds.  I know my parents and his parents would flip shit at the thought but neither of us have any faith in women to get a marriage. It’s not that I don’t like women it’s just that I feel I need some space after a while if that makes sense. I can enjoy a weekend at a gf’s place but as soon as I leave I am excited of returning home. 

Our state recognizes gay marriage, we have legitimately talked about it. Both of us from living in a shitty apartment have enough money to buy a house together and all. 
I don’t know guys I kind of wished we both were gay so we could be a legitimate couple but I think this is an okay idea. My friend said if he could somehow get this over with his parents it would be okay, I talked to my parents and told em and they kept asking if I was gay. I told em I am not gay and they said they would accept it if I was. Which is cool of them and all but not gay. 

We are both getting older and would really like to settle down. We both have a lot of money that we saved up from living in a shitty apartment. 

I don't know if this will work, it sounds like a great idea our heads but yeah. Advice please

**edit 1** - Its not just we want it for a tax benefit. We like the idea of being with each other too and raising kids together. My fears are though how would our kids view us. Would women still be okay with us if they knew we were married. Would our friends/neighbors have any respect for us. It's a lot to think about :/

**edit 2** I really don't think I am gay. I have thought about it, even would like to be but I am not. Trust me everyone has told me I'm gay for this even my own family.

I don't hate women I do enjoy my time with women I just don't like spending too much time with them. I have always been an introverted guy so I guess that doesn't help. I just think I have more meaningful conversations with my guy friends. If I was a woman and I said that I liked talking to guys more that wouldn't make me misogynistic would it?okay then. 

To those people saying I should slow things down I have know this guy for 8 years (lived for 8) and if we got married we'd prenup and all. We have been managing expenses splitting stuff since we were 18.  And yes people have talked about what happens if the perfect girl comes around. Yes I am wary of that but we discussed that kids &gt; everything. And people are asking why do you want to rush into it right now the reason is I don't have anything going on right now. I come home from work usually waste time on my computer and if it's a Friday Saturday night go out. Seriously it is dull as fuck, I don't feel like I am working towards anything. The only enjoyment I get out of my day is when I make a good amount day trading that's it. 

**Edit 3** okay first of all I appreciate the advice that you guys are sharing I have shown my friend and he is looking over the comments as well. Need to reiterate a couple things. 

**We aren't gay** - We aren't attracted to each other, I don't need him to complete me in any way or form. I value him not for a hormonal high but legitimately the loyalty and trust we have for each other. I understand I came for advice but saying you are gay doesn't do anything for me. Believe me this has haunted me for a while I did some self searching and can say I don't feel attracted to men. So please refrain from just saying **Gay in denial** - *op's a faggot** . I don't spend my time talking to him about my day or send him texts filled with emoji's. 

**I respect women**. And its not like I just care about them physically. There have been girls I have wanted to go [Hero for a girl](http://youtu.be/koJlIGDImiU). I just appreciate my personal space. I am currently dating a med school student and we have a great relationship, we see each other once or twice a week have good conversations/great sex ^^. 

**regarding parenting** - me and my friend have enough money to pay our kids through private school a tutor/nanny whatever they need. We both make a decent bit through our careers and aggressive investing. On top of that we will stick around with each other. I feel that our marriage is much stronger than the majority of single parent households and other dysfunctional unhappy marriages. I may have worded my previous edit wrong saying that I am getting a kid out of boredom. I'll try to word it better, I have a biological urge to have a kid, a kid which I can teach him my values, see him grow up. I felt as the stuff I do now is not helping me reach my deeper goals in life. It feels as if hanging out at a bar is just nonproductive just a thing I do to fill up time. 

I really wish some of you guys had the experience of having such a good bromance really is different from just having guy friends.

Dear Great New Company,

As a Graphic designer with an education from Pratt Institute, I will be glad to make a contribution to a great new company.
Insert your own company situation:
While you spend money for food production, kitchen rental, materials, tools,packaging, marketing, retail space and website, I will be glad to work for free while my $80 000 student loans keep piling up. I will be glad you start making your profits though...while I spend sleepless nights looking for paying customers while I get carpal tunnel syndrome from using the mouse so much.

""You could be a college student looking for experience""- I am looking for an experience but in the meanwhile I have to buy groceries, pay for rent and gas and most of all PAY for Creative Suite which costs $2599, so I can service leeches like you for FREE :-( and so you can get ahead &gt;&gt;&gt; in your business.

""Or an experienced professional between jobs wanting to keep your skills sharp or just looking for something fun to work on""- most desperate experienced professional between jobs have families to feed, so they would rather work in Wal Mart while they look for another clients, than to support scum like you. They have no time for something fun to work on.

""This is an unpaid project, but we will serve as a reference for you if needed""- Graphic Designers have plenty of references from unpaid internships, and plenty of portfolio material. Too much in fact. Getting your reference is good for nothing, so you can stuff it you know where! Unless you are Vanity Fair, nobody gives a flying shit about your reference.

How about you be fair, and pay at least 20$ hr for this small project of yours....karma will remember. If it is truly small and fun, you will end up paying $200-$500, which is a tiny fragment of what you are spending on the rest of the business.

In the meanwhile, LEARN that Graphic Design is not a ""fun"" project. It is a legitimate field of work with limited colleges offering this education, with very fierce admission process,
with $40 000 tuition a year, located in cities with monthly rent for a crappy room in range of $900, with fierce competition after graduation, where people spend up to a year ""interning"" for MTV, Conde Nast, NBC, so they can earn a real job.

Graphic designers suffer from arthritis, spondylitis, general neck and back pains, wrecked fingers and hands joints, poor eyesight, headaches and most of all, SLEEPLESS NIGHTS for years to come, because every single project coined by a client as ""this will take an hour"", usually stretches to last several days. Since clients and big companies like to lie as well, often, if not paid in advance, designers find themselves unpaid after months of work. Then only a court can decide, but who has time and money for that?

NOTE TO DESIGNERS: NEVER, EVER WORK FOR PERSEUS TELECOM(NYC)

I got an offer from the CEO which I know to be a low offer, but I'm not sure as to what would be a fair offer in the end. Any suggestions?

A little bit of background:

* I'm a student, so I'll be working part time, around 20 hours a week, but I fit in 35+ if the need rises
* I'm one of 2 backend coders
* During the summers I can make approx $30k pre-tax with internships and whatnot
* The team is of 8 people (2 co founders [one of which is majority], 2 front end, 1 integration, and 2 backenders)
* The CEO thinks all employees should have equal distribution in the beginning
* The company's current worth is $0
* We are going to go for series A funding in the upcomming 30 - 40 days

Lets assume there are 20mil shares to go around. Here are my thoughts:

1. Until we have investors, we should save around 15 mill for them. (right now the 2 co founders are funding it)
2. There should be stock differentiation between employees
3. The two co founders should each have around 5-10% ownership
4. Each of the current employees should be receiving around 0.5 - 1% per annum (until we have funding after which salary can be decided) which would be given at a monthly rate

Any views which seem unfair? Any suggestions for what would be a more fair offer?

This means I'm anticipating a lot of expenses on interviewing at residency programs. 

Below, some examples of why I need extra cash on hand now:

The electronic app I submit tomorrow will cost me over $1000 in fees since I am applying to nearly 70 programs all over the nation.

If I interview in California, I understand the flight might be ~$500 roundtrip?

I already scheduled the Step 2 CS and CK exam (required to graduate) and that alone sucked out $1700.

My family has no extra money to lend me and I won't be able to borrow from close friends.

So my options are personal loans, right? I would like about $10000 to cover my living expenses/travel expenses for the rest of my 4th year (until I get my pay check as an intern in summer of 2014). 

I have $4000 in my bank account now, and will receive another $2000 next semester (January) from my school loans for living costs.

Is getting a loan from my credit card company a solution? The APR they offer is as low as 8% for amounts up to $25000 if that means anything.

Any help appreciated. Thanks!"

I have outstanding offers for internships next summers with multiple Big 4 firms, in their NYC offices. Very happy about that and was planning on accepting one, but thought that it was worth it to go through career fairs/recruiting events this semester (my offers don't expire until November), so as to just know what else is available and keep my options open.

I attended a seminar with GE, where they discussed their CDP program, which is aimed at accounting students. You are able to fulfill the CPA work experience through the program, something they didn't used to be able to offer. Here's  a link to the program:

http://www.ge.com/careers/culture/university-students/capital-controllership-development-program

My question is, from a long-term standpoint, do you think that choosing this program upon graduation would be significantly better or worse than a Big 4 audit position? I've been told that there are few positions that will act as a better springboard than the Big 4, so I'm hesitant to give up an offer and pursue these other positions.

1mdxcf,4,2013-09-14,Advice for Entry Level Engineering Career Search?,lightningrage90,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1mdxcf/advice_for_entry_level_engineering_career_search/,"I was wondering if anyone had any advice for the career search nowadays. One of the main reasons I choose mechanical engineering was because I thought it would be in demand upon graduation, I am no longer sure if that is true.
 
Since mechanical engineering is so broad, I decided to implement a targeted job search. I have been predominantly look for a position in CT, the state I live in. First I focused on the aerospace industry, but I have had almost zero luck doing this. Every contact I speak to says ""apply online"" and once I do, that seems to be the end of it. I actually spoke with someone at a career fair today at an aerospace company I really wanted to work at. He handed my resume back saying that they did not hire entry levels without relevant internship experience, or offer internships to people who are not actively enrolled. I am nearly convinced that aerospace is a dead end and I am looking to try a different field.

I have read some articles saying that the energy field is a great field for mechanical engineers to migrate into. I also been told that Texas is a great hub for engineers to find energy related careers. I have an interest in renewable energy, most notably green building design. I am African American, so I am a little nervous about the possibility of racism in the South, but I see very few entry level engineering opportunities in the North East, so I am willing to grin and bear it.

To sum it all up, my questions are:
Would you say it is worth-while to pursue entry level mechanical engineering positions in the North East, i.e. Connecticut? If so, which companies?

Would it be worth-while to relocate to the South to find engineering opportunities, and if so which companies?


P.S. The internship that I had involved learning a mathematical statistics software package called SAS.

Also, I am definitely open to relocating anywhere in the U.S."

[What's the dumbest effect a producer/director ever asked you to create?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc87bz6?context=5)|We were asked to reproduce a practical effect for a trailer for Snow White.  They loved the practical effect, and so I said just recreate that, it would be cheaper, but they didn't want to. They wanted to do it CG.  So we tried, and they didn't like it as much, so we eventually recreated our own version of the same practical effect, but they ended up just going with the original.  Huge waste of time and money.
[Can you give an example of VFX that's so good no one knows it's actually VFX?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc8756t?context=5)|Well, I would wager a guess that many people who saw Life of Pi have no idea that the tiger is CG most of the time, or that the ocean isn't actually there.  Let me think on this a little, though, and get back to you.  i like this question.
[Buddy, everybody knew that fuckin' tiger was CG.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc8agvd?context=5)|Buddy, no they didn't.  I'm not talking about the CG geeks.  I'm talking about the average movie goer.
[Can you point us a time frame where your job can be seen in Narnia or in X-Men with some details of what was your part and how did you performerd? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc87db9?context=5)|I was a VFX producer on Narnia, and X-Men: First Class...I was a VFX coordinator on X-Men: X-Men United, so I was involved in the project management.  For Narnia, the company I worked for did some matte paintings and simple comps scattered throughout.  For First Class, we did Emma Frost, Angel's wings, and Mystique's transformations, among other things.  On United, our major sequences were the opening Night Crawler bamf sequence, and the interior of Cerebro.
[I'm looking to get into the film industry after art school. What advice can you give me?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc86q9i?context=5)|Well, it depends on what you want to do.  My general advice would be to have very specific goals.  If you want to be a filmmaker, then you need to make films.  If you want to be an animator, then always be animating.  The doers are the ones who make, not the ones who wait for someone to pay them to do.
[I'm curious, is the technique for reconstructing the scenery behind the obvious cgi used because it helps create the realism for the main subject in the shot? I know 5-10 years ago it was blatantly obvious that there was CGI on top of a live action shot. Was it easier to make the live action shot look less 'live' so that it created a better backdrop for the heavy action in the foreground? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc8cpvz?context=5)|No, aerial photography is expensive and you can't always get exactly the shot you want.  If you build the plate in post, then you can get exactly the shot you want and make sure your framing is exactly right for the action.
[Hi Tim, can you tell us a little bit about the tools you use? What are the most common software programs you use, and for what purposes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc87aae?context=5)|Hi, yes my day job was a VFX producer, but I also taught myself to comp and matte paint.  If I could go back and take a different path it would be as a matte painter.  I use After Effects for comp and motion graphics, because it's what I had at the time, and I still like it.  I use Photo Shop for painting.  But I'm also a filmmaker, so I use Final Cut for editing...Final Draft for writing...Movie Magig for budgeting and scheduling live action.  As a VFX Producer, yes it was a lot of spreadsheets.
[Which 90s or early 2000 movie do you think was far ahead of it's time as far as VFX goes? Best movie ever as far as VFX goes (relative to it's time\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc87104?context=5)|Hm...Well, T2 is probably the most ground breaking film from the 90s...My favorite VFX film of all time is Blade Runner.  The stuff Trumball and his team did in that film still holds up.
[I'd argue Jurassic Park was the most groundbreaking ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc88yhs?context=5)|Yeah, JP was, but T2 was the first film to have completely digital comps.
[It's been two hours, Tim. Please come back.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc8ajxo?context=5)|Sorry, I had a kid issue...Resolved, and all is good.
 |My first job in VFX was as a Production Assistant at Cinesite Hollywood...I dug it.  From that position you get to see a lot of what's going on.  I could have gone the artist route, but my older brother was an artist and I wanted to blaze my own trail, so I stuck with the production path.  It taught me a lot about the business side of things that helped me way more when I decided to make my own movies than sitting at the box would have.
 |Well, my VFX artist experience is all lower end, because I would do it on the side, but I comped a green screen shot for a biopic on Billy Graham that was something like 6000+ frames.  Armie Hammer played the young Billy Graham, and the shot was this long speech with him walking around in front of a baddly lit GS.  For a quick shot it would have been fine, but 6000 frames is a long time for your edges to have to hold up.  It turned out...sort of eh.
[What was your favorite part about working on X-Men?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc86tnu?context=5)|Just being a part of such a cool franchise with such diehard fans.
[What is the best thing aspiring filmmakers can do to better themselves?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc86uiy?context=5)|Watch lots of films...not just films you like.  And make films, don't just talk about making films.  Get out there and do it.
[Many times when VFX guys make a film, there's a lot of emphasis on, of course, the VFX. Is this movie sort of a showcase for your talent? Also how did you get started in VFX? Where would you suggest someone get started today, with so much different software? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc8791i?context=5)|Well, my last feature had very little VFX, because I didn't want to be labeled just a visual guy...I wanted to prove I could tell a story with relying on visual gimmicks.  It's called Sick Boy, check it out if you like indie stuff.  With this one, though we need to pull out some bigger visuals, so yeah it will hopefully showcase those tents, but we also want to showcase our filmmaking and story telling skills and show the VFX guys can do more than make pretty pictures.  As far as getting into the industry, things are different now.  There is a lot more recruiting right out of school, schools that weren't around 10 years ago. The key is to get in somewhere and make yourself invaluable, have a good attitude, and never stop learning.  Even I you get in as a PA, just get in.  Oh, and you should be prepared to have to chase jobs outside the US.
[Why did you decide to make your own movie?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc86jn4?context=5)|I've always wanted to make my own films, because I genuinely love the medium and the craft.  VFX was my way in.  I love VFX, but love everything else about filmmaking, too. It's my favorite thing in the world...next to my wife and two beautiful kids.
[What is the one effect that you worked on that you are the most proud of?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc87a6l?context=5)|Actually, this may sound silly, but I am most proid of the work we did for the first Alvin and the Chipmunks.  Our client was not the most easy to deal with, and they made things very difficult for us at every step of the way.  We produced 45 minutes of amazing animation for that film even though they recast the voices 12 weeks from delivery, and then forced us to change our head models 9 weeks from delivery...which f'd our rigs and forced us to re-animate a lot of facial stuff...but we did it.  My team was awesome.  The crap part of a deal like that is, we designed the characters, the animators brought them to life, the movie makes $600+ million, and the facility that did all the work gets nothing as far as royalties.  Justin long still gets a check for the three days he showed up on that one.  That's what's wrong with this industry and our side of it.
[What is the most ridiculous shot/effect you have ever done?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc87a6l?context=5)|The most ridiculous effect was adding hair to Mel Gibson's balding dome in What Women Want...Apparently women didn't want a Mel Gibson with thin hair.
[What will be the most incredible effect in your new movie, the one people will be talking about?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc87a6l?context=5)|I think the most incredible effect we are planning for PRETERNATURAL is a creature transformation to rival the transformation in American Werewolf in London, which in my opinion hasn't yet been topped.
[What are the current plans for a VFX Union?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc86qk5?context=5)|That's a difficult question to answer.  I don't think a union solves everything.  The facilities have to get together, too.
[How long was the education for your path? i wish i could just move to california and become succesful.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc87ei6?context=5)|My education was actually in Architecture.  My filmmaking education was the muti-plex and video store.
[Do you think this new project will do the same thing as the mermaid mockumentary?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc874xu?context=5)|No...Mainly for the simple fact that we're not making a mockumentary.  We wanna make something that takes the subject matter very seriously.  That's one of the biggest differences with our film versus some of the other faux docs out there that deal with monsters, like Troll Hunter.  We want to make a scary movie, so there will be very little humor or tongue and cheek stuff.
[What do you think is the role if vfx in future cinema? Say 30 years from now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc875ct?context=5)|It will continue to be a major tool.  I mean, there isn't a film made now that doesn't have some sort of visual effects element to it.  That wasn't the case even 15 years ago.  A big VFX show then was 100 shots.  It's an amazing tool, but unfortunately, it's bred a crop of lazy filmmakers who don't feel the urgency to figure things out ahead of time...and just sort of shop around in post to figure things out.
[On a scale of one to Skyline how bad will the film be?  Nah I'm just messing with ya. good luck.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc8c825?context=5)|With skyline being really bad?  Hopefully not nearly that bad.
[As someone who is majoring in film but doesn't know what aspect to really focus on, how did you know you wanted to do VFX?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc87thq?context=5)|Well, I didn't.  I wanted to tell stories by way of moving pictures...I wanted to make movies, so I was a fan of everything that went into making movies.  I always had a love and respect for effects, so when the opportunity came up to get in that way, I took it.  The problem is, it can be hard to move around within the industry once you're in, and I didn't know that people who worked in post weren't though of the same as people who worked on set.
[What is your and other professionals opinion of the program blender? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc89tfl?context=5)|I think Blender is a great tool, and that more people should be using it.
[Can you elaborate a little on the day to day tasks of a VFX producer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc8b6h1?context=5)|Eating crap and having to pretend like you like it.  Wanting to say no, but being told I can't.  Feeling horrible that people are working so hard and being powerless to really do anything about it.
[1\) How did the company go bankrupt? Life of Pi was awesome!  2\) Are you more scared or excited striking out like this and making your own movie?  3\) I love the movies you worked on and this new one sounds really cool. Keep up the good work.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc87z6e?context=5)|1) The reason for R&amp;H's bankruptcy is very complicated, but shrinking price points for the work they did, along with increased international competition, and the fact that they were the largest privately owned facility of their kind that didn't have huge government incentives backing them up are the major reasons.  They just didn't have deep enough pockets to weather the down time. 2) Excited for sure. 3) Thanks!
[When and where did you get your big start in VFX for movies?  Where would the best place to go if you want to intern on a movie or big movie studio, and still keep the job after your done? (Depending if you are actually a good worker\)  I am a self taught VFX artist myself (Still training\), if its not too much to ask, could I have constructive criticism on my latest work? Link to www.youtube.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc880nl?context=5)|I'll get back to you...it just might be a bit later.  With two kids under three it's hard to stay seated for very long.  Hang tight, although a few of your questions I've answered in other threads.  As for your work, there is some promise there.  I would study photography and lighting if you can.  Keep at it.
[As a sophmore in college, I would like to know, where would be the best place to go for movies after I graduate?  P.S. This is my most latest work; only took a half hour to make, uploaded it 3 days ago..and it has almost 18000 views...I am disappointed to be honest, but what do you think of my sillyness? haha Link to www.youtube.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc880nl?context=5)|The best place to go after college and intern is the place that's offering you a spot.  What you do once you're there is up to you.  If you make yourself invaluable, they'll keep you around.
[Is there any place that I could go to to find some tricks of the trade? What do you suggest is the best learning source to become a better VFX artist? I dig through a lot of YouTube tutorials but a vast majority of them are done by people who have just learned it themselves and aren't very experienced. Any suggestions?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc892kh?context=5)|Just keep doing it.  That's the best way to learn.  The biggest difference between a seasoned pro and a newbie (assuming they have the same artistic talent) is technique.  The only way you will hone your technique is by doing it.
[Did you happen to see The Hobbit in 48fps? How would you feel if that became the new standard? How would it impact the jobs of the VFX department?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc8axm4?context=5)|I saw a little bit of it, and I hate it.  Movies aren't supposed to look like real life.  They're supposed to look like movies.
[I actually agree about the fake part. The Hobbit was the first big attempt at 48fps, and hopefully film makers can better wrap their abilities around the format with future films. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc8h9ke?context=5)|We'll see.
[Hey Tim, I'm a guy going to school for a random computer science degree but recently decided I'm going to pursue more education in the VFX field after I get my current degree. What if any is your opinion of Gnomon, and do you think its worth the money to go there? Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc8a6t8?context=5)|I've answered similar questions, but my opinion is that if the talent is in you, it doesn't matter where you go to school.
[Would you say it is technology or know how that makes one film look better than another?  Did special effects become cheaper in the last x years and if so by what factor?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc8fo39?context=5)|It's story and vision that makes for a good movie.  There are plenty of good movies with less than spectacular technical elements.  Yes VFX have become cheaper.  Probably by a factor 50%.  Which is why facilities are having such a hard time.
[According the IMDB, you were only involved in the x-men movies i liked and not the ones i didn't like. Will you please be involved in the next X-men film?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc8b7gv?context=5)|We'll see...
[Hey I'm really excited for you that you get to do your own movie! However, if you remember the movies skyline and AVP Requiem, they bombed and were made by two guys that used to do VFX. What are you going to do differently to make sure that doesn't happen to your film too?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc8gd4z?context=5)|Well, those guys are much more interested in playing Joe Hollywood than telling interesting and compelling stories.  Story is key with me.  The VFX are just something that I can bring to a budget that you don't usually see.
[Now that you are working for yourself, do you use an agent?  Also, do you think you would prefer crowd-funding on every project to the current financing model for many American films?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc8bzde?context=5)|No agent, and I don't think crowd funding is the way to go across the board.  This one hasn't been successful yet, and may not be like most of them.  It all depends on the project.

[How much of a gap is there in ability between pros like you and folks on YouTube like freddiew or finalcutking?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc8hgiy?context=5)|Well...tough to say.  They do fun stuff, but it's missing a level of finish that the top level VFX folks are doing.  I don't want to assume that if pushed they couldn't match it, but they don't have to doing what they do.  The techniques are the same, though.
[How is it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc8ba0m?context=5)|It's fair to middling...
[As a special effects technician (mostly in live theatre\) I am curious what the relationships are like between your department and say the makeup crew or the effects or set dec crew? To what extent do you divi up the work and/or what animosity exists between you? Some would think you would make perfect enemies, the effects guys of course wanting to blow up something for real, or get the shot by creativity vs 'doing it in post'. Or do you think you should work together to get the best of both? How.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc87qtr?context=5)|I think they should work together, or more specifically, that the filmmakers should have a clear vision of what they are looking to get out of a specific shot.  But that is rarely the case anymore.  Because you can do so much after the fact these days, more and more filmmakers are pushing off decisions that are necessary to make adequate use of a practical solution.  Which pushes more to the post guys, but it's not the decision of the VFX guys to do that.  We're always saying, ""Man, why didn't they just shoot this.  It would have been so much better.""  But the practical guys get upset because stuff that traditionally fell on them is now gone.
 |CG should pick up where traditional photographic techniques can't go.  I think Guillermo del Toro said that.  And I agree.
[Hey Tim,  I'm not sure how much you've been involved in the hiring process in your work as a producer, but I'm curious to hear you're take on a bias I (as well as other professionals I know\) have noticed against artists moving from commercials to film VFX work. I'm a lighting specialist based in New York with about 5 years experience. I've worked in very high end commercial studios (MPC, The Mill, ect\), but for the life of me I can't manage to get a gig on a movie. I have a very good reel with a good amount of high end photoreal work, and I'm willing to relocate for project durations. I realize New York has a limited film market (and what's here is typically comp work\) but I feel like I should have had better luck in finding film work or even hearing back from most of the companies. I have close friends who work in feature compositing who have agreed with me and who claim to observe a snobbish approach a lot of film people have to commercial artists compared to film. Again, I have no problem in finding photoreal commercial lighting work and I'm almost constantly booked. Have you noticed this yourself in your career? What are your opinions on it? Do you have any advice to working toward getting into the film market for someone in my position? Thanks! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc8grls?context=5)|I have never experienced a bias against commercial artists.  In fact my experience is that they move around often.  If there is an issue, it's likely due to your current location and the number of readily available local lighters.  If there's a line of quality people right out front, you're likely to go with one of them over importing someone.  Make sense?
[How do you feel about the greater Austin,Texas area film/vfx scene? Do you feel like it is growing? Could it support larger big-budget features?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc886bk?context=5)|I think there is enough talent to support it, but there isn't enough infrastructure yet.  You need a big pipe and a lot of render power to meet the expectations of the big clients.  They don't care if you're an upstart, they just want their shots right now.

[Hey Tim. Narnia was one of my favorite films ever. I watched all the bonus material on the extended DVD set about how the creatures and backgrounds were created. I think you were probably interviewed at some point, and I lurked around on the R&amp;H website for a while and even wrote a school paper on matte painting, which I didn't fully understand anyway. Thanks for your work on that and other awesome movies.  What is your favorite monster or fairy tale story? also have you read American Gods?  EDIT: also what is it like to work with Ang Lee? He seems like a super cool guy.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc8gcva?context=5)|Thanks...I was at a small studio for NARNIA, though.  My favorite monster story is probably Frankenstein, and yes, I've read American Gods.

Fast forward to college and I started in my local community college at their electronic communications program. Turns out it was more for news broadcasting and tv production which is not where I waned to go with film. Any advice on going the education route? I have heard many times its more about what you know and who you know as well as what your resume looks like than a 2 or 4 year degree.  Is that true? Thanks. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc892xk?context=5)|Yes.  I didn't get a film degree, and when I got my first job I was working alongside guys with USC and NYU film degrees...I've left many of them behind.  You get out of this what you put in.  If you want to be a writer, then write.  If you want to be a carpenter, you gotta swing that hammer.  If you want to be a filmmaker, you make films.  If you want to be a doctor...Well, you should go to school if you want to be a doctor.
[What do you think about VFX artists like freddiew and CorridorDigital who use YouTube to make a living doing VFX skits.

Once you start making money with something like that, you can get yourself stuck doing stuff like that.

The Internet is a great stage for people these days to get their stuff looked at.
[I'm a huge fan of the X-Men movies, and you mentioned earlier that you did work on the Nightcrawler BAMFing scene.  That was legitimately one of the coolest display of powers in any super hero movie to date, so huge props to you on that one!!  As for a question, when you are working on doing FX for a movie, is there any creative input on the part of you or your team?  Or is it more that the people in charge of the movie have exactly what they want it to look like in mind, and just ask you to do the actual effect?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc87s0w?context=5)|Well, rarely anymore do the people in charge have a clear idea of what they want, so they lean on the VFX guys to figure it out...But just as rare anymore except for in a few cases do the VFX guys get treated like true creative collaborators.  It's frustrating.

 |The big thing is being a vendor.  As long as VFX is treated like a vendor and not allowed to share in the profits their work brings in they will continue to struggle.  Do you think anyone went to see Transformers because of Shia Lebouff?  Or however you sat his name...no, they went for the big ass robots.  The guys who make the big ass robots in your big ass robot movie should be treated like headlining, above the line talent is.
[If I understand correctly, a possible solution to compete against cheaper/less expensive vfx houses is to become a famous vfx house (from a final audience point of view\).  So, in the end, you're ""blaming"" the people that manage the vfx business right?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc8edgt?context=5)|No, that's not what I'm saying.  The post VFX model started as a client vendor situation, but our contribution to the final product has increased such that we need to be treated like above the line talent.  If they are selling tickets for the film based on the work the VFX facilities have done, then the facility should be cut in on the profits regardless of how big the movie is.  But the VFX facilities have this sort of battered wife mentality...they're afraid to leave their abuser, because what if there's no one else out there...truth is their aren't that many clients.
[*an unreliable documentary about fairies.*  Why do you call it ""unreliable""? Serious question, though.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc87y49?context=5)|It's a play on the literary term unreliable narrator, where you have a first person perspective on a story being given by someone who can't necessarily be trusted.  We'll be presenting the story as true, but since it's a documentary being told by a couple of ex VFX guys about monsters, you might want to be skeptical about what we're going to be showing you.
[When did you start having interests in movie making?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc87d9r?context=5)|As far back as I can remember.  But I got serious about it my senior year of high school, which is when I started writing screen plays and reading whatever I could get my hands on about making movies.  I went to school for architecture, though, 'cause I thought it was silly to pursue an actual career in the industry.
[So it'll still be in a first person perspective, but from multiple people instead of one narrator?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc8efst?context=5)|Well, a documentary has a perspective.  We will have interviews from others, but it's the filmmaker's perspective and agenda that shapes the story.  That's our first person narrator angle.
[Would you ever go back to working for another vfx house or do you want to focus on your own films from now on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mdlph/iama_vfx_pro_whos_worked_on_xmen_and_narnia_now/cc8kb9g?context=5)|I want to focus on my own projects as much as I can, but I have a family, so, I'll do what I need to do to make sure they are provided for.  If that means chasing down another facility job, I'll do it. Mic I have to go down the street to Best Buy, and they'll hire me, I'll do that.
[I really want to get in to this line of business, but I'm no artist.

I wrote a short one page paper about why I want to go to London to do an internship in advertising. One of the problems I had when I was writing it was that I actually studied there for six weeks in 2012. So I couldn't wax poetic about how much I wanted to see Stonehenge.

It doesn't feel like my best work, but that might be because I'm so freaked about it. I don't feel as though it's up to my standards, but at this point I might just want to smooth it out a bit and turn it in before I go crazy.

1mduam,1,2013-09-14,Don't Touch The Darkness,[deleted],libraryofshadows,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1mduam/dont_touch_the_darkness/,"	Working at a morgue wasn't Victor's favorite thing to do, especially on a Saturday night. His dream was to become a doctor and this was the only opportunity to gain experience that was available.  Working at a hospital would have been ideal, but he was only a college freshman and all of the good jobs and internships went to seniors and graduates.  
	The job was kind of boring, he didn't get to handle the bodies or assist in the autopsies, he just processed forms. Occasionally he got to put the toe tags on the bodies and push them into the freezers.  Sometimes he would prep and clean the coroner's work area before he did an autopsy, but he mostly just entered data into the computer and verified that all of the proper forms in the coroner's report were filled out and signed.
	Victor would usually work a late night shift and was alone for most of the evening.  Being alone in that building scared him sometimes.  He wasn't afraid of the dead like most people were.  It was the silence that got to him.  It was always really quiet, except for the low hum of the florescent light bulbs and the clicking of the computer keys.  It was hard to concentrate on his work because of the silence. The building would produce many unknown noises and  every little sound was amplified. 
	The one perk of the job was the files, even though he would never tell anyone that.  Each person's file contained all of the gory details about their cause of death.  Sometimes he would pull the bodies out of their refrigerated drawers and examine them while he read their files. 

	Victor sat as his desk and lazily flipped through a folder.  It was an old woman who died of a stroke.  It was one of the boring files with nothing interesting in it.  He had about 8 files to go through before he could go home, but was in no real hurry.  The night before, he had stayed out late partying and drinking and was still feeling the effects.
	The coroner, Joe, was a man in his sixties with a full head of gray hair.  He rushed across the room, hastily putting on his coat.  He didn't usually leave this early, it was only ten thirty.  ""You gonna be alright here tonight?"", asked Joe.  ""You ask me that every time,"" Victor replied.
	""Sorry about leaving ya alone with so much work, but I just remembered that I had to pick my daughter and grandson up from the airport. When you get my age, you tend to forget things now and again"", said Joe. They shared a laugh as Joe put his jacket on. Joe continued, ""Just do what you can and I'll finish the rest in the morning.""  
	Victor waved goodbye and returned to the open folder,  eager to move on to the next one.  Joe's dress shoes clicked down the hallway, growing fainter with each step until they were no longer audible.
	He was relieved to be done with the stroke lady and eagerly pulled the next folder from the stack.  His eyes widened with excitement.  This folder contained a girl named Robin and the cause of death was suicide by overdose.  She was just twenty years old and very pretty. He stared at her picture for several minutes and wondered why such a pretty girl would want to kill herself.  What could have been so bad in her life.  He would normally wait until later in the evening to look at bodies, but he couldn't wait, not this time.
	Victor made his way into the room where the bodies were kept and slid her out of the cold metal drawer.  She lay there, fully nude and was just as pretty in person.  She didn't look like she was dead, more like she was sleeping.  The bodies normally turned grey after being dead for several hours, but she was still tan and very much alive looking.  
	He stared at her naked body, eyes investigating every detail.  He swallowed hard and reached his hand out to touch her breast, they were perfect, even in death.  He was hesitant and his hand trembled slightly as it drew closer.  He knew he wasn't supposed to do this, but it wasn't like she was going tell on him.  Her skin was smooth and felt like cold leather.  
	He nervously looked at the door several times to make sure no one was watching him.  His hand slid down the length of her body, across her breast, down her stomach, along her thigh, then back up. He had never touched a girl this pretty and moved slowly, admiring every contour. He didn't know why he was touching her or why he liked it so much, but he didn't let that stop him.  He ran his finger over her pouty lips, and pink lipstick smeared on his finger.  He brought it to his mouth and tasted it.  To his surprise, he had an erection and after some mental debate, he used his free hand to unzip his zipper.  He was planning on relieving himself.  As his unoccupied hand made its way back to her breast, he heard his name whispered, ""Victor"".  He quickly turned to the door, certain he had been caught, but no one was there.  He turned back around to find the girls eyes open and fixed on him, ""Please don't do this to me"", she whispered.  He tripped and fell backwards, his head and back hit the wall on his way to the ground.  He grabbed his head in pain and rolled around on the tile floor, cradling it as he groaned.  As he touched the back of his head, his hands came away with no blood.  A chain of  obscenities escaped him as he sat there.  He looked up at Robin's corpse, waiting for her to move, but she remained lifeless.  The longer he stared, the more he felt like an idiot.  A nervous laugh escaped him and he felt that he deserved to be scared for what he was doing.  
	Victor had enough excitement for the night and returned to his desk.  He couldn't look at her file anymore, so he moved on to the next one: A black kid in his mid twenties, two gunshots to the chest. One bullet punctured his lung, the other went through and hit his spine. Victor cringed at the thought and wondered what the wounds looked like.  He would have normally had a look at this body, but because of what just happened, he decided to stick to the files.
	The long, slow whine of an unlubricated door hinge poured through the building.  Victor turned towards the sound, still and attentive, waiting for the source to reveal itself.  Maybe Joe forgot something and came back to get it. Victor hoped this was the answer, because strange sounds bothered him more than the silence.  The click clack sound of hard bottom shoes made their way down the long entrance hallway.  Victor relaxed at the sound and returned to the file. The footsteps made their way, step by step, down the hallway and into the main room.  Without turning Victor said, ""Forgot something else, huh?""  Silence filled the room once again.  He swiveled around in his chair, smile still on his face and found that he was alone. The smile quickly melted away. He ran out of the room into the hallway and it was empty.  The hallway was about thirty yards straight to the exit and no one was there.
	Victor took this as a sign to head home, he had enough creepy stuff for one night.  As he gathered his things, he remembered that he didn't push Robin back into the freezer drawer. He strolled into the freezer room and stopped dead in his tracks, Robin was gone.  A cold chill ran through Victor's body as he stared at an empty metal slab where the dead body of Robin was supposed to be.  Either he had imagined the girl or she wasn't really dead. He wasn't sure which he preferred.  Thoughts raced through his brain, searching for a rational explanation.  She would have said something if she woke up in a morgue, and he would have heard her, right?  The problem was, where had she gone.
	The best thing to do was call Joe and tell him what happened, leaving out the details about his grope session of course.  He wanted to leave so badly, he was scared like never before, so he decided to make the call from his car.  He turned all of the lights in the main room off and quickly headed towards the exit.  The hallway was lined with four sections of overhead lights and had a switch every fifteen feet to turn off that section. Victor began down the hallway, he clicked the first switch, casting the section behind him into darkness. The feeling of being followed permeated his thoughts, but he didn't look back. He was afraid that if he turned to look, he might actually see something.  Second switch, click, more darkness. His pace quickened, third switch, click. Finally he was at the exit. He exhaled a long sigh of relief as he pushed the door open and stepped outside.  The cold night air hit his face.  As he turned back to switch the final light off, he was surprised to find that the first light in the hallway was on. Maybe in his haste, he failed to push the switch down completely. 
	Victor made his way back down the hallway, turning on each switch that he passed until he reached the first light switch.  He pressed down on the switch, hard, making sure it was off this time.  As he approached the second light, the footsteps started again, slowly approaching from behind him.  Victor looked back into the darkness and saw nothing.  He ran, slapping each switch off and turning to make sure the lights in that section were off. When he reached the exit door he paused, staring into the black hallway.  Free from the confines of the morgue walls, Victor flashed his middle finger towards the dark hall in triumph, then flipped the final light off.  His hand plunged into his pocket, expecting to find his car keys.  His hands moved from pocket to pocket, searching but coming up empty. When Victor found that Robin was missing, he had been so consumed with the event that he failed to pick the keys up from the table.
	He had no choice but to venture back into the building that he offered a cocky middle finger to moments ago.  He was afraid to go back inside,  but he had no choice.  He felt like a child being afraid of the dark and of a that place.  It wasn't anything more than a building full of dead people, nothing to be afraid of, right?  For several minutes he tried to convince himself that he was being childish.  ""Just your imagination"", he said to himself.  Finally he built up the courage and ran full speed down the hall. 
	He saw the keys as he approached his desk.  The sight of them was comforting.  The keys sat atop of a folder, and as he drew closer, he could see that the folder was Robin's.  He knew that he didn't leave them on top of her folder, in fact he remembered placing her folder at the bottom of the pile.  The thought of Robin still being alive came back.  Of course, it was the only rational explanation, squeaking doors, lights and strange sounds.  She was probably wandering around in the dark looking for help.
	Victor returned to the freezer room and hoped he would find Robin, but found something horrible.  He couldn't move, standing in shock as he looked across the room at the body laying on the metal slab.  The body laying in Robin's place was an old woman, the one that died of a stroke.  Was this the body he had been touching.  He wiped his hands on his shirt in disgust at the thought. The old woman was the total opposite of Robin; her skin was dry and sagging and her breast looked like socks full of sand.  Her face was sunken in and she smelled worse than the other bodies, which was pretty hard to do.
	Victor almost fainted and leaned against the wall to stop from falling. Suddenly the room plunged into darkness. Victor gasped. He was out of breath like someone had punched him in the stomach.  He stood still in the dark, listening for any noise or movement, but only heard silence.  He shifted his weight and stepped away from the wall, the lights flashed back on.  Surprised, he looks around for an explanation and realized that he leaned against the light switch.  He felt even more childish than before.  He wondered if the night could get any stranger, but before he completed the thought, he got his answer.  Across the room, on that same metal slab, was Robin.  She lay there just as she had before.  He pushed her body back into the freezer and noticed a dark burgundy and purple ring around her neck.  He hadn't noticed it before, maybe because he was paying so much attention to her tits. 
	He grabbed his keys and paused for a moment, staring at the folder.  Curiosity got the best of him, he had to check something.  In the ""Cause of Death"" section it read: Strangulation. Somehow the C.O.D. had changed from ""Suicide By Overdose"" to this.  He read more and found that Robin had been raped and strangled to death in a gas station bathroom.  He flipped through the pages and stopped on an empty form with the words ""Don't Touch Me"" written in pink lipstick.
	Victor backed away from the desk.  He had his keys and  curiosity quenched and he wanted out, immediately.  He made his way into the hallway and ran right pass the light switches without turning them off.  Even though the hallway was only about 30 yards, it seemed to stretch for a mile.  As he approached the door, the light near the exit shut off.  Victor stopped dead in his tracks.  The darkness was like a wall and so dark that the exit door couldn't be seen just a few feet behind it.  He stared deep into it, deciding what to do next.  Maybe he could just rush into it and burst out of the door.  It would only be a few steps, he thought.  
	Just as he prepared for takeoff, something in the darkness moved.  The onyx silhouette moved just beyond the border of the darkness.  His plan seemed more dangerous now that the shadowy figure lurked in front of him.  Before he could muster up the courage to charge, the first section of lights went out. He spun to find the same black wall of undulating ink behind him too. He was trapped, sandwiched between unknown dangers.  Time was against him, and he anticipated the entire hallway being submerged in darkness soon and he didn't want to be there when it happened.  Charging the door was the only option.  He exploded in a full sprint towards the door, screaming out a battle cry in some ill attempt at intimidation.  He rushed into the darkness like a running back on the goal line and disappeared into it.
	Victor instantly felt weightless, like he was falling. He couldn't see, but felt cold and sticky like he was in an ocean of cool honey.  Even though he felt like he was weightless, he could barely move his arms and legs.  He struggled with all of his strength and only moved a few feet. At any moment, he would push the door open and be outside.  His hand found what felt like the door handle and a sharp pain raced through his hand and up his arm.  It felt like something had bitten him. The same pain happened in his right leg, then his side, then his other arm.  He was being bitten over and over by something with a small mouth and pencil like teeth.  As he opened his mouth to scream and the dark honey slid into his mouth and throat.  He squirmed in pain and tried to move away from the door but could only move a little at a time.  Just as he thought he would suffocate, he was spewed from the darkness out onto the hallway floor.  He coughed and gagged as he sucked in large gulps of air. 
	He crawled down the hall so he was right in the middle of the dark walls.  The next closest light near the exit flickered and dimed.  Victor was forced to crawl farther away from the exit to avoid being consumed by the darkness as it swallowed another section of hallway.
	A shape emerged from the dark, it was Robin. She stood expressionless and said, ""You shouldn't have touched me"".  He cried out a begging apology to her.  He apologized for touching her and for what happened to her and that he didn't deserve this.  Nothing happened and Victor was unsure if his apology worked.  Minutes went by and nothing happened, she just gazed down at him.  Suddenly, the lights above him began to flutter and dim. He pressed hard on the light switch in an attempt to overpower it from turning off. The lights dimmed so low that he could barely see.  He closed his eyes  screaming out in pain as he prepared for the bites to resume once the darkness returned.  He continued to scream, but nothing happened.  
	He opened his eyes and was alone, pressed against the wall in a brightly lit hallway.  The exit was right there in plain sight, no dark wall, no dead girl.  He had never been so happy to leave work and briskly headed for the door.  Just a few feet and he would be home free. He imagined the cold night air hitting his skin. As he approached the door, the lights flickered and he immediately made a dash for the exit. The hallway was fully eclipsed and stopped him dead in his tracks. The bites returned and touch every part of his body. His painful screams were muffled by the thick darkness as the bites increased in intensity.
	Victor opened his eyes, he was laying on the ground in front of Robin's body.  Confused and not sure where he was, he scanned the room until his memory returned.  He must have hit his head pretty hard and blacked out when he thought the cadaver had spoke to him.  
	He laughed, happy to not be devoured by the darkness.  There was no such thing as ghosts anyway, he should have known better.  He stood up and stared at Robin's body again.  Even though the bites and darkness were still very present in his mind, he pushed them to the side.  All of that was just his conscious manifesting itself in a screwed up dream.  He reached his hand out and poked her body with his index finger. She remained still and silent. 
	Even though he had imagined all of the evenings horrors, he was still mentally exhausted. He pushed the body into the freezer drawer, turned the lights off in the main room and headed for the exit.
	One by one he flipped the lights off in the hallway as he passed them. He had never been more relieved to leave work. Standing in the exit doorway, he turned and looked back down the hall. 
	His body went cold as he saw that the first section of lights were still on. He stared in disbelief, but had no intention of going back inside to turn them off.
	He reached into his pocket, searching for his keys. In his haste, he had forgotten to pick them up from the desk. He had no choice but to venture back inside to retrieve them.

It seems that upon graduation, there are few options besides internships (many of which are unpaid).  This seems to be a larger portion of the jobs market than in the past.  So is this generation just getting suckered into volunteering or is there something else going on?"
1mdr0l,1,2013-09-14,"My internship felt like bullshit, but I tell people as if it were a legit experience.",[deleted],confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1mdr0l/my_internship_felt_like_bullshit_but_i_tell/," - I study engineering at a well respected uni. I've taken various leadership positions in clubs, have worked at labs, my GPA isn't amazing but it's not too terrible either (3.3), and overall I don't consider myself to be such a bad candidate for a job. I still do feel bummed about my GPA though.

 - I got an internship with a legit company in California, where I am from. Not a huge company in overwhelming demand by people of my major, but it's still a legitimate company nonetheless.

 - I was told that I was going to be doing engineering work. However, all I have done for the 2 months was sort paperwork. It was not that I was not proactive about it; I asked for some more real engineering opportunities, but the boss told me that where I was was where I was assigned to, and there wasn't anything he or I could do about it. 

 - I swallowed my pride and worked hard. My boss, co-workers, and co-interns liked me, and I liked them too. We felt almost as if we were a temporary family. I believe that my boss could write me a good reference letter when I decide to apply for another job. Plus, I also got paid good money.

 - However, I still am ashamed of what I did (or rather, what I didn't get to do). This especially feels bad when I hear my colleagues talk about what they did, when they talk about the research they did, the products they helped design with startups, etc. So I tell them that I ""worked with engineers with design plans and data"" just to sound more legitimate.

 - I don't know whether I truly had a shitty internship experience, or it's that my colleagues are exaggerating their experiences as I have done.

 - Luckily, over that summer I did become a semi-finalist of an engineering design competition (I worked on it myself). I also got published in a journal. I was nowhere near the first author so it doesn't really matter, but I am an undergraduate after all, so I can't say I am completely dissatisfied. All in all, it wasn't an achievement-free summer.

 - Regardless, I will keep applying myself, raise my GPA to ~3.5, and keep looking around for better opportunities. I'm going to do my master's, so I got one more summer during which I can do an internship before I am out of school. I'm fine with unpaid internships; I just want something where I get to do legitimate work, so I can actually use that to further my career and actually feel good about myself."
1mdq4r,2,2013-09-14,Exceptionally Choppy Undergraduate Experience Super Worried About Getting into Grad School!,thefaith1029,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1mdq4r/exceptionally_choppy_undergraduate_experience/,"Hey There Fellow Redditors,

So, I had an EXCELLENT experience at community college. FLEW threw it in 18months, joined up the honors society and did amazing enough to get accepted to a top 50 school in the US. Upon being accepted, I took one summer course and then decided to withdraw from my first fall term because, I was just exhausted. Went right back in to bat hard but had a little trouble adjusting - then things went REALLY South.

My younger brother passed away. Then, I took more time off to grieve/deal with family issues surrounding his passing. He was 20 - I was 22. Then I started to get back into school when I started to fall physically ill. It got so bad that I ended up in &amp; out of hospital for two years, all the while trying to maintain school. I managed to get my GPA just above a 3.0 but it was ruined this past summer when I failed my last class because I was you, guessed it - hospitalized - there's nothing I can do about it because I did take the final in the class so I did ""earn"" that grade. I'm now on a feeding tube looking to go back in Fall to finish my last class. My Grade point average is going to most likely end up being 2.9 something and 3.0 if I'm lucky.

Currently my plan is to study for and take the GRE and then apply to grad school. I'm just lost on how this is all going to look on my application. Obviously I'm healthier now, the feeding tube has quite literally saved my life and I'm able to function. And I wouldn't be applying to grad school if I didn't think I could take it on, but I just don't know how schools will look at me, what types of schools should I apply for? Maybe state level? and Private? 

I'm wanting to get an MBA or some sort of marketing program even though my BA is in Human/Cultural Geography, I do a lot of online work and have a few small successful blogs. I also have work experience from 2007 - 2009 where I worked a variety of internships both long standing ones and summer internships...

Please advise."

1mdmfp,2,2013-09-14,"Girlfriend of 6 years broke up with me, starting to think I was never really in love, but I still miss her so much.",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1mdmfp/girlfriend_of_6_years_broke_up_with_me_starting/,"It has been about three weeks since we broke up, and boy was the first week a living hell. I couldn't focus on anything, felt like my life was falling apart, and that I would be alone forever. I have started to feel a lot better recently, but I still find myself going over our relationship in my head, and figured this would be a good place to put everything on the table and get some good feedback. 

I met her when we were 17, and I had just gotten out of a terrible relationship that I had been in for 2 years. My ex at the time was a very mean and abusive partner, and this new girl just seemed so perfect. She was extremely nice and fun to be around, the opposite of my ex, and I just knew I wanted to be with her. 

Fast forward two years, she has gone off to college (about three hours away) and I stayed at my parents place and went to a local college. We maintained a long distance relationship with some success, it was very hard at first, but I did not find myself missing her too much. I think this is the point where we started to grow apart. We stopped talking as much as we used to, stopped surprising each other with things. 

She graduates from college and moves back home. I am now living in an apartment with some friends and I want her to come live with me. She doesn't think it would be practical to live together, and ends up living at her parents house again while she goes to graduate school. This summer, I had been extremely busy with an internship, and spent most, if not all of my time traveling to conferences and working on my research. I didn't think about her much, didn't call her or text her very much, and it certainly did not bother me that we were apart. 

End of the summer (about three weeks ago), we are at her house, and she starts talking to me about how we have different interests and how we don't like the same things. This has always been true, we have never liked the same movies, music, books, anything at all really. We keep talking and eventually she tells me that having been apart so much she doesn't want to see me as much as she thinks she should, and that we almost never see each other anymore. She tells me that she got used to never seeing me, and that she wants to break up.

This hit me like a truck, I instantly began crying and felt like the world was going to end. I told her how I could try harder to be with her more and I could try harder to talk to her more. After a very long and terrible talk, she told me that she wants to see what else is out there, and she feels very conflicted about being with me. We talked for probably four hours, and the consensus is that she wants space. The next week is probably the hardest week of my life, I can't eat, can't sleep, I just feel terrible all the time and I can't remedy my symptoms. 

A week later she texts me saying that she still loves me, and that she just needs time to herself. I give her about a week of silence and she finally texts me again to tell me about her classes and whats been going on the past week. We then go back into no communication and I haven't heard from her in over a week. I don't know what to think, and I don't know what to do. I don't want to ignore her and let her slip away, but I also don't want to smother her and drive her away. 

It gets a little more complicated here. I felt very very terrible one particular night, and after talking to a friend decided I would make a pros and cons list of her qualities. I ended up with a list of about 5 pros, and something like 30 cons. After making the list, I felt phenomenally better. It made me realize that I really wasn't that happy in the relationship, and that we don't make that great of a match. We never really connected on a deep level, and it always felt like she didn't truly know me. I find myself thinking about this list every time I feel bad, and it cheers me up. 

One last thing, yesterday I went to a party and she happened to be there, and I was getting some vibes that her and this guy were pretty friendly. It didn't bother me at first, until I saw them hug, and now it is eating away at me. All I could think of last night was them together, and its still in my head now. I'm thinking that its too soon for me to be around her, because I felt fine before I saw her at the party. All that's going through my head is that she betrayed me, that she has ignored my feelings these past few weeks, and that I'm not sure if I ever loved her. I just can't figure out why this breakup is still bothering me so much. Anyway, I will leave it at that, and any comments would be greatly appreciated, thank you. "

I plan on majoring in pharmaceutical chemistry and biochemistry.)

I came to this engineering school for a few different reasons, one of them being the fact that the government would pay for my tuition, and another being that it has a relatively good reputation. I left high school not really understanding the true difference between engineering and other sciences, but now I know and it makes me feel terrible.

Everywhere I'm surrounded by engineers, who will most likely be leaving college after four years with a comfortable salary and a stable job. While they seem to go down their educational path towards a brighter future, I'm working towards a degree that might not even land me anywhere. 

This isn't how I imagined scientists growing up. I thought all scientists, including the chemists, were well renowned and had wonderful lives. They worked in labs, discovered new things, and every industry wanted them. But now I know that's only for engineering; everyone else struggles to find their place, and even when they do, they're subject to the ebb and flow of whatever the world wants them to do. I keep reading horror stories of chemists with PhDs, struggling to make ends meet with salaries around 30k.

This really hit me when the school started talking with us about its career fair. This place always brags about its job placement rates and starting salaries, so I attended a seminar. They gave us inspiration speeches; they told us it didn't matter what year you were, you were almost guaranteed an internship here if you put yourself out there and tried. The spokeswoman told us about a student with poor grades and how even he scored an internship with Chrysler.

So, I raised my hand, ""what about non-engineering majors? Is it worth attending the career fair with a non-engineering science degree?""

I kid you fucking not, that bitch looked me straight in the eyes and said, ""Don't worry, I believe reps from Wal-Mart will be there""

That was the moment where I felt like I wasn't going to have any sort of a wonderful life with my degree"

Thanks god my gf was on the back seat, she only got minor injuries. However, the girl sitting in front suffered brain injuries and has been transport in a hospital somewhere in Florida where she's supposed to have a brain surgery. Her status is stable, but I don't know how it's gonna end up for her. From what I know, her eyes were opened but she did not answer to any stimuli. The driver has a broken leg and a broken arm. He will need physiotherapy for a couple of months.

I feel really bad for the girl. My gf's problems are nothing compared to that. Still, her internship is now over. She worked really hard for it since was an international internship and had to gather money to finance it. She didn't seem too much disturbed by the events, but I think it's because she's still on the adrenaline and have plenty of things to deal with. I think it will be hard for her in the next couple of weeks.

I just don't know how to feal about the driver. I think it's wise to say that it's not his fault. It was an accident. Although, a part of me hates what he have done to the people sitting in the car with him. It was his responsabilty to not take the wheels if he was to tired. I'm also terrified about what will happen to the girl, especially with the idea that it could have been my gf."

1mcvsn,1,2013-09-13,"Reddit, my family is fucked beyond reasonable doubt.",[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1mcvsn/reddit_my_family_is_fucked_beyond_reasonable_doubt/,"First of, I would like to say that my father is an arrogant asshole, my mom can't work anywhere and my sister is supporting herself while my brother has just found work. 

Now to begin the awful story. I have some people I know on reddit so I'm going to cut the personal details out of this.

My dad works at a job that pays about 40,000 dollars. He finished college but he can't use his degree (Came from a different country to the States). So now he's stuck with that shitty job at 40k.

Next we got my mom, who, like my dad doesn't know how to communicate in English whatsoever. She has been unemployed for over 3 years because her leg hurts her and doesn't have insurance to pay the doctors to fix it. She has gone to the hospital but they didn't help at all.

Next we got my brother. He finally found work a week ago and is working a brutal job for 11/hr. He is in his early-20s and lives with us. He is just starting to go to community college after dropping out of high school.

Next we have my sister. She's in her late twenties and has her own small business that's about to fall apart. She is the owner of the type of company my dad works for. She and her boyfriend are thinking about getting married but it looks like he doesn't want to and is just using her -- for 2 years. She's in denial as we all try to tell her.

Finally you have me. The only logical (or so I think) person in this family. My brother comes in at a close second. I am not going to reveal any info about myself other than the fact that I'm still in school and live with my parents.

That's a more detailed version of the family. Time to start the story. My dad got 10,000 dollars legally somehow (I can't say why) and we were thinking about buying a condo or house with that as our down payment. Everything was going great! We finally had enough money ""saved"" for a down payment! Then all hell broke lose. My dad works for my sister's company. Her hard ass boyfriend wants my dad to work way too much. My sister tells her boyfriend that my dad finished the job he was supposed to do.

Somehow, her boyfriend finds out and gets mad at her. My sister tells my mom, ergo she tells my dad. My dad got so angry at my sister's boyfriend (because of the means of finding out the information) that he quit his job. The job that is supporting our entire family.

He was looking for a new job but none were to be found. After about a week, we finally started to feel the effects of it. The ""saved"" money we loved in that envelope was slowly consumed for basic neccesities like internet, rent, electricity, and cell phone bills. 

My parents applied for food stamps and medicare and were accepted because they were technically earning 0 dollars. We lived off of the 10,000 dollars.

After 2 weeks of my dad not being able to find work, I went in to help him. I searched and searched, trying to find a job for him. I finally found a job he was qualified for and he's starting work tuesday. My brother, as i've said before has already started work.

My mom is still unemployed but looking for a job. My sister is helping us pay the bills by giving everything she earns from her salary to us to support us.

I am an optimist. But trust me when I say this -- My dad will 100% quit the job he'll be doing. I just know it. When people look at him funny on the street he yells at them. I wonder what it will be like for him to work at a place where my sister isn't the one in charge. I just hope everything goes well.

My brother will quit his job as well. It's obvious. He comes home dead tired. He can't live like this much longer.

Both my dad and brother are in really desperate mode right now so hopefully that will motivate them. 

I am currently working as an intern but will slowly be able to work at a position for a company. I will give my family everything. 

I make some YouTube videos in my freetime with ads and have been doing crazy /r/beermoney for this past week. I just hope it will be enough to cover the rent.

Thank you all for reading my story. I really needed to let all that out. I can't believe that we blew away 10k like it was nothing. I remember the joy on our faces when we got that money. And now. To see an empty envelope is fatal to my morale.

I just really hope things get better because if they don't, we will literally be on the street."
1mcuwb,3,2013-09-13,21/M/USA,[deleted],lifeinapost,https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeinapost/comments/1mcuwb/21musa/,"My birth was weird. I was facing the wrong way, and when my parents arrived at the hospital, the doctor was nowhere to be found. Things were put off as long as possible, but when push came to shove, the nurse made an executive decision and decided to try to turn me around. So without the doctor, she went ahead and turned me around, but she botched it up a bit. She wasn't fully trained for the task, and it wasn't her call to make, but she made the call, and because of it, I'm alive today. When I came out, the nerves in my left neck/shoulder area were damaged, and my left arm was completely paralyzed. 

My parents were devastated. Not much had gone right with my three older sisters so far: the first had some kind of mental condition that was diagnosed while she was in the womb, and that doctor suggested an abortion. My parents, who were Catholic, did not even consider that an option. Needless to say she's alive today because of that.

The second was fine, the third died during pregnancy.

Anyway, back to me. Arm paralyzed. Due to a ton of physical therapy, time, and prayers, I eventually regained some functionality in my arm a couple of years after my birth. I wasn't allowed to play any contact sports all through my childhood (football, soccer, basketball, anything that could potentially result in running into somebody else). Anyway, you know how kids are. Between that and being an introvert I got my fair share of grief from my peers about things just because it was fun and easy for them to pick on me. Anyway, I'm not going to elaborate on that, as it's not super relevant.

My 2 older sisters, my younger brother and I were raised Catholic. And our family was good. We went to church every Sunday, followed every time with my Dad taking the 4 of us to the children's museum. Every night we had a mandatory night prayer that we all did together, which did kinda suck (being a kid and all...), ending with hugs and kisses goodnight. Like I said, our family was pretty solid.

But we grew older, and life got more difficult. My mother had a best friend who was a Nun. And even though they lived in different states, they still got together sometimes and hung out. My mom had a hobby of making soap, and she would teach the Nun how to do it, among other things friends do together. One day, the Nun was telling Mom about how she just learned how to massage (or something like that), and she offered my Mom a massage (they were at our house). They went up to my Mom's room and closed the door. I'm not going to go into any detail, but she got more of a ""massage"" than she was comfortable with. 

This was devastating for her. Her childhood was really rocky, and she found stability in the Church. But now that this happened, and no relevant Bishops would listen to her calls, and the local clergy wasn't willing to reach out and help out with her pain. The whole experience was very traumatizing, and she started to drift away from her responsibilities as a mother because of how she was dealing with the whole thing.

On top of this, my older sister (the younger one), got to high school, and got in with the wrong crowd. Drugs, alcohol, depressing, rape, a couple of suicide attempts, and almost anything else you can think of from a stereotypical ""troubled teen"" story. My mother thought this was her fault, and needless to say, the kind of attention she received from my parents was the exact wrong kind of attention that she needed. 

My brother and I still went to church with my Dad. I look up to that man so much, and the last thing I wanted was for him to not have anybody to share this aspect of his life with, even if I wasn't interested in it whatsoever (he was in the Seminary for a while before meeting my Mother). My social life during middle school, and even until my senior year of high school, was non-existent. I was the kid that was worth talking to if you needed help with homework. I had the reputation of ""knowing everything."" But besides that, nobody wanted anything to do with me. I don't mean to brag when I say this, but just so you get to know who I am a little better: I am a highly intuitive person. I've always been good at absorbing information and keeping it. I never really take notes, and I've never really studied for exams, even through college. It's why I love math/science so much. Just so, I'm a terrible student when it comes to memorizing anything. Since I don't see the point in knowing what day of the week the Declaration of Independence was signed, I won't memorize it, even if I need to for a grade.

My sophomore year, I got really pissed that my brother was in Karate and I couldn't be. So I went to my mother and complained enough that she scheduled an appointment with the doctor just to get me to shut up. Instead of shutting me up he sent me to a Neurologist, who told me I could do whatever I wanted to. ""It'd just hurt when you get knocked there."" He also referred me to a hand surgeon, who was able to do surgery to restore pretty much all of my missing functionality to my left arm (examples of things I couldn't do: rotate my palm face-up, make my arm stick straight out to the side, similar movements). After the normal physical therapy, my passion of music really helped to increase my finger dexterity to a beyond-recovery point (guitar/piano).

Anyway, I had absolutely terrible hygiene. The thought of girls wasn't even close to being in my head. I had absolutely no trust in people, and I always automatically assumed that when somebody approached me, it would be either for homework help, or to make fun of me. This was until my senior year of high school. I was still active in my church's youth group, but mostly because I felt like I had to. Nobody was forcing me, but I didn't want to disappoint my Father. Then I signed up for my Deanery's Senior Retreat (for any Catholics who have heard of Awakening, it was that kind of retreat). Basically, that weekend breaks you down, puts you in a state where you are completely vulnerable and exposed, then affirms and reassures you (One thing that we did looks a lot like this subreddit, but in person, with a small group of people). 

It was the first time that somebody outside of my family appreciated my company because I was the person that I am, not because of what I could provide. I graduated high school, and applied for the state school's Computer Science program. 

By this time, my oldest sister, who was the stereotypical prized straight-A student, developed this notion that my mother is Narcissistic, and that simply being around her, or ANY member of our family, was toxic to her mental health. So after receiving her 2 BS degrees, she moved to Atlanta and now ignores all of our texts, messages, emails, and phone calls. Which sucks, because we were really good friends.

And in college I started to make some great friendships. I made one of my best friends my first semester. He was hospitable instantly, introduced me to all of his friends, who were all also really great, and that was my group of friends for 2 years. After the first year, I moved in with him. (Then [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1famkz/tifu_by_eating_at_long_john_silvers/) happened) 

And about halfway through the 2nd year, he found out I was Catholic. 

And that was the end of our friendship. Just like that. He didn't understand why, and constantly shit-talked me for it. And when I confronted him and told him that he was being a huge dick, he said it was for my own good. And after I moved out, that whole group of friends also decided that there were too good for me.

My Junior year I was lonely, but I refocused my efforts towards my studies. I also was able to land an internship with a start up video game company. I had also been helping out with the high school youth ministry at my old church (like 1/2 an hour away from my school), which is a completely awesome experience. 

So here I am in my senior year, still doing the Catholic thing. I found a passion in Software Project Management, which is weird seeing as I'll have a science degree, but the 2 real-world real-client projects I'm leading this semester will help beef up my resume. Hard to pinpoint exactly when, but some time in the past couple of years, I came out of my shell in a big way. I mean, it's hard to be in a shell when you're working with crazy high schoolers and leading a couple of projects. My sister (the one I still talk to) had an unplanned pregnancy, but decided to keep the child, and now I am siblings with the best mother ever and my niece is the most beautiful baby ever. Still trying to figure out the dating thing, but this past week I met someone who floored me with her personality. Thank you guys for reading this and commenting (if you so choose). It was great to write this out."
1mcu9n,11,2013-09-13,Another guy wondering about job offers...,throwaway0982243,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/1mcu9n/another_guy_wondering_about_job_offers/,"I got my first job offer recently and I have begun negotiating for the first time. It's been kind of like my first time having sex: exciting, awkward, and I have no idea what I'm doing.

I don't want to be too greedy, but I do want to be paid what I'm worth. Here are some details:

* **Me-** 25yo/Male/M.S. in Mechanical Engineering

* **Offer-** $80k + 1 mo salary relocation, full benefits

* **Industry-** Midstream Oil &amp; Gas

* **My Expenses-** Houston, TX cost of living; $120k student loans; 13 year old car that's about to die

* **Leverage-** Interned there over the summer and did exceptionally well; well-liked by all employees too

* **Experience-** 3 month internship with company; 2+ years part-time engineering work while in school (modeling and research-related); not much full-time/salaried employement

* **Education-**Bachelor's in Physics (Tier 1 uni); Master's in Mech Engr (Tier 2 uni); 3.5 GPA


I was able to negotiate one round and just got a $4k signing bonus; no salary increase. I feel like this is a lot of money, but then again I don't know if I'm getting twerked. **I have no idea what I'm worth.** [BLS](http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes172141.htm) has the mean of mech engineers at $84,770 and mean of mech engineers within this industry at $128,650... but this is all for varying levels of education and experience. Payscale.com put this offer at the 50th percentile for people with similar experience as me and my education level.

I tried negotiating (I sucked) and got a $4k signing bonus but I wanted more on my salary. It seemed to be getting kind of awkward with me asking for more. I'm completely lost here. Not to ""toot my horn"" but I feel like I performed higher than a ""50th percentile engineer"" over the summer, however, 80k seems like a big number to a new grad like me.

What do you think? Should I ask for more or settle?"

3) Complete **full contract** in March 2017.

4) Contracted for Student Loan Repayment Program (SLRP) and MGIB + Kicker.

I am also attending a rigorous 5 year MS+BS program for Computer Science. Additionally, I'd like to take advantage of a summer internship with Google and/or some study abroad programs. I would like to transfer into the IRR and stop wasting the Army's money and my study time.

Does anyone have any experience with transferring early to the IRR? I also cannot tell from the wording on my contract, would that terminate my SLRP and MGIB + Kicker benefits?

1mcsyo,6,2013-09-13,"Putting together my first portfolio since I was a student, could use some guidance! (not asking for a portfolio crit)",IDaccount,IndustrialDesign,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndustrialDesign/comments/1mcsyo/putting_together_my_first_portfolio_since_i_was_a/,"Hello fellow IDers.

I have a few questions regarding how to put together a portfolio while respecting client and my current employers privacy.  Some background: I've been at my current job for about 2 years now - it's my first non-internship position, and I graduated with my degree in Spring 2012.  Working where I am now has been an incredible opportunity, and it is amongst the top consultancies in the country.  But I'm getting ready to move on now - I'd like to move back closer to my family, so I am starting to look for options in another area.  The portfolio that got me my job was almost entirely student work (with some work from previous internships), and in my 2 years at [current consultancy], I have worked on a ton of great stuff and grown tremendously beyond that student work.  The problem is, most of the projects I've worked on aren't public yet.

So my questions are: 
First: How do I (if at all?) present work that is not public?  What is the ethical thing to do?  I was thinking maybe I can have a two tier portfolio - a public one (that would hopefully be good enough to get me into an interview) - and a private one that I could show in a potential interview (with some of the unreleased work)?  Any thoughts or feedback would be appreciated! (For the record, I have a very deep respect for IP, and the ethical considerations involved!  But, I also have worked on some kick-ass stuff that could potentially help me get my dream job)

Second: When I was a student, I was highly reluctant to show group work in my portfolio.  As a professional, everything is collaborative.  Several things that I've worked on have ended up being my original designs, but other projects I may have only contributed detail work, or generated a design concept that wasn't chosen by the client.  How do I treat that work? 

Any guidance or feedback is appreciated!"
1mcsg9,1,2013-09-13,Just needing to get it all out.,[deleted],LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1mcsg9/just_needing_to_get_it_all_out/,"I (f) love my boyfriend. More that anything I've ever loved. We met at our University. The fact that I graduated in May and then we'd be four hours apart was just a faint nagging that could easily be ignored. The relationship was not without it's faults by a long shot but it was amazing. Second semester I started my internship in the same town and he was in classes full time. I hated that I couldn't see him everyday. I got sadder and sadder as time came closer to graduation. It was becoming real. He wouldn't show his sadness and instead just say it'll work out because we love each other. We have to look at the positive. Pray that it will work. I am neither optimistic nor am I religious. That wasn't too fly with me. I found myself angry at him that he wasn't consumed with the all out dread that I was. Then guilty for feeling that way. 

He was right. Summer wasn't really too bad. He visited and I visited, and it was great.  But then he left. I had a full time job and he was working full time also. It really helped. My new job was fun and it kept my mind off being sad because 8 hours of my day was taken up with work. We saw each other twice a month June-August and sometimes three. I still was broken hearted when he left or I left him but that's ok because we were making it work. After all our distance isn't too bad. Then September came. He went back to school and I started a real job in my field. He has to balance work and school while I have work full time. He works weekends.  We are at the point where we don't get to see each other again until the last week in October. We haven't seen each other since Labor Day. Almost two months. I don't know how I can do it. 

Now I find myself ANGRY at him. Why doesn't he pick up shifts during the week and save the weekends for me!? He has to take off work for other things during weekends. He assured me things would work out! What the fuck! This isn't how it's suppose to be. If I use the money to go visit him on the weekend he'll be working 8 hour shifts ending between 10 and 12 at night. That doesn't work! It's not working anymore. Now it's putting up with time. Even if I did go see him his parents don't let us sleep in the same room or even be in a room with the door shut. I am 24 and he's 23. I find myself saying things to him like ""yeah right we can do that next time we see each other....never"" or if he tries to get frisky on skype or text I get mad. ""It's not like we can do anything at your house anyways."" These things come out, I get mad at him all the time for little reason. It just happens, I can't help it! I am in bed when he is done working on weeknights and weekends sometimes also. I am so incredibly bitter. All the time I am miserable. My mom always says she hates only having ""Sad daughter"" around instead of ""Happy daughter"" that is here when boyfriend is. The pain of being away from him is getting bigger than the happiness of being with him. Sometimes all I want is to break up and try to find a way to be happy on my own. But then I think that is the last thing I want. If I am this miserable only getting to text, call ,visit and Skype imagine what it would feel like if I didn't have him at all? 

I hate being sad. He is who I talk to when I am sad. But he doesn't understand how I view things. I am not the optimistic type and don't see the bright side of life. 

We talk about getting married and moving in together. He promises me  he will follow me. Then every so often a comment comes out that sounds like he doesn't really mean he will follow me no matter what. An innocent question about how I'd like to move there. And my whole mind is screaming it's not going to work. 

I can only feel this love and happiness when I am with him. Being with him is causing me so much pain and sadness. 

I don't know what I am looking for here. Support, advice, just a place to type? I don't know. If anyone can, this community can help me find a way to soothe my ache. 

Even if no one reads this, I think it helped me feel better to get it into words.

1mcp85,8,2013-09-13,30/m/NJ,Bedfordshire,lifeinapost,https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeinapost/comments/1mcp85/30mnj/,"Thought this would be a good place to write some stuff down.  

So I was born and raised in North Arlington, NJ.  It's a small town right near Newark and about 10 minute drive from MetLife Stadium.  MY father was a commodity broker and did very well for himself.  In fact, in the 1980s he was a millionaire.  I have a sister that is 7 years younger than me.  My parents tried very hard to have another child but it just wasn't happening.  Finally after taking a break for 2 years, they decided to start trying again and one month later my mom was pregnant.  Funny story is she was conceived while we were on a family vacation to Disney World.  My dad got a 2 room suite and I had my own bedroom.  Happiest place on earth indeed huh?  

At age 10, after nagging my mom for almost a year, I started taking piano lessons.  My mother always had music playing in my house growing up.  There's an old home video of me at 4 years old dancing to the entire Born in the USA album.  Yes.  And that will only be shown to my wife, whenever I meet that woman.  My mother always encouraged me to be myself and enjoy life and I LOVED to perform. I loved putting on a show for people. Whether it was pretending to dance like Michael Jackson or playing Bob Barker on The Price is Right, I always loved to entertain.  This came into play when I started piano.  Immediately I took to it.  It came to me very easy.  Most things did.  I was a very smart kid and today, am a very smart adult.  I was able to know what my mother said when she asked ""where's the fish?"" on my blocks and I'd point it out at 9 months old.  I started reading at age 3.  I could read the TV Guide with my grandfather.  He passed away when I was 5 (I still remember the night he died) but he had such an amazing impact on my life.  My mom told me stories that I would read to kids in my kindergarten class.  I even had the opportunity to skip a grade in school because I was so intelligent but my parents kept me on track because they didn't want to stunt my social skills growing up.  

So back to the piano...I learned at a fairly young age that I knew what my calling in life was.  Something in entertainment.  I would teach myself songs and how to play them, etc. In 4 years I was able to read and play very complex chords and songs.  My achillies heel was that I never learned how to play classical music.  But I'm ok with that.  Elton John can't do it and he turned out ok.  So at age 16 I started learning guitar as well.  I'm just OK at that but I know basic chord structure and if I needed to play a guitar, I could do it no problem.  

I knew music was going to be in my life forever.  During my high school years I decided my dream was going to be to headline Madison Square Garden.  Problem was I never had a band.  I never could get people to play.  Plus I was a chubby kid and never really had the confidence enough to think I could be this big music act because I didn't think I was good looking.  But that was ok.  I went to Monmouth University and enrolled in their music business program and that's where I met my best friend in the world.  Her and I have been inseparable since that September.  We never were a couple, we never even kissed, but I am incredibly in love with her even though she is in a 7 year relationship with one of my other best friends.  She's everything I want in someone and it's going to be very hard for me to get past that if and when I meet someone else.  

So I was at Monmouth and acted in a few shows there, one in which I was in the lead of shakespearean play!  I had to take an entire class on how to act for shakespeare.  I wouldn't trade that experience for the world.  I was OK as I forgot some lines.  In one show I even forgot a whole monologue but my co-star bailed me out big time.  It was there my want for entertaining came back into play.  I was willing to work at it but some politics behind the scenes made me not want to work with the director of those shows anymore.  I look back on it and it was probably stupid petty shit I was a whiny bitch about but hey you learn from it.  

My senior year I needed an internship and I asked my classmate next to me where he interned because he was at a music publishing house, which is the industry I wanted to go in after taking a class on it the previous semester.  So I went there and got the internship at this place.  It was in the creative department.  I excelled at the position and they decided to hire me to be the department assistant as they were growing.  I wound up getting in on the ground floor and being part of a company that grew in the next 5 years so much that we were being looked at to be bought.  And we were.  By BMG.  At the time, I was the guy pitching our music catalog to all video game companies, any new media ventures, and anything and everything sports-related.  I knew my time may have been limited.  My company saw value in someone at that position, BMG did not.  So I lost my job.  

THIS is where everything started falling apart for me and my family. 

2 years prior to this, my father lost his job trading a everything went computerized and eliminated what he did, as he was a middle man.  He also refused to adapt and thought computers were the enemy.  You know, one of those guys.  Long story short, he went through all of his money. My father was never smart with his money as he invested in crappy projects instead of just keeping stuff small and simple.  Also during this my mother started getting VERY heavy.  I always knew her as big during my life but this just kept growing and growing.  My father is also an alcoholic. Not the abusive kind, just the self-destructive kind.  And this affected everything in the home.  

In 2008 we got a phone call from the bank that the IRS levied 9k from their accounts and now had nothing left.  So I, working at the time, and with relatively minimal expenses, decided to take up the financial burden on the home.  

It's now 2013 and my father still has not found work, my mother has crippling obesity and cannot get gastric bypass because she doesn't have insurance, and I am trying to find full-time STILL from when I was let go in 2010. 

In 2008 I started teaching piano lessons on the side to supplement my income.  It then became a way to pay our bills.  I've been teaching piano and guitar since then and have quite a few students, but it's not enough to keep everything afloat.  

There are a lot of layers to this and I know I've been rambling on for a while.  But that's my life...so far.  I'm happy to answer any questions at all.  "

I am a senior majoring in Financial Economics and Actuarial Science.  I have work experience associated with finances and budgeting of a non-profit, however it is not a traditional internship and not really pertaining to actuarial work.  I am sitting for FM this October and plan on taking P around February.  

I decided to pursue being an actuary this summer and really don't know what the best way to go about networking.  There is a job fair coming to my university next week, which I will attend, but beyond that, do you have any tips on how to interact with recruiters that I meet, or even how to go about making connections with people that I would not see personally?  My preferred path would be as an actuarial consultant.

I'm really just looking for any tips to get the ball rolling.  I like to think that I have a charismatic personality and am intelligent.  I truly enjoy conversing with all kinds of people and so far I believe people enjoy my company, in both social and professional settings.  I am just not sure how to take my first steps.  Any advice at all will be much appreciated and go a long way!  Thank you."

1mgpgd,0,2013-09-15,I [21/M] am in the midst of a messy breakup with my girlfriend [20/F]. Looking for any advice on how to soften the blow.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1mgpgd/i_21m_am_in_the_midst_of_a_messy_breakup_with_my/,"First a little bit of background:

My girlfriend and I had been dating for just shy of 11 months.  From the start, we got along incredibly well.  I had never met anyone like her, and we immediately fell head-over-heels in love.  We both are in the same year at the same university.  She has a deep interest in medicine and statistics, while I have a background in engineering.  She is happy-going, studious, incredibly smart, dedicated, and quite pretty.  We have only ever had two instances in which we didn't really get along, which I will detail below:

Instance 1)

We were at a party, having fun, as we often do on the weekends.  We often drink, but rarely more than a few, no drunken shenanigans, getting sick, etc.  I walk I wander into the other room, and while getting more drinks for the two of us, I run into an acquaintance who I haven't seen for over a year.  We strike up a short 5 minute conversation, and I go back into the previous room to check on my girlfriend.  She is tongue deep in another girl's throat, her roommate's to be exact.

Now, she's in no way actually attracted to women, nor did she even find the whole thing sexually exciting or attractive.  It turns out, several douche bags had simply been egging them on in the hopes of peer pressuring them to do something entertaining (I'll save my rant on how these kind of people are some of the worst in the world for another day).  In my mind this crosses the line of cheating.  I was furious that she would simply throw herself around like that, especially with someone other than me.  But, I tried to handle the situation as responsibly as possible.

Since we had never explicitly discussed where to draw the line on this kind of behavior, and it turned out she had thought this was the line, that I might enjoy watching, and that she didn't enjoy it at all, I decided to let it go after talking about how much it hurt to watch her be used like that, and in my mind be unfaithful.  She agreed that this is completely reasonable, felt horrible for hurting my feelings, and promised there would be no chance she would ever want to do anything that could jeopardize our trust.

She stuck to this.

This happened about 3 months into our relationship.  Around 9 months in, the second incident occurred.

Instance 2)

It's summer break and our relationship has turned into a long distance relationship for the summer.  She, studying for the MCAT, is spending the summer on the US east coast, while I am stuck in the Midwest at my first internship.  At the company I worked for, I am not allowed to get any days, non-injury, or sickness related off of work.  She is studying for the MCAT at an elite camp of sorts with instructors who have scored incredibly high in the recent past, and have some level of teaching skill in addition, along with classes to refresh information that may be on the exam.  

It's mid June, and she asks me when I can come to visit her.  I've already done some research on how visiting her would work, and it does not look good.  The only weekend I could really be there would be July 4th weekend since I wouldn't have to instantly turn around and come home.  The problem with flying on July 4th (bus/car travel time would occupy the entire time by itself) is that it is expensive.  Not to mention, the rules at the MCAT camp dictate that visitors can only stay till 10, and they were not given the weekend off of studying.  Essentially, I would be showing up for 3 days for $600+ since I would be paying for a hotel as well, while she spends all of her time shut in her room studying.  As a college student I can't throw that kind of money around, so I had to explain to her that I couldn't come.  Meanwhile, it was impossible for her to visit me since she didn't even get that weekend off.

She gets very upset.  Suddenly, it becomes an issue of, ""spending time together isn't worth $600"" in her mind.  From previous experience that summer, I had a good idea of how much free time she would actually have since the limiting factor to us talking (we preferred Skype so we could see each other and smile) was that she could only give me about 30 min every other day to talk, otherwise she was too busy, no matter how much time I could make available for her.  Essentially I would only see her for an hour or two for $600.  Despite explaining this to her, she was still upset.  Unfortunately, I couldn't really come up with any resolution and she just sort of ""got over it""

That ends the story of incident #2, but there's one more bit of information to include in the story.  Despite being an elite studious camp, apparently lots of scandals were occurring within.  Guys were peeping at girls changing in their rooms, Med student instructors were doing hard drugs such as mushrooms, and a lot of students were sleeping with one another.

My girlfriend instantly clicked with some of the instructors, although disappointed by their drug use.  She easily related with them due to having similar goals, and ideas with medicine, as well as shared a common knowledge of all things medical, something which I lacked.

One evening she called me out of the blue, and asked me what I thought about smoking marijuana.  While I've never done any drugs myself, a one time incident like this seemed not only admissible in my mind, but I was happy to encourage her to try something new if that was what she really wanted and had put some serious thought into it.  I have, in the past few months mostly forgotten the details of the conversation.

As the summer came to a close, I recieved a second call, out of the blue.  ""We're breaking up, I'm starting to realize we never really connected as much as we could have.""

That was all the explanation I got.

Now, this made no sense to me.  Wait, other than two specific incidents, we never have had a problem!  We've been happily in love for months now, and at almost every stage I thought we connected beautifully, and she expressed similar feelings.

After a week or two of crying and sitting around alone, school started up.  Our friend group is the same, and while she may no longer feel in love with me, I really want her to continue being my friend, as I've seen her as my best friend for the past (almost) year who I can tell anything to.  Surprisingly, she is cordial too, and we even still hang out, sometimes just us.

We get along incredibly well, and she even hints at still having a significant amount of feelings for me.  She sleeps over one night and I get to cuddle with her again, she even kisses me once more.  It wasn't a gentle peck, it was one of those emotional ""You mean the world to me"" kisses.  Now they may have been how she intended it, or it may have been just one more ""goodbye"".

Last night, things took a turn for the worse.

After a bit of drinking at a party, I walk one of her tipsy floor mates home to make sure everyone's night ends well, and run back to the party, because she apparently forgot her phone there.  When I come back, my now ex-girlfriend is sitting out in the hall waiting to talk to me.

She asks if I realize there's a bit more to our breakup then I thought.  I admit that I had guessed as much, and in my mind I am thinking of the worst possible scenario: her kissing someone else over the summer.  (Yes we were sexually active, so this may seem a bit childish, but the thought of her expressing her emotions to anyone but me tore me apart.)

As she sits me down to talk, she admits that on the night she had smoked that marijuana for the first (and only) time, she also snorted adderall (she had never done any drugs before, remember?), gone out to a club with a lot of the drug using instructors, had been kissed by one, and then went back to another one's room to fuck.

On top of this, she adds on that she can still never forgive me for not coming to visit her at some point this summer, and that she is now unhappy because the instructor she had sex with doesn't want to talk to her, now that she's not there for the physical side.  She also explains that this only happened once.

I was speechless, and I still don't know what to say.  I walked 3 miles home in tears, thinking all the while that it might be best to just walk in the road instead.

After the issue of cheating in the past, I thought there was no way, she could ever do something like that, especially considering how much we loved each other, and respected each other.

She seemed sincere in her apology to me, and admitted she'll forever regret that decision, but she has no interest in being together again.

The worst part is, even though I am near blind with rage, I still love her, and I don't know how to handle those feelings.

I guess I just typed most of this out, because I promised I wouldn't tell anyone that would care, and I needed something to vent, but after typing it all, I realize, I have no idea how to react to my current feelings, in love, yet enraged and hurt.

I just want some constructive advice on how to improve my current situation.  Please don't up-vote or ""offer your condolences"" as I just want things to be better, and that won't do it.

**tl;dr**: GF left me after being led on by someone she saw as an inspiration and cheating on me, in a drugged up night, don't know how to react."
1mgos6,1,2013-09-15,I need some advise on three issues badly.,[deleted],Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1mgos6/i_need_some_advise_on_three_issues_badly/,"Obviously this is a throw away account. Back story: I am the international university college intern at a very large church. I am a senior in college and will graduate this year. But here is the situation. I have been discipling this married international woman for a few months now. I have been really careful about where we meet always in public places, husband fully knows etc and the words I choose to say to her. So most of the time I just end of listening to her talk. But right now I feel that she is using me to pour her emotions and telling me secrets that she has never told her husband. I don't mind it, and I don't have any feeling for her, but just as a single guy who is just 21 I feel I want to seek counsel from people who are much wiser than I am. I feel that I am being used by God to capture her heart, and we do talk about the Bible and she has even come to church and our international Bible study. So I really don't know what to do, I just feel like if she is using me as an emotional outlet and not her husband it will ruin their marriage, and I do not want to be responsible for that. And is it even my place to be talking to a married woman as a single guy? 

Second issue: 
I feel very stupid and unwise, I know the Bible teaches us to flee from sexual immorality, but I feel that I have dug myself into a situation with two Chinese girls. I think both of them like me, but they are non Christian and we are unequally yoked. But the question I have for you guys is as an international intern at a church does it take away the glory from God if a date a international girl? I feel that it would because I know some people will say oh he is just doing this not for God's glory, but to have a international girlfriend. Frankly  the girl doesn't matter to me, as long as it is God's chosen girl for me.

Last one: 

I have a friend from high school that went to the same college as me. I have known this guy for many years and I have invited him to church, but he is not interested in Christianity. But the other day I invited him to a church meeting with my international students and he became friends with one of the girls. And the other night he has invited this girl to the bar, and even asked her to smoke marijuana with her. The girl refused his offer, but I feel I see him as a wolf now and will not invite him back to any of our events again. Just very frustrating to me that he would do this, but I know I still need to love him. 

Sorry for the rant, and for the people that made it this far in reading this comment thank you very much. "

Many seem to craft their pitch so as to include what they're interested in, e.g., ""Hi, my name is *p*. I saw your website and noticed that you were looking for summer interns with skills or experience in data mining/big data/artificial intelligence/*q*. &lt;etc&gt;""

I don't really have any experience or a particular skillset that I can tailor to any one company, so I'd like to be able to say that I am a CS junior looking for _any_ summer internship available in _any_ team doing _any_ kind of work. (Of course I won't phrase it exactly like this, throwing gratuitous any's, but the idea is that I just would like any kind of internship doing some form of programming). 

Is it adequate or appropriate to present myself in this manner, i.e., with no specific interest in any one CS discipline other than programming?"

I know two friends who have very similar level positions in the same field and I know how much they are paid and that's the number I'll quote if they ask for specifics. They're a smaller sized company and they've been great through this whole process so it's not like my attitude is to squeeze every penny out of them, as long as they give a number that's close to how my friends are paid right now (I think their number is slightly higher than I would have thought in my opinion).

When I do get the call, should I press hard and insist that I hear their number first, or does that not really matter? 

p.s.This is for an internship position. Actually more of something in between an internship and full time (internship-to-full-time expectation sort of thing). does that make any difference in terms of how I should handle this?"

I have done two internships with the same Actuarial firm, and at the end of my second internship I was offered a verbal offer of employment at the firm. 

However the firm I was to be employed with was rather small, and due to some unforeseen circumstances, this position is not available anymore.

We were intrigued but some of us didn't want to look, knowing its always real.
  I called them sissies and clicked on part one, it wasn't so bad really, just a picture of a dead body and the story of how it got there, it had a link to part 2 so i clicked, it was the same, just every time it would have a do not look underneath the link. We got to 14 and it was different, it didn't have a picture nor a story. All it was doing is begging you to not go to 15, we got freaked out but me being a knuckle head clicked on to 15, underneath it all it stated was we warned you... 15 was on cannibalism.
On the top it said sorry, only way to save myself, I was starving. With a picture of a cannibalised body underneath. We then all went to sleep saying that was enough for this night, realizing we've been on it for 2 hours. When we woke up we said goodbye and headed back to our places.

Just a quick one to start, but my go-to anecdote in the pub for customers.

Picture in your mind 10:30 on a saturday morning. The store is still quiet, being perched on a retail park outside a medium city. A few customers milling around, the sun is shining and I'm currently filling shelves with the remainder of the morning's delivery. A typical start to the weekend.

On this particular morning, I am refilling the feminine hygiene products, sanitary towels to be precise. Fortunately, being a strapping^ish ^^^sorta young chap, I'm able to tow out a few boxes of towels under one arm to fill the shelf quick before moving on. So there I am, several boxes of ladies hygiene products under one arm, placing them onto a shelf, when I hear the question. The question everyone here will encounter at least once.

**""Excuse me, do you work here?""**

This day my customer service didn't beat my smart mouth to the response, so instead of the typical ""Of course, how can I help?"", I answered:

**""I really hope so, otherwise I need to get a new hobby.""**

Fortunately our customer in this tale had a sense of humour, and was an absolute delight. Future tales however will often not contain a happy ending..."

Caterpillar Finanical: It seems like they don't do much with securities. Mostly insurance and loans for equipment? I may have just misunderstood the website.. http://finance.cat.com/cda/layout?m=686948&amp;x=7

Northwestern Mutual Insurance: These guys are financial advisers. You start out selling insurance, I guess and then if you have a big enough client list you can sell securities. However, this won't help me with large scale fund management or corporate finance/capital structure. http://www.northwesternmutual.com/career-opportunities/financial-representative-internship/about-our-internship-program.aspx#Top-Internship

The third company, I just saw on the street. His website doesn't work, but when I talked to him he said he was a financial analyst and managed people's retirement accounts. His card says he's a ""Fiduciary Governance and Compliance Consultant"". Whatever that is?

I'm in the process of looking for jobs after graduation, but I am becoming very jaded with the whole process. I will find an entry level job posting that seems perfect for me and then realize that one of the requirements usually entails some industry experience. I got turned down from every internship I applied to in the past because ""you don't have enough experience"" or ""we found someone with more experience, sorry"" as well. I had some interviews last week from my schools career fair, and a few of the recruiters made this a talking point in the interview as a negative point. It constantly feels like an uphill battle.


Should I apply to these types of job postings anyways, or am I just wasting my time? Has anyone else in my position had success in finding an entry level job?

**For clarification:** all of my other credentials are fine. I have a good GPA, work in a lab, TA, I can talk to people, and have references on lock. I'm currently a senior majoring in aerospace engineering.

My main concern is that as this was my only internship so far, and it being from a financial company, it would not weigh as heavily as say a candidate with an internship from a technology-focused company. Do companies consider this when recruiting?


Also, do you feel that one internship is too early to decide if software development in a financial industry is right or wrong for me? I'm sure there are other opportunities that I haven't yet discovered; I just could not see myself developing enterprise web apps for the next 5-10 years.

I'm heading off to college and my estimated 4 year cost (including housing, food etc.) is $73,600. The school wants payment at the end of each semester and has a 1% interest rate. 

To help pay my parents have saved $16,000. I have a scholarship that offers $3,500 per year. I also have two guaranteed six month internships paying together approximately $20,000 (but this won't be until my start of junior year).

I received a letter from my college saying I have student aid available as a ""Federal Ford Direct Loan-unsub"" for $9,000 in the 2013-2014 year. The letter also says there is parent aid available of up to $15,000 with interest of 6.41%.

TLDR: I will owe $73,600, I will have 53,200, I need $20,400 in loans. 

So my questions are:
For the FederalFord is this financial aid I should accept?
Should my parents use the offered loan or are there other loans you would recommend?
Should I use up all the $16000 in savings first and delay getting a loan till later in my college years or should I spread out how I spend it?

I was hoping I could get advice/guidance from the women here because this is honestly the only place on reddit i feel comfortable posting this to. I don't know where to start or what to tell so I'll just tell the entire story.

I had sex for money and now my partner of 1 year wants to leave me. I'm not upset at her, I understand why she's upset.

I was thrown out of my parents house, in the middle of my last year in community college, because they found out I was taking estrogen and transitioning. I wasn't working because I couldn't find a job with hours that would fit into my school schedule, and it was the beginning of the year, I was still looking for a job after completing my summer internship. Anyway, I didn't have a lot of money because I really didn't expect my parents to throw me out so my partner let me stay at her apartment rent-free for the time being. I ended up finding work after a few weeks and was able to pay for my share of rent and food. My partner's mother hated me though, mostly because I was trans, and she thought I was taking advantage of my partner because I lived with her without paying rent for a few weeks.

Anyway, my partner and I ended up living fairly comfortably in a small studio in Los Angeles for the rest of my school year (this is 2012-2013). I tutored, and did freelance graphic design, PR, and writing. She wasn't in school and worked as a graphic designer for a big real estate firm. Once the summer came, I couldn't stand not living full-time and decided to be full-time female, except at work. In an extremely unfortunate event, my boss for the hagwon I worked for saw me and my girlfriend at a boba shop in Koreatown. We didn't see her but she had called me an hour later essentially telling me that I was a pervert, that I wasn't getting my final check (about $900 in cash), and that she never wanted to see me again. I couldn't afford a lawyer, and all of the employees at the tutoring center were paid in cash to avoid taxes. Luckily, I had money saved up from the freelance work and was able to support myself through the rest of the summer doing legal courier work and some free-lance writing.

Anyway, come August, my partner left for San Jose to finish up school, and I could no longer afford to rent out our studio at $1300 a month. I had only one more month left before I had to leave for Santa Cruz for school, so I was going to try to find something on AirBnB but then my friend who's a Stanford grad student and lives in San Francisco told me I could stay with her and share her room in Potrero Hill for $500. I wired her the money, and at this point, I had little money left. Like barely enough for the gas to get me up to San Francisco but I didn't really have a choice, I had to go somewhere and that was probably the cheapest and safest option I was going to find. So I start to run out of money and I ask my partner for a loan that I can pay back once I get my financial aid disbursement check and she says she can't because her parents monitor her bank account. I even called my parents and begged for a loan but they didn't even want to speak with me.

I only had $10 left in my bank account to last me 10 days, I had to do something, especially because I needed money for gas to get down to Santa Cruz for move-in at school. So I put an ad on craigslist. And I had sex with someone for $200 that night. I regret every moment of it. I still feel disgusting and I hate myself for it. I never want to do it again. I feel like I can never tell anyone because I know they're going to think i'm a wh***. I feel like I'm a stereotype. The trans sex worker. I needed the money though, and I wasn't finding work, and I couldn't wait any longer so I just did it.

I told my partner and she just started immediately crying. I feel so fucking awful because she was there for me throughout my transition and I betrayed her. She wants me to take a train down to San Jose tomorrow to talk about things and I don't know what to say. I don't know how to express just how much shame I feel and how much I needed that $200. I'm sorry this is so long... I didn't know how else to tell it."

I just turned 20 years old, a sophomore, and I realized that I know nothing about finances, whether it be credit cards or 401k. Nothing. I'm attending school right now as an IS&amp;T major, and I will have approximately $20,000 student loan debt upon graduation. I've been reading around /PF/ a lot and I found a really old, popular thread citing that if I were to repay my student loan in its full duration over time, I would be paying $7,600 in interest fees. That would be a poor decision to let that happen on my part, in my opinion. I'm the oldest of 2 of a single mother who has worked two jobs to keep a roof over our heads and food on our table. My brother and I have always acknowledged this and know that we are blessed. While our mom worked, we tried our best to keep her worry-free at home, whether it be keeping our grades up or keeping the house tidy and staying out of trouble. I graduated top 5% in my class and my brother, a senior, is due to graduate top 1% of his class.

Main questions:
My mother has told me explicitly to never use or think about credit cards until I'm older, but I've been reading that some people get credit cards at an early age to start building credit. I've had several jobs in the past, but I'm not working this semester. Should I get a credit card now or wait until I'm more financially stable and have a job?

I have been long debating between a degree in Computer Science (CS) and Information Science and Technology (IST). In everyone's opinion here, which one is more useful in helping me find a job and helping me land a better paying job? In all honesty, to me, there's no real difference. I'm really happy as long as I'm in this area/field. I just want to find a job that pays me well right from the get go, because I will mostly be trying to pay off student loans and helping my mom pay for my little brother's soon-to-be college tuition. I will have graduated when my brother is due to start is junior year of college. 

Where do I start in terms of trying to seek a paying internship that could potentially offer me a job as well? I've schedule an appointment with my IST advisor for this upcoming week, but I just wanted to have multiple sources to read about and learn from.

Is there any other financial burden or the sorts that I should be worrying about and looking into? My mom has always did her best to keep our financial matters out of our heads (my brother and me). So as her oldest son, I want to learn to become independent as soon as possible and help her finance and help our family. Thank you PF. And yes, I just made this account. I just recently starting looking through reddit and I have never realize there was this subreddit with so much knowledge and so many people who have such a strong understanding of finances."

I gave up on quitting drinking a while ago.  I originally quit drinking around the same time I stopped doing an excessive amount of Oxycontin, took a trip to India, and made a half-hearted suicidal attempt/gesture. After a few months, I started to cave in on occasion, before going another month without drinking.  And when I'd started again, it wasn't so bad.  The consequences weren't too severe.  I kept to drinking maybe once on the weekend in a given week, even though I was typically getting very drunk.  It didn't really effect my life, that much, except maybe I couldn't work out on Saturday or on Sunday.  I was able to get back into my grad program and finish, with pretty good marks.  

Generally, I was able to keep it under control as long as there was a structure, a reason for me to keep it under control.  But eventually, that too began to slip.  I started drinking during the week, on occasion, though not so much that I couldn't go to school or my internship the next day.  Pretty soon, though, I discovered poppy tea and could get high and feel all pleasant and carefree without a hangover, so that didn't stay a weekend activity for long.

I stopped that in June, and had my first ever withdrawal, and have pretty successfully stayed away since.  But after a few successive vacations, the summer quickly blurred into a long bender.  Whatever measure of control I'd managed to assemble fell to the wayside, and I was back to drinking most nights a week to the point of blacking out.  Instead of having the resolve to stick rigorously to a schedule of searching out jobs, I've let my life lapse into a half-miserable hedonistic malaise.  I don't think alcohol is the reason, at least not in isolation, but it's not enriching my life whatsoever and only serves to prevent me from confronting the changes I need to make, like some external defense mechanism.

I'm tired of feeling like a hypocrite, as my actions do not nearly match my beliefs and my values, and I know that means making changes in my life and my approach to life.  For one, that includes remembering lessons that I've learned in the past, and among those is the lesson I have had to learn several times over--that there are times when I enjoy drinking with friends, but those times are far outweighed by the trouble drinking brings, and also by the problems I do not solve because I choose to drink instead.  

Thanks for listening.  Hope everyone has had a good weekend!"
1mfqd1,5,2013-09-15,"I[22M] am struggling to connect with emotionally exhausted, long-distance [21F] girlfriend as she starts work",YoYossarian,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1mfqd1/i22m_am_struggling_to_connect_with_emotionally/,"I realize so much of these answers depend on how I phrase things so I want to be as impartial as I can. She is a redditor as well so there is a chance she might see this and recognize the circumstances even if I use a throwaway. I just need some additional perspective on surviving long distance relationships with two career invested partners.


My girlfriend and I have been in a long-distance relationship for two years now. I'm madly in love with her and we see each other regularly (about 8-10 times a year) and have done several long vacations together (several weeks to two months). We discuss the idea of marriage regularly and are pretty well committed to get engaged at the end of her last year in college, when our careers permit. She recently started an internship position which requires her to work very long days in addition to doing prep work at home. In general, our communication during the weekdays has been limited to several texts in the morning and evening and maybe a short phone or video call, usually with the implication that talking is cutting into time that could be used for her work.


On the weekends she spends even more time doing prep work and will spend her evenings with friends, meaning our communication is only marginally improved. Even so, the volume of communication is not the issue, but the inability for us to connect when we do speak. My college life and career choice were extremely stressful and demanding and I have found myself in her shoes on many occasions. I ensured that I always spent time with her regularly, frequently at the expense of my almost non-existent free time and sleep. Far from bitter, I couldn't have imagined doing it without her.


I respect what she is going through immensely as I have lived through it personally for years now, it is just difficult for me to accept the lack of communication as it is causing many secondary problems. We have been talking past one another about the fears of our future toegether going unaddressed, particularly the sacrifices we are making to be with one another. This has caused the most serious fights we've had so far in our relationship. She has become very quick to anger recently, however this is a recurring theme whenever she is stressed; yelling and being unaware of her combative tone escalating the conversation. She starts to think everyone is mad and disappointed at her, so she reacts accordingly even when they are not. I am currently in a lull in my work so I am trying to use this time to be extra supportive, writing her letters, sending her pictures, trying to be as attentive as I can get away with without asking too much in response. It has blown up in my face as I am tormented by the fear of feeling like a doormat, especially since I initiate the overwhelming majority of conversations now, paying careful attention to do so when she is least busy, and find myself often feeling wilfully ignored.


In the past, when she was stressed she wanted as much affection as I could give her and I did my best to do so, but now it feels like she wants little to do with me. If I back off, our communication all but ceases and if I press to talk about how this is hurting us, it usually ends in a fight.


Recently, after a particularly bad brawl we sat down and talked things through and I left feeling convinced that we were starting to see eye to eye, but I thought we turned a corner several times already and was left disappointed. I worry that once the weekend is over the progress will be undone again. This hurts most of all because our relationship was born out of a long distance conversation in which we got to know each other more intimately than I believe would have been possible if we had started dating face-to-face. I want to recapture that connection before we lose it.


A side note on our careers: My career is the rigidly inflexible one so she would eventually have to work around me for a while should we get married. It is possible and we've worked hard this past year to make sure that she doesn't have to give much up to be with me, and I've tried to involve her in every decision I've had the power to make so far. It is a situation we are well aware of and we've talked about more than anything. Though I can't change my career path to be more accommodating of hers yet, I support the relationship financially and have every intention of following through on my promise to ensure we have a stable family life as soon as possible. I wish I knew what more I could do.


**TL;DR** *Stress from career is causing communications breakdown in my relationship. I need help reconnecting with her without adding to her stress.*"

I've gotta make myself look like a person again for an internship after a year of letting my hair grow. My hair currently looks [like this](http://imgur.com/a/sVECk). My hairline/face looks [like this](http://imgur.com/8YsnXE1). [These](http://imgur.com/gRwtpJV) are my glasses.

Also, any general tips for biking places in Austin?  I am a little nervous with all of the ""biker hit by car"" stories on the news lately."

Now the problem I ran into is google. I really don't know which words to google. I usually end up with the weather forecast for Toronto, which is interesting but not very helpful.

I found the national weather service but apparently they only give internship spots to universities who have a partnership with the Canadian government, at least that's what I got out of the the mail.

I'm interested in severe weather forecasting and I don't mind getting my hands dirty.. I know I'll be spending a lot of time in front of the computer at work at some point, so something practical would be great.

If you know of any companies or meteorological offices, just the name would already be a great help!"

Toasters Gone Wild is a place where people like me are able to feel safe whilst I browse over my favourite toaster models, such as the [Panasonic NT-ZP1](http://johnlewis.scene7.com/is/image/JohnLewis/231762567?$prod_main$), the [Dualit Lite Gloss 4-Slice Red 4-Slice](http://cdn.idealo.com/folder/Product/2408/4/2408445/s3_produktbild_gross/dualit-lite-gloss-4-slice-red.png) or for you real Toaster freaks, there is the [DeLonghi Brilliante Toaster](http://images.kaleidoscope.co.uk/is/image/OttoUK/cloudzoom/DeLonghi-Brilliante-White-Toaster~23B371FRSP.jpg) which boasts supple perky levers and 4 slots that you can slot your bread in. Or if you're feeling a little more adventurous, there is a whole sub-genre of [bageling](http://steadfastappliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tfal-toaster-ver2.jpg) and if that's not your kind of thing, there is always toaster [bukkade](http://www.eurograduate.com/images/articles/news/Toaster%20project%201.jpg), [squirters](http://d436bf61292a5a72eb74-0b84e0b94db0dd2da26f73dca6f0cfa3.r35.cf3.rackcdn.com/catalog/product/cache/1/image/1000x/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/0/1/01_BM_toaster2.jpg), [BBT](http://www.kcmltd.com/equipment%20pics/toasters/CT540.jpg), [orgy](http://www.chefline.co.uk/images/CT1.jpg) and of course [vintage](http://www.best-toaster-ovens.com/wp-content/gallery/images/antique-toaster.jpg).

The toasters over at /r/ToastersGW know how to have fun and they love to submit pictures of themselves being in mighty [dirty](http://i.imgur.com/3RM7Dni.jpg) circumstances and from time to time, enjoying some [weiners](http://i.imgur.com/jI8c3Ho.jpg) and some taking a whole [bagel](http://i.imgur.com/I4TbyzU.jpg). All these pictures are available for you guys to enjoy in a sanitary and understanding way. /r/ToastersGW do not allow slanderous comments nor do they condone interaction of the creepy nature. No, it is an environment where you can watch buns get toasted safely. Where everyone can enjoy the sight of a toaster in action but must stay respectful. Respect one another and we can all have a good time.    

I know what's on the end of your tongue and it's fine. I'll answer. You're welcome. I know it's hard to find what you're really looking for on The Internet. Sometimes, you get lucky and discover a place where your needs are fulfilled. Now that I'm sharing /r/ToastersGW with you guys, I hope you will share it with others. The others that you have seen looking at your toaster lustfully, that guy at work who always insists on cleaning the toaster and even yes, that dude at Ikea that spends his lunch-break in the appliances section. We know what you're doing and that's OK. /r/ToastersGW is here.

/r/ToastersGW has moderators, as I said, to keep us in check. Here is what they had to say:
 
&gt;##1. How did /r/ToastersGW start?

&gt;&gt; **Chicken_Mcnugget** ToastersGW was set up as initially a way for horny toasterers to express their ways, without interfering with the battle over at /r/toasterrights. Kind of like posting to /r/gonewild instead of /r/pics.

&gt;##2. What's your toaster like?

&gt;&gt; **Chicken_Mcnugget** Silky smooth and sexy curves, right out of the Latino heartland.

&gt;&gt; **META_FUCKING_POD** She is a sexy deep blue Kitchenaid, with two slots for double the pleasure.

&gt;&gt; **TheBadgerTeeth** My toaster likes it real slow, real light at first. Then it gets crispy. ;)

&gt;&gt; **LetsPlayK** It has big ol slots for extra fun.

&gt;##3. Do you have a favourite post?

&gt;&gt; **Chicken_Mcnugget** No, I dont discrimate. I will spank the one eye wonder to any colour, gender, religon or creed (except the dirty toaster ovens)

&gt;&gt; **META_FUCKING_POD** 
http://www.reddit.com/r/ToastersGW/comments/1gx4mx/close_up_double_penetration_two_thick_slices_in/

&gt;&gt; **TheBadgerTeeth**  Not usually one for favourites, but... Toasty buns and big wieners.

&gt;&gt; **LetsPlayK**  http://www.reddit.com/r/ToastersGW/comments/11x147/want_some_japanese_toast/

&gt;##4. What does this Subreddit do that others don't?

&gt;&gt; **Chicken_Mcnugget** Accept everyone for who they are. We dont judge, either.

&gt;&gt;**META_FUCKING_POD**  As far as I know, this is the only subreddit to have hot pictures of toasters above the legal age of toaster consent.

&gt;&gt; **TheBadgerTeeth**  Pretty good role-playing thing going on. And come one. Perverse toasters.

&gt;&gt; **LetsPlayK**  Toaster porn and high spirits.

&gt;##5. Would you like to say anything to your Subscribers?

&gt;&gt; **Chicken_Mcnugget** Treat your toaster well, you may never know when accidents may occur. I lost my last SO to a thunderstorm where a power surge knocked the life out of her, I'm still grieving, years later.

&gt;&gt; **META_FUCKING_POD** Thank you for all the support you have given, and thanks for help expanding this subreddit.

&gt;&gt; **TheBadgerTeeth** Keep them coming! I'm running out of fap material here.

&gt;&gt; **LetsPlayK**  We are going to start cracking down on Creepy PMs. This is just a warning.

Thank you very much for reading. If you too would like to write for Subreddit of the day, apply for the [Internship programme](http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/ywgo3/subredditoftheday_is_now_hiring_read_the_details/c7wwcxi).

I've seen threads on here asking for tips primarily for criminal law positions (lots of prosecutors and PDs.)  I have a few questions about interviewing for firms that specialize in trusts, estates and, to some extent, elder law:

- As far as substantive questions go, what are some favorites or those likely to pop up?

- What are some resources I can go to to brush up on the area?  My focus in law school was estate planning and tax (some elder law) so I'm not totally lost, but I'd like to be able to remember some fresh, key points.

- ""Why do you want to be a lawyer/why trusts and estates?""  I really never know how to answer this question.  I think there are some good answers out there for a lot of other areas of law, but trusts and estates doesn't really lend itself to a lot of the more romantic notions of practicing law and, frankly, for some reason I just took a natural liking to the subject.  I really enjoyed what little drafting I have done, for what it's worth, but it seems silly to emphasize my law school exercises because I feel it makes me sound like a naive Bambi.

Some background about me:  recent law grad, waiting for NY bar exam results, and spent the majority of my time in law school taking estate planning-oriented classes.  I had a few internships, but my only 'practical' experience in anything relating to it would maaaaaybe be tax clinic (because, hey, tax) and the actual estate planning course (drafting pretty standard stuff.)

I hate the people, I hate the culture, I hate the atmosphere. I kind of like what I'm studying, but goddamn, not that much. 

I slip in and out of depressive episodes that are only getting worse. I'm not happy here and I won't be happy wherever this path takes me. I'm only here because it's where I'm supposed to be. It's what I'm objectively good at. I got invited to another honor society yesterday and I'm going to join, so I can use it as leverage to find my way into a business world that I know won't make me happy. I honestly could not care less about money. That's something a lot of people like to say, but I honestly don't care. Everything you can buy with money is terrible. I'd rather die than live in upper-middle suburbia. And to suburbia I'm headed. I'll have every metric of success society values, but I won't be happy. I'll have fucking died inside. 

I have a cousin who blew his athletic scholarship and chance at college partying every night. He's now works an honest blue collar job to support himself. Everybody tells me how much more sensible and responsible I am than him, since working as a laborer is so despicable. I would trade everything with him in a heartbeat. He doesn't have to deal with etiquette dinners or internships or resumes tailored to be just so or having panic attacks about being 2% away from an A on a midterm. He just has to focus on honest blue collar work, which he probably hates because everybody tells him how miserable it is.

Since at least sophomore year in high school I've been working on an escape plan. I'd just leave and never look back; brilliant in its simplicity. I don't know where I'd go. I used to think I'd live off of nature in the wilderness, but now that I write it out in front of me it's incredibly silly and all I honestly care about is getting as far away from my life as possible.

I have the awareness to see something is wrong and the foresight to see that it will always be wrong, but I won't act on it. I'm going to graduate an engineer and make tons of cash while every door that could have led to a simpler, more fulfilling and meaningful life closes shut. I'm tearing up as I write this."

**Suggestion one: Restructuring**  
/u/stupidnickname is completely MIA. As such I don't think he can do his duties as Head Defense of this firm. I am suggesting a bit of a three-way rotation of positions. I would like to demote SNN to a partner until such time as he has returned to active duty here, Promote /u/Mukhers to Head Prosecution, and steal the position of Head Defense.

I'm finishing up interviews next week with a handful of firms. As of now, I have been extended a verbal offer from a national firm in my town, and I'm 99% sure that I have at least 1 (likely 2) Big 4 offers in another (larger) city, out of state (recruiter said, ""I'll check if we even need to do a formal interview with you""). Because the CPA requirements for my state are different, the national firm has offered to work around that with me, possibly by bringing me in as an intern until I finish the credits required for licensure.  


My goal is to end up in my hometown (where the national firm's office is) working in private / corporate accounting, with the end goal of controller / CFO type roles down the road. Aside from the 3 firms mentioned (1 national, 2 B4), I am interviewing with another national firm that is in state, but in a different city--I'm going to interview, but probably decline if offered because it's all of the downside (non-B4, out of town), with none of the upside (B4 clients / prestige).

My dilemma is this: I am married, and my wife has a job that she loves here in town. We spent 4 years away from home before coming back due to my job requirements, and we've really enjoyed being back in town. Going out of state to a big 4 firm would look great on a resume, but I wouldn't want to do it for more than 2-3 years (3 max, probably--it seems like it's a chore). Also, I'm not sure how well it would help me make contacts in our hometown if / when I want to leave public. Alternately, I could take the job at the national firm in town, and work on networking with local businesses, as this is where I want to end up long term. I think the main draw of big 4 is exit opportunity, but I think most of those opportunities would be out of state, in the city where that job is. I also love the people that have been recruiting me from the big 4 firms (not just the campus recruiters, but the people that come to the campus events and all that), but I know if I took the job at either one of them I would probably never work with those people, as the offices are quite large.  

So, please throw out any pros / cons to either side of this that you all can see!

TL;DR: National offer (local office, staff of 8-9 in my service line) vs. Big 4 offer(s) (out of town, large city). I love my hometown, but don't want to miss any opportunities / sell myself short. HELP!

1mev82,27,2013-09-14,I just landed a great sales job. Here's what I did to have a successful job hunt! (xpost from r/jobs),neverenough22,GetEmployed,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/1mev82/i_just_landed_a_great_sales_job_heres_what_i_did/,"I'd been trying to move back to NYC after having done an internship here a few years ago. Unfortunately, I couldn't get so much as a call because I was living in Ohio. Well, I sold my car, packed two suitcases and got a sublet for a couple months and, about 3 weeks later, I was employed! I'm working for a great company that should yield some fantastic income and it's something I never even knew I'd be interested in.
Enough about me. Here's what I did over the past few weeks to land a job:


RESUME: 
•Personalize each resume you send with company name and position. I kept a general resume and would just change out the company name, position and any skills they mention in the description. Save each one as a PDF with your name, desired position and company and throw it in a folder on your desktop. It takes seconds but why not make sure it's not just a vague, half-assed resume?
•Make sure that there are NO spelling or grammatical errors on your resume. None. Take it to your friend with the English degree. Take it to your university's writing center. I work with several recruiters now who said they can spot a typo within 3 seconds-- and guess what happens to that resume?
•Create a section that lists skills and abilities. Why? Resume searching software pulls keywords!
•Your friend, the graphic designer? Throw him $20 and a case of beer and have them create a great layout, something you can edit. Do you know how many boring, ugly resumes come through?
•If your GPA is above a 3.0, throw it on the resume. Also, add what year and month you graduated. A recruiter mentioned that they like to see it-- and if they don't see it they sometimes view it as a red flag that you didn't graduate or are hiding something.



THE COVER LETTER
•I hated writing these. But write a few drafts. Trim them, omit things and get them down to a reasonable length. Try to throw in the keywords that you see mentioned in the description so anyone scanning your cover letter will pick them up. Keep it concise.
•I had several versions of these because I was considering different roles. I had one for sales, one for corporate advertising/marketing, one for advertising agency and one general one for anything that didn't quite fit the others. If you're applying to very different roles, just have different cover letters, drop in the company name and position and BOOM-- personalized cover letter.
•At the end, don't simply just say ""Let me know if you want to talk"". Offer a time or date when you can come in. Tell them that you'll call them this week to ensure they received the cover letter-- and then CALL THEM FOR REAL. Ask for an interview, even if it's just a phone or Skype interview. Why offer all of this info to them with no call to action?


THE HUNT
•Update your LinkedIn profile. This is now maybe just as important as showing up to an interview because it's what recruiters look at all day long (Source: I work with a team of recruiters and interviewed with another recruiting agency) Recommend people you believe in and write them reviews. Request or hope that they do the same. Join professional groups that have to do with your industry, geographic area or education. Make sure that your LinkedIn profile has your most recent resume and credentials listed! And that photo? Better be professional looking.
•I set aside times of the day to hunt. I started beating myself up after a while when I didn't get up at 7AM and work until 7PM. But what I found is that the timeframe of 1PM-8PM was my sweet spot, so that's what I did. It IS important to keep business hours though so that you can go into an interview at a moment's notice!
•Check out LinkedIn, Indeed, Craigslist and any industry-related search sites. I found Monster and Careerbuilder to be useless.
•See a job you want? Throw down a few bucks and Fed Ex your resume, cover letter and portfolio to the hiring manager. Makes a bigger impression than just another PDF file they delete from their inbox.
•Reach out to hiring managers and HR people on LinkedIn. Ask for interviews!
•Find the name and number of the person doing the hiring? Call them. Ask for interviews! (Seeing a pattern?)
•This is perhaps one of the most valuable tips: try to find a good staffing agency or recruiter that specializes in your field. Why? They're paid to place people, unlike that HR lady you keep bombarding with your resume. Do your homework, but this was incredibly important in me getting interviews, freelance work and, eventually, my job.


THE INTERVIEW: 
•For the love of God, don't be late.
•You're not late? Good. What are you wearing? It should match the company culture to the best of your knowledge. Applying to an account firm? Suit up. Applying to be a graphic designer at a boutique agency? Slim chinos and a button down. When in doubt, dress up.
•On appearance: be clean, well-groomed. Your clothes don't need to be Versace and Armani, but try to look current and put together. If you need to, go drop $50 at H&amp;M and get something a little snazzier than the pleated pants and too-big shirt you bought at Kohls six years ago.
•Also on appearance: nonverbal communication is important. Sit upright, don't slouch. Give a firm handshake, not a dead fish. Make eye contact. Smile. Smile. Smile. (Not too much, you don't want them to think you're too weird!)
•Prepare for the interview. Before you go in, research what the company does. Bring up any (positive) headlines you've seen in the news about them.
•When they say ""Do you have any questions?""-- ASK QUESTIONS! ""What's your favorite part about working here?"" ""What kind of additional projects could I take on?"" ""What does the perfect candidate look like?"" Whatever their answers are, relate it to you and your experience. If they say they want a proactive accountant, mention how you took it upon yourself to find some billing issue at your last job. Whatever it is, relate their answer to you. Make it so YOU are the solution.
•Create a 30/60/90 Day Plan and present it to the interviewer after you've interviewed once or twice and base it on the info you gather from the interview. Basically, you just write out what you plan to do in the first 30, 60 and 90 days if you're hired. Do you know how impressed the people interviewing me were when I did this? This alone might've gotten me the job.
•If you feel comfortable that you're probably being considered for the job, ask for it! You don't have to say ""Give me the job"", but approach it as ""I'm really excited about this position. If you could present me with an offer, I'd be thrilled to join your team!""
•I've gotten mixed reactions on this one when I mention it to others, but it's ALWAYS worked for me. At the very end of the interview, I say something to the effect of ""You know, I'm great with criticism. Is there anything about me, the interview or my experience that you have any concern over?"" Don't pry, but let them think for a moment. Maybe they'll come back and say ""You're a bit junior for this position and I don't know if you have the experience in CSS or Java that we need..."" Counter that. ""I understand your concern, but I would point out that I am currently learning CSS and Java and that I learned HTML in three days. I may not be a senior programmer, but I learn these languages quickly."" Boom. I don't like to let them walk out with a doubt in their mind about me and it's possibly the last time you'll get to fight for the position before they pass you over!
•Ask for their card. If they don't give you one, ask for the person's e-mail address at reception. Or just address a thank you card with the person's name and company as soon as you leave. Mail it immediately. Come home and write that e-mail (if you didn't send it snail mail) right away. I've been told by recruiters that this separates the ""Maybes"" from the ""Likely New Employees"".
•Consider not taking the job. I know, it's crazy-- but I turned down two really decent offers because I wasn't excited about them. Yes, I moved to NYC without a job and then turned down jobs. Crazy? Maybe. But look-- you'll be spending 40+ hours a week at this place. You are interviewing THEM in a sense, too. If you're not into it, write an e-mail after thinking on it and just say that you value their time and feel that you should no longer be considered a candidate.
•Go on EVERY interview you're offered. You're overqualified? Go. You're underqualified? Go. You're not interested really? Go. It might seem like you're wasting the other person's time-- and perhaps you are. But it's GREAT for experience. Try out your new questions you've developed. Ask for feedback. Worst case scenario is that you walk away with a new contact, more interview experience and no anxiety next time. I walked into my current position's interview with no expectations and was thrilled when I received the offer. You never know!


ENCOURAGEMENT: 
•I had a rule when I was job hunting. If I got a rejection letter or was denied a role, I did 3 positive things like apply to another job, contact a hiring manager or follow up on an application. It keeps you moving forward.
•Eat healthy. Go to the gym. Look and feel your best when you go in for the interview!


I realize this is a wall of text, but let me just put this out here: I have a liberal arts degree from a state college with a decent but not exemplary GPA. I moved to a new city without a job and took a huge risk. But what made me successful, I believe, is that I learned HOW to job hunt and gained some great skills and insight on how to do it. I made it my job to learn how and constantly improve.
PM me if you have any questions and I'd be happy to answer them!

1meujb,123,2013-09-14,Just landed a great sales job in NYC. Here's what I did to have a successful job hunt!,neverenough22,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1meujb/just_landed_a_great_sales_job_in_nyc_heres_what_i/,"I'd been trying to move back to NYC after having done an internship here a few years ago. Unfortunately, I couldn't get so much as a call because I was living in Ohio. Well, I sold my car, packed two suitcases and got a sublet for a couple months and, about 3 weeks later, I was employed! I'm working for a great company that should yield some fantastic income and it's something I never even knew I'd be interested in.

Enough about me. Here's what I did over the past few weeks to land a job:

RESUME:
•Personalize each resume you send with company name and position. I kept a general resume and would just change out the company name, position and any skills they mention in the description. Save each one as a PDF with your name, desired position and company and throw it in a folder on your desktop. It takes seconds but why not make sure it's not just a vague, half-assed resume?

•Make sure that there are NO spelling or grammatical errors on your resume. None. Take it to your friend with the English degree. Take it to your university's writing center. I work with several recruiters now who said they can spot a typo within 3 seconds-- and guess what happens to that resume?

•Create a section that lists skills and abilities. Why? Resume searching software pulls keywords!

•Your friend, the graphic designer? Throw him $20 and a case of beer and have them create a great layout, something you can edit. Do you know how many boring, ugly resumes come through?

•If your GPA is above a 3.0, throw it on the resume. Also, add what year and month you graduated. A recruiter mentioned that they like to see it-- and if they don't see it they sometimes view it as a red flag that you didn't graduate or are hiding something.

THE COVER LETTER

•I hated writing these. But write a few drafts. Trim them, omit things and get them down to a reasonable length. Try to throw in the keywords that you see mentioned in the description so anyone scanning your cover letter will pick them up. Keep it concise.

•I had several versions of these because I was considering different roles. I had one for sales, one for corporate advertising/marketing, one for advertising agency and one general one for anything that didn't quite fit the others. If you're applying to very different roles, just have different cover letters, drop in the company name and position and BOOM-- personalized cover letter.

•At the end, don't simply just say ""Let me know if you want to talk"". Offer a time or date when you can come in. Tell them that you'll call them this week to ensure they received the cover letter-- and then CALL THEM FOR REAL. Ask for an interview, even if it's just a phone or Skype interview. Why offer all of this info to them with no call to action?

THE HUNT

•Update your LinkedIn profile. This is now maybe just as important as showing up to an interview because it's what recruiters look at all day long (Source: I work with a team of recruiters and interviewed with another recruiting agency) Recommend people you believe in and write them reviews. Request or hope that they do the same. Join professional groups that have to do with your industry, geographic area or education. Make sure that your LinkedIn profile has your most recent resume and credentials listed! And that photo? Better be professional looking.

•I set aside times of the day to hunt. I started beating myself up after a while when I didn't get up at 7AM and work until 7PM. But what I found is that the timeframe of 1PM-8PM was my sweet spot, so that's what I did. It IS important to keep business hours though so that you can go into an interview at a moment's notice!

•Check out LinkedIn, Indeed, Craigslist and any industry-related search sites. I found Monster and Careerbuilder to be useless.

•See a job you want? Throw down a few bucks and Fed Ex your resume, cover letter and portfolio to the hiring manager. Makes a bigger impression than just another PDF file they delete from their inbox.

•Reach out to hiring managers and HR people on LinkedIn. Ask for interviews!

•Find the name and number of the person doing the hiring? Call them. Ask for interviews! (Seeing a pattern?)

•This is perhaps one of the most valuable tips: try to find a good staffing agency or recruiter that specializes in your field. Why? They're paid to place people, unlike that HR lady you keep bombarding with your resume. Do your homework, but this was incredibly important in me getting interviews, freelance work and, eventually, my job.

THE INTERVIEW:
•For the love of God, don't be late.

•You're not late? Good. What are you wearing? It should match the company culture to the best of your knowledge. Applying to an account firm? Suit up. Applying to be a graphic designer at a boutique agency? Slim chinos and a button down. When in doubt, dress up.

1mers4,1,2013-09-14,"Mom, Dad, please understand my perspective",IAmTheWeregoose,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1mers4/mom_dad_please_understand_my_perspective/,"I've felt overwhelmed in my major for over a year now. I'm so far behind that apparently freshmen are now ahead of me (and my entire class somehow). I know I'd do well as a psych major; people assume I am one all the damn time. Everyone I talk to honestly thinks I'd make a better psych major than a computer science major. Hell, the people at my IT internship preferred me to do work that involved dealing with people and their ideas over programming. 

All I want is for you to understand that I'm not just giving up after the work got hard. I'm getting to a point where I understand my skillset and it feels best served somewhere else to me.

I'm sorry if I disappoint you. I just want you to support me. And if you're upset, that's fine. Odds are, I will change my major unless my current advisor gives me some damn good advice. I'll take the financial responsibility if I have to. Just keep in mind that I wanted to go into psych before I applied for school and you pressured me out of it.

I love you guys and have done everything to make you happy. Can't you just respect my wishes here, just once?"
1meqea,3,2013-09-14,How many calories?,[deleted],Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1meqea/how_many_calories/,"I used to weigh about 250lbs. I dropped down to about 190 for a while. I had a death in the family, and between not exercising and too much booze, I came back from an internship to find my jeans didn't fit and I weighed 215lbs.

I think the reason I got off my diet was I was too strict. Never drinking , never going out to eat, etc. So I decided to start tracking my calories again, allow myself to have a drink or a candy bar once in a while, and just make sure to compensate in my calorie count for the day.

Is [Harris Benedict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harris%E2%80%93Benedict_equation) a good way of estimating?"
1meosf,10,2013-09-14,An SC2 eSports story. By just another reddit user.,eXeBreaker,starcraft,https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/1meosf/an_sc2_esports_story_by_just_another_reddit_user/,"Alright, so... I guess I'll start this off by explaining my motivation towards the SC2 scene. I played Halo religiously before switching to SC2. I figured that SC2 was the greatest skill indicator towards a single player vs another single player, and I was not much of a team player. I saw a couple of VoDs on youtube about tournaments, casting and so on. I think the first game I ever saw was HuK vs. QxC some time back in 2011 and that inspired me to buy the game.


My major in university was Chinese, then I saw my first NASL in 2011. I thought to myself, ""These Korean guys are really strong."" Then one three-letter name popped up among all others: Sen. When I found out he was from Taiwan, I totally flipped. This was, more or less, a direct culmination of something I was genuinely interested in, and something that I studied for my major. A Chinese-speaking player, a **foreigner** that was taking down Koreans like a boss. I was amazed that he took third place at the first NASL I had ever seen. This inspired me to make my next study abroad location Taiwan. I had been to mainland China twice anyway, so why not try Taiwan? They have one player who is this strong, I wonder what the rest of their players are like.


So, I went to Taiwan to study abroad. There, I met the big name casters as well as Sen, at two different barcraft events. I extended my social networking, and saw if their tournaments needed an English stream. I made contact with a few people who needed English streamers, and one day I found my event. I found my ticket. The Asia Star League's Admin, Ken, gave me his facebook info and we got to talking about it after I returned to America.

The days when I met Sen, Joeman, and SoBadRush (the strongest Taiwanese zerg and two big casting personalities respectively), I was super inspired to become a stronger player. The next day I went 10-0 on the ladder. I got in to diamond NA, and platinum TW/KR.


But there was another event headed by team Millenium's Coach, LLewellys, that I got to cast. It was called the MSI pro world cup and took place between 6 different Koreans, a Chinese player who is the little brother of DoTA 2 legend Sky (his name is LoveCD), and GamaniaSen.


Because of my relative inexperience to casting, I had no clue how to set up my stream and because I had only a single monitor, everyone could see everything I was doing on my screen. All 2,700 Chinese-speaking viewers. That day people made a meme for me. It basically goes, ""ForGG Threw out the GG!"" (what I actually said in Chinese was 佛GG打GG了！） [This Chinese casting legend](http://images2.china.com/game/zh_cn/esports/djtuijian/11085976/20100830/2010083018571875631800.jpg) added me on Skype between games and invited me to cast an offline event just a few minutes before my stream was finished. We got a skype call going, and 2,500 viewers could not believe I was talking to him. One of my Taiwanese friends said to me, ""Do you know who that was? That was XiaoSe! He is the best caster in China! He is like Day9 for China!""  The event he invited me to cast for was a major offline event in China, the NeoTV Star League, and if you guys remember [this trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxnr-aznBJA), it was amazing stuff. I loved being there for it from start to finish even though I was not at the live event.


March 2013 rolls along, and an MLG Winter event took place in Dallas - driving distance from where I lived. I initially wanted to start up a Chinese stream for it, and frantically tried establishing contact with them. In the end they didn't need a Chinese stream / cast. What they did need was an in-game observer, an in-game cameraman. They set me up for an interview with Axeltoss, and I was 90% sure going in that I would not get it. Adebisi did instead.


When Axeltoss told me that I didn't get the position, he still encouraged me to keep doing what I'm doing now (Casting Chinese/ Taiwan events in English, and casting western events in Chinese). He said he was casting and coaching for two years before he started getting paid for it.


It has now been a year and one month since I've started casting. I get paid via paypal by some organizations while simultaneously making some money off of twitch revenue. But of course, that does not constitute stable income. I'm in Korea at the moment. My logic for coming here was simple, I thought to myself, ""Um, well I know some Chinese leagues have invited Tasteless and Artosis to cast, as well as invited some Korean players to compete, even paying for accommodations. What sets me apart from them? I have on paper that my Chinese is 'fluent', and my plane ticket would be the same price as anyone else's from Korea. It would also be nice to just see a WCS KR event or two while I'm here.""


Right now, my status as a caster is just ""community caster"", ""amateur caster"" or anything else in between. I am hopeful that one day I can get in on a Chinese SC2 event. That's all I want. I don't want OGN, I don't want GSL. But at the same time, I set a deadline for myself. If in August 2014, I have not gotten in on a mainstream event, I will probably just continue community casting on the side and do teaching English as a second language as my main job. 


It is also worth me mentioning here that seeing a few different figures and personalities, players and the such in eSports popping up that are new, like Terry the Intern, AcerScarlett, and Nathanias, are what drive me to keep going."

1mjafn,1,2013-09-16,[30/m] complicated story with crush,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1mjafn/30m_complicated_story_with_crush/,"Hey,

me and my crush got to know each other last year. We both moved to a foreign country to study the same program. We are both a bit shy and sometimes get hit by anxiety/depression attacks (me more than her). In one of our first nights out - in this new country - her, me and some others went out. When we had some time alone, she asked me what I am looking for in a girl - and I told her, cause of my childhood and past, it takes a long time before I even consider ""hooking"" up with a woman. 
Over the year - with a couple of breaks, since my depression got worse and I had to go back home for a couple of weeks/month - we got to know each other. When I was back home she messaged me and asked how I am and we messaged each other almost every day and when I was back in town we spend some time together and discovered that we have a lot in common. We share the same values, we both get bored easily, that's why are both interested in many different topics/activities; we have the same humor, hate the same people and so on.
Since she managed to get an internship in her home country and I decided to stay here, we don't see each other any more but message us almost every day.
Last weekend I wrote her an Email and told her how I feel about her. She send me and Email back and mentioned that she enjoys our talks (serious or bs topics, doesn't matter), she also thinks that we share the same views and values and ""[she] also cares about me and has an affection for me"". But she hopes that I will find someone else in the town I am recently living in, that can see how ""awesome"" I am.

36 hours after her short - but in conlcusion - ""rejection"" email she messaged me again and asked how I am doing. Since I was still ""crushed"" and didn't want to get more emotional, I replied briefly with a random story. Since then every day she messages me and ask how I am and what I did. I don't know how to handle this situation.
I can't forget her, but I feel I have to try, since she ""rejected"" (more or less) and I don't want to get more emotional attached than I already am, and move on with my life. But since she messages me every day, I am not sure if she wants me to ""chase"" after her, or if her rejection is some sort of defense mechanism - she ones told me that she ""pushes"" away people so she won't become too emotionally attached - and I should still try to get together with her.
Maybe she ""rejected"" me since she doesn't wanna have a long-distance relationship?
Her sentence that she also cares about me and has affection for me still leaves me in the dark. Is her rejection serious or is she scared? I don't know if there is anyone else with this kind of story, but nevertheless, maybe you can still give me some advice.
Shall I move on, shall I keep in touch with her, should I ignore her or still try to get together with her?
Advice is welcome. "

I've always had an interest in web design and development, but don't have any formal background in it.

Over the past few months I've been studying up, having gone through CodeAcademy and spent nights combing thorugh online tutorials and a few books I've purchased, mainly on HTML, CSS and responsive design. I've also done some preliminary self-study on Python, and the very basics of web frameworks like web.py.

I'm currently at a point where I think I would benefit greatly from actually following the minute steps of how someone goes from thinking of an idea for a website (or having a client with an idea) to forming a fully functioning site. I've found it easy to search for simple questions I have, but I feel like this isn't giving me the necessary workflow and mindset experience I need.

Are there groups (online or in major cities) that get together to learn these kinds of things? I don't think it would be feasible to get an actual internship anywhere given my 9-5 job. I'm interested in any advice you can give me."

I have the schools video teacher (who has a masters in film production, used to teach at university level so he knows what he is doing) look over the cinematography aspect and production and he said spot on he and some of his students who are my friends are willing to work on the visuals on the movie,said  its great and the budget is damn high so you don't need to worry about that. Just a background on the movie so you don't think it is a stupid indie made by a 16 year old (well 18 by the final cut). This question is optional.

1miyba,11,2013-09-16,Help for a Prospective Transfer (Sort of a Long Read),adagiosaur,UTSA,https://www.reddit.com/r/UTSA/comments/1miyba/help_for_a_prospective_transfer_sort_of_a_long/,"I'm currently a freshman at Texas A&amp;M (College Station) in my very first semester. I'm from San Antonio, and was involved in a particular highschool program that really pushed A&amp;M and engineering. I didn't really have a whole lot of guidance as far as colleges went, as I'm pretty much the first in my immediate family to go. I graduated top 5% of my class, got an 1820 on my SAT and was fairly involved, so the obvious push was to go to a tier 1 university. I had only visited A&amp;M, and was already being pushed to go there. In the end, that's the only place I applied, and got financial aid that covers about 3/4 my tuition, at least for the first year. Towards the end of the summer, I just had a gut feeling that I didn't make the right decision, with both my choice in major (aerospace engineering) and university. 

Now I'm here, and the gut feeling is overwhelming. I'm not enjoying myself. I changed my major to economics (one strong interest of mine) during add/drop week mostly for the sake of getting out of engineering. I don't enjoy living on campus, and would much rather go back to living in a house (I would move in with my college minded brothers who live near UTSA and are currently going to vista). Worst of all, I don't bleed maroon, and find many of the traditions that A&amp;M is so well known for as distracting and annoying (believe me, I'm not anti-social and like to have fun, but I'm sick of saying Howdy!). Being from such a diverse city I can't fit in with the crowd here and have simply gravitated towards hanging out with a few friends that came from my highschool.

What it comes down to is, I want to get out of here, preferably before next semester. Problem is, I'm having a hard time getting over the hump of going from tier 1 to tier 2. And it's not that I have a superiority complex or something, I'm just worried about how much weight employers may actually put on the college you came from. I'm a believer in the idea that college is what you put into it, but many people would tell me that it would just really not be a good idea to go from A&amp;M to UTSA.

My plan would be to either go into computer science, as I have had an internship at a large tech company in the area, and actually quite enjoyed my foray into computer programming, or I would continue pursuing my new found interest in economics. So, what do you guys think? Is it a good idea, a bad idea? Do these programs have good things going for them?

EDIT:
I forgot to mention that finances are an issue as well, as I'd prefer not to have any debt, and my family cannot help me pay whatsoever, and even the idea of taking out $6,000 loans a year that I'm having to do at A&amp;M isn't very appealing, as I'm likely going to shoot for at least a masters.


TLDR: I don't like A&amp;M, but it's tier 1. Should I transfer to UTSA anyways?"

**Current Situation:** I go to a mediocre state school on the West Coast. I have four more classes / two quarters to go before I graduate this year with a BA in Philosophy. It will cost ~$5,000 to complete this degree. I have already spent $40,000.

I had a pretty shitty time in high school and thought that college would be better. Surprise, surprise, college hasn’t been any better. I’ve been in a downward spiral the past three years- mentally, emotionally, physically, &amp; academically.

Currently I’m living at home and unemployed. I will be commuting 1-hour each way to college town X three times a week because I can’t afford to live there.

Changing majors isn't necessarily an option. Each major requires roughly 44 credits. I'd be looking at $11,000 to switch. My school doesn't have many good vocational majors. The only one that I can think of is accounting and I suck at math.

**Reasons to drop out**

• It really pisses me off that I pay so much in tuition for access to the gym, health services, counseling, etc. and because I’m too poor to even live in college town X, I won’t have access to any of those services.

• I don’t have any professional or academic references. Just some burned bridges and lots of disappointment.

• I don’t have any friends. Literally no one would notice if I didn’t come back to campus.

• My degree (and pretty much any humanities degree) is worthless without some good internships, work experience, references, etc. My only work experience has been in food service. As stated above, I don't even have the references needed to apply to law school if I wanted to pursue that route.

• I’m a phony. I know nothing about philosophy. I’m worried that will show when I go back to class.

• I have no idea what to do with my life. I’ve considered a wide variety of vocational paths (nursing, dental hygiene, physical therapy, law, social work, plumber, electrician) but I always seem to get stuck on the fact that I need references or I get hung up on self-doubt or there’s some insurmountable obstacle- usually social in nature.

• I’m angry with myself, the world, the people who have done me wrong, the university- everyone and everything. I realize that dropping out might be an act of ‘cutting my nose off to spite my face’ but I genuinely feel an urge to hit the self-destruct button. It makes me feel good thinking that I could help lower my university’s graduation rate, as fucked up as that is.


**Reasons to stay**

• If I pursue an AAS degree in nursing, dental hygiene, etc., I may get an extra point or two on the application for having completed a bachelor’s.





**Edit:** Thanks for the advice guys. Writing this post and responses to you guys has really helped me get some clarity and insight into what I'm feeling. And with clarity and insight comes perspective. I can see how my warped thinking is making everything look dark. Things don't seem as bad now.

Five years of iron-gripped-tugging hand jobs, barely-there-minimal-effort-no-climax blowjobs.

You should thank your fucking stars everyday for our daughter, if it wasn't for her you'd still be in the run down shitty apartments you and **your** daughter were in.

I realize that dropping out might be an act of ‘cutting my nose off to spite my face’ but I genuinely feel an urge to hit the self-destruct button. It makes me feel good thinking that I could help lower my university’s graduation rate, as fucked up as that is. 



**Reasons to stay**

• If I pursue an AAS degree in nursing, dental hygiene, etc., I may get an extra point or two on the application for having completed a bachelor’s. 

• If by some miracle I get my shit together and apply for graduate school (social work, law, …) in the future, then I’ll have my bachelors done.

My writing internship of three months has turned into an editor's position. It's the first proper job that I've had in a long time and I don't want to mess up. 

I have a huge bulk of work to do with daily expectations that is spread across 5 magazines. Whilst this isn't a problem, I'm quite meticulous, which means that I can often take too much time in doing something. Whilst the quality of my work is good (or so my boss tells me), the production can be a bit of a jagged line.

I enjoy the challenge and the people in my workplace are fantastic, but I also don't want to take advantage of their faith in me since we're all working together. 

How can I work far more efficiently? Also, is there a means of creating quality at a faster pace? I'd welcome any advice!"

Any suggestions?,Hiker828,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1mip2i/im_not_sure_which_career_would_be_best_for_me_any/,"I'm a 20-year-old male, and all through high school I did well academically (I was my class salutatorian). After graduation, I decided to go to community college and take all the basic classes I needed in order to save money and give me more time to decide on a major. I am in my last year at the school, and I am still unsure of what career would be best for me. I *really* need to be applying to universities right now, but I'm afraid to do so when I still can't decide on a career.

I have thought about several different majors - Business, Communications, Political Science, Psychology, Computer Science - But I'm not sure which one would be the best for me. I want to get a degree in something that I can actually find a job in. I think if I can figure out what kind of work I would enjoy doing, it would be easier for me to decide on a major.

Here is some information about me as a person. Maybe it help with suggestions on what I would enjoy doing as a job:

* I'm more of a creative person. While I do well in math, I really struggle with it. Same with science. I enjoy writing/editing.

* I have experience with recording software and using a sound/lighting board for venues. I used to record albums for my musician friends.

* I'm *okay* with public speaking if I am prepared and familiar with the subject matter of my presentation. It's not my favorite thing to do, but it doesn't bother me too much to get up in front of people and speak (in most cases).

* Personally, I'm kind of a shy/reserved person. If I don't know you, it will take me a little while before I am comfortable around you. Once I get to know you, I'm more open and expressive.

* I have an interest in computers, but not a lot of experience with many programs. I think programming might be interesting, but it might be challenging for me as I know nothing about it. I have a little bit of graphic design experience, and once I get used to database programs like Excel and Access I don't think I'd have a problem using them.

* I did an internship with my city over the summer. I worked on several big projects, such as writing legal policies and recording/editing videos for the city's television channel.

* I am willing to relocate. In fact, I would prefer to move to another state once I finish college. I'd love to move to a city with over 200,000 residents.

* I've done quite a lot of domestic volunteer work, and also some foreign volunteer work as well. I love traveling, and wouldn't mind a job that involved a lot of travel.

* I'd prefer a ""white collar"" job over one that involves a lot of manual labor (by that, I mean things like construction work, plumbing, welding, etc.)

* If you have any questions that would help you get a better idea on what I would be good at, feel free to ask!

I used sokanu.com to try to give me some career ideas, and this is the site's top 20 list of careers that would be best for me, based on my answers to the site's career assessment test:

1. Statistician
2. Database Administrator
3. Computer Programmer
4. Historian
5. Cartographer
6. Web Developer
7. Web Designer
8. Information Research Scientist

14. Actuary
15. Biomedical Engineer
16. Correspondent
17. Journalist
18. Environmental Engineer
19. Phonetics Engineer

1mik6q,7,2013-09-16,Me[25M] and my girlfriend [25F] are in limbo - do I wait it out or not?,confusingthrowaways,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1mik6q/me25m_and_my_girlfriend_25f_are_in_limbo_do_i/,"Background: We have been dating for almost 4 years now, living together for 3 years. I work-full time, she works full-time as an unpaid intern (6 month program). I am supporting her financially during this 6 month period.

About three months ago my girlfriend accepted an extremely difficult and time-consuming internship. She works M-F, is out of the house by 5am and doesn’t get home until 8-8:30pm. We knew this new job would be difficult on our relationship, but I didn’t expect it to take this much of a toll on us. I see her about an hour a night – she gets home and is so exhausted from work that we don’t spend any quality time together. It’s just work, eat dinner, shower, go to bed, repeat. This exhaustion has manifested itself into a lack of a sex drive from her, which can be frustrating for me. Also, by the time she gets home she is physically and emotionally spent, so not the most pleasant person to be around. 

Recently (about two weeks ago) we had a talk where she explained that she is unsure about her future. About us, about her career, just kind of a nervous breakdown. She said she needed time to figure things out and if us being together is what she wants in the long run. The problem is she physically doesn’t have time to think about it, as that almost every waking moment is consumed with work. She feels like right now she doesn’t have the emotional capacity to deal with being a good employee and a good gf at the same time. 

This is very upsetting for me because I see myself with her long-term and love her very much. I am starting to feel used because our relationship is in doubt, yet I still provide her financial support. This wasn’t an issue before, b/c I saw it as an investment in our future. Now that our relationship is in question I think “why am I still providing for her if we might be broken up next week?” On the other hand, I think this internship is only 3 months longer – why throw away a good thing over problems we are having based upon her internship? Maybe I should wait it out…. 

Also, ladies: is this a legitimate excuse for not wanting sex? She tells me she is just so exhausted that it's the last thing on her mind, all she wants to do when she gets home is sleep. I try to empathize with her, as that it's tough getting home at 8:30pm and have to think about waking up at 4:30am (I definitely could not do that!)

Let me know if there are any other details you need!


---

tl:dr – Gf and I live together. She has very stressful, time-consuming internship and doesn’t feel that she has the capacity to do well at her job and be a good gf to me. However, only 3 months left of this internship. I provide for us financially. Wait it out or call it quits?"

It's been a while since I posted here. I wanted to tell my story, or where I stand now. It's not going to be a motivating story, but I want you to understand where you may end up.

I'll start from the beginning of my journey. I was a person who used to watch porn and fap everyday (often more than once). I was depressed, alone, without hope. When I started nofap I was happy all my troubles would one day go away. My first streak (19 days) was awesome. People noticed a change in me. As you may have guessed I've relapsed (many many times). During my nofap journey I've applied to an internship and later got a permanent job there, I worked out every day, I meditated everyday, I stayed positive, I took cold showers. Even tho I still had my insecurities with me, I was dealing with them.

Time has passed and I am still relapsing every 7-10 days or so, I am trying to deal with compulsive urges (not only with fapping), but they beat me each time. I still meditate, take cold showers, but I am nowhere further in my spiritual developement than I was few months ago. Each day is harder for me. Doesn't matter whether I relapsed yesterday or last week. Each day I struggle with feelings of despair and emptyness. Those who know what it feels to be empty inside and still try to do everything one has to do will understand. I have actually stopped comming to nofap for a while and didn't count the days since the last time I fapped. It didn't matter. I still relapsed whenever there was a chance.

What I am now: I talk more (I think), I feel less anxiety, I have some motivation, but my insecurities are also stronger, I have no hope I will ever connect to people or advance in my meditation. I honestly don't think I will ever be able to go longer than a month without fapping. People are amazed at how disciplined I am, but they do not realise how weak I am.

This story is not to discourage you, but rather to aware you that this journey is incredibly hard (most of you know that already). I am not giving up, but I don't have motivation to try harder either. This is the post from a man, who is at crossroads. And he still doesn't know where he will go. Stay strong, and I hope you are doing better than me."

I don't really like the phrase ""on-the-fly"" after reviewing my resume, it feels like to me that it gives connotations that maintenance was not necessarily done with safety in mind, which is not something I'd like to convey on a safety internship resume.

Exciting and kind of scary,ilovecheesepie,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1mihls/unemployment_exciting_and_kind_of_scary/,"A little background: I've been working during the duration of my degree. For most of the degree, it has been okay for me to do so as my program is designed for working adults. This year, however, is very different. I'm working on my action research, class, and my internship (a year of student counseling) along with my job. On top of it, my husband is a student getting his BS in Computer Science. It's a little bit of an understatement to call us a little busy. 

Since this school year started, I've not gotten close to the amount of sleep it takes for me to function. I've fallen asleep at work, and in class. Internship is about the only time I stay awake. I don't remember kid's names when I'm at internship (on top of being awful at names). One night, I had a heart to heart with myself to determine what I could do to make this period... not to the point of killing myself with fatigue. I evaluated the day and between commuting, there just wasn't time for me to fit in a self care regimen unless I cut out more sleep. So basically, I had to figure out what I was going to cut out of my schedule. My husband and I talked it over when I came home and it turned out he has a job this fall and winter at his school- making more than I do at my job. Well damn. That and we have financial aid saved up just in case this sort of thing were to happen (yay) to live off of until my graduation. On top of it, my friends who have finished grad school have all told me I'm crazy for working during my internship.

So I've decided to take the leap into conditional unemployment. I've decided to give myself time to sleep, time to actually do my homework, time to do a decent exercise regimen, and best of all, time to come up for air. I am all set up in a home office to actually do my work at home and with projects coming in left and right at my internship, I'll need all the extra time I can get. Plus, there are quite a few options to get really part time employment if I feel I need it (read: seasonal retail or being an elf for Santa- something I've always wanted to do).

The best part of this is that everyone I've talked to about this is so supportive. I've never had this much support going into unemployment.  I've been the breadwinner for my husband and I, for the most part, since we've been married and it'll be nice to sit back and take a ""breather."" Sometimes it's okay not to be grinding my finger to the bone in 80 different directions, right? I'm already getting a masters, yeesh. I have the rest of my life to be employed. I am scared about the part after I graduate, but I'm pretty sure I can figure it out; I always do.

I guess I just wanted to share this as kind of a happy tale. Sometimes taking the leap can seem daunting, but that's what we all did to get here, right?"

I feel that I'd have a better-looking resume if I waited to apply for a second internship (first was at a well-known financial company) during the next year. 

I would have a hopefully higher GPA (3.5 now), and more side projects (none notable currently, beside a team project from class). 

My concern is that if I applied now, I would fail the resume screening in the fall, with fear that I will be considered a ""fall applicant"" and be passed over in the spring. Another concern is that these companies will be more picky in the spring. 

Any advice/suggestions?

I don't know where else to post this. I was hoping I could get advice/guidance from the women here because this is honestly the only place on reddit i feel comfortable posting this to. I don't know where to start or what to tell so I'll just tell the entire story.

I had sex for money and now my partner of 1 year wants to leave me. I'm not upset at her, I understand why she's upset.

I was thrown out of my parents house, in the middle of my last year in community college, because they found out I was taking estrogen and transitioning. I wasn't working because I couldn't find a job with hours that would fit into my school schedule, and it was the beginning of the year, I was still looking for a job after completing my summer internship. Anyway, I didn't have a lot of money because I really didn't expect my parents to throw me out so my partner let me stay at her apartment rent-free for the time being. I ended up finding work after a few weeks and was able to pay for my share of rent and food. My partner's mother hated me though, mostly because I was trans, and she thought I was taking advantage of my partner because I lived with her without paying rent for a few weeks.

Anyway, my partner and I ended up living fairly comfortably in a small studio in Los Angeles for the rest of my school year (this is 2012-2013). I tutored, and did freelance graphic design, PR, and writing. She wasn't in school and worked as a graphic designer for a big real estate firm. Once the summer came, I couldn't stand not living full-time and decided to be full-time female, except at work. In an extremely unfortunate event, my boss for the hagwon I worked for saw me and my girlfriend at a boba shop in Koreatown. We didn't see her but she had called me an hour later essentially telling me that I was a pervert, that I wasn't getting my final check (about $900 in cash), and that she never wanted to see me again. I couldn't afford a lawyer, and all of the employees at the tutoring center were paid in cash to avoid taxes. Luckily, I had money saved up from the freelance work and was able to support myself through the rest of the summer doing legal courier work and some free-lance writing.

Anyway, come August, my partner left for San Jose to finish up school, and I could no longer afford to rent out our studio at $1300 a month. I had only one more month left before I had to leave for Santa Cruz for school, so I was going to try to find something on AirBnB but then my friend who's a Stanford grad student and lives in San Francisco told me I could stay with her and share her room in Potrero Hill for $500. I wired her the money, and at this point, I had little money left. Like barely enough for the gas to get me up to San Francisco but I didn't really have a choice, I had to go somewhere and that was probably the cheapest and safest option I was going to find. So I start to run out of money and I ask my partner for a loan that I can pay back once I get my financial aid disbursement check and she says she can't because her parents monitor her bank account. I even called my parents and begged for a loan but they didn't even want to speak with me.

I only had $10 left in my bank account to last me 10 days, I had to do something, especially because I needed money for gas to get down to Santa Cruz for move-in at school. So I put an ad on craigslist. And I had sex with someone for $200 that night. I regret every moment of it. I still feel disgusting and I hate myself for it. I never want to do it again. I feel like I can never tell anyone because I know they're going to think i'm a wh***. I feel like I'm a stereotype. The trans sex worker. I needed the money though, and I wasn't finding work, and I couldn't wait any longer so I just did it.

I told my partner and she just started immediately crying. I feel so fucking awful because she was there for me throughout my transition and I betrayed her. She wants me to take a train down to San Jose tomorrow to talk about things and I don't know what to say. I don't know how to express just how much shame I feel and how much I needed that $200.

So with that in mind, I have been practicing using Python with the goal of creating a Django web app (should I continue with learning Django?). 
 
Are there any distinctions or any specific factors that would classify a developer as a software or web developer, or furthermore, a back-end and front-end developer?


To be even more specific, here are the things I want to eventually work in:

* Developing with high level languages (e.g. Python, Java, C++)
* Working on the functionality of applications (and not GUI or design-related work)
* Ultimately, problem-solving, and using code to carry out a specific purpose. 

To add some background, I currently have a year left of school (and so I'm actively trying to build up my portfolio to help land a second internship). I don't yet have any notable side projects, so it just seemed to me that a good way to show my passion is to create a web app with a limited interface but strong/useful backend functionality.

So with that said, some advice/guidance will be far appreciated. What should I focus on, and what should I do next?"

So I'm in college and have been dating my girlfriend for about a year now. When we first starting dating, her confidence was one of my favorite aspects of her. 

Recently she was applying for a internship, but never got the job. She was devastated. She has also recently been effectively cut from her school's soccer team, which also hasn't helped the whole confidence thing either. Last week she sat me down and told me that I seemed like I was getting distant, and with everything that had been going on in my world, I saw what she meant. She said she couldn't go on if things didn't change. So I stepped up, got out of my comfort zone, and stopped being so distant. 

After our talk, the roles seemed to have completely flipped. She had been acting distant from me, so last night I called her out on it. It wasn't aggressive, or name calling stuff, I'm pretty good at handling issues with the whole, ""When ____ happens, it makes me feel ____. That might not be our intention, but that's how I saw it"". I felt like we were working things out at first, but then she started having something like a mental breakdown. We have been dating for a year, and have never once had an argument. It probably has to do with the fact that I don't really let things get to me, and that if they do, I usually just let them boil until the pressure builds and I kinda break.

Either way, she started talking about how she was getting nervous about our future, and where we were going with our lives. She mentioned how she was scared that things were slowing down because I have a job offer lined up for when I graduate, even though it is in a field that I'm not even sure if I want to work in. It felt like she was drawing some correlation between the fact that I have my shit together for the first time in my life, and she isn't sure of her future. I guess in her field knowing some programming languages really helps in finding a job, so I offered to teach her them, because I am a CS major. She said, ""It doesn't matter. No one will hire me.""

It made me feel like she was angry/jealous that I'm finally getting rewarded for my hard work, where for the first time she isn't getting rewarded for her work. 

She said she felt like her relationship with God has been lost since she started dating me. She knows I've been agnostic for some time, but I've never been against her beliefs. Hell, I've offered to go to church with her if she didn't want to go alone, and if she didn't feel comfortable with me there, I could give her a ride to anywhere she wanted to go Sunday mornings. Recently my mom went through a crisis of faith, and she seems much closer to God now. I told her she could talk to my mom if she wanted, or I could ask what my mom went through to find God again. She started talking about how she believes things should be; God first, family second, self third, meaning God should be your highest priority, followed by family and friends, and finally yourself. That's fine. Some people need God in their lives. But, she told me she thinks it isn't fair that she spends more time thinking about me than she does God, which I'm still kinda confused about.

She talked about how in the beginning she told me she never wanted me to change myself for her, but along the way she's changed her mind multiple times. For example, I grew up in a family where sweeping things under the rug was a norm. So when I was going through some issues, I'd handle them myself and never really open up about them. She wanted me to be more open, so I was. I told her about my relationship with my family, and how terrible it actually has become. About how on the surface it might seem like we're a pretty normal family, but underneath my mom has been pretty mentally abusive to me over the years. About how I had some serious self esteem issues growing up, and turned to unhealthy ways of coping with pain.

She was happy I opened to her, but I think she feels/felt overwhelmed by it, and thinks that leaving me will perpetuate/start a cycle of self deprecation like it had in the past. It felt like she was saying, ""I'm in the relationship now for you, not for me."" 

She told me she knew she'd never find another person like me. That she never had someone who was so kind and understanding in her life. She told me she knew if she broke things off, it'd be the biggest mistake of her life. She said she needs time to recollect herself and to find her confidence again. She said she still wanted me in her life, but she needed space. She asked for a break.

I told her I couldn't do that. I told her that I can't do breaks. She said it wasn't like I was over crowding her, or I was in her face too much, but she wanted to keep me around, but just not be officially together I guess. I told her if she didn't want to be together, that's fine, but I wouldn't wait around for her to be ready. That isn't fair to either one of us.

She then said, she wanted to be *more* serious then. She wanted to talk about the hard stuff in our lives. She wanted us to be closer. She wanted to talk about my past and hers, because it has made us who we are. I'm not so sure though how much I really want to talk about our pasts, especially dating wise which is what she wants to know about mine.

I'm not a girl, but I do know what its like to have a total breakdown. It seems like the whole world is spinning around her head, but she can't make it stop. She doesn't know what she wants but she does. 

What should/can I do to help her out? I'll be there as much as I can for her, because I love her to death, but there's only so much I can do. I really feel like she's just in a slump and can't get herself out. She's not the person I knew I liked when I first met when I was 15, or the person I fell in love with over the past year. She says she wants to be serious, but wants space. She says she wants her life to be unpredictable, but wants to plan out the rest of her life. She wants me to be successful and happy, but is bummed out that things aren't working out for her, and kinda takes it out on me.

TL;DR: My girlfriend has self esteem issues.

Now those 2 months are drawing to a close, despite doing 2 peoples jobs (one on maternity leave, one on secondment) on top of my own gigantic project which is at a level of complexity 2 pay grades higher than mine.  Giving every bit of effort I can and never saying no when people pile work onto my already ridiculous workload to demonstrate my commitment and abilities. 

I today got swindled out of a 12 month internship with a pay rise by someone with no work experience because their degree is slightly more relevant to the role.

On top of that I get rejected for another job in there today which I was recommended for by 5 different people but rejected for by the recruitment place with absolutely no fucking reason and my impending unemployment means I have to tell my buddy I can't afford to move out with him which completely fucks him over because he can hardly afford the place on his own and I feel completely responsible for that.

And it turns out my GTA V copy is delayed in the mail so I'm not even getting that glimmer of fucking justice, a game I've been looking forward to for years won't be delivered on time like most other peoples.

Wednesday I have to go to the doctors to get my liver test results back, and the fact they've retested me for something doesn't bode well at all. And today at lunch a fucking filling falls out of my tooth, I'm only recently back in this town so I don't have a fucking dentist and all the dentists are full except the private ones so I have to choose between spending half my last paycheck on a filling or just let my tooth rot.

Every time I get a little bit ahead I end up further back down no matter how much effort I put into it, I don't come from a rich or educated family and I've put in so much effort and time and never let up a little bit trying to better my situation yet people with privileged backgrounds get ahead without trying.

People wonder why I'm cynical? Yeah. Fuck everything."

For all intents and purposes, I am an MSE student right now but on the books I'm Und-E.

My GPA is pretty bad, I'm at 2.491 right now through a combination of arrogance and poor time-management, and I'm busting my ass to get it to a reasonable point. 

My extra-curriculars I think help give me some of an advantage, especially compared to some other kids I know however. I worked during my Freshman year (at an out of state school), and joined a Fraternity. Within work, I'm involved with a Leadership program but haven't exactly done much with it. Within the fraternity, I'm a member of our Risk Management Commitee, and a Study-Tables monitor for this school year. This means I've basically guaranteed to have 10 hours a week in the library of my own time to make sure my brothers study as well, and this is going to help me get my grades in line. In addition, I managed to get a position in a quality control lab over the summer for a few weeks, and got invited back over winter break. Ideally I'd like to be able to turn this position from a simple Lab Tech to a full internship, but I'd like to actually make some money compared to the 8$ an hour I get there. If I can turn it to an internship, it should pay more in the 13-15$ range, which is a lot more reasonable. 

This is my first career fair, and I'm nervous. I just don't know what to be asking recruiters, and I think that I can explain my GPA if I'm given the chance. Should I even put my GPA on my resume to begin with? 

Right now I'm holed up in the library flipping through a Pamphlet full of recruiters and trying to research what they do and what my chances of getting an interview with them would be like. I've been asking around with some of the older guys in my fraternity, as well as some of my advisors. I figured I might as well ask around here too, and see what other kind of input I can get. "

Four interns struggle with the problem. 

So as part of our companys upgrade to windows 7 we are trying to phase out all of our old Dell D series laptops and replace them with E series. (Yes before you all go into a tizzy we still use many Dell D620s because they are the most reliable laptop we have ever had the pleasure of working with.) 

So as part of this upgrade we need to provide new docking stations, the kind that also function as monitor stands. Now at the time none of us realized that the ~~ 9 year old~~ faithfull external monitors that alot of people were using are were the old three prong mounting bracket, while the new docking stations were 2 prong. 

So one intern was changing a customers dock out for them and got to the monitor part. They spent about 10 mins out at the customers desk working on it before deciding to go for help. So they lugged this monitor and docking ststion all the back to our lab and asked the other 3 interns. So the four interns struggle to man handle this monitor into place with no avail. So they ask a full time tech to come take a look, the full time tech struggles with it for a good 10 minutes before asking the department boss to come take a crack at it. The boss struggles for another 10 minutes and gives up.

So at this point it has been about 2 hours from the begining of the original dock install and no one can attach the monitor. It is at this point that intern number one, realizes the error of our ways. He points out the prong difference and we all dismiss him saying something along the lines of ""That shouldn't affect this."" Needless to say we struggled for at least another hour before realizing that intern number 1 was right.

TL;DR: The All Spark wont fit in Bumblebee, we should put it in Optimus Prime instead."

On my own time, I learned a lot about web development with Django and JavaScript, and I was able to land a solid internship over this past summer. Although personal projects are pretty cool to build, I find myself not liking the computer science major much at all. Studying things behind the practice of coding in a class environment is just not that interesting to me, and it seems like every day in my CS classes are kind of a drag. It's impacting my ability to do well in school.

The problem now is...what should I major in now?
I still absolutely love doing math, if that helps with an answer."

We were generally very happy and had a great relationship.

For about a year towards the end, I was very unsure about the relationship. Small things started to bother me, and I almost started to resent her for reasons I'm not entirely sure of. However, our relationship was still great and we still had fun together and so I was never motivated to break up with her.

I ended up going halfway across the country for an internship this past summer, and the space gave me time to think. I finally broke things off with her about a month ago, saying that I wouldn't be happy staying with my first and only girlfriend forever without wondering ""what if"". For the past month I've been generally happy and sure about my decision, despite her trying to hang out with me and things like that.

The problem is, we agreed to stay friends and so I didn't go ""no contact"". I still followed her and her friends on multiple social networks, and we talked occasionally. We also have a lot of mutual friends still, and so we run into each other and parties and things like that.

Now that it's been a month, she seems to be starting to move on and have fun with her friends and things like that. i see her talking to new guys, and I feel like I'm beginning to regret breaking up with her. I finally stopped following her and her friends on the social networks, because I couldn't stand seeing all the posts and pictures.

My question is, is this real regret that I'm feeling? Should I try talking to her, or is this just an immature case of only wanting her now that other people do too? This was my first (and only) real relationship, and thus my first breakup too. Need advice!

**TL;DR:** Broke up with first and only girlfriend of 3.5 years after a generally great relationship. Now that it's been a month, she seems to be moving on and my confidence about the breakup is going away. Is this regret and should I contact her, or is it an immature case of only wanting her back because other people are talking to her now?"

I was born at 0230 in humanna hospital in newnan georgia early january in the year of some dead guy 1988. that hospital still stands but under a different name. shortly after my birth i was circumcised, not a fan rather ticked but i press on. when i was days old my family adopted hannah, our faithful dog whom i would know most of my life and all of hers. i was a cute kid with porqupine blond hair-very adventurous before the age of four i held a rock and dropped it-red sparks isued forth as it struck the ground and at that moment the power went out in the house-i was convinced it was magic. around that time a tornado came close to our home as a result of hurricane andrew, i remember the sound of roaring wind and the sight of dark purple clouds as i slept in my neighbors split level basement. when i had been four for a short while my nextdoor neighbor was going through a difficult period of adolescence-which translated to him molesting me out of a sense of rebellion. i was not harmed at any point, and i thought he truely cared for me, this carried on. i met my first friend when i was five, he lived down the street from me and i would almost always be at his house when i had time-he was very artistic. i was always fighting in school, if someone hit you you got int trouble: my eldest brother would always be picked on and hence in trouble; my other brother wouldn't get caught; if you hit me you were going down-that carried on for three years. during this time i fell in love with an older woman. i was now in the second grade and visits from my neighbor were rare, she was in the fifth grade-her mother was furious when she found out... we broke up and i was heart sick or a while. a few weeks after columbine a boy at school asked me if i knew how to make a bomb, my neighbor had read an article on the young internet and we had made match-head mines so i said yes and if he came to my house i would show him... someone heard and the telephone game began-when the teacher had heard it turned into ""yes and i'll bring it to school and show you"" so i get called into the principals office and theres a child interrogator, my parents and the bitch of a principal. the officer asked me if i knew how to make a bomb, i said yes and told him how; he asked if i were to bring one where i would use it, i told him where i thought the most damage would be done; he asked me if i would do it, to which i replied ""HECK NO MY MOM WOULD KILL ME!"" the principle still tried to throw the book at me, emphasis on tried-my mom was pissed! so at around this time the molestation finally ended, no drama he just started selling illegal fireworks and didnt need me anymore (que years of questioning who and what i was, in the end im alright) at this point i get involved in boy scouts and it really helped me grow as a person-i wanted to be the one people followed-that people wanted to follow- for everyones smiles to be because of me, not out of mockery but of respect. stayed the course to the end and got eagle scout with 10 days before my 18th birthday (thats the deadline) i traveled many places through the scouts. mountains mostly but once i went sailing through the keys-that was the most magical summer of my life. durring middle school i went to a different school than i was supposed to, my perents were scared that my local school was too violent. well i developped a knack for shoving my foot down my throat. what got me kicked out was i had learned a word that i didnt understand-asked for clarification and got bad advice. so i walk up to my favorite (pregnant) sub and say ""im glad you got laid""... yeah. so for the 8th grade i go to where i was supposed to and it was allright-the admin werent assholes and it was actually better. met the people i would hang with for highschool and my first real girlfriend. some kid thought it would be funny if he took my book and pissed on it-he got in trouble-i got a new book. then this kid from florida showed up and i swear to you that his haircut looked like a penis-no lie straight up his hair looked like a giant blond cock. he was a bully, one day he put a piece of fat from his tray onto mine at lunch time and i put it back-he proceeded to rub into my head aggressively and i elbowed him away he said ""ok"" and punched me three times in the face. i stood up and turned his ass in. whe i was a freshman in highschool i got a job as a bagger at kroger and worked there for two years, it was a good job and i liked my co-workers. on my off time i would walk 2 miles to the nearest bookstore and read for 6hours straight. sophmore year marked the first and last time i contemplated suicide-it was stupid really i was failing french and started thinking stupid shit-i decided that if anyone came and talked to me i would stab my cheast with a pencil-thirty minutes later it was like my brain rebooted and i was like well tat was stupid. i quit the job to take school seriously for senior year, found a group of people that i could actually enjoy being around and had the time of my life. sometime durrng the later half of my highschool time i had an epiphany i was going to die in seventy years... i had no idea what i was going to study at college... and that if i continued on as i was i would live a life so unremarkable that you could replace me with anyone and barely notice i was missing. so i decided that i would live my whole life towards an impossible goal that would take my whole life to accomplish. even if i died before it was completed, if i gave everything i had to make the dream happen and held nothing back... i could always die with a smile. sounds weird but that has kept me from suicide ever since (8years and counting) so i decided i would be a leader and change the world so that it would rock... i would be a king, i even bouth how to start your own country by erwin strause. there was just one problem-all the land was taken, thought i solved the issue by deciding on antartica-NOPE its devided between all the world powers, eventually settled on the moon and i delved into spaceship design in my spare time. went to college after applying to two military schools (was accepted into both picked the one with less hazing and better food) i decided on a major in criminal justice and met a very special girl who never left my side. i was dating my first girlfriend again at the time (this was my fourth relationship and first double dip) eventually we broke up and this girl and i were joined at the hip officialy. i learned many things and my subordinates genuinly likedme and would do what i asked them to do without too much fuss! life was good. then i decided to propose and tried to be as traditional as possible. my parents didnt approve, this drove my love to madness and started a year and a half of bickering. i proposed under a wilow tree on valentines night, when i was with her all was well when i was with my parents the fighting got worse. in the summer of 2009 i was kicked out, my relatives took me in and i joined the national guard. did well enough on the asvab to get a loophole into the SMP program and i was able to finish school while living with my fiance and trying to patch up my family ties. i took an internship with the department of family and children services and was put in the file room, eventually i finished-they were amazed nd actually wanted for me to tag along. everyone of those people was a saint-one was a little shady but not too much. i graduated got married and commisioned into the active duty component of the army in the same week. my family was there and that day holds the happiest memories of my life to date. then it fell to hell-the wedding night wasn't so great... a few days later i went off to train... a few months later she confessed to an affair... then asked for a divorce... it was my turn for madness... the divorce took 15 months to complete and i am still not healed. i had to fight to keep my job because my peers attempted to claim that i was mentally unfit for duty, well he made a mistake and my commander took advantage of it. won the battle and transfered-and very soon i will deploy and take a huge chunk out of the debt i incurred to pay for college and support my wife even durring the proceeds of divorce. i lost my faith and things i had seen in my life suddenly became evidence that god either did not exist or was evil, my molestation, my friend who lost an eye an ear a nose half his face and parts of his scalp to the hyenas who killed his family the same night, the LRA of uganda, and the night my fiance broke-i grabbed a knife out of her hand as it was pointing to her cheast-she looked at me started sobbing and it turned to laughter that haunts me to this day. my life has hells but they do not hold a candel to what i saw done to others, especially to the children i saw durring my internship. if there is a god i will smite him for abandonning the weak and defensless, until i am no more. i once had a dog of my own, her name was havoc ""the dog of war"" those who know me now can tell who i am but-hopefully they dont know when the narwhal bacons. the land lord said he would shoot her, she had to put her in a pound, i tried to adopt her but was too late-the man said a little girl fell in love and she was gone... there was hesitation in his voice, i hope she is alive. I am far better off than where i was, i havent cried in months. and each day i am made proud by seeing what those who have and are under me now accomplish-part of that is my responsibility if only because i dont get in the way, hopefully im helping but either way...their success makes me happy. after this deployment i will continue to kill off my debt as soon as possible, and now i am setting my sights on mars-throught mars one. it does not matter to me if i become a king or not anymore, only that i advance the torch of human knowldge so far that it can never be pulled back. i hope that i can love again, or at least have a non serious relationship soon-but for now i am getting comfortable with who i am as a person. i'll use the spare time and money to get a masters degree in psychology and travel where i can."

1mhknp,6,2013-09-16,What do you think of my plan?,buddy-bubble,China,https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/1mhknp/what_do_you_think_of_my_plan/,"Hi there,

apologies to all those who are very annoyed of all the posts about guys moving to chinar with no clue or anything, this is another one :)

I have been traveling in china a few times over the past years and somehow came to like it. Currently not an option for like spending the rest of my live here, but I think I certainly would enjoy to spend a year or two.
I started learning mandarin at home and am currently on a very beginner level, enough to advance on my own by talking to people / exposure to the language.
I am 23 years old, working as a software engineer in europe with a few years of experience in my field. Without bragging, I would say that I am pretty good at what I'm doing (c#, all kinds of .net stuff). Although I genuinely love my job, I want more. For me, that means leading people, managing stuff. Also, currently getting certified as a project manager. Via a good friend, I have hooked up with a very reputable chinese software company and am currently doing a short internship in their product management / PR team in china. When I started, I spoke to the departement leader, learned that there is definitely a demand to turn this into a full time job. At the end of the internship, I will meet the supervisors again, ask them for their thoughts and whether they are serious or not. Also will meet the CEO for dinner and plan to ask him for advice.

So basically here's my plan assuming that everything plays out well:

* Finish PM Certification back home and sort things out with my current job.
* Start working in China for this company, hopefully somewhere around project/product management or managing international relations
* Take classes and speak as much mandarin as possible to get at least a little bit intermediate
* See how I like it, look for other (better?) jobs and maintain healthy relations to companies back home for an exit strategy

I think an exit strategy is one of the most important things, currently I have 2 (very vague) ones:

* I hope my former company would employ me again (I think I am doing pretty good work and they are more or less constantly hiring, so could be possible). 
* My closest supervisor back home is right now starting his own business. Already spoke to him, right now he would very much like to hire me in a roughly a year for his development team or possible leading position. We work in the same team and he knows what I am capable of. Right now the best option for me, but of course not a guaranteed thing

Of course I have a few concerns, hence this post:

* I will lose money. Thats a fact. My job at home is very well paid, I expect to earn not even half as much (which by Beijing standards should still be ok)
* I will lose contact to pure coding, focusing more on management/PR/Notsureyet. But then again, that might not be too bad as I feel pure programming itself is a dead end to me
* I would have to break up with my GF of 3 years.
* Chances of employment after I go back home are not guaranteed.
* It will be difficult to establish a new life in this environment. I already have a few friends here, so could expand in those circles. The first months would be rough though.


Anyway, thanks for reading this, I just wanted to lay down my ideas. Hoping someone will provide some feedback, no matter which, any kind is welcome :)

Also how about visa? I read a bit but it all sounds overly strict. As I understood, it basically boils down to the employer to justify his need for a foreign employee. Would language skills itself suffice? I'm under no illusions, every thing I can do regarding software development, there are already 1000s of chinese people who can do better and for half the price. So I think the only option here is *being* a foreigner.

1mhgf7,0,2013-09-16,I[19M] have been with my Gf [18F] for 2 years and I'm not sure if it's best of us to continue our LDR.,C_lupus,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1mhgf7/i19m_have_been_with_my_gf_18f_for_2_years_and_im/,"**History:** High school to college LDR started off fine now a little depressing.

We started dating my senior (her junior) year of high school and got off to an awesome start. We just clicked from the beginning and she really made my senior year what it was. She's my first S/O and I'm her second, they dated early in high school so neither of us have much experience.

We decided to stay together through my freshman year at school which for the first semester was a little tough for her at first but we made it work. 

The second semester wasn't the same I had a much higher workload and she had an internship that kept her pretty busy. Communication broke down when neither of us could make time for one another. When I was home for break it was back to the good old status quo and we spent as much time together as we could till I had to leave.

Now were both in college still several hours apart: she's pledging and I'm taking 19 credit hours with a 6-10 M-F. So again we are having a hard time talking to one another. We can't find a common time for both of us to dedicate too each other. Last semester was awful and I didn't want to stay in that situation if it continued to the next one.


**The problem:** : LDR doesn't work for us I want to see other people.

I'm a bad BF in LDR's, I'm a work-a-holic I dedicate all my time and energy into one thing and don't pay attention to much else. I'm outgoing and meet a lot of people, it's easy for me to get caught up in everything going around me and leave her texts unanswered and calls unnoticed.

But as busy as I am I feel lonely, I hate not having her here with me. Physicality is a huge part of our relationship so it sucks not having that person to just relax and cuddle up with after a long day.

When I meet girls I find myself being a little reserved and holding back, withdrawing so I'm less pressured by temptation. It's human nature to be attracted to people both physically/personality wise regardless of whether or not you're single. I still meet people just fine but I don't like having to hold back especially when I'm out at parties. (That being said I've never cheated on her or danced with other girls at parties, grindings far from innocent.)

It leaves me a little depressed and alone I wish I could be single and experience this post high school dating scene (but not the one night stands or hookups that some partake in every weekend). 

At the end of the day I want to be single, I want to see other people. Not because of anything she's ever done or because I have meet someone I'd rather be with but because I want to know what else is out there. I've changed a lot in the past 2 years I'm the the same guy that I was when we started dating and she's not the same girl.

My spring semester sucked I didn't want to feel like that into my second fall semester but so far I do. She's visited for a weekend so we actually slept in the same bed for once. But as she pulled away I couldn't helped but feel underwhelmed. Seeing her again was awesome we had an awesome time but at the end of the day I was walking back to my dorm alone again.

**Options**

There's three paths this relationship can take:

1. We break up and find other people
2. We stay together and get married
3. We break up then get back together

**Thoughts:**

I don't think I can marry my first girlfriend I've never known anything else and I know I'll always have some doubt whether or not I made the right choice.

I know that she doesn't want to break up, we've talked about it and while I'm unhappy now she'll says she would be ""clinically depressed"" if we broke up now.

She hasn't made friends as easy as I did my freshman year. I think she's still finding where she fits in and who she want's to be. I'm hoping things workout with her new sisters and she'll feel like she fits in at her school. 

But because she doesn't have anyone she can really talk to yet there and I'm her best friend and BF she wouldn't have anyone to go to. I don't think right now is the right time to break up with her but I think it needs to happen this year. Ripping the bandaid off is going to burn for a month or two but it's better than slowly pulling it off over our next year or two at school.

If I didn't love her this would be easy but we've done so much over the past 2 years it's hard to imagine not being with her. I also worry we both love the security of having each other but ultimately won't work. Sometimes I think that I love her but I'm no longer in love with her.

---
I hope all that made sense and wasn't too reminiscent of /r/offmychest content. I'll answer just about any question that you guys have. Thanks for your time!

---

**tl;dr**: Been with my GF for 2 years, the first half was fine, but the distance separating the second half of it isn't easy for me to deal with. I think we'd benefit from being single, she doesn't want to break up."

I made my way over here from a related subreddit, after spending no less than an hour and a half this evening trolling Etsy like a madwoman.  It's a bit like YouTube.  I find myself clicking around in awe, and suddenly time is gone and I don't quite know what's happened.


Anyway, a bit about myself! am twenty-seven years old and currently residing in the Midwestern United States, where I am rapidly closing in on the end of my undergraduate career. In a few months' time I will be receiving a degree in sociology/anthropology, with dual minors in disability studies and English. Eventually I'd like to work for a nongovernmental organization focused on advocacy for people with disabilities or queer youth. I just recently returned stateside after an internship in South Africa, which was just about the most incredible experience of my whole life.  I'm so grateful to have been given the opportunity to go, and hope that I can return one day.


My hobbies include photography, writing, sport shooting, travel, and just about anything to do with the outdoors. I'm a collector of glass paperweights, owls (of the non-living variety), and bad decisions.  Right now the thing that's topping my bucket list is to get my private pilot's license. My father is a pilot and it's been a dream of mine since I was a kid.  My favorite television shows include Ripper Street, NCIS, Sherlock, Firefly, Star Trek: TNG, and House MD.  I've got tattoos a'plenty, and used to have quite a number of piercings until I was forced to retire them through unfortunate circumstance.  I think body adornment is a fascinating subject.  I also think sushi is a comfort food.


Looking forward to getting to know all of you!"

1mh9gd,35,2013-09-15,Opinion on a patient and guidance for a lowly intern,Propofabulous,medicine,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1mh9gd/opinion_on_a_patient_and_guidance_for_a_lowly/,"Hey guys, anesthesia intern here...looking for guidance from my more veteraned colleagues.   I'm in my 3rd month of internship, currently on pediatric inpatient wards and doing my best to adapt to our volume (usually 30 patients/day with 8+ admits and discharges/day).  Each day I gain new respect for the fallibility of my knowledge, but the awareness at least gives me motivation to keep studying.   

The reason I'm posting is I wish to get an opinion from a physician more senior than myself on a case that struck me on an emotional level.  Let me begin by saying I'm not usually an emotional guy.  I've seen my share of horrible cases (rape, sexual abuse, DWI child fatalities, unexpected sudden cardiac death, etc..) and did a month on the palliative care service doing daily family death conferences so I feel I've developed as thick a skin as expected in an intern, but this case got to me (I'll give the outline without any identifiable information). 

This is a prebuscent male who presented in the past to our pedi inpatient service for vision loss.  We get a call at 6pm from a pedi resident pgy2 (btw, is known as a weak resident).   
""hey guys, I got this kid coming up, he's been here like 6 hours...Been seen like 6 times for migraines over the past month.  Nausea/vomiting several times over the past month with 4 day hx of blurry vision with darkening... Oh and a weird eye exam, blown pupils that are not really reactive"" 

At this point,  my upper level freaks out and I hear ""WTF? Call the optho and neuro attendings from home now!  You've been sitting on this kid for 6 hours?  What's wrong with you? I'll be down in 5 minutes.""  I had not heard the HPI at this point, my upper level tells us to handle the floor and runs out.

This kid comes up, and basic HPI as follows...prebuscent boy, Severe headache began a month ago.   Has had intermittent vomiting and blurry vision.  Mom has taken him to be seen a total of 7 times by various ER's and clinics (seen in our ER 2weeks ago)  over the past 30 days and been given a repeat diagnosis of migraines (mom has migraines).   His vision had been worsening, so much so that for a week he has had friends walk him around school by hand as he cannot see.  He presented to our ER with 4 days of agonizing headache, bilateral vision loss, and nausea/vomiting.   

Fast forward to him arriving on the floor.   I escort him up and am met by optho, Neurology, neurosurgery, and Pedi attending.   I do my best to give an adequate presentation (totally nervous with 4 attendings so concerned).   He gets in the room and after I present they huddle and began talking.   After about 15 minutes of questions I go in to check on him.   He's listening to ""The Lion King"" with the remote speaker to his ear, eyes facing the floor (at this point, I realized he can't see the TV screen).  His pupils are so dilated that there is only black (he has blue eyes).  Sweetest kid in the world and looks/acts just like my youngest brother.   He repeatedly thanks me for taking care of him and keeps apologizing that he can't see my face.  He tells me he can't wait to see again because he has sisters he has to take care of.  I smile and speak with the family, explaining our concern.   At this point, all the attendings file in and begin questioning, they get the same HPI as described above.   They do an eye exam, and I've never seen 4 attendings get so pale so quickly.   This previously healthy kid can see nothing bilaterally whatsoever, even with the pen light only a few centimeters from his orbit, and mother states it's been this way 4 days and that he had declining vision before and she was told ""migraines.""  She also states that, to her knowledge, an eye specialist was never contacted.  

We leave the room and I've never seen more livid attendings (thank God it wasn't my fault). The neuroro/optho attending can't believe they weren't contacted 2 weeks ago, in the first ER visit, for nausua/headache/blurry vision to evaluate for ICP.  They are even more pissed that this child sat in the ER for 6 hours and the resident didn't see blown, nonreactive pupils as an emergency.   

Long story short, steroids are initiated and multiple imaging studies are ordered.   A diagnosis of pseudotumor cerebri with optic neuritis is made... But the general consensus from my superiors is that he will suffer irreversible optic nerve damage bilaterally, the extent unknown but with potential blindness.  I spend a lot of time with him/his family and say we're going to do everything we can, but my stomach is sinking the whole time.   I know the prognosis is poor and he'll likely lose the majority of his vision, but I don't know how to say this to the family, so I tell them we'll wait and see. 

I guess my question is, shouldn't this have been caught?  I realize his physical exam and pupil size/reactivity likely has changed over the past 30 days, but wouldn't the vigilant physician have considered an optho/neuro opinion for a case that screams textbook increased ICP?  I guess I'm having trouble accepting that several hospitals told this mom it was only migraines and it would pass, when it was getting worse and treatment could have been initiated earlier.   Or, am I just totally over analyzing this and letting my inexperience show?  For some reason or another, this patient hit me in a soft spot.  I've been revisiting this case several times in my mind and I'm just looking for advice, maybe for my own emotional reconciliation and as a clinical pearl to take forward."
1mh84b,4,2013-09-15,Chugging.,Sal_the_man,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mh84b/chugging/,"Just need to type this out:

It's been a long road to be whom I've wanted to be. I'm nearly there, but I've fallen into a ditch...these are the reasons why

1) **I've been a terrible person lately**

I'm always arguing with my parents about petty issues. It will start with a small thing such as cleaning my room and turn into a whole 1 hour exchange on the problems we have with each other. I love them, but I feel empty saying that I sometimes find solace being away from them. I felt even more torn when family members threw a surprise aniversary party for my parents and I was away at school.

I've also been trying to improve my ignorant, stubborn, and sometimes domineering character. There have been some bad relationships in the past, and amending them has been an embarrassing and slow process for me. I'm actually a very nice person and make friends with everyone easily, but trying to expunge my bad traits has been a journey

I am trying to change, it's just I feel that there is always a war going on in my heart and mind.

2) **Peak time in college**

I'm currently a third year pre-med student and really have to improve my current academic statistics to further my chances of getting into medical school. However, I have also thought about picking up a second major of Public Health so in case Med School doesn't work out I can go directly into a job field I like. Parents have somewhat shot it down since they know how tough the field is right now, but two of my friends who graduated with the PH major have attained great success. 

So improving my grades, paired with considering the extra workload of another major, and thinking about where I am going to go in life in two years is a huge thought in mind.

3) **My car dreams have fallen apart, for now at least**

I am a avid car enthusiast and ever since childhood I always had this dream of working tediously to buy a car completely on my own. I am fortunate enough to be coming from a stable family, and I was always grateful for what my parents treated me with, but I wanted to do this on my own to prove to myself that I'm a man.

And after 4 months of 15 hours a week in college, and 40 hours a week at an internship over the summer, I finally bought a true sports car, a 1991 Toyota MR2! I was extremely happy the moment I bought it, and felt so proud, **not prideful**, that I was granted the opportunities to attain this luxury. Life was good, until 3 days after I bought it and it broke down.

It's been in limp mode for a month, and I've thrown in more money than I expected. As a result my funds have depreciated and I am not in a situation to pay as much for my tuition as I wanted to (because I wanted to prove to my parents that I can be financially responsible of my life too). 

Although the money factor does come into play, my parents have constantly reminded me what a bad investment I made. I'm good with the wrench, and I am willing to do my work no problem, but my rents have always dissuaded my car passion as they tell me I'm wasting time &amp; money instead of working in school and for my future.

All my friends have supported me though...I could care less if it was a hybrid civic. To put so much physical &amp; mental effort at my internship &amp; work to fulfill my dreams, and then have it burn down in front of me has been such a huge mental blow. 

But that being said, I remind myself that I've had car problems before and that ultimately **this thing can be fixed**. I just have to be patient for the funds and shift my priorities. 







**Where am I now?**

I currently feel that I am barely held together by expired glue, but by some miracle I am holding up against a brisk breeze. Broken, yet still holding on...

 I knew that I would face hardship in trying to be financially responsible **but that's what I expected and wanted** because eventually I am going to have to face the world for myself. It's very intimidating, yet a good learning experience. Ultimately, I just want to show my parents that I'm a man now, and I want to make them proud.

Minute by minute, hour by hour, and day by day I am improving myself then improving my situation. If I can do this now, by myself, I can do anything in the future. 

That's all I wanted to share. 

Thank you for reading this."

1mh79o,0,2013-09-15,"OkC can suck, but I met her. Now that I don't need them, here are my tips for getting the most out of OkCupid",TipsForTits,OkCupid,https://www.reddit.com/r/OkCupid/comments/1mh79o/okc_can_suck_but_i_met_her_now_that_i_dont_need/,"Throwaway, I'd rather not have my primary account connected to online dating.  Sue me.

Over the years I've spend a fair amount of time on online dating (and OkC specifically).  I'll cut to the chase.  Some things work, some don't.  Take my advice, or don't.  Comment with your opinions, or don't.  But here are some things that have consistently worked for me, because OkC can suck for guys and I want you to be successful in finding someone to connect with.

**PROFILE**

* Don't be self-deprecating.  It's good to be self-deprecating in person, but only as a way to counterbalance a subtle brag.  Too many people do the former without the latter.  In profiles, it just comes off as insecure.
* Don't be cliche.  The words ""laid-back,"" ""down-to-earth"" should not appear in your profile.  If you think something might be cliche, it is.
* Don't be weird, obscure, or super in-depth.  If a girl is reading your profile, it's because she looked at your pics and found you sufficiently non-objectionable to not reject immediately.  In your profile, she's looking for reasons to reject you.  Girls have TONS of choice online, and will pass over guys they wouldn't in person for very minor perceived faults.  Your main job in your profile is to appear like a normal, funny person who has friends.  Your personality can come out in messages once you're chatting.

**MESSAGES**

* I had much better success messaging women who were currently online.  If you message a woman when she's not online, you'll be one of ten messages in her inbox when she logs in.  If you message her when she's online, you'll have her undivided attention, at least for a second.  Admit it, you love it when that little ""You have a message"" window pops up.  
* If you see a girl you like who's not online, add her to your favorites (she can't see this) and message her the next time she's online when you are.  This is also good for avoiding wasting time on inactive people.
* Messages should be two paragraphs, 3-4 lines each.  Shorter reeks of copypaste, longer reeks of desperation.  First paragraph is a playful joke/tease about something in her profile (not looks), preferably not something everyone else is commenting on.  Second paragraph is telling her that her profile wasn't half bad, and you won't bore both of you by listing all the things you have in common, yada yada yada.
* Honestly, who knows.  Messaging always feels like a crapshoot.
* Don't fall in love with profiles.  They're not real.
* Don't be afraid to send a second email if she doesn't respond to the first.  Something funny, like ""You need to fire the intern who's screening these things, she's clearly underqualified.""  But three is probably too much.

**DATE**

* Get her number after she's sent you three messages.  Earlier seems desperate, later is wasting time.  Don't forget, OkC is nothing more than pre-screening for a blind date.  You're not on there for pen pals.
* Don't ask for her number, tell her to give it you in the context of hanging out (i.e. ""You crack me up, we gotta hang out, I'm busy this week but give me your number and we can hash something out for next week over text."")  In my experience, if a girl has replied three times, it's very rare to not get a number with this.
* Text her within a day of getting her number, but not within a few hours.  This is OkC, she gets a lot of texts, wait longer and she'll forget you.
* For the first date, tell her to meet you at your place, and that you'll go out from there, there are a lot of cool places nearby.  When she gets there, give her a friendly hug, tell her you're almost ready and to come on up.  Have her sit on the couch, offer her a glass of water, then pretend to fuss around in the bathroom with the door open for like 30 seconds to a minute, then head out on the date.  Why?  If she's coming to meet you and waiting for you to be ready, it's subconsiously telling her that she's making effort for you, which must mean she likes you, right?  It sounds juvenile, but it works.  Also, once she's been inside your place and sees that it's clean (it should be clean) and normal, she'll be a lot more comfortable with the idea of coming up at the end of the date.  I'm not advocating being a sleaze, but if you're on a date with this girl, you'll want her to be coming up to your place at some point.
* Figure out a first date that works and do it over and over and over until you're really good at it and can do it on autopilot.  Not dinner.  Something fun.  Like pool.  Or whatever.  You need to be focusing on her reactions to you, not on the date logistics."

1mh5yo,3,2013-09-15,Girlfriend interning in DC as I remain in NY,[deleted],LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1mh5yo/girlfriend_interning_in_dc_as_i_remain_in_ny/,"Hello LD community. I am in desperate need of help. My girlfriend and are are pretty serious and everything was great when we were together. All we have to do is make it to December, then we won't have to be apart again. She had a bit of a rough past with drinking liquor and we had a rough start to the relationship (was with two other guys two separate nights). I didn't really take it to heart TOO much because we weren't technically ""together"" or even had talked about establishing a relationship. I've been cheated on in past relationships and I've cheated once as well, too. My problem is I dwell too much on those memories to where it becomes a problem. She is now in DC and we do fine during the week, but when it comes to the weekend and going out to the bars (she stopped drinking liquor) , it goes into a complete 360. I get way to controlling, to an obsessive state. There is a group of guys that live the floor above her and her roommates that are apart of the same internship program. They know she has a boyfriend, but numbers were exchanged quite quickly of meeting and they are constantly asking her and her roommates to come over to their place for dinner, parties, hanging out, etc. I've been a single adult before, and maybe I'm just a bad person, but when a girl says she has a boyfriend, but he wasn't in the picture, I still wanted to pursue. So I just assume the worst of their intentions and even though I claim to trust her, I assume the worst of her too, because I'm still sickened by the venom of the past in our relationship (being lied to about the guys she was with). So I start to get very controlling of how long she goes to their apartment for, not to drink when she is there, etc. when she goes out to eat after one of the programs classes or goes to an event, that are aside from the internship. I'm constantly nagging her if she is sitting next to any of those guys, who she's with, if she's drinking, etc. I ask her if they have been texting her at all, what they say...I believe her, but I don't? It has been an emotional roller coaster for us. We care so deeply about each other but I am ruining her experience there by being like this. She gets so stressed on the weekends and feels isolated from the other interns because of my wishes. I realize I am being SO selfish in the comfort of knowing she isn't out drinking around other guys, or at the guys apartment upstairs, at the cost of her being depressed in her room. The ball buster was her saying how she agreed to go to a ""black light"" party at the guys apartment upstairs and how a lot of girls from the program were going. I was thinking to myself, ""a dark lit party in white t shirts with guys trying to touch you and write all over you with markers? FUCK THAT!"" I said there was no way I could  handle that kind of anxiety that comes with knowing she was at a party like that. I can swallow my tongue and deal with bars, but that I just couldn't handle. she agreed not to go and was going to just head into DC (she lives outside of DC) and keep busy because she didn't want her roommates to be like ""why are you not coming"" as she sat in her room all night. She ended up not going anywhere and said that we roommates (she has two) were staying in as well. Then she told me one of her roommates decided to go because it wasn't a black light party anymore, but she was remaining home to calm my nerves. I called her when I had down time at work around 9 something pm (work nights as a chef). She answered the phone after a few rings and I just kind of felt like something was up, but didn't think after all we've been through, she would lie. she talked to me for a few minutes and said she couldn't wait to skype after I got home from work. It turns out she went with her roommate to the party, exited the room when I called so I would not hear, and re entered after we got off the phone. She assures me she only had 1 beer there, which is understandable because I got home soon after to skype. I just felt so betrayed though that she lied to me like that. Long story short (not really, haha) I just need some advice to get through the rest of this year. I love this girl to death and she feels the same way towards me. It is not like this AT ALL when we are together. I can't go on living like this though, and neither can she. I am asking for any kind of help possible, I appreciate anyone's time who reads my long, drawn out story. "
1mh5r3,1,2013-09-15,"How to ask for a much-deserved raise? I'm shy and have difficulty being forward about things like these, so any help will be much appreciated.",[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1mh5r3/how_to_ask_for_a_muchdeserved_raise_im_shy_and/,"I know this question's been asked many, many times before, but I thought it wouldn't hurt to post my case. Please bear with me, this can get a little whiny.

I work for a wholesale apparel company as a production assistant. Initially my manager was handling everything himself, realized that he needed an assistant, and that's where I came in--when I started to learn the ropes, he began to push his responsibilities on me and I was expected to do some of his work in addition to my own (he claims that it was to ""make me stronger"" and give me experience). Later another manager was hired, which made things better, kind of, but I still have a lot on my plate. I kept my mouth shut because I thought I'd be rewarded in due time. But during the past couple of months I've been stressed out of my mind, and my body is showing it--hair falling out, skin problems, packed on some extra pounds, etc.

Initially I got this job through a friend, who told me that I would be making $500 a week, which was a lot better than what I was making as a part-timer. Art history majors aren't exactly marketable... so I was grateful for whatever I got. Once I go in for an interview, the owner tells me I'll be given $400. And I accepted instead of fighting, because I'm dumb and naive and really needed a job (and thought I'd be denied the position if I said otherwise).

I've gotten two ""raises"" since then and I've been working there for almost six months--finally got to the amount I was originally told I would receive ($500 weekly) but after doing calculations I realized I'm making $10/hour. No benefits, and federal/state taxes aren't taken out. It was only recently that I started getting paid overtime (er, twice), and even then the higher-ups were hesitant to pay me even though I'm working AT LEAST ten hours daily with barely any break time (they provide lunch, but since I work in a high-paced atmosphere I get maybe five minutes in between hours to check my phone, my personal e-mail, etc.).

My friend usually got raises with me since we started working around the same time... but recently the owner told him that we'd both be getting raises. That was two weeks ago, and my friend is shocked that I still haven't gotten one (the owner told him not to tell me, so he didn't bring up the subject until recently). My friend decides to casually ask whether my salary has been increased along with his, so as to not tread on toes--and the owner denies ever saying that I would get a raise. 

My friend is much younger than me, and decided to work instead of going to college. I am a college graduate with internships and job experience under my belt (not that my resume is relevant to my current work, but still). He works in sales, directly under the owners. I work in a different department, and since my first manager quit I'm preparing for the amount of work he's left behind until someone new comes in to take his place (they're also hesitant about hiring someone new, though, even though the owners each bought million-dollar homes for themselves). I come to work on time and leave late. My friend works hard, but he's a little less punctual, and takes breaks accordingly. Sometimes it gets to a point where he has nothing to do, and helps me out a bit with MY work because I have so much shit to do.

Now, I know it would be better to find a new job, but I'm kind of trapped--I have to pay rent, student loans, eat--and since my costs are greater than my income, I have a credit card bill that's bigger than my savings and checking account combined. I'd have less than a month to find a new position, but I'm scared that the job market will be just as scarce as it was before I entered this terrible company.

So, Redditors... how to ask for a raise? I'm very hardworking but not the most aggressive person. I don't hate my job, and I actually like the people I work with (I hate the bosses, though). The only reason why I've decided to do this is because I realized that there is absolutely NO ONE who will stand up and do the job for me. I'm sick of not being able to pay bills and having my youth sucked out of me... I'm only 23, but I'm tired and exhausted and depressed all the time.

I'm reluctant to throw my manager under the bus (about how he pushed his tasks onto me earlier on), even though I really want to, and bring my co-worker/friend into the equation. He says I should do whatever it takes to get what I deserve, but...  conscience. Also, I don't want to hurt his reputation. Should I wait and see if they'll realize my worth, or should I address this problem ASAP?

Please help. And sorry for the deluge of text.

TL;DR My company treats me like crap (AKA like an unpaid intern), but I don't know what to do about it."

The Internship is a throwback to the days of The Wedding Crashers and Old School, with Vince Vaugh and Owen Wilson playing essentially the same goofy characters as talkative underdogs with chemistry, charm and charisma. However the setting is different, instead now they're laid off sales people working at a competitive internship at Google for a spot at their future. The movie also doubles as an almost 2 hour long commercial for Google.

I hate to admit but I found the movie funny, even though the plotline was ridiculously predictable and formulaic. Sometimes that's just what the audience needs, a no brainer comedy. The laughs were typical, awkward sexual encounters/phrasing, humorous incompetence, scumbag entitled villain gets hit in the balls etc. Nevertheless if you are a fan of Vaugh or Wilson's comedic work, its worth one watch.

I've always had VERY low self confidence and thus I haven't applied to any big names in Silicon Valley. It is my dream, however. I usually program the following languages: (C, C++, PHP, C#, Java, JS, Python, Ruby) and I'm learning Clojure in my spare time. My github is mostly filled with little AI toy projects from my undergrad work.

I got out of college and decided to work at a small start-up as a web developer. Because our prototype was in PHP, we've done the whole project in PHP. I'm afraid that if I continue working for this company, I won't be able to get a job at one of my ""dream"" companies (Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Facebook)

My question is, if I have a year of professional PHP experience, 2 internships, a research assistantship and a B.S. in CS, will I still be able to get into one of these big tech companies or have I ""missed the boat""? 

If I HAVE missed the boat, should I go back to school and get a master's degree? I really love machine learning and would love to study it for 2 years. I feel like going back to school might ""reset"" my marketability to these large companies. Is this a good course of action?"

So, I'm currently in the fall semester of my senior year of undergrad at a small state school of no particular merit, majoring in philosophy and up until now I had planned towards law school. But at this point in the game, I honestly don't think I'm prepared for it yet, nor am I in any good condition to apply and hope to get accepted to any law programs. 

So lately I've been toying with applying for a Master's in philosophy, at least for a year, until I can get my bearings and really apply myself for the LSAT and be confident in getting accepted to law school. This is because I don't want to take a year off school and want to continue my education. 

But I was recently going through some university websites and noticed that many of them that I would've loved to attend allow transfers for the coming spring term. Now, I know I'm a senior, and only have 1 more term left to finish if I stay at my school, but here's the thing; not only do I feel like it'd be cheaper to transfer and have to make up a term or two of non-transferrable undergrad credits, but I would also like to experience a college life that I never got to have both because of financial problem, family problems, and just being out of the loop when I first started college. The school I really want to transfer to is fairly cheap (Temple) and I don't have any loans to my name yet. I'm fairly certain I'd qualify for some aid because I have a stellar GPA and SAT scores. 

Basically, I want your opinions on whether I should just transfer now and make up a year and save a little money overall PLUS have a sure chance of getting in and continuing my education, or should I apply to a master's program for next year and pay much more and possibly not even get in (because GRE's and basically no extra-curricular or internship stuff to my name)? 

Taking a year off from school isn't even an option and I'm not gonna consider it, and I'm just not ready for law school yet; however, whatever course i decide to take, law school is my next step for sure, just not now. I want more time in undergrad and I want to an experience that I missed out on while continuing my education in a field that I love. Thank you for your help and for being respectful, guys. "

I am learning to program real application that have some sort of real functionality with APIs and such.

Is this worth my time or should I focus more on game development? I know that I have a lot of opportunities while at a top research university that I won't have after I graduate. Should I study programming more broadly or focus intensely on game development? I want to get into game development but I am not sure how practical it is, with the same effort I could potentially get into another company and get really good at programming and then move to game development from there.

Education: Have my M.A in Mental Health Counseling (2011) and BA in Psychology (2007).

Work experience: 8 years working in group homes. 1 year of an internship in an outpatient clinic. 5 months exp working with domestic violence perpetrators (hated it), 1 year exp working with kids with a variety of disabilities in different capacities (some in school, some @ home), and 7 months (and counting) as a behavior specialist for adults w/ disabilities (part time job).

I moved across the country to get a new start. I picked up a group home gig with a mental health agency, with the intent of transferring into an outpatient clinic. Except I got canned at the 6 month mark (manager didn't like me and looked for any reason to fire me). I'm currently working p/t as a behavioral specialist, but that only gets me 10-12hours a week, with no hope of making FT there.  

Job prospects aren't looking that wonderful out here (I'm on East coast, and I moved from Pacific NW), and I had the same problem out in PNW.  Even with a counseling job (if I ever land one) starting salary tends to be 32k ish, if I'm lucky. Right now I'm doing some pizza delivery driving on the side to make ends almost meet, and an interview Tuesday for a 28k/year position.  

Honestly, this is killing me.  

I'm trying to figure out if I want to stay in this field. I want to be able to help people and make a difference, but I also want to be financially stable.  

I thought about re-training as a Speech Therapist or an Occupational Therapist, but that's 3+ years of school + more debt that I'm very hesitant on taking (current student loan debt is 70k...yes, I know). Thought about doing a 2 year allied health tech program (like respiratory tech or similar) but the field doesn't look to be doing too hot.  

So, I come to you guys.  How fucked am I? "

He has gone to teach over seas for a year and by this time he has only been gone a month. We are both saving money so we can move out next year when he moves back home and start our lives together. We still text each other all the time and we try to video chat at least once a day, but it seems lately that we are fighting constantly. My life has been very stressful this past week. I am a full time university student, working 4 days a week, my cat unexpectedly passed away, and I already am very stressed out about school (had 3 assignments due the first week! Not to mention PMS on top of everything). I've been rather on edge emotionally this passed week and without him here to support me its been very difficult. We have normally get past our fight before we stopped talking for the day, but today was a little different... He is making me feel like I can't even talk about the things that are making me upset (not relationship related) because I start crying due to the stress of everything. My crying intern makes him angry and I don't understand why. Our last issue before today's issue was 2 days ago. He went out exploring in his new city and he took some immature video about a girl with a hot dog and making inappropriate sounds (if you know what i mean), and thought it was funny so he posted it on fb. I was so embarrassed and hurt that he did that because I felt very disrespected by it. We got over that though, after a couple hours he finally understood and fixed the situation. Today's problem started when I hadn't heard from him since 7pm (his time) and it was almost 5am (his time) when I heard back from him. He was hanging out with people he had never met before, which i'm happy that he is going out and making friends but of course I was getting worried. When he finally contacted me we went on video chat right away and at this point I was not upset I was just letting him know it would have been nice if I was warned first because i've been very stressed lately and its just adding to the pressure. He didn't know he was going to be out that late and wasn't able to let me know because he didn't have a phone. Shit happens and I get that so I wasn't upset about that. But overwhelmed me starts crying again and then he gets mad at me. He wouldn't tell me what was bothering him, he just kept saying he was done with the conversation. I know he was tired too but it doesn't help when he won't even communicate to me what I did wrong. I don't want to feel stressed like this and I don't want to get upset about everything but with all the stress going on its been really hard on me. When we are together we rarely fight, maybe once every 3-4 months. This fighting is putting a huge strain on our relationship and since I wont see him in person for another 3 months i'm getting really worried about our relationship. I love him so much and I don't know what I would do without him. If anyone has advice on how we can fix this that would be great! Neither of us have had to do long distance before."

I'm a junior with little internship experience (3 months in business development). I went to a career fair at my school last week and dropped off my resume with a bunch of people. Most were looking for spring or summer interns but one called me back for an interview, which I had yesterday. I haven't gotten the offer yet but they called me back today and it looks like I probably will. I also just started applying for internships this weekend but haven't heard back from anyone.

They explained that I'll be working for a team of five people who work for an old guy who trades for himself. I'll have to summarize news articles, call/write letters to brokers for quotes and indications, run a P/L program and Quicken, create spreadsheets, and do other trivial things. The ""company"" looks like a very small business and doesn't come up on Google. This is a paid internship. As I'm a junior now, I'd like to get an internship that will actually teach me things and hopefully make me look good for SA recruiting.

So do you think I should take this internship or wait to see if I can get other offers?"

I left that internship after this last season since it was unpaid, despite still having a handful of undergrad courses to finish. I then applied for a paid internship with another team (Team 2). I got an interview with Team 2. Then a few days later, I saw a full-time position with Team 1 that was perfect for what I wanted to do. I applied and was called in for an interview. I was just informed that I got the internship with Team 2, but my interviewer at Team 1 said they won't be making a decision until next week, which is when Team 2 wants me to come to orientation. 

I obviously want to work full time over another internship, but I don't want to screw myself over by turning down the internship and then not getting the job. Basically, I have no idea what to do! I know a lot of people at Team 1 that I could contact, but I don't want to do that if it's considered inappropriate, since they specifically said they wouldn't be making a decision until next week. I also don't want to put Team 2 in a bad position by telling them I'll work for them and then quitting a few days into it if I happen to get the job with Team 1. Is it awful of me to go ahead with starting the internship with Team 2 knowing I may be leaving them very, very soon for Team 1?

This is really confusing so I hope someone is able to understand and help me out with some advice on what to do in this situation!"

I'll be doing a summer internship from early June to mid-August in the Financial District. As an East Coaster who's been to SF once at the age of 8, I don't really know where to start with regards to looking for housing. This past summer I interned in NYC and arranged for housing on my own through Craigslist and it worked out just fine, but I was already familiar with NYC and knew more or less what I should be looking for and at what rates.

So I'd really appreciate any guidance you guys could give me at all here. I know this is super early since I won't be there until early June, but I'd like to be as prepared/knowledgeable as possible, and would also like to arrange for housing as soon as possible.

* I want to minimize my commute -- walking distance to the office (in the Bank of America building) would be ideal. I will not have a car.
* I paid ~$1400/month, including utilities, this past summer in the Financial District in NYC. I'd like to spend roughly the same if possible, but could go higher. I don't need a super-nice place, but it does have to be clean/comfortable.
* I'm perfectly fine with having one or two roommates.
* I will have very long hours, and so would like to be somewhere that doesn't constantly have loud parties/street noise that might disrupt my sleep.

Considering all that, 

1. What neighborhoods/districts should I be focusing on?

2. What is a reasonable range of rent?

3. Is Craigslist the best search method?

4. How early should I start seriously searching / how early can I possibly expect to have things settled/arranged?

5. Anything I should be cautious of; things to look for; important factors I'm leaving out? Anything at all, really.

Apologies for the long post, but I really would appreciate any guidance you guys could provide. Thanks in advance!"

my girlfriend (unfortunately not yet a redditor) is looking for an apartment/room while she's doing an research internship from Oct 2013 until Jan 31st 2014 at LBL and thus far despite writing countless emails she hasn't had much luck. Do you have any tips for a german student where to look for rooms/apartments besides craigslist and what to pay attention to when applying? Any help is much appreciated!"

[If you were still Show runner of Dexter, how would YOU have ended his story?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca6hew?context=5)|It's so frustrating because the show ends this sunday and if i tell you my ending, then you'll know that's not what's going to happen. i'll check this site on monday and tell you my ending.  okay by you?
[I guess I have one more question, if that's ok. Of the four seasons under your direction, which was your personal favorite?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca6kr8?context=5)|By far it was the fourth season, the trinity killer year.  the writing room and the directors had all been with me since the start and we were really firing on all cylinders by then.
 |No contest.  season 4.  trinity/lithgow.
[Why is season 8 of dexter carp?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca5tv1?context=5)|Couple of reasons.  they broke the code with the audience.  it's so important to keep the rules in place when doing a show like that. also... i'm not there anymore!
[Hey Clyde! I was wondering what you thought about the Dexter/Hannah love story that has seemed to become the main focus of the show. Do you like it? Dislike it? Does it seem forced?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca6i6y?context=5)|Gotta say, it feels a bit forced to me.  i know what they're going for.  not sure it works as well as it could have.
[I just finished season 3 and I keep telling my buddies how Dexter would slice up heisenburg so quick, but I am about to get into Season 4 which people just nut their pants about... really disappointed I know all the big suprises going forward but you guys put together one hell of a show!!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca79qy?context=5)|Even though you know the big reveals, the show is still amazing. you'll love it. 
[I read somewhere that John Lithgow was told the whole Trinity arc before  he was even hired in order to get him to agree to the part. Had Lithgow turned down the part, do you think you would have recast the part of Trinity or would you have rewritten the Season 4 plot completely?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca6tgl?context=5)|I personally pitched the whole trinity story arc to john lithgow in a conference room at his agent's office.  i talked for an hour.  no notes. when i finished, he stood up dramatically (as he does) and said 'i'll do it!' i said he had some conflicts in timing.  he said 'forget that stuff. i'm in!' that's how it happened.
[Hey, next time you run into Scott Buck, could you do this for us?: Link to imgur.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/ccacuhk?context=5)|I'm so not engaging on this one!
[One thing on the minds of a lot of Dexter fans is how low the quality of the show dipped when you stepped down as show runner.  With many particularly viewing seasons 6 and 8 as particularly atrocious, Since you were so invested in the first half of the show, what is your opinion on the direction the show has taken, and if you were show runner again what would your vision have been for post-season 4 Dexter?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca5zed?context=5)|I agree the show has slipped.  i had a great idea for the end of dexter that i never got to pitch.  too much to go into now.  also, you have to see the final episode before i can comment on it.
[Doakes was a great character and was truly missed on the show..Was there ever any talk about keeping him around and how hard was it to kill him off?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca75u5?context=5)|Doakes, played by erik king, was a terrific character and a truly great guy. just saw him at comicon in august.  it was a tough decision to kill him off.  but this is the big leagues; and we wanted the audience to know we meant business.  it's a tough world out there and there are casualties. james doakes was a casualty of the fact that he was on to dexter and had to be dealt with.
[Any regret not saving the Bay Harbor Butcher FBI pursuit for later in the series?  It would undoubtedly have been a significantly better way for this series to go out...you know, with actual tension.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/ccacb3u?context=5)|No regrets.  you always have to tell your best story as soon as you can and not save anything.  you just have to trust that you'll come up with something better down the line.
[As a film major I will take that as a lesson thank you.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/ccaf38k?context=5)|Well, i disagree with my friend vince.  i'm all for getting the best stuff out there quickly, then just doing better and better.
[If you know how Buck and crew end Dexter... could you at least tell us if it is an ending you are satisfied with for a character you brought to life so well?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca6j44?context=5)|The ending that buck and crew came up with is satisfying to me and i think will be satisfying to the viewer as well.  it's pretty powerful.
[What's your opinion - compared with season 1-4 - on the evolution of Debra's character and the confusing and complicated relationship she has with his brother Dexter? (Sorry if there are spelling mistakes, English is not my native language\) Thank you anyway.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca8buz?context=5)|I think that the whole debra storyline was inevitable.  the writers just couldn't keep her in the dark any longer. that said, i wasn't thrilled with her whole downward spiral into near insanity.  but it's all about choices and those were the choices they made.  but the way, your english is perfect.
[Love Dexter. Which was your favorite episode?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca744a?context=5)|I have two favorite episodes:  the trinity thanksgiving episode. and the final episode where dexter kills trinity and comes home to that horrific discovery.
[Do you think Quinn is kind of a one dimensional character?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/ccabsol?context=5)|Sadly, i kind of agree.
[But his character has so much to do!  Like this season. He didn't want to become sergeant.  Then Angel convinced him to try to be sergeant. Then he tried to become sergeant.  Then the black woman who's only job on the show was to become sergeant over Quinn became sergeant over Quinn. Then she or the subplot completely disappeared and were never heard from again.  You call that one dimensional? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/ccapmw4?context=5)|Appreciate the irony.
[How would you have solved this problem? To me it feels that something has gone wrong with the way this character was used, especially in season 6-7. Now they seem to be flashing him out, giving him redeeming qualities but it feels a bit late. Doing this earlier would he have become a more satisfying character? Using him to his function (teased in S5\) would have made a change? And one more question: Did you have any idea or goal of what to achieve in the future with this character when he first appeared in season 3? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/ccafuap?context=5)|I created the quinn character.  originally he was going to be a new foil for dexter, after drakes.  and a love interest for deb.  part of it worked.  part didn't.  again, it's not bricklaying.  it's always a moving target.
[What the hell happened? Do they even care about good story anymore, or just putting out the first thing that comes to their heads?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca5yow?context=5)|If you're asking about dexter, the mix in the writing room changed significantly.  it's still a really hard job to put out a good tv show.
[I guess, but I mean, that treadmill scene? Come on.  Edit: But otherwise, props to your input for the first four seasons, they were fantastic :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca652u?context=5)|Thanks so much.  didn't really know we had such a hit on our hands. it all kind of blew up in a really great way.  right show for the right time i guess.
[Would you say antiheroes have become more prevalent on TV and if so why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca5vyu?context=5)|Yes antiheroes are definitely more prevalent on tv.  not just dexter, breaking bad, tony soprano, mad men.  characters with deep flaws are more interesting to watch, to write... and are more like us.
[Can you comment on why you, Daniel Cerone, and Melissa Rosenberg all left Dexter when you did (I think Daniel left after season 2\)?  How much creative control did you have over Dexter? How much creative control did Showtime have?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca9iub?context=5)|Daniel left after season 2 because he had an offer to run a show on cbs. melissa left because she had written ALL of the 'twilight' movies and it was time for her to move on. i left because i was shooting and living in l.a. and my family was in the east.  it was time to be with my wife and daughter. i had significant creative control on dexter.  but i also had partners and showtime.  as i said below:  best idea wins.  not about ego.  about results.
[Hello Clyde! I'm a huge fan of Dexter. Season 4 is one of the most entertaining and devastating collection of episodes in the history of television, and I believe that it was a huge part of forming what people are now calling ""the golden age of television."" So thank you so much for your influence!  My question is, as I'm sure many would like to know, if you were still the show runner for the final season of Dexter, how would it be different from the actual final season? Would it be the same? And if you could safely answer this, how would your version of Dexter end?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca63e7?context=5)|Thanks so much for the kind words.  i agree about the fourth season. actually, the writers guild and variety magazine came up with a list of the 101 best written tv shows OF ALL TIME and dexter was on the list. can't comment on the last episode just yet as it's airing this sunday.
[I saw you comment on the very end of Dexter. Could you please set our minds at ease and let us know that none of the ""leaks"" are legit?  Did you ever do controlled leaks to throw fans off?  How the hell did you keep Rita's death a secret from everyone else on the show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca6ypm?context=5)|Not sure what the leaks are that are out there. never did controlled leaks.  i respect the fans too much. as for rita's death.  i wrote a false ending for the crew and cast, so it wouldn't be leaked.  the real ending only was in my computer until we were ready to shoot.  the network and others had to actually come to my office and read it on my monitor.
[Well, one states Quinn becomes the new Dexter, one states Matthews has known everything all along, kills Dexter, and raises Harrison and Harrsion sees a ghost Dexter at the end, and one states that for reasons as of yet unknown, Dexter kills  Deb.  Did  you actually shoot the false ending or was it enough that it was written in the script?  Would you ever consider doing a screen play for a movie, or is it just too hard to tell your amazing stories in such a limited time?  Thank you so much for the responses!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca75ds?context=5)|Can't comment on the leaks.  but they're basically bs. we never shot the false ending. i've done several screenplays.  mostly uncredited production rewrites on scripts before they start shooting.  talking with my agent now about the screen version of 'unthinkable'. thanks so much.
[Now you have left me with a tough decision, lol. Read *Unthinkable* or hold out for the movie and go in blind...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca7jme?context=5)|Definitely read unthinkable.  the movie is years away and i wouldn't want to deprive you of the pleasure of reading a great book!
[Done. Will pick it up tonight after work. Can't wait.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca7nqd?context=5)|Thanks so much.  if your store doesn't have it. you can always get it from amazon.
[When the current writers state that they have had the end for Dexter ""in mind"" since the beginning, Is that an end thought up by the writers at the start and followed by current writers? Or what does that mean exactly? Was there an outline of the story arc from the beginning at all, but of course could be stretched or shortened due to not knowing the amount of seasons?(to your knowledge of course\) ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca7iqq?context=5)|When we started the show, we didn't know how it was going to end. when i left after four years, we still didn't know how it was going to end. so there was no outline or arc that charted the course they're taking now.
[I hope you're still answering questions. Thanks for your work on Dexter. Seasons 1-4 are my favorite ever seasons of TV.  Wikipedia says you joined Dexter mid-way through season 1. Is this correct? You wrote episode 2 'Crocodile', so I couldn't understand how that could be true. I thought you were writer and showrunner for the entire first season except for the pilot.  Did you enjoy working on Dexter? I assume it was exhausting, so is that why you left?  What work did you do as a 'consultant' on Dexter? How involved have you been with the show since you took that role? Did you only have this role for season 5, or do you still have that job?  Daniel Cerone was credited as the second-top writer on the show, after yourself, for seasons 1-3, but did he actually work on season 3 (the Prado season\)? I ask because there were reports that he left the show after season 2, and he didn't write any episodes that season.  Does John Goldwyn still work on the show? He's still credited as Executive Producer along with Colleton, but since season 6 we haven't seen him do any interviews or Comic-Con panels, while Colleton still does.  Was Lundy ever actually suspicious of Dexter, or was that just Dexter/us being paranoid?  When you made the decision to kill Rita off, did you have future seasons in mind? Were you trying to envision storylines for future seasons, and believed that Dexter would be better off on his own again? Or, was killing Rita about making the best and most dramatic season 4 you possibly could?  While writing season 4, did you know that it would be your last season on the show? If not, did you have any vague plans for what would happen in season 5?  Thanks again for one of the best TV series ever.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/ccaaxee?context=5)|Okay, that's a lot of questions. i'll answer a few. wikipedia is wrong.  i was showrunner on all episodes of the first four seasons.  i love working on the show.  yeah, it was exhausting.  but it was an amazing ride.  cerone did not work on 3.  goldwyn was involved til the end.  the thing about killing rita was showing to dexter that what he does, what he can't help doing, has consequences.  and that he can never really have a normal life.  i knew near the very end of 4 that i was leaving for sure.
[If you were still showrunner of Dexter, what other themes would you have explored?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca871p?context=5)|I would want to go deeper on dexter discovering his own humanity.  or realizing that he'll never be fully humanized; and what's the psychological cost of that?
[What do you do in a ""writer's block""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca63ft?context=5)|Because i have to keep writing to make a living, i'm blessed with not having writers block. i know now that often not writing is part of writing and i just go with it.
[ also what are the greatest difference between a good idea for a script and for a book? I'm not talking about writing, that part is obviously very distinct, but the ""raw story"" itself. Like what would make a story ""good for a show"" but not for a book and the other way around?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca63ft?context=5)|As for difference in ideas for book or series:  a series has to have what we call 'legs'. how can it sustain audience interest for many years. a book, even 'unthinkable' is often conceived for the reader to enjoy in one sitting.
[What kind of research did you guys do for the Dexter character? I was a social worker and have some experience with very disturbed sociopaths, and you got his psychopathology pretty bang on.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca7hqa?context=5)|Thanks.  there are several serial killer books out there.  i read a few.  my staff read them all. also, dexter is based on a novel called 'darkly dreaming dexter' and jeff lindsay, the writer, gave us a pretty solid template.
[Do you remember which books you used?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca7kq8?context=5)|No.  sorry, it was a long time ago. i can tell you this, though, they were disturbing as hell. 
[If you were asked to do ""one more season"" of Dexter as the *real* ""final season"" for maybe Netflix or something like that - maybe a movie, would you do it (and possibly get most of the original team back together\)?  Link to www.reddit.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/ccabig3?context=5)|Thanks for asking. but that ship has sailed for me.  i've moved on creatively with my books and other stuff i have in the works.
[:(  What if they uhm, they gave you a lot of...uh...money?  Or uh.  ***ANYTHING, PLEASE DO SOMETHING. SAVE US.***  *i've moved on creatively with my books.*  What if you write a Dexter book with permission of everyone (lol @ this happening\) that would be titled ""How It Should Have Ended: Dexter"" which takes place right after season 4 and details the true ending of the show?  EDIT 2: What about a mini-season that takes place right after season 4 that wraps everything up as the true final season, even if it is only like 6 episodes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/ccaep5g?context=5)|They offered me a ton of money.  it wasn't about that.  i wanted to be with my wife and daughter in the east.  no regrets.
[What are some shows / writers that have influenced you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca6oj3?context=5)|Well, it really goes back to the original golden age.  so, paddy chayefsky, rod serling, reginald rose.  and then steven bochco, david milch, damon lindelhof, vince gilligan.  so many good writers out there.
 |In books, it'd be dashiell hammett, raymond chandler, michael connelly, dennnis lehane, lee child.
 |X-files, hill street, sopranos, all in the family, simpsons, breaking bad, lost (yes, lost), so many.
[How do you think Dexter would have been had Deb discovered Dexter and Lumen at the end of season five instead of the end of season six? What would you have done if maybe upon Deb's discovery, Lumen may have shot Deb that instant ala Todd from 'Breaking Bad'? Should things have been set in a running train like motion after your season instead of stalling? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca7i5t?context=5)|It's always a challenge to know how fast to go, how much story to eat up. hard for me to comment further as i didn't do the seasons you're referring to.
[Would you say you had a big ""break"" ever? (If so what?\) Or did the work just keep going progressively up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca7diy?context=5)|I grew up in dorchester, a poor part of boston.  moved to l.a. when i was a teenager (tough to do).  was working on my masters when i met these two guys who were the kings of the tv movie world (remember tv movies?) anyway i started reading scripts for them and doing notes.  they offered me a job to be their second secretary.  i had to choose between that and grad school.  i chose them and they basically taught me the business.  i had alway been a writer, but never thought i could make a living doing it in show business or in books.  and here i am.
[No wonder your new favourite show is Ray Donovan, You grew up in Boston moved to LA and started working in show business. You basically are Ray Donovan though I assume with out all the violence and blackmail.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/ccag4fj?context=5)|No way i'm as tough as ray.  but i have my moments.
[Clyde, thanks for taking the time to do an AMA.  I’m just going to get this right out of the way, and I’m sure what’s on a lot of people’s minds – what happened to Dexter after you left?  Lazy writing (no computer having a password, no house having a security system. Dexter being able to hack into someone’s computer by using a 2-way spyware program. Harrison’s epic fail fall on the treadmill\)  Not grounding Dexter (emotionally or otherwise\) after the season 4. Elevating him to “superhero” status.  Formulaic and predictable writing (People called the ending to season 6, two episodes in\)  Never resolving story arcs that were started (Quinn’s suspicions, Deb “loving” Dexter\)  Short-lived, pointless story-arcs that had undeserving endings (Sirko’s death in season 7, Louis’s death in season 7\)  Useless characters (Masuka’s daughter\) that don’t belong in a final season.  No sense of impending doom or closure for a final season. Writers trying to cram in points/characters they never had a chance to explore (Dexter having a mother figure in Vogel\)  A general dumbing down of the show (especially characters like Quinn and Batista\)  What are your thoughts on the above? How much of Dexter going downhill so fast has to do with switching show runners from you to Chip, and then to Scott? How much say did MCH have, if any? Do you think it was a mistake to give season 2 a “series finale” feeling? Is Showtime to blame at all? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/ccajiiz?context=5)|First of all, i agree with most of what you have to say above. it could be argued, that my leaving had a deleterious effect on the show. but i would never say that, though others have.  mch is the sort of actor and man who trusts the writers and goes about his work brilliantly and professionally.  showtime was part of every big story decision that was made.  
[What do you think made Dexter a sociopath? His mother's death? Harry constantly telling him he was permanently damaged? Something else? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/ccabv3x?context=5)|It's a big salad of what you mentioned.  remember, he watched his mother being murdered, then say in her blood in that container for days. how can you ever get away from that?
[Season 9?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca5xyj?context=5)|Season 8 is the last season of dexter.  final episode this sunday night. it will have been the longest running scripted one hour show in cable history.  some of it was actually great.  john lithgow year for example. very proud of that.
[Introducing an insane central plot dynamic that blindsides people (like, say, a woman suddenly realizing she's been in love with her foster brother her whole life\)  OR.  Trying to do a Take Backsie on it when you don't know how to properly weave it into the narrative?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca8jb3?context=5)|Such a loaded question.  both options suck.  again, it's really difficult doing a show that lasts 8 years.  stories and characters and plot have to be diligently tended.  the writers did the best they could.
[So, is there anything you like or were surprised by that you hadn't thought of in the seasons of Dexter that you didn't handle?  Favorite non-Trinity story in the show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/ccac358?context=5)|Favorite non-trinity moment is the last episode of the first season. that was amazing. the way the show ends this sunday night is pretty cool. not what i would have done, but cool nonetheless.
[Do you have a process that differs when you write different genres?!  Mysteries as opposed to say comedies? I won't reveal anything but the plot and resolution of Unthinkable was insanely satisfying. Do you have to work backwards, outline differently? Very curious. Thanks ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca6ia8?context=5)|It's kind of the same for both.  first of all i outline the hell out of everything.  usually i know the ending and work backward from there. that's how it's been for everything i've written.  with 'unthinkable' i was lucky enough to know the very beginning and the very ending at the same time.  then the tough stuff came: filling it in!

Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/ccac9vn?context=5)|The thing i love about working with michael and jennifer is that they'll be doing some really heavy, demanding scene.  we'll then be relighting and they'll come over and hang and tell jokes and screw around.  then when the set is ready for them, they go back to the heavy demanding stuff without missing a beat.  i really respect that.

[Television is a really collaborative medium. but as the showrunner, you must have a lot of power to make final decisions. do you find your strength to be pushing your own ideas through, or working with others to get their ideas in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/cca7qwa?context=5)|It's always 'best idea wins'.  so, it's not about ego, it's about the final product.  it's my responsibility to make it the best it can be, no matter whose ideas come to the fore.  when i'm doing a book like 'unthinkable', i have final say on everything.  but i still listen to my writer friends and to my editor.

Thank you for giving us those seasons.  I just have a small question. When you wrote that last scene of the season 4 finale with Harrison in it, did you have plans (even vague ones\) about making Harrison a major character at one point and maybe even introducing him to Dexter's dark world?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mkv67/i_am_clyde_phillips_showrunner_of_dexter_and/ccabvs6?context=5)|Thanks for your kind words. we toyed with a couple of things for harrison.  but it never got past thw 'what if' stage.  really, it never went beyond just yakking about it.

[Correct me if i'm wrong but you wrote 4 episodes of Dexter than Produced another 44 episodes.

[Dexter Seasons 1-4 were pretty awesome, 5 was ok, and 6-8 have just been abysmal.  What was the point of having a Subplot with Quinn getting passed over for a promotion only to never have that character on TV again? Why did LaGuerta get a bench?  Why did Dexter park next to the Brain Surgeon when he was following him and then literally stand outside a coffee shop staring at him for an hour?  Do you think James Remar despises what his role has become (The ""Say out loud what Dexter is doing role\)  Honestly Clyde, I'm so angry about how my favorite show turned into my least favorite show that I'm going to sell my DVD's, cancel showtime, and boycott everything Scott Buck does for the rest of his life.

I decided to go back to school for another bachelor's degree in CS. My first bachelor degree is in Japanese studies. That turned out to be fruitless. 

Here are the two programs I am considering. I live in New York (Staten Island), and would like to be able to commute to school, as well as keep the cost down. So I am considering these two CUNY programs:

[CCNY Grove School of Engineering](http://www.ccny.cuny.edu/compsci/)

or

[City Tech](http://www.citytech.cuny.edu/academics/deptsites/cst/btech.aspx)

I'm heavily leaning towards CCNY's program for its ABET accreditation and course selection. It looks like a more well rounded and Computer Science specific major. The only issue is: they are currently imposing many requirements to even begin the major, and even though I am currently finishing them up now, they won't let me apply for the school while I am finishing the requirements, so I will lose a whole semester of potential work. 

This isn't the worst thing in the world. I may be able to even get an internship with my friend doing Python and Django work, so that would be fine. But I would really like to start on this degree.

So, does anyone else know of a good, low-cost, yet reputable school where I can get a good CS education? I really want to go in to some AI courses so those are a plus, and the better the school is at placement in internships the better. 

I appreciate any help or insight anyone can give. 

Thanks.  "

I don't want this to be taken as me asking for advice, but more as a discussion.

I was recently looking back into going to university to get a degree to become a Strength and Conditioning Coach. So I was looking through schools and programs and jobs, and then it hit me...does an aspiring Strength and Conditioning coach need to have a degree? I stumbled upon this article, and it really got me thinking, I invite you guys to do the same.

[Part 1 of the article](http://www.ericcressey.com/is-an-exercise-science-degree-1)

[Part 2 of the article](http://www.ericcressey.com/is-an-exercise-science-degree-2)
 -------
Now, in part 2, the author gives what he believes as a good alternative to a formal education that will further him in the fitness industry. Right now, I am a fitness instructor and a freelance personal trainer that works at 3 different gyms, and has upward 20 clients a week. My end goal is to become a Strength and Conditioning Coach, and so I was looking into getting my degree in Exercise Physiology or something related to push that up towards a reality. But after reading this article, would it be more advisable to just rack up a bunch of certs and try my luck, or do I go back to school and get shit done? 

I know that being at a school will increase my networking options and will put me in a good position to work with higher level athletes and to work with them, but will the cost of schooling be worth it if I can save money by going through certs? Is there anyway I can get internships that will let me be able to work with these athletes without attending the school? These are just some thoughts that popped into my head.

I am not worried about going back to school, I am almost 20, and have been helping people train in my community ever since I turned 18. I know that I would enjoy myself and have a blast if I were to go to school. My only worry is that I don't want to fork up the cash to go to school if it will end up just being a ""good mark"" for me. I mean I know it can't hurt, and in the long run it will *probably* better me, but if all it does is give me a ""one up"" against my peers, then is it really worth the $50,000? Just a thought. Hopefully this will be a good discussion, tell me what you guys think."

1mksj4,22,2013-09-17,"33/M/US, Texas",[deleted],lifeinapost,https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeinapost/comments/1mksj4/33mus_texas/,"I'm ethnically Chinese, was born in Taiwan and lived with my maternal grandmother and my uncles until I was 4. My father was a student in California with my mother, until they came back for me and brought me to the states with them. My parents refuse to talk to me about those first years of my life with my grandmother, I suspect I was molested by my uncle who was later beaten by an angry mob and permanently wheelchair-bound after he molested a neighborhood kid years later.

I enjoyed California, the weather and coast were nice. He finished grad school a year later and, unable to find work, piled us and my newborn little sister into a Ford Pinto for the drive to Texas. We've stayed here ever since. He found work as a Chinese restaurant manager and has been doing that ever since in buffets, take out joints, you name it. He never was much of a father, was always working, which is typical of first-gen Asian immigrants. He is also a huge gambling addict and gambled away what little money we had on Vegas trips several times. The final time was in '97 or so, he flew back and beat my mom. I almost strangled him to death. I haven't spoken a word to him since, I was 17 at the time and I don't regret it at all. I've never really known him, to be honest, and what little I do know is terrible.

My mother is a shut-in, has never made any effort to assimilate and speaks little English in spite of being in the country for almost 30 years. I was a shut-in with her as a child, as a result, and never really learned how to socialize properly. Whenever I wanted to go out and needed a ride to go to Boy Scouts or camp or friends, she was yell at me for being selfish. I can will myself to be social around people and polite, but it is exhausting. Social anxiety is a problem for me, I just want to be left alone most of the time. Being very tall from a young age, six foot seven now, didn't help, I've always tried to hang back and blend in, not be noticed.

My mother's language skills left her few options for work, so she went to the massive flea market in town that is open on weekends and she opened a store that sells shoes and household goods from China. She's been doing that ever since. She dragged my sister and me with her every weekend, so I pretty much hate the place. I blame her and that place for being so alone as a kid.

I left for college at 17, went to a large in-state public school, almost flunked out that first year because I completely was unable to handle all that freedom. I got my act together and graduated in four years. Went on to law school as a fall back, I had no idea what I wanted to do. I ended up hating the idea of being a lawyer and during my second year, I dropped out to take a job with a business media startup that paid generous commissions for subscriber growth. It was the first thing in my life that I was super motivated to do and was good at, so I worked my ass off. Ten years later, the company is a national, prominent publication now and my pay exploded. I didn't know how to handle all this money I was getting, I was very poor kid who didn't even have cable TV until I moved to college. I just saved everything and invested it. My net worth crossed $1 million a few weeks ago, as a result. I'm so grateful that this job came into my life, it's been the most fulfilling thing I've done, by a mile.

My sister is not a shut-in with social anxiety like me, somewhere during her early adolescence, it clicked with my parents that they had to do something different or she would turn out like me. She was allowed to go out and have friends and do things and, thankfully, she's turned out well-adjusted. So much so that she did corporate sales very successfully for a few years after college, a very interpersonal-intensive line of work.

She's now studying for her MBA at a very good private school here. She was prepared to take out $100,000 in loans - some public Stafford loans with 6.8% interest due to expiring subsidies and the rest private loans with interest as high as 14%. I was infuriated at how much interest that was. So I loaned her the money as a nominal rate of less than 1%. It was strange - she didn't ask me at all, I forced it on her yet I was extremely unhappy that I was doing it. $100,000 is an obscene amount of money for me, I just have a hard time getting over it, I guess. She graduates in May, already has a $80,000 offer on the table from her summer internship. So that's going to work out well.

I'm unmarried. No kids. Been awhile since I had a gf. I'm not that preoccupied about it, it's others who are. My sister says she cries for me, which amuses me greatly. I know she means well, but this is what I want.

I want a new start somewhere, I've been in Texas my whole life. I love it here for a multitude of reasons, but life is short, I'd like to see some of the world. I love my job but I'm probably going to quit in the next year so I can leave unencumbered. Ten years is a long time to do any one thing, I want to learn a new hard skill and try something else.

I'll always be upset with my parents for my upbringing, but I forgive them for how things were. They tried their best, for the most part, and I'm not starving. I have to take responsibility for what I am and will be, I can't live in the past forever. It is hard, however, her language skills means she pesters me every hour to do something for her. Whether it be pay bills or look up something or explain something. Sometimes I use it as an excuse to launch into a tirade about how much I hate her, I feel terrible about it.

I still go with my mom to her flea market space every weekend out of guilt, I help her open up and close and stick around for a few hours in between. She's not getting any younger. My parents have zero savings and have sunk what money they had in the past into screwball business ventures that have all failed miserably. My hope is I can turn my million into several million through investments so I can care for them adequately in their later years. We'll see."

After I graduated the school, I’ve become miserable, burned out and full of depression of finding some jobs.


I have the language problem between my mother language and my father language that both of them are not fluent, but mixed that I’m just tourist in my own country. It came out that my diagnose is PDD-NOS, and to be honest.. I don’t accept this because I feel miserable and being alienated by the special supervisor that all men treating me as a child/disable/dumb person that they don’t fucking know I’m just like them, only delayed to catch up what they meant and language error. Because of that I was scared for getting the job and very regret that I should get the job at the age of 16, because i only have internships for the part of the school. And I do hate to ask the help where it’s special for special people, in which makes me feel more miserable than usual, because I want to live as a normal life. Not for living with the title hanging as they are fear of what to do with me..


My hobby was art, because it’s the only way for me to make them understanding. Now after I graduated the college as a Media Design.. I lost my talent because of burnt out from internship exams after I realize it that I should not passed this exams because of how unorganized I was to understand.. People are telling me to continue the art, but because of I realize that I seriously cannot draw it that I felt they are lying to me. I even realize how I fix with my own CV with Indesign that it wasn’t looking great with shame.


Right now I got threatened from my mother after she works so hard, cannot speak Dutch very well at her jobs and she’s so sick of me that I don’t look doing at all (because I’m depressed already). Even worse, she only got 5 years to go for working and her pension is empty. That made me more miserable that I made her struggle..


Right now I cry for help of how can I be able to get the job with ease, even I don't have experience with everything but graphic designer and art.. And that I can be able to communicate them very well.. Can I even sign up wherever they ask experience, even though I don’t?"
1mknxm,1,2013-09-17,Girlfriend interning in DC as I remain in NY,[deleted],LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1mknxm/girlfriend_interning_in_dc_as_i_remain_in_ny/,"Hello LD community. I am in desperate need of help. My girlfriend and are are pretty serious and everything was great when we were together. All we have to do is make it to December, then we won't have to be apart again. She had a bit of a rough past with drinking liquor and we had a rough start to the relationship (was with two other guys two separate nights). I didn't really take it to heart TOO much because we weren't technically ""together"" or even had talked about establishing a relationship. I've been cheated on in past relationships and I've cheated once as well, too. My problem is I dwell too much on those memories to where it becomes a problem. She is now in DC and we do fine during the week, but when it comes to the weekend and going out to the bars (she stopped drinking liquor) , it goes into a complete 360. I get way to controlling, to an obsessive state. There is a group of guys that live the floor above her and her roommates that are apart of the same internship program. They know she has a boyfriend, but numbers were exchanged quite quickly of meeting and they are constantly asking her and her roommates to come over to their place for dinner, parties, hanging out, etc. I've been a single adult before, and maybe I'm just a bad person, but when a girl says she has a boyfriend, but he wasn't in the picture, I still wanted to pursue. So I just assume the worst of their intentions and even though I claim to trust her, I assume the worst of her too, because I'm still sickened by the venom of the past in our relationship (being lied to about the guys she was with). So I start to get very controlling of how long she goes to their apartment for, not to drink when she is there, etc. when she goes out to eat after one of the programs classes or goes to an event, that are aside from the internship. I'm constantly nagging her if she is sitting next to any of those guys, who she's with, if she's drinking, etc. I ask her if they have been texting her at all, what they say...I believe her, but I don't? It has been an emotional roller coaster for us. We care so deeply about each other but I am ruining her experience there by being like this. She gets so stressed on the weekends and feels isolated from the other interns because of my wishes. I realize I am being SO selfish in the comfort of knowing she isn't out drinking around other guys, or at the guys apartment upstairs, at the cost of her being depressed in her room. The ball buster was her saying how she agreed to go to a ""black light"" party at the guys apartment upstairs and how a lot of girls from the program were going. I was thinking to myself, ""a dark lit party in white t shirts with guys trying to touch you and write all over you with markers? FUCK THAT!"" I said there was no way I could  handle that kind of anxiety that comes with knowing she was at a party like that. I can swallow my tongue and deal with bars, but that I just couldn't handle. she agreed not to go and was going to just head into DC (she lives outside of DC) and keep busy because she didn't want her roommates to be like ""why are you not coming"" as she sat in her room all night. She ended up not going anywhere and said that we roommates (she has two) were staying in as well. Then she told me one of her roommates decided to go because it wasn't a black light party anymore, but she was remaining home to calm my nerves. I called her when I had down time at work around 9 something pm (work nights as a chef). She answered the phone after a few rings and I just kind of felt like something was up, but didn't think after all we've been through, she would lie. she talked to me for a few minutes and said she couldn't wait to skype after I got home from work. It turns out she went with her roommate to the party, exited the room when I called so I would not hear, and re entered after we got off the phone. She assures me she only had 1 beer there, which is understandable because I got home soon after to skype. I just felt so betrayed though that she lied to me like that. Long story short (not really, haha) I just need some advice to get through the rest of this year. I love this girl to death and she feels the same way towards me. It is not like this AT ALL when we are together. I can't go on living like this though, and neither can she. I am asking for any kind of help possible, I appreciate anyone's time who reads my long, drawn out story. "

I graduated in May with a degree in Biochemistry &amp; Molecular Biology, and I've been looking ever since for a lab technician/research assistant job in Boston area universities and hospitals, and no one has contacted me yet.


The thing is, I don't have any research or experience to my name. College sucked for me, and I had no desire or motivation to do any internships or volunteer in labs so now I'm kinda screwed.


I was just hoping someone who went through this might be able to give me some pointers.


Thanks!"

I’m not sure if I’m being too eager or just annoying, but I haven’t been given much to do. 


The entire hire process was a bit unorthodox. I asked a former instructor if he had any contacts at a certain company to do an internship at, and he referred me to someone who I sent my resume to, who in turn sent my resume to his supervisor. Mr. Supervisor set up an interview with me and two other people I’m currently working with and we all agreed that I would work full-time on an open ended basis pending my graduation in May 2014. From there, we would see where I would like to go at $company and where I would fit in given my experience and preference. 


I go to school at night, and I have to work full-time because I have rent/living expenses to pay for. I hate to be annoying and I don’t want them to feel like they’re not getting their money’s worth ($17/hour). I live in an *at will* work state, so I could technically be fired for any or no reason at any time – which I definitely do not want. 


I don’t see why they would have hired me if they don’t have anything for me to do, so what’s the hold up?

1mkkth,3,2013-09-17,"My boyfriend [25M] and I[21F] live together, but he can't hold down a job and we hardly ever sleep in the same bed.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1mkkth/my_boyfriend_25m_and_i21f_live_together_but_he/,"My boyfriend is 25M and I am 21F. We have been living together for four months, and we have been dating for six (known him for over a year). 

**Background:**

I originally moved in with him because my lease ended in May and I was unable to make ends meet (I had a crappy part-time internship), and he owns his own home so there was plenty of room. I am a full time student, and he graduated two years ago but has not worked steadily since. 

We had only been dating for about two months when I moved in, but he and I get along well and there were not any major problems with living together. About two months ago, I got another job and have been working full time and going to college full time.

He and I both are night owls, so it was not unusual for he and I to stay up until the dawn when I was unemployed. He is a big drinker and he would often go out to a bar every night to socialize, but he stopped doing that as often when we started dating (his choice, not mine). 

As soon as I started to work full time, I had to be awake at 6:30AM to get ready to be at work at 8:00AM-5:00PM. It is a normal office schedule and it sucks, but I do it. My boyfriend is still staying up all night long, which would normally not bother me but it creates a problem.

**Problem #1:**

When he stays up until dawn when I have to be at work, it means that he and I never are in the bed at the same time. This is is severely impacting our sex life and how much intimacy there is in the relationship. He will not come to bed with me unless I ask and make it a point that we need to have sex.

It seems as though he would rather stay up all night long and watch television and play on his phone than to sleep in the same bed with me. He and I share the same bed, but it is not until 5AM in the morning that he will finally lay down and go to sleep. The only way I have gotten him to have sex with me is if I ask him to do it right after I get home from work.

I have tried communicating with him, and it's gotten a bit better sexually, but it is still frustrating to never have sex with my boyfriend at night and in our bed.

Edit: He and I both used to have daily sex, and it is what I want and what he told me that he wanted when we started to date. He and I have both had 50+ partners, and you don't get to that high of a number if you DON'T like to have sex...


**Problem #2.**

He can't seem to hold down a job. This is not a critical issue at the moment, as he has enough in savings to get through a year at least, plus he owns his own home and car (both are paid off).

I am not sure whether or not it is due to the fact that he is unhappy at the jobs that he has gotten, or if it is a lack of dedication and work ethic. He has had two jobs since we started living together, and both were in sales. He earned his degrees in Political Science and Psychology, so I'm not surprised that he cannot find a degree in his field. He is a very intelligent person, and he is not willing to accept an entry level position.

Before we started to date, he was employed as a financial planner, but it required investing his own money into seminars in order to turn a profit. He does not want to be in finance, so he stopped working in the field and switched to sales when we started to date. He had two sales jobs, but he quit both after about 2-3 weeks. Honestly, I would have quit the jobs too (both had terrible managers and they lost his paychecks at one position, the other was straight commission and the product would not sell), but the point is that he can't seem to find a job and stick with it long enough to see a return. 

He is willing to work if the work is interesting, but he does not have any solid work history to land a job with. It's been two years since he graduated, so I'm not sure if this is just a result of the recession, or if he's just not dedicated to working.

**TL;DR:** Boyfriend and I are living together. He can't hold down a job, so he sits at home playing games until late at night, which is preventing us from having intimate time as a couple."

I moved to Seattle two years ago after graduating from law school for my current job. I'm a commercial surplus lines insurance broker with a focus on high-tech professional liability and privacy liability. In brief, I specialize in finding and negotiating insurance contracts where the risk is too large, too weird, or too risky for retail-level insurance companies. I do much of my placement with underwriters/syndicates at Lloyd's of London and our domestic equivalent. Because I work on the wholesale/surplus lines side of the industry, I don't deal directly with the entity actually being insured. Instead, I'm a consultant for their agent. 

My day-to-day activities involve reading, analyzing, and negotiating contracts, managing clients, researching markets, and creating proposals. Because I work in a small branch office, we have very little on-site support, and so I also handle any technical issues that can't be solved by remote access from our IT staff back east.

My background is in law and technology. I originally went to law school with the ambition of working for the Electronic Frontier Foundation and had a strong focus on intellectual property law. Unfortunately I graduated into the job market of 2010, where entry-level legal work required 3-5 years of experience, and I was in Michigan. Prior to that, I've done estate planning law (legal internship) and been a band manager/representative, IT consultant, and interned at a venture capital firm. 


**What I'm Looking For**

I would like to transition to a technology-driven industry; a phase one tech startup, biomedical, and/or nonprofit. I enjoy wearing a lot of hats, and prefer a role that changes often enough that I can never quite get comfortable (or bored). Obviously I'm looking at the Gates Foundation, Seattle BioMed and the like, but I prefer small companies, and they can be hard to find."

I'm a fourth year mechanical engineering student. I really want to be a good mechanical engineer and as what I have been reading in /r/engineeringstudents, internships are very important in your engineering school experience. Unfortunately, in my case, we only got the chance to do an internship on the summer before fifth year (it takes 5 years for engineering here in the Philippines). I am also aware that companies might not be that interested in me since I have no work experience. The only plausible thing for me is to do personal projects. I love tinkering (disassembling broken things and trying to make it work again, ie. clocks, appliances, brother's toys) but I want to have an organized, documented and ""proper"" projects so that I may be able to include it in my resume. So what projects can you suggest for young engineering students like me that I may be able to include in my resume? Currently, I grew fond of SolidWorks (had to teach myself since it's not available in school) and one of my current project is to do the full Iron Man suit in its solidworks form. What suggestions can you give to make me more marketable? My purpose is not solely to look good for companies but I also want to spend my spare time (aka relaxing time) in productivity.

TL;DR what are good projects for young mechanical engineering students?"

She's now finished enough upper division math courses to have a completed applied math minor.  She focused on calculus based statistic courses.

The thing is though, is that she sees herself in finance. and wants to switch over into finance.

Would it be a bad career choice to go into finance and then graduate by the end of the following school year without having internship?  She would need to take a full-time summer term and then graduate at the end of the following school year - full time courses the entire way, but they're manageable and don't seem really stressful (we are used to being busy people).

She would be expecting to graduate with a 3.8 GPA and is part of Alpha Chi.  Just no internship or work experience in a related field.

Should she be completely discouraged from switching over to a career in finance because she'll graduate without an internship?  We're still young, in our early 20's, so I tell her to just follow her passion, but I'm not sure how terrible employment opportunities would be for someone who would graduate without finishing college with an internship or any kind of related work experience."

We are Bugbyte. Last year we embarked on our mission to unite gaming and helping homeless dogs. We finished our first game and gained a lot of experience, it really was an eye-opener to realize how tough the mobile gaming market really is.

[Daredogs reddit post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1322c1/we_made_an_android_game_to_support_dog_shelters/)

Our savings were depleted, so we had two choices. To give up or to take a loan and try to succeed better with a new game. We felt we didn't want to give up yet, so here we are.

We feel there is great potential to do good with mobile gaming. This because advertising revenue makes it possible to make games playable for free, but have players still generate real money revenue.

**So our concept: Play for free - Help feed a homeless dog.**

This concept is what our young company is built on. We donate 10-20% of our game proceeds to dog shelters around the world. We dream that someday we will be able to up the percentage, make substantial donations, and have great games for people to play.

Our new game Ace Tales has come very far, and recently we launched an indiegogo campaign to fund the polishing and porting of the game to iOS. We also have an intern Matti, who we have grown so fond of that we would want to hire him.

Even if we fail at this in the end, we hope to spark an interest in other developers to try out the same concept! Who knows, one day the big names in the industry will donate a portion of their game proceeds. And players will tend to lean towards the games that have a positive effect, besides being entertained."

1mk5a0,59,2013-09-17,Professional development in Chinese companies,Peking_Meerschaum,China,https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/1mk5a0/professional_development_in_chinese_companies/,"This started off as a reply to /u/buddy-bubble 's post asking for advice about working for a Chinese company. I have a lot of unfortunate experience in this area and was moved to write a much more detailed response than I had anticipated. I decided to make a self post of it, as I've seen a lot of people asking about such jobs on this sub. 

So, here are the reasons one should generally not work for a Chinese company:


* **Chinese companies will promise you the moon, but in reality they will trust you with no real authority** and your ""leadership"" role will be a meaningless title. Chinese bosses (from the owners of tiny restaurants to the CEOs of major companies) try to concentrate as much power as possible in their own hands, and trust few if anyone else with any sort of leadership authority. This applies to things like making hiring decisions to something as minor as sending someone out of the office to pick up some paper or something. I've worked at companies with over a hundred employees where the boss insisted on personally signing every re-reimbursement form (no matter how small) and every sick leave permission slip. This is doubly true for foreigners. They might have told you you will be leading a team, but this will assuredly not be the case. 

* **Lack of Professionalism:** It might seem cool at first that everyone wears a t-shirt and sweatpants to the office, but once you discover that this is merely an indication of how seriously they view their job and the company in general, it will be too late. The ""team"" that you will ""lead"" will be half lazy and half incompetent, and will grow annoyed when you attempt to make them work faster. The only choice will be to either let them work at their agonizingly slow and inefficient pace as they divide their time between chatting on QQ and playing online games, or attempting to crack down on them only to have them shut you out entirely and play politics to undermine your position in the company. A few members of your team will quit unexpectedly without any notice, and one will go on vacation back to his/her home village and simply choose not to return, that's just how they roll here. It will be tempting to try to use logical reasoning with them, but using logic on a Chinese person is like giving a cat a shower--it won't kill them, but they act like it will. Your questions will be dodged with the trusty 不为什么 and 你还不了解中国企业文化. You will go to the boss and try to get him to back you up, only to have him demure and rebuff you out of fear of getting his hands dirty. It is at this moment you will realize that the boss is as corrupted and unprofessional as all his employees, and that the asylum guards are indistinguishable from the inmates. After some time, with dawning horror, you also realize that you yourself have become one of them, and by then it is too late.

* **Monotony:** Contrary to popular belief, Chinese office jobs are not terrible because of the amount of labor involved. That would be ridiculous, since so little actual work occurs. What makes them terrible is the monotony. Wake up, crowded subway, arrive 9am, lunch 12pm (this is the most inflexible rule of all, your Chinese colleagues will literally stampede into the elevators rather than risk having to go to lunch at 12:05), leave at 5:30 or 6pm, crowded subway. Repeat every weekday for a year. You will be treated like a schoolchild in that you have to sign in and out in the morning, and you will need a note from a doctor in order to get reimbursed for your sick day, even if its the only one you've ever taken. Do you have an interesting opportunity that could help the company out, and need a few hours to go meet with someone/investigate something/go to a meeting outside the office? Your boss will refuse to let you leave, and make up an excuse as to why he needs you around the office that day. He will suggest you followup with said opportunity during the weekend on your own time.

* **You are a resource to be exploited** and nothing more. This is the stark truth of how most Chinese bosses view the foreign employees they hire. Despite what they may have told you in your job interview, you will not be given any real authority of any kind (as mentioned above), and at the same time you will be held to a different, sometimes higher standard than the Chinese employees. Unless you speak Chinese (in which case you will spend your entire day translating documents and contracts as they pile into your QQ box), you were hired to bolster the company's image, and for that reason only. If you are a designer/architect/programmer/etc. they will tell you you were hired to add international talent and perspective to the company's own work, but you will quickly find that no one, including the boss who hired you, actually wants to listen to, much less utilize, your opinions--unless of course they just strait up steal them and take the credit themselves, which will also happen from time to time. No, your suggestions/instructions will be ignored, and you will find yourself in meeting after meeting with clients, expected to sit quietly as ""white window dressing"" while the Chinese hammer out the details of a design/product/etc. that you never agreed to in the first place. If you aren't a designer or architect or programmer, and are just working in some nebulous ""management"", ""marketing"", or ""branding"" role, you won't even be given the façade of contributing meaningfully. You were hired for the color of your skin alone and the ""face"" that it brings, and at best are an interesting conversation piece and at worst some sort of court jester. Either way, you will have *no* meaningful hope of long-term development or promotion within the company, and you will take nothing but cynicism away from the experience. 

* **Working in China is Fool's Gold:** If you are hoping to make and save extra money by working for a Chinese company, you are in for disappointment. You will be paid a wage which is substantially less than what you would make at a similar job back home. Granted it's all relative, you will have a life which is more comfortable than the average Chinese person and many of your co-workers (no Westerner should take a job for less than ￥10,000 per month), but do you really want to be reduced to comparing your income to peasants and migrant workers in order to justify your paltry salary to your parents and friends back home? You can tell yourself you don't care about what others think of you carving a life out in China all you want, but everyone feels that existential sense of shortcoming when they mentally calculate that they are earning less than a McDonalds line cook back home, no matter how many superfluous taxi rides and sticks of 串儿 their income buys in China. And in all honesty, you won't even be *well-off* by Chinese standards, you will be earning only a few thousand more than the workers make at Foxconn. You will try to save money but fail, as life in China is filled with sudden, hidden expenses that pop-up. If by some miracle you've saved up some RMB in the bank, you should remember that it's essentially Monopoly Money when you bring it back home--your year of hard work scrimping and saving will barely pay for your ticket back. 

* **Working in China isn't a Magic Resume Saver:** It used to be impressive to go off to work in China at a Chinese company for a year, but things are changing fast. Now everyone knows someone/someone's kid who went to China, and the mystery and uniqueness this used to bring is fading. More often than not, you will find that in terms of resume material, a year spent working as a ""director"" at a Chinese company will be treated by companies the same way as an internship is treated: a slightly interesting tidbit that won't have much bearing on a final employment decision, especially if the company has no connection to China. Even if you're Mandarin is fluent, it won't help you unless you are applying to a company which deals directly with China. And your Mandarin won't be fluent if you are just going to China to work for a year in hopes of picking it up. You will be able to say a few words and sentences, and your tones will be wrong. If learning Mandarin is your goal, then go to China to study Mandarin, *don't* attempt to learn it by working at a Chinese company. 


TL;DR: Working at a Chinese company in China is a bad career move and a worse life move, it is a monotonous and even Kafkaesque experience that will leave you bitter, cynical, and generally worse-off than you were going in. Come to China for the food, the Rainies, and the experience. Do not come without a plan and expect professional development or real financial gains of any kind. "

So, when I myself see something I can't explain I shift my perspective to understand it. I believe I saw into another version of earth. The glitch was small and almost insignificant, but I saw it.

This summer I had an internship in Michigan, and me and 2 other guys rented out a house. The morning of July 2nd at roughly 6:15 I got up to ask my roommate something quickly before he left for work. Now roommate 1# had been out of town for 2 days and 2# had only just gotten up at 6:00, quickly showered and got ready.

I caught him at the bottom of the stairs and talked to him there. On my direct left there was an old letter couch, and as I was talking to him I saw a green and yellow blanket folded roughly on the seat nearest me. It didn't hit me until I was up the stairs and roommate had left that we didn't have a green and yellow blanket in the house. When I went back downstairs, it was gone.

Facts

* 1. Like I said none of us had a blanket like that.
* 2. I had been the last one to bed that night, roommate 1# was gone and 2# had only used the upstairs bathroom and was going downstairs for the first time that morning. 
* 3. I was sitting on that couch the night before.
* 4. I remember it, its fuzzy and not exact, but definitely there. Kind of like the perception filter stuff in Doctor Who.
* 5. No one could have taken it, and it surely didn't just walk away.

This had me seriously questioning reality for a couple days.

**EDIT**   Time clarify a bit: I don't really know why I'm trying to convince you people of what I saw. I know most posts here are to have them explained somehow. But I went through all that the first week after it happened. I literally had an 11 hour drive later that day right after this happened to think it over. So I made sure to remember every detail I could to try and reason it away. But I know I saw it, I know its a leap, but I see no other option. I'm not crazy, I wasn't on anything, I wasn't hallucinating from exhaustion, I didn't dream it. Who says a real glitch in reality would have to be some grand happening, like flying lights or prophetic vision? Why not just some simple view beyond the veil.

I'm not someone to believe on hearsay, so I don't expect you to be. I just want what happened to be known

1mjyly,8,2013-09-17,How my dad and my boyfriend became strangers... and how I'm starting to get through it,xyggz1,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1mjyly/how_my_dad_and_my_boyfriend_became_strangers_and/,"Needed to get a rant out of my system! Prepare for novel..

About six months ago my dad told me he was in a serious relationship. He is divorced from my mother but they have been fighting each other in court for the past 4 years as they worked together building my dad's now successful company. He believes she deserves nothing, she believes she deserves everything. I think they're *both* frustrating idiots (in context of the divorce I mean). But right from the start I have insisted that I am not taking sides. I moved out shortly after the start of the divorce and stayed on speaking terms with both parents. Both parents were extremely frustrated by this decision. Both parents wanted me to stop talking to the other. Both parents admitted on separate occasions that they resented me for keeping in contact with the other. Both believe the other is the worst most selfish greedy awful human alive.... You get the picture. All I will say is they have *both* done bad things but I love them both regardless.

Anyway, ever since he told me about the new woman in his life, my dad stopped making any time at all for me. I saw him maybe three times after he told me about the new girlfriend, and each time it was a rushed affair, because he was on his way to meet her. We used to go out to dinner together and talk for hours. Suddenly he's barely there. 

Then he tells me he's getting married. I'm not invited to the wedding. The next time I see him, he's married. He's acting very weird. Saying awful things about my brother (my brother is schizophrenic but he is the sweetest guy there is, so this was shocking to hear). My two sisters have fully sided with my mother and do not speak to my father, but my brother, like me, still remains in contact with him. According to my brother, who I guarantee would never lie, the last thing my dad said to him was that if it weren't for my mother, he wouldn't be burdened with my brother. Obviously the schizophrenia has been a lot to deal with and my brother needs to be checked on on a regular basis, but this came out of left field.... 

If it can get worse, my dad announces he and the new wife are moving to the Caribbean.... tomorrow. He literally gives me one day notice. I am so shell shocked I barely react. He says nothing will change, gives me a hug, and that is the last time I saw him. 

After a few weeks of him leaving and pure radio silence, I start to build up this resentment. Resentment that I took so much guff from my mother because I chose to keep him in my life, and he just chooses not to keep me in his. I send him a pretty unsavoury text saying I don't find it fair that this new woman in his life gets priority over everyone else. He tells me a new spouse always takes priority and that ""children do not rule the world"".

Nothing for a few more weeks. I find out from my sister, that happened to bike by his house, that he came home and was in town. And he didn't tell me. I text him asking why he would avoid telling me he was in town after I specifically expressed I was upset he wasn't making time for me and he replies with the most confusing answer ever: that I betrayed him and to never speak to him again.

WHAT?? 

Well, it turns out my mom found out he had left town from my brother. She used this knowledge to grill his ass in court because he was required for some reason to stay in town and not move any of the valuable objects they were negotiating from the house, which apparently he did. My dad claims I outed his moving to my mother, that I betrayed him, and that unless I smarten up and apologize and take responsibility for what I did, he has no time for me. 

Let me emphasize two things: 1) I did not tell my mother a thing, I knew it was a sensitive issue - and, more importantly 2) he never told me not to tell her, so how is it fair to be upset even if I had told her?

... Unbelievable. At this point I am sick of texting and want to call or see him in person to try to explain how completely wrong he is about this whole ordeal, but he won't answer my phone calls. Claims nothing good can come of this for him if we speak on the phone. I probably call him 30 times, in tears and freaking out the whole time. No voicemail on his phone. He continuously doesn't answer. Then he repeats via text to smarten up and take responsibility for what I have done, despite my insistence that I had nothing to do with it, and again, tells me not to waste his time otherwise. 

It's pretty clear to me at this point he has made his choice to start a new life and I am just some inconvenient 21 year old loose end. I send him an email after I cool off telling him I love him but that I can't talk to him for at least a little while because we will clearly never agree on the issue. I tell him if he does decide he wants to talk to me that I insist it be a phone call or in person and that I can't believe this whole fiasco went down through text message. 

And that was almost three months ago. Haven't heard a peep from him since. I'm doing my best but it has been tough. 

At exactly the same time as my dad's departure, my boyfriend announces he got an internship starting in august running until january which will require him to travel on a train all over the US and Canada. 

It was a sore subject because he had applied to the internship originally without telling me, and when he did finally tell me about it, he insisted he would never get it. I was emotionally dead thanks to the dad-drama and was really, really harsh on him when I found out. Got really upset, felt betrayed. I definitely overreacted because my boyfriend leaving just emphasized the abandonment with my dad. We talked about breaking up, but didn't do anything at first, staying together. But we had already been having issues and had already broken up once before (for like 20 hours mind you) And, like I said, once I found out about the internship, I was really quite aggressive. We fought pretty much everyday after I found out.

We only lasted a few weeks after he broke the news. I called him one night telling him I didn't see this working out, not with the way things had already been so crappy lately. He said he'd need to think about it, and the next day while I was at work he texted me saying I was right. And that was that. 

He was my best friend for years before we dated and 100% my emotional crutch. Lost my virginity to him, convinced myself we'd be together forever - told myself that we were best friends that fell in love and that we would never fall out of it. 

Breaking up would have been hard enough - pairing it with my dad leaving, a stressful 40 hour work week and studying to write the MCAT, I pretty much broke down. 

I couldn't get out of bed in the morning, I was crying ALL the time, barely eating, my performance slipped at work (bosses noticed), I couldn't bring myself to study for the exam... I obviously begged my ex to stay with me many times, needing the emotional support. Social outings were a nightmare because all my friends are also friends with my ex, and weren't about to not invite him to come out, especially considering he would be leaving soon. I don't blame my friends, at all, I'd have done the same. But it definitely hindered any progress. It was a seriously shitty time. It was bottom. Honestly, it was rock bottom. 

But it got better. 

I dropped the MCAT. Not a good career move, but there was no way I was going to be able to get a good score. That helped relieve some stress. I forced myself to meet new people that didn't know my ex.

I started volunteering at the hospital, and interacting with patients having it so much worse than me really helped me realize that the world didn't stop turning just because I wanted it to and that there were people out there who had it so much worse, and yet kept positive attitudes.

I moved apartments - clean slate. Didn't have to sit in the living room where I cried as I gave my ex back his belongings or where my dad dropped the bomb that he was moving. Didn't have to sleep in a bedroom where my ex had slept with me most nights. 

Then my ex left town. Social outings with my old friends became therapeutic. I didn't have the anxiety of running into him. Then I found out I made dean's list at my school for the previous academic year, and dropping the MCAT felt like less of career killer. 

Things got better. 

At some point I realized I was thinking about my dad and my ex less and less.  At some point I realized the only time I thought about them was to think about how little I had been hurting lately. 

It's still hard sometimes. I'll stumble across a memory of either of them while I'm least expecting it, and it'll be everything in my power to not let it bring me down. It's still hard to think about the fact that two people that I cherished and never wanted to imagine out of my life - are exactly that, out of my life. 

But I haven't cried in a long time. I get out of bed in the morning. I care about my work again. Volunteering is as rewarding as ever. 

Some days I think about how I literally begged my ex to take me back and how he said no, and I am so relieved that I am just so disgustingly happy. We were unhappy together. I needed him emotionally, but we weren't good together. I can finally see that.

And I am so much stronger now. Because I got through that emotional shit all by myself. I am happy alone. I am not dependent on a boyfriend to help me through hard times. 

And I really am genuinely happy alone. An ex boyfriend that dumped me rather brutally about 5 years ago started talking to me upon finding out I was single and after a few weeks asked me to give him a second chance. 

And I said no! Because I am stronger now. I don't need some guy in my life (especially some guy that saw it fit to dump me) to be happy. 

And I'm proud of myself for saying no. Proud that I can be alone and happy and okay, only three months after shit exploded. When I was with my ex boyfriend I hated being alone. I was so needy. I constantly needed his attention and affection. And now, for probably the first time ever, I am perfectly happy to have alone time where I just read or listen to music or watch TV... alone. Sometimes it's even all I want. 

So I guess I will wrap up this seriously long rant to say that no matter how shitty you think it is, it gets better. It really does get better. 

I feel like I am fully sober after a very long, painful hangover. But the fact is I was drunk before. And not the good kind of drunk. Things needed to change. 

So you know what, life? Bring it on. And thank you! I am a stronger person because of it. 

**TLDR** Dad leaves town with new wife, relationship with boyfriend ends because of an internship and pre-existing problems. Cue emotional breakdown... But I am getting through it. And I am so much stronger because of it! Woohooooo"
1mjygk,1,2013-09-17,Need some advice,djgucci,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/1mjygk/need_some_advice/,"Hey guys, first time posting here. A little background for you: I'm 19 years old, have my B.S. in Mathematics with a Certificate in Actuarial Science, have exams P/1 and FM/2 under my belt, and I'm currently studying for MFE/3F in November. Yes, I'm young. I went to an accelerated high school with a dual enrollment program.

I was hired June 2012 for a summer ""internship"" at an underwriting company, lets call them Company X. Company X has no actuaries. They hired me on the idea of starting an analytics department. After the summer, I was hired part time while finishing my Senior year of undergrad, and upon graduation this past spring, hired full time under the title of ""Actuarial Analyst"" with a salary of 30k. 

While I can't say that the work I've been doing has been 100% actuarial, it has familiarized me with some of the internal workings of the insurance industry and I worked with some extensive data, finding trends and doing some basic rate analysis. 

Here's my dilemma: I've been talking to the person who originally hired me at Company X, who has since left to become a part owner in Company Y. He wants me to leave X and join him at Y, to do very similar work, with a bit of a raise (I wouldn't even bother leaving for any less than 40k) and a promise that the company is experiencing rapid growth and I have a very bright future at Y, leading to a CFO kind of role. Obviously this seems enticing, and I most likely don't have the same kind of future at X, a larger, but stagnant company. However, neither of these companies are doing real actuarial work, and I'm a bit concerned that I'm not learning the skills I would need if I were to leave and join an actuarial firm or something like that. I also want to make a decision on what path to take soon, because if I keep taking exams I may end up overqualified and under-experienced, narrowing my opportunities. 

Tl;dr: I have 3 choices:

1. Stay at Company X
2. Move to Company Y
3. Leave X, Decline Y, and find a new job at an actuarial firm or other employer able to give me better Actuarial specific education.

I'd appreciate any advice you more experienced actuaries are able to give me. Thank you very much!"
1mjvmn,0,2013-09-17,I'm tired of this,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1mjvmn/im_tired_of_this/,"No. I can't stand it. I've got to say something.

First of all, I'm a freshman in highschool. That doesn't mean I'm an immature twit, as is commonly inferred. I'm more of an intellectual type. I go home and instead of my ""Algebra II"" (really prealgebra review) homework, I study quantum mechanics and programming language design. I'm in love with knowing. I'm an INTJ/INTP (not really sure which, probably a bit of both).

I want to be an adult. But I'm not. I'm limited by this leash marked ''minor'' that prevents me from doing anything. I want independence. I want to be able to fuck up, and then get back up myself. That's what independence is; the freedom to screw up as hard as you can so you can pick up the pieces.

I want to sustain myself. I want a dose of reality. I can't stand sitting here, doing nothing productive with my life. I'm waiting for some spot to open up where I applied for my internship, but it's... probably not going to happen. I'm only 14, so I'm not sure they're considering my application very seriously.

I want to turn into a trainwreck (hyperbole behind) now so I don't have to later. I want to learn to pick myself up after I fall, but I can't fall. I'm not standing. So how am I to learn to stand the getting back up?

This leash marked ''minor'' restricts me in every way possible. Not just through legal matters, but through social matters. I've been told I matter less, I've been told I'm foolish, I've been told I'm not up to par with an adult, just because I'm younger.

God dammit, it's not like being 18 makes you automatically better! I've climbed mountains, and at the top of a mountain, you're pretty equal to the next guy who climbed the same one. I've carried a pack about 1/3 my weight for 50 miles. I think I'm at least an equal to that guy over there who's 19 and a total loser; complete druggie, going nowhere but down.

I've always thought you have to hit the wall as hard as possible to realize there is no wall. It happened on my backpacking trip. It's happened with academia. It's happened with programming. It's happened with school. It's happened with becoming me. It's happened with finding myself. It's happened with overcoming my depression.

I came out better for it; but this leash keeps me from hitting the wall labelled ''adult''."
1mjulg,2,2013-09-16,What do employers want in an intern?,evomax01,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/1mjulg/what_do_employers_want_in_an_intern/,"Hi. I've gotten a toehold into this field by passing the P exam a couple of months ago. Right now, I'm just getting my ass kicked in this topology class. I doubt that I'll have to know any of it to be a successful actuarial intern, so right now I'm thinking about taking a lighter load this semester and plan on passing exam FM during December.

I've switched my major around, so the only actuary-related course is a AP-stat equivalent stats course, and a regression half-course this semester, and possibly intro microecon. 

I don't think passing exam FM this December is a stretch, so given I have that much, what else can I do to make sure that I get an internship this summer? It's very important since I'm a junior (I know, I should have gotten on this career shit earlier) and this is my last summer break before graduation.

Any help would be appreciated.

However, I was a little surprised receiving the call, and while I did ask about the salary and benefits, I really did not negotiate at all. The recruiter sent me an email listing the base salary and all benefits, and I am supposed to call her on Thursday regarding my acceptance of the position. From what I can gather by reading about the company online, they have pretty strict salary practices. But I definitely want to at least try to ask for a higher salary or a signing bonus. How should I go about doing this? Negotiating by email certainly seems unprofessional, should I send an email asking if I can briefly talk to her by phone? And if so, how should I phrase my email?

Just to provide some more details, the job is out of state and requires me to move, so I think a signing bonus is reasonable. However, it is only an entry level position and as a recent college grad I don't know how much bargaining power I would have. Any advice would be greatly appreciated! "

This spring, I will graduate with a BS in international relations and a minor in business. I have an excellent GPA (3.9), but no extracurricular activities or internships, aside from helping my brother start his own business and working there part time. Up until now, I was planning on going to law school. Because law school admissions decisions are almost entirely determined by LSAT score and GPA, it always seemed more beneficial to spend more time studying and keeping my grades near-perfect than it did to spend that time ""getting involved"". 

After hearing constant horror stories about the legal job market, I've decided to pursue a career in accounting instead. My question is, where do I go from here? Should I enroll in a master's of accounting program and simply go back to take the necessary undergrad credits? Or should I go back for a second bachelor's in accounting? And what sorts of extracurricular activities should I get involved with? What steps should I be taking to kickstart a career in international accounting? or consulting? Should I aim for my CPA?

Any sincere advice is greatly appreciated. If you can point me towards some helpful books, websites, or other external resources, that would be useful as well. Oh, and it's worth noting that I'd like to transfer to a better school as well.

I was wondering, how should I go about applying to these agencies to try and work out an internship? Should I call or email their contact person? Should I just send my resume if they don't ask for a cover letter or would it be better for me to write cover letters regardless?

**Victim Rate Skyrockets**

As the number of night victims continues to climb, the town council has **mandated** the upgrade of wooden planks to metal ones used to board up ALL housing entrances. Housing entrances include doors, windows, pet screen doors and any semblance of holes that enable entrance into your home. We emphasize that this upgrade is mandatory effective September 16th, 2013. The deadline to perform this mandatory upgrade is Friday, September 20th and any house found with any trace of wooden boards during the daily twilight sweep will be marked with the scarlet X. Members of the household will be quarantined in the town lock-up for 100 days and 99 nights. The mandatory metal planks can be found at any convenience store near your house. The old wooden planks must be left out by the night of Friday September 20th for Special Removal Services to pick up. The town council has also issued a reminder to strengthen the salt circles around your house. P&amp;G's Lunascence 1-Gallon Salt Gels are highly recommended over the regular crystal salts. These too can be found at any convenience store in Crescentville. 
***

**IMPORTANT NOTICE**

Effective September 16th 2013, curfew time is changed from 6 P.M. (1800 hours) to 5 P.M. (1700 hours). The sirens will begin at five o'clock sharp and end precisely after half an hour. Begin bolting your locks and boarding up the entrances *before* the sirens end. Anyone caught outside your houses after the sirens have stopped and the entrances have been boarded MUST contact Crescentville's Special Night Armed Forces immediately. The precinct will dispatch cruisers to your rescue right away. But we urge you to please abide to curfew times. Be *inside* a building at least 15 minutes before the sirens begin. Start the Bolt and Board procedure early. The earlier you are locked away inside a building, the safer you are. In this battle against the night people, precaution is key. 
***

**JOB LISTING:**

1. Special Night Armed Forces Intern - With the increasing number of night people hauntings, the SNAF is recruiting interns for vigorous training against these entities. Capable candidates will be hired right away. Pay is negotiable and adjustable to your qualifications. Any able bodies welcome. Individuals with previous military and combat experience will be placed in high priority. 
Any interested candidates should report to the Special Night Armed Forces headquarters on Tomken and Kennedy Drive anytime in the day. Memorize SNAF Mission Statement and Risk Oath before reporting to HQ. 

2. Science Center Student Researchers - In the midst of the night crisis, teams in the Science Center are urgently trying to construct a temporary machine that emit sun rays to counteract the night. We urge any students with appropriate qualifications to come forth and offer assistance with the creation of the Solar Machine. Apply on the Scientific Developments section of the Crescentville Website. 
***

Our deepest condolences to all the families of night victims, including Mayor Ernest Willower, whose daughter Jennifer Willower is included in this week's victim count. The weekly mass memorial will be held in Crescentville Cemetery on Saturday mornings as usual. Visitation hours are from noon to 4 P.M. (1600 hours). The cemetery MUST be evacuated before night falls. Mourn your loved ones, but let them be a reminder to be ever vigilant in these dark times. Evening soccer practice and any kind of outdoor activities after dark are canceled for the rest of the year as winter approaches. This winter will be a harsh one, with longer nights and colder winds, conditions in which the night people thrive. Children are more susceptible to the night people. Keep them inside throughout the winter. 

Until the next issue, be safe and be well. "

-very sad the majority of my family I invited can't come 

-sad we don't get nice family portraits that aren't funeral-related 

-sad I have so many deceased family members who can't come 

-angry that some family didn't even bother to RSVP they aren't coming 

-excited to see the family members that are coming 

-excited to meet a four-year-old nephew for the first time! 

-feeling... unappreciated, I guess, that I put so much work into designing a really guest-focused, welcoming weekend, and the reality is the wedding just isn't that important to the majority of people, no matter how much I want it to be 

-feeling like I missed the boat for wedding excitement in my friends group, most of whom got married from 20-23. It's three years since the last set got married, and I feel like most of them are just kind of over weddings, and I'm all, ooooh, yay flags! 

-feeling really over-the-top loved and blessed that a friend who is in South Africa for an internship, a friend who I originally planned on standing up with me, is putting in the effort to Skype in for the ceremony in the middle of the night his time.  

-nervous as hell that the tech won't work 

-sad that the food got pared down to ""functional"" instead of ""fantastic"" 

-pleased we scored a cheap caterer willing to work with us 

-pleased we've saved as much money as we have 

-upset we've spent as much money as we have

Last year, I interned at a NPR affiliate radio station producing, editing and writing stories for air. Over the course of my one-year internship, I had about 18 pieces that made it on the radio. I also interned at another nationally syndicated radio show (recently ranked in the Top 100 iTunes podcast) at the same time. I edited interviews with big named celebrities and eventually got to produce interviews and fill in as a producer a couple times. 

I thought I produced some good work and submitted some of my radio pieces for awards. This year, I ended up winning 4 journalism awards, one of them being a national award from the Associated Press.

After winning these awards and having 2 years of internship experience, I thought I would be able to find an entry-level job. The only job I landed after my internships was a position as a writers' assistant in reality tv. The only reason I got it was because I knew someone who worked at the company. I worked there for 6 months and was laid-off this past summer when the show's production ended. 

Since then, I have applied to at least 10 jobs a day (no exaggeration) and only landed about four interviews, three of them being out of state. I produce radio pieces for practice and attend professional radio meet-ups to network and show off my work. I also have contacted almost every single one of my past employers asking for help. 

With every day passing, I can't help but feel more helpless. I'm not sure if I should continue on my career path as a radio journalist or if I should go back to school for computer programming or something lucrative. I feel like I've done everything I could and I don't know what to do next.

Quick question. I've worked as a planner (intern position) for 6 months in Ogilvy and Mather in Europe. I want to move to London. I'm wondering how difficult it is to get a job there, in planning. And is 6 months too short? Even if I could get a good reference?
I have academic qualifications in advertising, if that helps.
I'm not sure I would be willing to take any other position than planning. Should I aim for that. Or realistically, am I not being realistic enough?

1mjex2,3,2013-09-16,Working towards a new year and a new self,[deleted],NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1mjex2/working_towards_a_new_year_and_a_new_self/,"Please forgive my long-windedness. I don't know how many of these tl;dr posts actually get read but it doesn't really matter - I want to get it off of my chest.

I'm a 20-year-old male living on the East Coast of the US. I don't even know exactly how long I've been using porn. It must be something like 10 years. I've been masturbating for almost as long.

I can sympathize with what seems to be a very common story: increasing thresholds for explicit content, desensitization, etc. When I was very young my parents confronted me about what they found on our computer but I didn't stop. That should have been a warning sign to me, but, as a lot of young men can probably attest, when the conditioning gets in that early, before decision-making skills have really had the time to mature, it can be a nasty habit to kick.

I got religion, so to speak, when I was 15. I can't imagine where I would be right now if I hadn't latched onto some kind of value system that early in young adulthood. Thank God, I have no interest in the kinds of horrifyingly exploitative and sometimes illegal stuff that caught my impressionable and internet-reared brain when I was younger, but after 5 years of trying to kick the habit I still find myself returning to pornography when stressed and having an interest in extreme sorts of content that, intellectually, I know is unhealthy from every possible perspective. I'm sick of it. I spent much of my high school years abnormally unmotivated, exhausted, and emotionally desensitized. While I know there was a lot more than just PMO at work there, I also know that years of frequent and persistent self-abuse certainly didn't help. It was only recently that I realized that this was an addiction, and one that needed to be confronted as one. I couldn't just shrug it off and expect myself to quit. It is a recurring, conditioned behavior that started before I was able to discern any better and has made me a shell of a person. I have had so many interests and passions that I have abandoned halfway, partially because of a lack of trust in myself and partially because of my own lack of commitment and emotional wherewithal.

My parents split up a little over two years ago. What was supposed to be an amicable separation turned into months (and years, now) of hateful conflict, manipulation, and emotional abuse from members of my family that I trusted. I left college after my first semester because I was feeling burnt out. I didn't bother taking my finals. I left friends and student organizations that were counting on me hanging because of my own confusion and exhaustion. Since then, I have been trying to rebuild myself. I spent the last year working as an intern with a community that serves the poor in Canada. I've been able to prove to myself that I can commit to things that are difficult and see them through to the end, but there's still a lot ahead of me. I look at people my age doing the things I want to do - making music, making art, serving their communities, doing meaningful work and succeeding academically - and, if I'm being perfectly honest, it can be a bit discouraging. When I look at portfolio requirements for art school, I realize how much people my age who are flourishing creatively are expected to have done by this point in their lives. It feels like poking my head out of a cave and realizing that the world has been going on without me while I was caught up in all kinds of psychological snares I stepped in years ago. I know it sounds silly and self-pitying, especially because I *am* very young, and I recognize that but it's how I feel, and I need to be honest and realistic with myself about it. 

So, I've decided to make this coming year a ""Jubilee Year"" of sorts. I want to be free of the bullshit I've let myself get caught up in and commit to the things and people that matter to me. With the help of a gradual reform of my diet, a more rigorous excercise routine, and antidepressants I've been lifted part-way out of a fog that has been strangling me for longer than I can remember, but there's still a lot of work to be done. Most importantly,  I *need* to quit PMO. I'm pretty sure it's the single greatest drain on my physical and emotional energy and my psychological health. My loved ones deserve better of me, and I deserve better of myself. As of right now, I am going to commit to being porn-and-masturbation-free, with everything that will require of me. Over the next year, I am going to commit to practicing and recording music with *real* regularity. I am going to *finally* pick up the martial art I have said I was going to for years and attend practice more than once a week. I am going to make a list of novels I've missed out on and finally just fucking read them by the end of next summer. I am going to put out the first issue of the zine I've been talking about for months by early Spring. I am going to start practicing a craft, even if it's only very rudimentary. 

But it needs to start now, with a commitment to stop PMO. Thanks so much for providing me with a framework within to begin the process and such an encouraging community to help along the way. "

Mike's personalities keep appearing, each predicting that something bad is going to happen until Mike wakes up.  We go to Boney Island, where Lightning was ""banished"" last episode to look for a Chris head immunity idol, Lightning is failing. At the hotel, Jo comments that she hopes Lightning fails to find the Chris head immunity idol while she is given steak to eat and brings up the possibility of voting Lightning off. The Vultures seem fine with this. Heather is watching Alejandro get a massage on his legs, with an intern doing it. She angrily orders him to stop hogging the masseuse. He ignores her, saying that if he could feel her arms, that they must be magical. Heather groans about Alejandro's legs still being asleep, while he says that he believes they'll never wake up. At the beach, Chris then announces that the contestants have to find seven 3D puzzle pieces that were buried under the sand and assemble the pieces to from a a landmarks from one of the countries visited in Total Drama World Tour. Additionally, the contestants have to be careful of booby traps. As the winners of the previous challenge, the Villains are rewarded shovels to aid them in the challenge while the Heroes have to dig with their hands. The Hamsters are organized in their execution, while the Vultures are in disarray. Hilarity ensues, Alejandro reveals his legs are actually awake, Mike's other four personalities speak in fear of ""The Malevolent One"", and eventually the Hamsters win because Lightning miscounted the Vultures' pieces and ruins what they already had. Sam volunteers to go to Boney is,and for a chance to find the immunity idol, and the Vultures vote out Lightning for being an arrogant idiot.

Analysis: This episode saw a lot of character development for Sam, while showing the unity between Mike's other personalities. I think this supposed fifth personality, the Malevolent One, could be interesting and possibly work out to be the season's main antagonist. We also get to see Sierra has become a total nut job since her withdrawal from Cody, as she constantly blogs about the cast. With this, officially want Sierra go e next. 

Second, Alejandro shows promise of being a long lasting character again. He effectively keeps the charade he has lost feeling in his legs, and has kinda sunk into the background of the cast. Gwen is mopping around, all sad about being a Villain, and needs to get her act together. Right now, I think either Alejandro, for the aforementioned reasons, or Sam has the best chance at winning. Sam because he is not only the friendliest person in the game, but also much more helpful to his team this time around. I think the person who is going home next is either Gwen if the Villains lose, for mopping around, or Sierra if the Heroes lose, for being a whack-job. 

Finally, Lightning going home was great. I hated him last season, he's gotten more annoying this season. I'm just glad the Villains came to their senses and got him out and not Jo. He placed highly last year, so it was no surprise that he went out early this year, but I'm just glad I barely had to put up with him.

So these are just my thoughts, if you have and questions or additional thoughts, feel free to post them in the comments, and until next Wednesday, that's all the TDAS for now.

Advice?",[deleted],psychology,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychology/comments/1mo558/want_to_be_psychologist_not_sure_if_i_can_make_it/,"I'm going into my final year of undergraduate school (yay) and if all goes well I'll have a BA in Psychology with a minor in sexualities studies by the end of spring. 

I want to be a clinical psychologist that specializes in deviant sexualities. For some that would mean ""kink friendly"" for others it would just mean I'm familiar with the issues of being gay/trans/everything else. I'm sort of thinking that's not feasible though. 

The problem is, my grades aren't *great*. I only have a 3.0. My academic counselor basically said I'd probably be better off getting a Masters before getting my PhD if I want to be competitive at all. Even if I was able to convince someone to look past my grades, would they have the expertise required to teach me about issues with people with differing sexualities? I can't just go into it with only experience with normal every day problems, I have to study under people who know what they're doing. 

And I'm kinda broke. My family has nothing, they can't help me pay for school. I'm living on loans and financial aid. I'm lucky in that my BA is costing me about $15,000 because I get a lot of money from federal aid (it could have been a lot less but I'm terrible with money and certain life situations didn't agree with me). I don't know if I can afford a masters program. I know I can't go into a PsyD, that's just too expensive. A PhD would have to be one where they pay me to work for them while I do my degree (there's a name for that, forgot it). I really don't think Anyone will take me straight from my BA though. 

I'm working on getting lab experience, and I'm thinking about getting an internship if I can (it would be unpaid, of course. There's nothing legal available to undergrad students), but I'm worried I just won't get where I want to go. 

I was thinking of taking a year off after my BA to work on getting nice letters of recommendation and lab experience and whatever else I can find to make me look good on paper. 

I don't know where to go. I don't want to be in debt for the rest of my life (I know it's pretty much unavoidable at this point but I can dream right?). I'd like to open a private practice some day, but I don't even know how to go about doing that. I'm scared I'm not interesting enough on paper to catch anyone's attention. 

Advice? Grad programs you recommend (in California, preferably)? Similar stories?

I follow it up with the same trick she did earlier, an [invert into a inside leg hang. Except, I add my own twist on it - I throw in a jade split.](http://i.imgur.com/D8PDGSv.gif)

Rich is smiling. He is transfixed. Alex is leaning back in his chair, his face going ""whoa"". That jade split never fails to impress. This is when I'm at my best, when I feel most alive - when I'm performing, and the crowd is putty in my hands. Granted, the conditions here at Joker weren't ideal (I like taller ceilings for drops, and more room for spins) but I could work with this. For these 4 minutes, I am flying.

Okay, there's my flexibility move. Next: strength moves. I do a [shoulder mount into a kneehold, transitioning into the superman.](http://i.imgur.com/HgP02GP.gif)

I can see that Rich is delighted. ""LOOK!"" he says, as I am settling into the kneehold. I grab my breasts and jiggle them at him again for maximum effect. ""Babe, look!"" He nudges her. At this point, Sparkles is pointedly looking away from me, refusing to watch the show. Alex is throwing more money on the table as I dance, and I am glad to be getting tipped on top of what he paid for the private dance.

Let's finish strong. I do what I consider one of the most beautiful pole tricks in my repertoire - a [pop-up butterfly, followed by an extended butterfly.](http://i.imgur.com/tvYe4tk.gif)

At some point, Sparkles gets up, presumably to leave. I don't know how, or what exactly happened. All I know is that I was upside down, and couldn't really see much - and that when I dropped into that extended butterfly, my foot comes in contact with her arm or her shoulder, and I knock her drink out of her hand, spilling it on the wide expanse of her stomach. 

""Sorry!"" I call out. Then, more playfully, ""I *TOLD* you. Don't say I didn't warn you!"" It was not the first time I'd knocked someone's drink over. Once I accidentally kicked a waitress in the head while doing a spin. Usually people understand and know it was an accident, and that there was no malicious intent behind it.

Not Sparkles, though. ""WHATTHEFUCK!!!"" she shrieks. 

""Sorry!"" I say, again. I'm going full Canadian now.

""YOU FUCKING DID THAT ON PURPOSE!"" 

In my haste to apologize, I've fallen out of my extended butterfly and land both feet on the table top with a clash of lucite on wood. Not the most graceful exit. ""Nonono!"" I protest. ""I didn't see you!""

""FUCK YOU,"" she bellows at me. ""Skinny fucking whore! Who the fuck do you think you are? You come into MY fucking club and think you're so much better than anyone else because you're skinny and you're from the city!""

Well, okay, it's true. I did kind of think that.

""WELL YOU'RE NOT. You're a fucking cokehead! You throw up everything you eat! That's why you're so skinny! You know why you haven't done any dances tonight? Because nobody wants to see anorexic little boys! I've had kids! I'm not some skinny little twig!"" She is histrionic, throwing any and all accusations and excuses that come to mind at me.

For some reason I think the situation is still salvageable, and I am still trying to apologize and soothe things over. ""I'm so sorry. I didn't see you! I swear I didn't do it on purpose! I'll buy you another drink!""

""Go back to Atlanta and go back to sucking dicks for money!"" And then for final emphasis, she throws the remainder of her drink on me and turns heel.

The bouncer has taken his sweet time making it over here, and now that he has, he simply hands me a bar towel and asks, ""you have another outfit?"" I nod yes, and he points to the dressing room. I am expected to finish my shift.

I go to the dressing room and I change. A girl is sitting back there, feet up on the counter, playing with her phone. ""It sucks out there,"" she says by way of explanation.

""Yeah.""

""Don't mind Sparkles. That bitch is crazy."" 

Like I said before, the other girls in the club seemed pretty nice. I actually do a little better afterwards, because the other girls talk me up to their customers as ""that girl from Atlanta who's really good on the pole."" I guess I'm a novelty, and I manage to sell a few more private dances that night, but it never really picks up. Sparkles avoids me, though once I come within earshot of her complaining to another dancer about ""that fucking slut who tried to steal my customer.""

When 2AM rolls around, the bar starts closing down. The manager looks at me and motions towards main stage: I have the last set of the night. I sigh - people aren't even bothering to tip at this point. My feet hurt. I'm not used to doing more than maybe 4 or 5 stage sets a night. I grudgingly clamber onto the stage and spend two songs walking back and forth, refusing to expend more effort than absolutely necessary. Afterwards, I make my way back to the dressing room, glad that the night was finally over. As I strip off my outfit, I dig around in my bag for an empty ziploc bag to put it in. I notice that something seems amiss. My outfits have been tossed around, scattered outside of their packages. My eye alights on one of my favorite outfits, [a bright fuschia, sequined number](http://i.imgur.com/440kvsh.jpg).

Someone had shredded it beyond recognition. Broken sequins littered the floor by my chair. Presumably the same someone had also gone through my makeup bag and scrawled ""BITCH"" and ""WHORE"" across the portion of mirror facing my stuff in black eyeliner, then tossed the nub of the pencil on the floor.  

I look around, and aside from myself, find the dressing room empty. Everybody else had already gotten dressed, and the bouncer was now walking groups of three back to their cars. The manager comes in and asks me for my tip out. I end up paying a total of $70 in house fees, and going home with $90. 

Fuck small town clubs. 

I haven't been back to the Joker Lounge since.

Epilogue:

My internship got extended (yay!) and these days, when I feel the urge to hit the stage, I drive an hour up I-20 to Columbia, South Carolina and work in a club there. I don't mind the drive. They have flexible hours, good management, and low house fees. It's a very nice, high end club, and I make decent money there. Mostly I just have a blast on stage and I don't focus too much on selling private dances these days.

I'd like to thank FPS with providing me with the inspiration to lose weight. Having always been a fairly svelte girl, I started gaining weight last year from poor eating habits while writing my thesis. I'd written it off as ""getting curvy"" until I started reading FPS and realized that pattern of thinking was the beginnings of fatlogic. Since June 12th, I've lost a total of 14 pounds. I'm about 2-5 pounds away from my goal weight. No tricks or secrets, just good ol' counting calories. 


Also, if I may plug a project of my own - I'm doing a mathematical modeling project based on the [Chow-Hall (2011) model](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/15/science/a-mathematical-challenge-to-obesity.html?_r=0) for shits and giggles and I need more data sets. Does anyone here have detailed records of their caloric intake and weight over time? Right now my n=1, and it seems to show that 70 calories (~an oreo cookie and a half) a day is the difference between reaching my goal weight on November 4th versus reaching my goal weight on October 8th. What I like about my model is that it takes history into account - I input my caloric intake every day, and the date of reaching the goal adjusts based on if I overate/underate. Basically it's a more sophisticated version of the myfitnesspal ""if every day was like today, you would weigh xyz in 5 weeks"" screen. It also takes into account your BMR dropping as a result of decreased weight, though for me it's really only a difference of about 60 calories between 128 pounds and 115 pounds. It kind-of sort-of not really accounts for exercise as well. Send me a PM if you want to contribute some data - I'd really appreciate it!"

A little background which may or may not be relevant but maybe helps you understand where I'm coming from:  I've been coding off and on (mostly off) for about seven years -- I wrote a couple of programs in Perl in college to handle large data sets and process batches of gene files, then about a year and a half ago, I started slowly learning JavaScript and Ruby with the intent of getting out of science research and changing into development as a career field, but through all of this, I was more or less only doing very small things (I built [this](http://platespotting.herokuapp.com)!  Yes, I know it's silly.), no big involved projects.  About six months ago, I got into a competitive development internship where we were thrown headfirst into a production environment with an extant code base for a huge website (I helped build a homebrew CMS in Python/Django, with flecks of JS here and there).  It was definitely a learning experience, and I'm now in a position where the internship is over and am job-hunting/building my skills.  

So here's the thing -- from the very beginning, I was using a lot of tools that I'd never ever even knew existed, much less used before.  I became reasonably competent at operating most of them, but in the rush to develop my hard programming skills and pick up basic conceptual stuff (I majored in molecular biology, minored in math, so a lot of CS stuff is foreign to me), I never really got a grasp on *why* we used a lot of things.  I am fairly certain I used a Debian 6 Squeeze x64 base Vagrant box with some custom modifications.  I used VirtualBox to manage a few different virtual machines.  But... why?  

So, now, while I'm trying to build my overall skills and have unhindered time while I job hunt, I want to understand more about the why/when things like that are useful.  What circumstances would one want to build virtual machines for working on projects instead of just using the native environment?  When you do decide you want to use something like that, how do you know what environment you want to use, and what is specifically appealing about using something like Vagrant when VirtualBox seems to give you access to a virtual environment without another layer of abstraction?  I've got a lot to learn, but I think completely understanding what I have been working with and become somewhat familiar with is a good stepping stone.  Thanks for reading all of this and thanks in advance for your answers -- I am just knowledgeable enough to know that I know essentially nothing, so, really, any guidance y'all might have on things that an intermediate beginner would find useful for developing relevant skills would be welcomed.

**tl;dr: Why do we use Vagrant/VirtualBox/virtual environments in general?  How do you decide when/which to use for what kinds of projects?  Help a sister out.**  "

CMV",Halbrium,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1mn96j/i_think_the_television_show_dexter_is_best/,"I feel like every season subsequent to the fourth season of Dexter is tired, contrived, and suffers from ""wheel spinning"" plots such as ""Quinn suspects Dexter"", ""Creepy Masuka intern guy"", and ""Pretty much anything to do with anyone else at Miami Metro, *The Country's Worst Police Force™*""

Who can forget classic television moments like  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlZnbagyj6c

I feel like Biney, Lila, Miguel, and Trinity each touched upon a critical area of Dexter's psyche. They brought interesting ideas for the character to explore and the series ending with Dexter finding Rita dead with Harrison in a pool of his mother's blood just as Harry found Dexter brings the series full circle. It shows that Dexter's lifestyle has consequences while giving him a chance to not make the same mistakes again with his son.

I really enjoyed the first four seasons of this show. It's sad how unwatchable the show is now. It was so jarring after Breaking Bad's ""Ozymandias"" to turn on Dexter and see the stilted dialogue and uneven performances."

I get a call sometime a week later saying its ""John from so and so company"" and they want to have an interview sometime later this week. He said he could make it convenient by coming onto campus.

I am currently a pre-junior (our school operates on a five year timeline with three co-op cycles, hence why I call it a pre-junior instead of just junior, even though I am entering my third year this October) studying computer engineering. I did my first co-op (which are six month ""internships"", and I quote the internship because it's technically six months of full time work, though no full-time benefits) at a webDev/eCommerce company. All of the work was programming-based, and though I initially chose CE for its hardware and software potentials, it's safe to say I fell in love with working with software. My second co-op I will be working on both hardware and software, so we will see how that goes.

I am currently thinking long-term (it's that time of my life :P) prospects, and the netsec discipline has been fascinated me for some time.

The questions I bring on the table pertains to co-ops/internships for netsec companies:

1. What is it like working for a network security company?

2. What type of knowledge/skills is absolutely necessary for employment for a netsec firm?

3. How much do you learn on the job?

4. How does a college student like me whom is interested in a co-op with these companies start networking? Get experience?

I do have a preference for companies - at that is small-to-midsized firms. Teams should be small, focused around talented people working together. Passion is very important to me, as you can say I find the passion and enthusiasm of people very contagious. It seems for the netsec industry, small-to-midsized firms shouldn't be an issue, as most firms *are* small to midsized. Would you consider antivirus companies like Norton to be a ""netsec"" company?

1mmivm,1,2013-09-18,Need Advice on Christian Relationship/Timing,ScotchandClass,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1mmivm/need_advice_on_christian_relationshiptiming/,"Hey guys!  So I've just finished my second year of an internship at my church and last may I confessed my affection for a girl who was in first year of doing the same thing.

She liked me too and we spent the summer not dating but spending all of our time together with friends hanging out.  We grew closer and stronger in our relationship, but not dating because she wasn't sure if she would be really ready or not when she began her second year.

Well, last Saturday she told me that she can't do it.  She can't handle the emotional requirement to date AND devote herself fully to the church and the internship.  

I totally understand, and am at peace about letting her be all who God wants her to be and to devote herself to this season.

Here's the issue: I can't tell if she's fully closed the door on me for a relationship in the future.  She told me that she still likes me and cares for me and that we're still great friends first and foremost.  But it's been a few days and she's totally shut me out from her life.  When I see her she's so happy an seems non-chalant about ""breaking up"" even though it was tough for her to tell me.  

It's been rough the past few days emotionally and I don't know what to do.  I want to fight for our relationship and wait for her.  But now I have to lay aside all of my emotions for her and be her friend without being intentional and pursuing her.  It's harder still because I work for our church, lead at the same campus and have the same friend group.

I don't know if she will still like me and if I should hold out or not.  I don't know how to just drop my feelings for her and be her friend while I watch other guys hit on her, when I see her in church, etc.  

I know I need to respect her decision and her space and let her be, but my emotions are the point where I don't know what to do.  I don't want to go to her so early since our discussion and tell her my feelings and my intent to wait.  She had said that she didn't want to keep me in a state of limbo when she wouldn't know when she would be ready and that it would be unfair to me.  

But I want to be with her and I want to wait.  She's worth it to me.

I guess I'm just asking for your advice and insight.  I've never been in a relationship let alone be in this state of limbo.  She means so much to me and I think we could really have some together.  

Also, I could use some prayer for my emotions and my peace.  I feel like God keeps bringing me back to Psalm 37:3 where David says, ""Trust in The Lord and do good, dwell in the land and feed on His faithfulness.""  But I'm not sure what it could mean.

Thanks guys!

TL;DR: I'm confused about a potential relationship with a girl who needs space and wants me to be just friends.  I don't know if I should wait for her or move on but I know that I want to be with her and need advice."

So as the title implies I will be applying for a summer internship at the IB divisions in London next summer. 

Have just finished up my cover letter and resume for the application processes but just wanted to get a honest opinion on my chances for getting in. I know that my resume is only part of the process of getting in and the end result will mostly be dependent on my performance during the possible interviews I will get. But would still appreciate your time and attention :).

So here goes.

Currently in my last year of an International Business  bachelor programme at one of the top continental European business schools (think Bocconi, SSE,  RSM, St Gallen) and have a GPA which is around 3.7-3.8 (converting it from another grading system). I have worked in a real estate Private Equity firm in London as a summer intern last summer. Have also worked doing market-research the summer before but this is not really finance related. Am currently on exchange for a semester to a semi-target US business school. Here I am primarily focusing on finance courses. Besides academic/work experience I have been chairman of a student investment group and have active at a rotary club for a few years. Furthermore, I have worked as a Finance tutor for other students as a part-time job and have done some fund-raising for my fraternity (raised ~20k euros from new sponsors).

Please give an honest opinion :)"

--

We have been in a long distance (1200mi) relationship for almost a year now. Actually, our one year anniversary is coming up this weekend. I feel like I should be totally excited, after all, it's my first ever committed relation that has lasted this long, and it has all gone so well. But this past month has been emotional for me.

--

We met each other when I was doing a 6 month internship for a company out in Nebraska, at the time, she was going to school at UNL. I should say we met within my last month of being there, and really, everything happened extremely fast. At the time, I didn't want to commit on being in a relationship, not long distance anyways. I'm pretty affectionate for a guy, thus I knew the distance would kill me. But we both knew how we felt about each other, so I decided to be strong, and give it a go.

--

Fast forward a few months, we were still very passionate. While we couldn't be physically intimate with each other, we had our way through phone, texting, and Skype... and this was practically a daily thing with us. There was the constant I ""love you"" being bounced back and forth, sending selfies 24/7, we even left our laptops open with Skype on so we could fall asleep together.

--

This all went on for about 5-7 months but it started to slow down. However, she got to spend almost the entire summer with me when I was doing a 6-month internship down in Virginia. (and hear I am tearing up as I am writing this) You don't realize how truly special someone is until they are taken away from you. I got so use to coming back to my apartment, with her waiting for me, smiling as I returned home from work. It was a amazing feeling. She couldn't stay all the way through August as she had to fly-out and get back home so she could prepare for graduate school back in Nebraska.

--

Our last two weeks together were emotionally rough, and I for one, especially for being a guy, cried so much when I had to kiss and hug her goodbye at the airport, not knowing how long it will be until we are together again. When she left, that entire week I was so depressed. 

--

Now I am back at school, and she is too, and its been almost two months since we have, well, ""gotten off"" to each other. The ""love yous"" are minimal, and it seems the only time it is said is when I initiate it first. Going through my text messages, 90% of them are my girlfriend saying ""I love you too"" or ""I miss you too"".

--

One night, she said she was under some stress with her work. I told her I know a good way to relieve some of that stress ;) Her response was, ""It sounds like *YOU* need to relieve yourself."" I was taken back by it as I felt she was only going to sext me because I wanted to, not because she wanted to. And yes, I confronted her about it. I told how I had been feeling, like how we hardly say I love you to each other and how we have yet to pleasure one another. I even proceeded to ask her if she was no longer attractive to me and she said ""No, no, it's not that at all."" I mean, she has clearly stated to me there isn't a problem then proceeds to say we can get off. By then, the mood was ruined and nothing happened that night, nor was anything said about it.

--

Fast forward one more month (current times here now) and our communication has just been awkward. I almost don't even feel like talking because I'm thinking she needs space away from me. I decided to go ahead and communicate that to her and she reassured me how everything is fine. ""We are fine."" When I asked about our sex life again, she said it's because she has been busy and hormones effect whether or not she's horny. It's like I get that, but for almost two months, you mean to tell me you haven't had the slightest urge to get off with me. Not unless I say something and even then, nothing happens. She really didn't have a response. I feel like if she does anything now, sext or whatever, it will feel forced because I have brought it up three times in the past few months.

--

So here we are now, a year into our relationship, and our goodnight messages, well, they are just that, ""goodnight"". I'll occasionally toss in a ""I love you"" and I will get the usual response, ""I love you too."" I really don't know what to think of all this. When I say ""I love you"", I do mean it. But I'm almost afraid to keep saying it if her 'too' replies are not true. I've told her this before that sometimes its nice to hear her say it first... but it hardly seems to happen.

I'm lost here Reddit.

**tl;dr**: Long distance relationship feels like it is coming to a winding stop."
1mmgd8,0,2013-09-18,Trouble with my major,JosephStylin,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1mmgd8/trouble_with_my_major/,"Right now I'm a sophomore studying industrial engineering.  I originally intended to study mechanical, but I didn't make the cut.  Before college, the only two majors I was deciding between were engineering and cinematography.  Engineering because I had an interest in middle school which kind of diminished throughout highschool, and cinematography because I am actually interested in it.  The only reason I chose engineering was because it was more financially stable.  My first semester went pretty well, I managed a 3.4 with the effort I put in.  However, my effort level and motivation has significantly decreased since then, and the difficulty of my courses has increased.  In my spring semester I pledged a fraternity which ended up consuming a lot of time and I ended up being on the edge for many classes, failing to complete all of my homeworks, and holding myself to a much lower standard than my fall semester.  I also suffered from a general lack of motivation to get my shit done because after succeeding my first semester I thought I could just cruise through, which was a pretty dumb mistake.  But I also took my first college physics course and struggled pretty hard.  My main issue was that even when I did go to lecture I couldn't pay attention because I just didn't care.  I literally had 0 interest in what I was doing.  It was kind of like I was going to class for the grade and not for the education.  I'm still doing this now.  My spring semester I pulled a 2.1 GPA.  I was on the verge of getting a C in 4 classes and I got a C in all 4 of those class.

I had an internship over the summer where I worked in a manufacturing plant.  I honestly didn't really do that much because I wasn't motivated at all and due to a lack of interest, granted what I was doing was pretty menial and bitchwork.  

On to the point I'm looking for advice for.  I'm about 4 weeks into my 3rd semester and its starting to look like my spring semester all over again.  Everytime I go to class I can't pay attention because I legitimately hate it.  I hate all of my homework and I hate all of my curriculum.  I don't have an ounce of interest in what I'm doing.  The only motivation I have is to get a degree so I can make money and not be a failure but at this point my hatred for my course work is overriding that motivation.  I'm still trying to get all my work done, but I'm taking every shortcut I can and missing out on a lot of information which basically ends up setting me back when exams come around the corner and I find out I don't really know anything, and then I get stressed as fuck and hate my life.  Now exams are rolling around and they won't stop.  My spring semester I had an exam pretty much every week for about 2 months straight and it was awful, and now that shits about to start again and I'm not sure I can make it through without fucking up.  I know I need to get organized and get my shit together but at what cost.

I need to figure out soon whether or not I should continue down this path or make a life course change and go into cinematography where I won't have a guaranteed paycheck but at least I won't hate my life.  My main concern is that I feel like shit for wasting my parents money like this when I know its tight, but I also don't want to fuck up by making the wrong career choice and be depressed for the rest of my life.  I was a straight A student in highschool so the motivation for success was there at some point.  

Should I stick with it and stop being a pussy or reconsider how I'm choosing to live the rest of my life?  Honestly at this point I feel like some anonymous opinions will help me.  Obviously I'm going to talk with my parents at some point, I just want a level head before I discuss this with them.  I did briefly discuss it over the summer and I ended up deciding to give it another shot after my internship, but now that I'm back in the same situation I feel like I may have made a big mistake.

Thanks for reading if you've made it this far.  Any input is appreciated.

1mmfrw,11,2013-09-18,I feel lonely and terrible.,tw_guy,MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1mmfrw/i_feel_lonely_and_terrible/,"I'm due for conscription next year and I'm really not looking forward to it. Also receiving my diploma around the same time. I'm stuck in a country I dislike, and I have spent years, years just thinking if I could just leave this country if I had the money and settle somewhere else. It is a goal that I am very determined to push through and make it work. The place here is so dead to me, that I don't even bother about the people. It's like an empty shell I just want to leave at the earliest opportunity. 

I don't have much friends around me, and I mostly spend time locked up at home. My internship's coming up next month, and I'm worried about handling office politics (already heard people saying stuff that hurt behind me, before even before I officially start there).

It's embarrassing, but I've tried to talk to girls on dating sites in desperation (I'm 20 and I've never had any prior rs) and I fail at each attempt. The first never texted me back, and they're usually fairly short replies and so I moved away. And then I met another who was so sweet and chatty, but somehow stopped talking to me entirely after the third day. 

Any suggestions? I'm not a very social, outdoors kind of person and the usual ""go out, talk to someone"" approach isn't a great idea for a guy with social anxiety and culture that perceives you as a crazy person, if you simply walked up to someone and said Hi.

1mmeu6,2,2013-09-18,Resumes are like houses. Here’s why I believe it.,spivotron,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1mmeu6/resumes_are_like_houses_heres_why_i_believe_it/,"People usually think of a resume as a fancy piece of paper with your education, experience, and skills on it.  
Yet, there is more to a resume; it is a document that speaks to a potential employer.  You want your resume to scream “Hire me! Hire me!” 
In fact in many ways, a resume is like building a house; you have to follow certain steps to make sure you are left with a beautiful end product.

Step 1: Design

Before every house is built, architects come together to brainstorm what the finished house will look like.  If you are a job seeker, you need to brainstorm as well, but in a different way.  Start off by asking yourself these questions:

What is my career goal?
Have I received any kind of special award?
Where have I gone to school?
What other jobs have I had?
What skills do I have?
The list is endless.  Employers love to see candidates who bring something new to the table.  Your focus at this stage is to brainstorm what content to include on your resume.

Step 2: Foundation

After the architects agree on a design, construction of the house begins with laying the foundation.  For a resume the most important part is your education.  Stating your education first shows a potential employer what your interests and how you can fit into the workplace.

Step 3: Walls

The next step in construction is building the walls.  Valuable experience such as internships, a long history of work experience, and volunteer activities can help build up and support your resume.  Haven’t found a part-time jobs or internship yet? No worries! Start by looking around your town and applying for whatever comes your way.  In this job market, having something is better than having nothing.  On the other hand, if you have tons of extracurricular activities and can’t decide which to use, I suggest adding the top 5.  Remember that you need to provide a short description of specifically what you did and its importance.  You want to show the potential employer that you did something useful and beneficial.

Step 4: Roof

No house is complete without a roof.  To cap off your resume, polish it off by stating your skills.  Skills?  From your brainstorming session, add in the skills that you are good at.  Maybe you are a good artist?  In the skills section write that you possess a fantastic artistic ability.  Support this by showing your portfolio and any awards you have won.  

Step 5: Decorate!

Walls? Check. Roof? Check.  Floor? Check.  Time to paint!  The last step in building a resume is to make it look professional.  This means choosing the right font, placement of your different sections,  type of paper, etc.  At the top of your resume add your name is large, bold text.    Then add your contact information below your name.  Here are a few words about email addresses:  Make sure it is appropriate.  Would you want the potential employer to remember you as the person who has great skills or the guy who uses pimpdaddy69@whatever-dot-com? Create a new one if you have to.  Use Times New Roman font as it is a clean and professional font.  

 
Again the order is :career goal, then education, then experience, then skills.   

You want your employers to associate your name with your face.  First impressions mean a big deal in the job market, so when it comes time to introduce yourself the employer, greet them with a smile, give them a firm handshake, look them in the eye and tell them why you would make a great employee.

Good luck!

I have about $9k in savings. That should buy me a few months of looking for a paid internship or entry level job at a similar company while enrolling in school at the same time.

The denim is **unsanforized**, meaning the yarns have not been treated, which, as any denim nerd will tell you, is old-school and great. Cut in our Wallace &amp; Barnes fit, and due to our own washing process, **the fit will not change after washing**."

I have a few questions, please.",StiffAndGifts,law,https://www.reddit.com/r/law/comments/1mm74w/some_interviews_coming_up_dabbling_mostly_in/,"I asked this in /r/lawschool and didn't get many bites.  I'd really appreciate any direction that can be given by people here.

Like the title says, I have some interviews coming up.  I've seen people asking for tips primarily for criminal law positions (lots of prosecutors and PDs.)  I have a few questions about interviewing for firms that specialize in trusts, estates and, to some extent, elder law:

- As far as substantive questions go, what are some favorites or those likely to pop up?

- What are some resources I can go to to brush up on the area?  My focus in law school was estate planning and tax (some elder law) so I'm not totally lost, but I'd like to be able to remember some fresh, key points.

- ""Why do you want to be a lawyer/why trusts and estates?""  I really never know how to answer this question.  I think there are some good answers out there for a lot of other areas of law, but trusts and estates doesn't really lend itself to a lot of the more romantic notions of practicing law and, frankly, for some reason I just took a natural liking to the subject.  I really enjoyed what little drafting I have done, for what it's worth, but it seems silly to emphasize my law school exercises because I feel it makes me sound like a naive Bambi.

Some background about me:  recent law grad, waiting for NY bar exam results, and spent the majority of my time in law school taking estate planning-oriented classes.  I had a few internships, but my only 'practical' experience in anything relating to it would maaaaaybe be tax clinic (because, hey, tax) and the actual estate planning course (drafting pretty standard stuff.)

Thanks ahead of time."

1mm65k,3,2013-09-17,24 [F4M] Washington - So this is awkward - but here it goes! Looking for that special someone. :),song_foryou,r4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/1mm65k/24_f4m_washington_so_this_is_awkward_but_here_it/,"This probably isn’t the best way to go about finding that special someone, but It’s worth a shot, right? I mean…what is the worst thing that could happen? 

Alright…where do I begin?...I guess the main reason I chose to post here is primarily, because I have a difficult time meeting guys in my everyday life. I’m not exactly a charming, beautiful model (but I don’t think I’m dull and hideous either). I’m just extremely shy and introverted - and thus have a very difficult time socializing - especially with the opposite sex. That’s not to say that I’m completely incapable of such things (most of my friends are dudes), but when it comes to someone I find attractive/charming - it’s like all parts of my brain that allow me to form coherent and thought provoking sentences (yes - I’m a though provoker….*sarcasm*) just stop working. It’s really quite frustrating. Additionally, I think people think that I’m too serious. I guess I don’t smile enough. I also don’t particularly care to make eye contact with people either…I think they’re put off by that as well…I guess it’s sort of a defense mechanism. Orrrrr I just lack a lot of confidence in myself…(which is more likely the case). But anyway, those are sort of the reasons I’m here now.

As my title may or may not suggest, I am looking for that someone special. Reddit is obviously a very weird place to look for such a thing, but I like to reddit and those of you who are reading this more than likely also like to reddit. It’s a start - right?? Haha. I’m really just looking for someone to relate to and vice versa.  I need someone who is patient, because more often than not, I am not very patient. I have my quirks, as I’m sure you have yours. I want you to be able to accept and maybe even love every one of my quirks and I will reciprocate by loving and accepting all of yours. I want you to have your own hobbies, but still share some common hobbies with myself. All of what I’ve listed above are pretty standard wants/needs from an SO - but I feel like it is necessary to state them. 

Physically - I am attracted to big/tall/Viking-like men. I am tall myself…and tall girls like to feel small too every once in a while. It seems like all the short girls steal all the tall guys away - it’s not fair! Haha…(haha sorry…hopefully I don’t offend anyone). Anyways - that’s where my list of physical specifications ends - every other physical spec doesn’t matter to me. :p 

If you feel like you fit the above description (or maybe not - I like to make friends too), here is a little more about myself: I’m a college student, 24 (almost 25). I graduate in June 2014 (unless I get another internship in the spring - then that might change). I love participating in outdoor activities (camping, fishing, hiking, white water rafting, etc.), I play video games occasionally (not as much as I used to), I’m a Libra (in case that matters to you), I love love love the rain and thunderstorms (obviously that’s relevant), and a bunch of other stuff that we can talk about if you’re interested in getting to know me. :)

I hope to hear from a few of you soon. :)

EDIT: It doesn't really matter where you are from. :) "

1mm54m,1,2013-09-17,How do you know if you have depression?,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mm54m/how_do_you_know_if_you_have_depression/,"Hi everyone,

This past year of my life has been difficult for me. The moment things got rough and went in a downward spiral was a year ago. I've been feeling very insecure of my abilities and myself. I'm graduating in December, a semester late, and feel a deep pressure to find a job. I'm a finance major from a top-10 business school in the states. I don't know what the future holds, I don't feel competitive in the job-market and I feel like whatever job I do get won't help me feel more positive about myself. I have a decent GPA, but I don't feel like I can get something I REALLY want, and instead will be a desk-jockey for some shithole I don't like. And if I don't get a job after graduation, then I REALLY won't get a job I want. 

I'm trying to manage all this while studying, working, and it's just driving me mad. I've just been having trouble feeling good about myself and always find a way to be self-critical about me, whether it's me not exercising, eating bad, procrastinating, etc. Is this normal? I recently got out of a relationship, and my best friend is in another city, I live alone, and so I've been feeling very lonely lately. I get along well with people, and things like that. But on the inside I just feel hopeless and helpless. I had gone to a psychologist in April, and I gave up on that after about 5 sessions. I don't know if it was me or just the psychologist wasn't suited for me because I felt like I wasn't making progress. But I stopped. Now, I have an internship I'm really enjoying and I'm learning a lot, but I feel the pressure daily to get a good job. I just always find a way to put myself down. I just had a beer right now and this is where all these negative feelings came from, does that mean I should lay off the drinking? 

So, bottom line. I've always been a bit insecure, I've gotten better about it, but it still lingers on. Am I depressed or just insecure or both? What should I do? Sorry if I'm rambling. I just need someone to talk to or hear me out. thanks, internet. "

So currently I am a senior at Johnson &amp; Wales University and starting to look for jobs for when I graduate in May. After my four years I have come to the conclusion I want to be a Media Strategist or Planner (same thing?) but my two internships have not really exposed me to the media side, for I was working on the account side. So my question is what is the best way to get a media strategist position?
I do have media experience through class of course, and many class projects. 
I work on my school Advertisement Team where I worked heavily on media, a long with early strategy. So that was a lot of help and exposure and we placed 1st in districts and 4th nationally. 
I do heavy social media work for school, I run 3 twitters and 3 facebooks along with instagram, so I certainly grasp most concepts either self taught or in the class room, I am just a bit curious the best way to really get a good first job doing what I am currently looking to
do.

Currently I am looking to move to Colorado  (Denver, Boulder) and one last internship to graduate. 
Advice? Tips? Networking?"
1mm3wn,1,2013-09-17,"As a CS senior graduating soon with no previous work experience, should I be applying for internships or full-time?",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1mm3wn/as_a_cs_senior_graduating_soon_with_no_previous/,"Background: I'm currently a senior, and apart from school-work, I only have a couple of personal projects to put on my resume. There were complications with a previous internship offer I had last year (due to my visa status, I'm an international student) so I didn't get anything during my junior-senior summer. Back in my home country there's no strong *internship culture* so I didn't really get any work opportunities there either.

---

So it's time to start applying for jobs and I don't know if I should be applying for summer internships, then try to look for potential full-time employment that way? Or should I go straight to a FT position?


Here's what I thought:

*Internship first*: The interview bar will probably be set lower (not sure about this though). It'll be a smoother transition into the work-force. I'll have some real, previous work experience under my belt, which I think could make a big difference in getting my foot in the door for a FT job interview. However it's not guaranteed I'll get a full-time job after my internship is over.


*Directly to full-time*: If I land a job, it would be a guaranteed steady income and a chance of building my life in the US (which I want to do). The interview process will probably be more difficult, therefor lowering my chances of getting something.


What are your thoughts on this? Anyone been on the same boat?"

* By attending UCF, how do you think you have kick-started your career in the CS world?
* What companies visit UCF? In which of these companies do students usually end up employed in? (Whether it be internship, part/full-time)

I landed a pretty sweet gig, was living at home, and New Years Eve was around the corner. On the outside, things were pretty good, but on the inside I was a little jittery. 

I was taking lunch outside on a busy city street. As usual, I was thinking about life, my future, and other silly things that I can hardly recall now. I was caught up in anxiety, that I do recall. Between a bite of my sandwich and a look up to distract myself with some quality people watching, a woman walked up to me. She was in all white from her hair to her boots, must've been in her 40s, pretty for her age, and smiling at me. 

""It's my birthday, and I wanted to share this with you."" 

She handed me a five dollar bill and walked away. That was it. Like everything around us stopped for a moment and this five dollar was opening up a new perspective I've never felt before. It was the strangest thing, such a small act that drove home for me seeing as I was literally just all caught up in the small stuff. 

The glitchiest part was when I looked down at the bill. On it was written, ""worry less, love more.""

I ate my lunch, went back inside, and vowed to truly start living my life. Now, two years later, I've been worrying noticeably less... and damn does it feel great. All it took was that woman in white."

1mqnx1,114,2013-09-19,My husband [23M] threatened me [22F] and I called the cops. Now I don't know what to do.,vivalaemilia,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1mqnx1/my_husband_23m_threatened_me_22f_and_i_called_the/,"Wall of Text incoming.

We've been married for 3 years, together for 6. We've been fighting a lot lately. A lot, a lot. There's some big issues, after all. We haven't been having a lot of sex, he's always the one to initiate and he feels like he has to beg for it for a week before I'll give in, I'm not pulling my weight in housework, we're both unemployed and the savings are gone, the whole deal. Divorce has been brought up a few times. But when he loses his temper, it's over the tiniest things. 

Today it was because he couldn't get our 4 month old's onesie over her head. She's a big kid, in 6m-12m sizes for a while now. I'm busy getting my shoes on because I'm running late for this huge internship fair and I've got a shot at a paid internship in my career of choice. I glance around to see what the problem is, he's trying to get it over the crown of her head instead of over her face first and it's just not working. Try that first, I said. He's already tried that. Well, okay, that onesie's got a snap on the shoulder to make the hole bigger. It's already open and I'm a bitch now because I'm not paying enough attention. 

We get in the truck and get ready for the long drive. Oops, I stepped in mud trying to jump into the passenger side with a carseat in my hand. Honey, could you go get me a paper towel? I'm in dress pants and can't risk getting out again. Sure, sure. He gets back in the car, we drive off. Oh, I let baby's sun shade up, I'll put that down since she's in the middle of the bench seat and doesn't need it. Now I'm an inconsiderate bitch because my putting the sun shade down is interfering with his driving. Alright, I can take that, it was kind of inconsiderate, but we're at a stop sign. He gets huffy. I say, ""If you're going to be like this today, I'd rather you stayed home."" I'm not interested in sitting in the car for an hour an a half in silence or with him yelling at me.

Shit hits the fan. He'll stay home, but I have to take the baby with me. There's no way I can do an interview with a baby in tow, he knows we need the money and I need this opportunity. Too bad, he's made up his mind. He turns the truck around and we go home. He wants a divorce and he's taking the baby. Sure, he's got anger management issues but there's classes and therapy for that. But I'm a bad mom. Last night, I was ignoring baby so I could update my resume while he played video games! He had to STOP PLAYING VIDEO GAMES to take care of our baby so I could get ready for an interview! Internet addiction, right there! (I don't deny being addicted to the internet, but this was going a little far.) He tells me to take the baby and go find somewhere else to stay because he's getting a lawyer. ""Have some quality time with her before you lose custody.""

Okay, fine. I start packing my suitcase. ""Where are you going to go? To your mom's? To your boyfriend's?"" I'll figure something out. He backtracks, wants to talk, wants to figure this out. No, I'm done. You want a divorce, nothing I can say will stop that, we're pretty obviously not happy together. He redoubles. If I walk out the door with the baby, he'll ""put me six feet under"".

""Bring it."" 

He takes his hatchet, conveniently at the bedside for use against pesky home invaders. He takes the cover off, runs at me, raises it over his head... and I duck, yelling ""[his name], STOP!"" He bends down to my level on the floor, roars in my ear ""YOU DIDN'T THINK I WAS SERIOUS! I'LL FUCKING KILL YOU!"" 

I run out the open bedroom door. I go to the backyard, dialing 911. He follows me, yelling ""DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT CALLING YOUR MOTHER"". He doesn't realize who I'm on the phone with until I say, weeping, ""Hello, I'm having a domestic dispute with my husband..."" then he's trying to wrench the phone out of my hands and I'm shouting at it ""PLEASE SEND SOMEONE! PLEASE!"" as it flies to the ground. 

""What have you done, why why would you call them, you've fucked us, WHY?!""

He picks up the phone, talks calmly to the operator. Gives them our address, tells them what happened, that we were fighting and no, there's no need to send a deputy, I shout at the phone ""HE THREATENED ME WITH AN AX, PLEASE SEND SOMEONE"". He glares, the operator tells him to hand me the phone. He picks up the hatchet, puts the cover on it, sets it on the kitchen table. I'm talking to the operator, he's wandering around saying ""I'm going to prison. Yup, going to prison. Fuck everything. Fuck it, I'm going to prison."" 

The deputies arrive. One takes him outside, the other keeps me inside. They take my statement, they're very determined to hear me say that I was afraid, that I thought he was going to kill me. They want me to say those words. The officers switch. Same deal. Gotta say that I was afraid for my life. I follow the officer outside this time, just in time to see them putting my husband in the back of the squad car. 

I don't know what to do now. I've got no money and no support, I've got school to worry about and the house, and most of all, THE BABY. My mom wants me to come live with her. She's got a spare bedroom, and a rental she manages is opening up in November. I could live there. All of my family is there, it's like built in childcare. There'll always be someone who can watch her for an hour or two, no problem.

But I'll have to withdraw from my classes this semester and I'm doing so well. I've had to take a lot of time off in the last few years (depression, baby, administrative bureaucracy) and this felt like my last shot. The university where she lives doesn't even have my major so transferring there is out, I'd have to commute 2 hours both ways to the nearest one with my program, and it'd be out of state. 

To make things even more complicated, his ""boyfriend"" comment while I was packing wasn't out of left field. I'm polyamorous and my boyfriend have been together for a year and half. He's undocumented and pretty much an indentured servant under the people he works for. He wants to come with me to my mother's city but there's no way he could get there. He can't drive and he can't speak English. He'll have to wait here until November when that rental opens up and I can come rescue him.

I know I can't stay at my house. I'm supposed to tell the prosecutor that I want conditions on his bond, that I don't want him to come to the house until I've moved out. But move back in with my mother? She's coming down tomorrow to help me get my things together before husband gets back and something worse happens. Somebody help me out here. Tell me I'm doing the right thing making my escape.

1mqnpj,1,2013-09-19,Me(F18) and SO(M22) have completely different work ethics. Advice!,allymat,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1mqnpj/mef18_and_som22_have_completely_different_work/,"A little background:
Me and my SO, we will call him Dave, have been together for about a year and a half. We are extremely compatible. We like/dislike the same things, we rarly get annoyed with eachother. We've only had maybe 1 or 2 minor arguemnts the entire time we have been together, even after living with eachother for about a year. Sex is enjoyable. Trust is there 100%.

The problem:
While Dave is everything I would want in a mate on the emotional end of things, he lacks the motivation to work which makes me worry about our future. Yes, I am young but I have been working since the age of 15. As of now, I am working two part-time jobs while managing a weekend internship and working towards a college degree. I enjoy working, mostly becuase I was blessed with jobs I enjoy but also it is simply rewarding. I like having nice things, I like having nice things I earned even more.

Dave on the other hand, has not had a job since we began dating. He has not even applied or looked around for work either. He constantly plays video games untill the  early morning and then sleeps the day away. When I ask him why he won't apply for work, he tells me he wants to get his GED first; he proceeds to make zero effort to work towards this either.

My question:
We both want the same thing out of life, but only one of us is willing to put in the work to get it. I love my boyfriend, like I said he is everything I would look for in a mate emotionally-but financially, I am worried about our future.

How can I motivate him to work without seeming like the 'Nagging' girlfriend; I dont want to pressure him into something he might resent me for later. I also don't want to sit by while his lazy habbits get worse and end up resenting myself for it later. How would you approach the situation?

TL;DR: Emotionally my SO is great; Financially not so much. "

I'm looking for a literate, descriptive roleplay while I play with my toy. Sending me a starter is the best way to get my attention. If its good, I'll reply. 

Willing to trade pics but I'd rather it not be the main focus. If anyone wants to play, my kik is LittleKhaleesi."

Need advice",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1mqiip/me21m_and_my_gf20f_of_6_months_passion_has_worn/,"Hello, I'm a medical student (3rd year out of 6) and she's a nursing student (2nd year). It's my first serious relationship, so I was all excited as it grew, ignoring that I had to study (fortunately I did well anyway). We don't have much in common besides both having very few interests and being overall boring people. We talk about everyday stuff and act like most 40-year old people act. Most of the summer we're away from each other, but since the academic year starts in roughly 2 weeks we'll be together again living in the same building. Or..?

Today she told me how bored she feels and how she needs to take a break - no talking till we meet in the university in october. She needs to think it over. It's depressing to imagine I could ever end up without her, but I'm past feeling devastated about it (our beginning wasn't easy either due to my having to study all the time so there were moments when I feared that). What I mean is that I almost feel like I don't care anymore, but somehow when we had *a talk* today I felt like crap and my eyes watered up. I'm confused.

I find her really attractive and she's smart too... she reads books and does well socially, but studying is not her thing. Medicine is none of her interest too, she's studying nursing only because it guarantees a job. To tell you the truth I would totally ignore the incompatibilities and spend as much time as I could with her (don't know if I can say ""whole life"", but that's what I mean). She just seems bored with me. It's like I'm not the kind of guy she wants, although she might appreciate my helpfulness, honesty so she won't tell me that.. During internship (we have to do every summer here) she met an interesting guy with whom she chatted a lot and spent some time and was really excited about him, even though *he's an arrogant jerk*. She told me she wasn't interested in him as much as in me, but I just don't know. 

What should I try to revive what's between us? Or is it not going to work anyway and I should give up any attempts? I really want to try, but don't know where to start. I'm not going to talk to her until we meet and then see what she came up with while *thinking it all over*.

I'm currently looking for a potential room someone has to rent or a flatmate to live with starting about mid-November. I'm a 2nd year PhD student at the University of Manchester, so I'm on the market for a more young professional type of living situation rather than student. 

My current lease is ending at the end of November, but I will be out of town from 14/10 - 11/11.. which is unfortunately one of the best times to look for a place to live. I'm hoping to find a place by the time I leave in Oct. and be ready to pack up and move once I return in Nov. I will most likely be applying and with any luck receiving an internship over the summer, so I'm just looking for a place to stay for the next 8ish months or so (end of May/beginning of June). It's an odd amount of time, but it's what I'm going with at the moment.

Things kind of fell through with a flat I was looking at recently, so I thought I'd give you guys a shout and see what anyone thought. If anyone is interested, or knows of any interest please let me know. 

Cheers."

I'm currently in a dilemma about choosing my career path...sort of.

I have been working as an IT Assistant (30hrs/week) for 6 months now and don't get me wrong, I like it. I've always wanted to be in IT. Prior to this, I was in the healthcare industry for 4 years as an Administrative Assistant. I was doing all of these plus more for about 5 years now, as a full-time/part-time student. 

I anticipate to graduate in the Fall of 2014 with a degree in Management Information Systems and I was wondering if I should open myself up for internships in Summer 2014. I want to stay in IT but I'm just not sure if I want to be in the support function any longer after graduation. I've seen a lot of people get stuck in the same position for a long time and I don't want to get too comfortable myself.

By interning this summer, I hope to explore IT in the software/analysis side of things. 

So I was wondering, what do you all think? Leave a permanent (part-time) job with health/vision/dental/life/long-term insurance and match 401(k) or take a risk and explore?

I understand that my decision about taking up an internship is contingent upon even getting an offer. But let's assume in this case that I was offered a software/analyst internship in the summer and I need to make a decision right away.

**TLDR;** quit permanent part-time job with benefits to take a risk with a summer internship before graduation?"

Since this is my first internship, I didn't recognize this at first but as I've been educating myself. I'm realizing what's wrong with our code.

To give you an idea of our project's code quality:

1) Our code is all procedural

[What would it take to get an Age of Mythology two? What sort of hoodoo?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mpyy2/i_am_dave_pottinger_a_lead_developer_of_the_age/ccbj1cn?context=5)|You'd have to ask MS.
 |But, sign me up! I wouldn't literally kill to work on AOM2, but that'd be an automatic slam dunk.
[Prostagma? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mpyy2/i_am_dave_pottinger_a_lead_developer_of_the_age/ccbjo32?context=5)|Heh, nice. I don't think that one's quite as popular as Wololo, but it's definitely one of the AOM unit sounds that sticks with you. I always wondered what the VO actor looked like; he sounds angry.
[Who thought of all of the silly cheats that you could use in Age of Empires, like adding cars with machine guns and whatnot?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mpyy2/i_am_dave_pottinger_a_lead_developer_of_the_age/ccbic2t?context=5)|Always a group effort, though probably driven a little more by the art staff. After all, it's not really a very good cheat if there's no art:) Our concept artists came up with a lot of the crazy ones (Lazrbear, George Crushington, etc.). The Monster Trucks from Age3 were actually a big favor I called in to make my boys happy. 
[Who was the genius that created the WUVWOO cheat in AofM?  That may be the greatest thing ever in gaming history.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mpyy2/i_am_dave_pottinger_a_lead_developer_of_the_age/ccbmdh3?context=5)|Ah, the great flying purple hippo.
 |One of our designers mistakenly sent an email meant for his wife to the entire studio. Sadly (for him), he signed it ""Wuv Woo"". We never let him live that down.
 |One of the artists came up with the hippo as a prank. Another modeled it, and so on.
[Those trucks were tucking amazing.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mpyy2/i_am_dave_pottinger_a_lead_developer_of_the_age/ccbk6jl?context=5)|Nice. It's ""tuck"" because my 3 year old (at the time) couldn't pronounce his r's very well. He doesn't find it funny these days, tho.
[Age of Mythology-inspired RTS on Kickstarter: Possible?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mpyy2/i_am_dave_pottinger_a_lead_developer_of_the_age/ccbj1ft?context=5)|I'm a little less sold on Kickstarter for games compared to other folks, but I would love to know how much interest there is in that idea.
[Considering that we do get alot of Kickstarter supporters on reddit, I'm sure everyone would like to hear an industry veteran's reservations on Kickstarter.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mpyy2/i_am_dave_pottinger_a_lead_developer_of_the_age/ccbk9vr?context=5)|Reservations is maybe too far. I love the idea of Kickstarter. I think it's opened the door for many things that would never have gotten a shot. I do think it has worked better for more tangible, physical items than for software. Software is inherently difficult to predict. I don't think crowd funding has a good handle on that risk, yet. To get your game funded, you have to promise a lot. Unfortunately, many games over-promise. To be clear, I'm mostly talking about the Kickstarters for guys who've been in the industry. More power to the non-industry folks using Kickstarter to break in. Knock 'em dead! I am disappointed in the successful game Kickstarters that have subsequently run out of money. Triply so in the case of industry vets who should damn well know better. They should know how to take a budget and leave room for iteration/mistakes/oh-shit situations. So, yeah, maybe I'm just more frustrated with the state of the current game Kickstarters. I wish they were more dependable. Bonus does get asked about doing an RTS Kickstarter a *LOT*. Given our heritage, it's understandable. It's not something we're currently planning. If a few more good success cases come around, then we'll probably give it some more serious thought. Related, there are already a ton of threads running around the studio email in the last few hours that all have the tone ""See, everyone LOVES AOM!!! Let's make that!!!""
[Just to see the other side of the coin!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mpyy2/i_am_dave_pottinger_a_lead_developer_of_the_age/ccbk9vr?context=5)| 
[Just wanted to say thank you. Age of Mythology is one of my favorite games of all time!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mpyy2/i_am_dave_pottinger_a_lead_developer_of_the_age/ccbidiv?context=5)|Mine, too! I actually was at Robot for a little while. Bonfire after that. In the end, I came to the hard realization that I wanted to do something different. But, knowing that and then doing it are two very different beasts. It took a while to put together the right founding crew. John and Jason are such fantastic partners. And, we've been fortunate enough to attract some other great talent, too. Up to 15 people and two teams now, in fact. Coming back to the question... I'm proud to look at what we've started building and see it tie back to the original ideals from Ensemble. I was at Ensemble really early and take a lot of pride in how great it was (and the commensurate responsibility for how it ended). I look at all the ridiculously excellent studios that spun out of ES and am amazed that we managed to field that team for so long. I'm happy to be part of Bonus and keep a bit of that old ES spirit alive.
[What made you (and others\) choose BonusXP over Robot Studios? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mpyy2/i_am_dave_pottinger_a_lead_developer_of_the_age/ccbidiv?context=5)| 
[Which Age of Empires game are you most proud of, and why? I personally feel that while they're all great, 2 was the best. Loved that game so much as a kid.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mpyy2/i_am_dave_pottinger_a_lead_developer_of_the_age/ccbi6sq?context=5)|Can I have two answers? ;)
 |It's hard not to be proud of the overwhelming success and pervasive-ness of Age2. I remember a cool moment when my wife and I were in a local movie theater and heard some kids talking about trebuchets. They weren't quite as common place back then (no Mythbusters, no Punkin Chunkin, etc.), so it was really neat to see such a direct effect.
 |But, personally, I will always love Age of Mythology the best. It was, in so many ways, a dream RTS to work on. The team was just awesome to work with, too. I loved the variability in multiplayer games with the minor gods. And the myth units:)
[I also loved the Egyptian's Roc that can carry 15 fully loaded siege towers. =D.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mpyy2/i_am_dave_pottinger_a_lead_developer_of_the_age/ccbjeuo?context=5)|Heh, I'd forgotten about that. Total screw!
[I'm a 39 year old gamer and Age of Mythology is by far by favorite video game of all time.  I don't know if this has been asked but is there ever going to be an app version?  If so, I hope you triple your fortune as you deserve it!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mpyy2/i_am_dave_pottinger_a_lead_developer_of_the_age/ccbjig9?context=5)|I don't know if there's ever going to be an app version of AOM.
 |Funny story (well, funny now, not very funny then)... AOM was largely considered a disappointment when we launched it. We were coming off of Age2 which had gone stupid gangbusters, of course. Expectations were crazy high. We bungled some bits of the project and had totally bitten off more than we should have (remember, this is when 3D RTS games didn't really exist yet). So, we had to slip the project an entire year, making it a three year game.
 |When it launched, it ""only"" did a million or something (don't quote me on those numbers) early on. Lifetime, it's done over 3M, I think (again no quotes). So, it's no slouch. But, compared to Age2, it's nothing. So, TLDR, there was a lot of disappointment when AOM shipped and it didn't do as well as Age2.
 |Looking back, we were incredibly naive to think it would top Age2, of course. But, you don't think that way when you're on the game. No one wants to think ""Yeah! This game won't sell as much as our last one! Woohoo! Let's crunch!"". You want to believe it's going to do better and be bigger. It just wasn't.
 |BUT... There is a lot of love for AOM. Age2 was Ensemble's big game. No one can argue that. AOM was, IMO, the cult favorite.
[That aside, there's also been some discussion over why Age3 was... relatively poorly received? Bruce Shelley during his 2011 Kotaku interview, for instance.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mpyy2/i_am_dave_pottinger_a_lead_developer_of_the_age/ccbmiz7?context=5)|The campaign was a huge source of discomfort for some people who really wanted a traditional, follow-history-exactly story.  And, in the end, Age3 had to try to live up to Age2. That's a tall order for any game.
[Any thoughts as to what went wrong? In the early 2000s there was a lot  of experimentation with the RTS genre - Warcraft III, CNC Generals, Dawn of War, etc. Warcraft III was a bestseller but CNC Generals sold badly, as I recall. Do you think tastes just shifted, or is there still a niche with new audiences for a game with Age2-like gameplay?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mpyy2/i_am_dave_pottinger_a_lead_developer_of_the_age/ccbmiz7?context=5)|I think the renaissance time period is just boring. Muskets look cool, but we ended up cutting the formation combat that made them look *really* cool. But, it's not as fun as medieval.  I think RTSes got oversaturated. Too many. Too similar. Tastes change as the generations turn over, too.  Personally, I'm excited about the ""newfound"" excitement for RTS games. It's fun to go back to revisit that genre for us (as developers). I think people are ready to get back into them, too.
[Is there ever going to be a second Age of Mythology?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mpyy2/i_am_dave_pottinger_a_lead_developer_of_the_age/ccbj9f4?context=5)|That's really up to MS. I think there are some spiritual successors in the works, though. In other words, we are working on something.
[I hope you still know that Age of Empires flagship is still quite famous worldwide and recently Age of Empires 2 HD released on Steam. Even though it is famous and will surely generate revenues, then why did the company stop the franchisee?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mpyy2/i_am_dave_pottinger_a_lead_developer_of_the_age/ccbikna?context=5)|Age is a beloved franchise, no doubt. Happy to see it get a little refreshed love with the HD remake. We did get a kick to see all of the old pathing and movement bugs still alive (John and I did most of that code for Age2, so we're allowed to bag on it).
[PS :- BIG FAN OF AGE OF EMPIRES ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mpyy2/i_am_dave_pottinger_a_lead_developer_of_the_age/ccbikna?context=5)|MS made a biz choice in closing Ensemble. I don't think too many of us Ensemblers agreed with the choice, but MS had different needs and goals to answer to. Ensemble had gotten big and a bit unwieldy. We didn't really want to work on Age much anymore (15 years with one franchise can wear on you). We wanted a break and tried to do other games. That vision just wasn't aligned with what MS needed at the time. IMO, anyway.
[We're actually digging into some of the pathing / movement right now with HD, if I hear any cursing coming from over in that corner of the building I'll make sure to point them in your direction ;\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mpyy2/i_am_dave_pottinger_a_lead_developer_of_the_age/ccbltdj?context=5)|Haha, suckers:) Oh, wait...

[It's funny, I've always seen Age of Empires as a fast-paced Civilization (my favorite game ever\). AoE has often been a very close second and it's always been my favorite RTS BECAUSE of the historical focus like Civilization. How did you come up with the idea for AoE? Do you see games like Rome: Total War as your progeny?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mpyy2/i_am_dave_pottinger_a_lead_developer_of_the_age/ccbiuk1?context=5)|The idea process there wasn't more complicated than you allude to... We all liked Civ. For a long time, we had a tradition in the studio where we'd take a day before holiday break, cram into a conference room, and play a 9 hour game of the Civ boardgame. It's surprising to me, always, that many people don't realize Civ was a boardgame, too. Hell, 89% of our the technology names from Age1 are straight outta that thing.
 |Anyhow... We all liked Civ. We liked Warcraft, too. It didn't take much brainstorming to do the chocolate/peanut butter ""twist"" and stick 'em together.
 |And we certainly rode that pairing hard. If you look back on all the marketing and whatnot for Age1, it's ""Civ meets Warcraft"" everywhere. I'm not 100% sure we lived up to that because the game was always more Warcraft than Civ (increasingly so over the versions). But, the Civ elements were a fantastic flavor and backdrop. There's something really comforting about not having to explain what an Archer does.
 |I'd never be so presumptive as to assume stuff like Rome:TW was our progeny. I'd hope they were perhaps influenced by what we did, but that's about it.
[What are your thoughts on a company basicly just releasing a game you and your team coded 10 years ago and selling it for 20$ without changing anything but the amount of pixels the screen can hold?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mpyy2/i_am_dave_pottinger_a_lead_developer_of_the_age/ccbirpa?context=5)|Well, the studio that did the Steam port has hardcore ties to Age2. They're run by one of the co-lead designers for it;) I think that gives them plenty of street cred to release that game.
 |So many of my friends and I owe just about everything to the success of those games. It's been bittersweet to see RTS kinda fade into the background. It's cool to see it get some attention again. Yes, I know about LOL and SC, but the quasi-historical RTS just isn't as big anymore.
[What was the thought process in making AoE, AoM and halo wars?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mpyy2/i_am_dave_pottinger_a_lead_developer_of_the_age/ccbis7l?context=5)|How long do you have?
 |We were very team focused, particularly in the early days.
 |One of my favorite memories of Ensemble was when we got together after Age1 shipped and we had an all day meeting about what we wanted to do next. We were only 25 people at the time, so it was a really tight group (who'd just been through 11 months of 100+ hours a week).
 |TG, our president, really wanted to do a medieval game. So, we brainstormed ideas inside of that box. One artist really wanted to do cannibals (zombies before they were hip, who knew?). There was a big push for an Asian-centric focus, but we ended going with the European focus based on the belief that most folks think about European stuff when they think medieval. I'm not sure we'd make the same call today, but that's why we made it back in '97 (holy crap, I'm old).
 |Fun fact... Age2 was supposed to be the ""quick redo of Age1 with new medieval art"" and shipped in a year. Two years, and a sh'load of crunch later, we ended up lucking into something that became huge. Anyone who tells you we planned it that way is full of it, tho;)
[Was it easy to make a halo game that wasn't a FPS? Did the fact that halo was originally going to be an RTS make halo wars easier to develop?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mpyy2/i_am_dave_pottinger_a_lead_developer_of_the_age/ccbi9oy?context=5)|Yes and no.
 |It was easy in that Halo had a lot of lore and a wide variety of units, locations, etc. I think some of that might have been attributable to its RTS origins, but Bungie just did a fantastic job fleshing out a really robust universe. I can't speak for everyone at Ensemble, but I know that I learned a sh'load about building an IP/world from working with the Halo license.
 |It was hard to make Halo Wars because we were reluctant to give up the ""Age Feel"". So, while not directly an FPS problem, it's similar because we knew what type of RTS game we liked to make/play. We knew enough to realize that we couldn't just port that over to a console. But, for as successful as Halo Wars was, I don't think we ever really embraced making a true console RTS. We definitely left some opportunity on the table there.
 |All that said, Bonus is working on an unannounced project that might be a mobile RTS;) It's surprisingly similar to the issues developing Halo Wars. Hopefully we'll leave less on the table this time...
[How do you feel about the expansion of RTS games since then? And where do you think the next big RTS game will be? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mpyy2/i_am_dave_pottinger_a_lead_developer_of_the_age/ccbkerj?context=5)|Looking back, I think the RTS hey day was the time between Starcraft and AOM. It was the hot thing. If you were playing games, you were playing RTS games at least a little bit.  But, much like the Rock Band/Guitar Hero craze, I think people just got burned out. Devs got burned out making them. Players got burned out playing too many similar games. In that sense, the 'expansion' of RTS games caused some of the implosion, IMO.  Nowadays, I think it's more reasonable. LOL and other MOBAs have taken a lot of the player bandwidth that used to be occupied with RTS games. That's cool. We needed that variety. Starcraft II is obviously primo, too, so it's nice to have someone keep pushing the bounds of quality.  I think the next big RTS game is either going to be on PC (e.g. Steam) or mobile. It's not easy to make a mobile-based RTS (I know because we're trying), but the first great mobile RTS will be a watershed event. Clash of Clans (which I wouldn't label an RTS) has shown how popular some of the RTS elements can be on mobile. PC stands a chance because that's where RTS games grew up, but the pickins' are slim right now.
[Thanks for the reply! Loved the insight and I'll definitely be giving Cavemania a try this weekend. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mpyy2/i_am_dave_pottinger_a_lead_developer_of_the_age/ccbmlpv?context=5)|Cool. Let us know what you think!
[Will we ever see Age of Mythology 2? It's by far the best RTS I've ever played in my life.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mpyy2/i_am_dave_pottinger_a_lead_developer_of_the_age/ccbjoks?context=5)|Up to MS.
 |Per some of the other answers, AOM was never as big as Age. Were I MS, I think I'd be crazy to start with the smaller franchise vs. trying to resurrect Age.
 |Either way, the more time passes, the harder it will be to rez either franchise.
[When did you decide you wanted to become a game developer? What do you believe led to this decision?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mpyy2/i_am_dave_pottinger_a_lead_developer_of_the_age/ccbj9qg?context=5)|I hate wearing pants.
 |Backing up... I started college in Mech Engineering. Wanted to go figure out how to make cooler/better cars out of some misguided ideal I developed when my parents got laid off from Ford in the 80s.
 |Quickly realized that my heart was not in that. Played Wing Commander 2 (among other things). Switched to Comp Engineering. Was all set to take a semester off to intern at an IBM facility in TX. Met my (future) wife. Quickly changed plans to intern at an IBM facility in Tucson so I could stay in town (we went to University of Arizona).
 |Wow, did that job suck. Didn't take long to figure out I would have no desire to work in the ""corporate"" world. And, as mentioned, I hate pants.
 |So, decided to make games. My friend and I started a game company on my credit card. ""Shipped"" something (mostly). That project was a great demo for my job at Ensemble (which was landed equally haphazardly).
 |The rest is history. Still sans pants.
[How did you come up with the languages for all the different nationalities in AoE? Is there real language mixed in there? Did the voice actors just make sounds that imitated the sound of those languages?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mpyy2/i_am_dave_pottinger_a_lead_developer_of_the_age/ccbl5gb?context=5)|Age1 is almost entirely made up. The work of Chris Rippy. ""Rogan"" is his lovely wife's maiden name IIRC.
 |Age2 is much more historically accurate, but still takes a lot of liberties.
 |Age3 is very close to right (or so I'm told).
[I am not a fan of RTS's in general (probably because I'm terrible at them\), but I must say Age of Empires has been a favorite series of mine for a long time and have spent countless enjoyable hours on the games, so thanks for that! Also how's it feel to strike panic in a man with a simple sound of WOLOWOLOWOLOWOLO!?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mpyy2/i_am_dave_pottinger_a_lead_developer_of_the_age/ccbi9y4?context=5)|Happy to oblige! You'd be amazed at how often we still hear that sound! You mention Age around anyone and they either talk about OP (overpowered) Paladins or they look at you with crazy eyes and start chanting WOLOLO over and over.
[I just want to say that Age of Empires II is one of my favourite games of all time. I still have AoEii game nights with my family. Thank you.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mpyy2/i_am_dave_pottinger_a_lead_developer_of_the_age/ccbl46l?context=5)|Age is about a lot of little bits. How many tiles is my dropsite from the forest? I need another 15 food for my 39th villie. Which of these 24 technologies do I want to research next? The sum is awesome, but it's a bit of a ""brain"" game (as RTSes go).  In some places, we succeeded. We were joking just the other day about how many times I stood up in front of the studio and painstakingly pantomimed how the Spartans should jump on the Wraiths, rip off the hatch, yank out the Hunter, and take control. Seeing that happen in the game was really rewarding.
[Also, what inspired you to design Halo Wars the way you did? In other words, what makes that game unique to you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mpyy2/i_am_dave_pottinger_a_lead_developer_of_the_age/ccbl46l?context=5)|Halo is the other direction. It's big and in your face. We tried very hard to live up to that legacy.
[How different is being CEO / Founder compared to your previous CTO / Tech Director or other roles? Do you enjoy it as much as coding?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mpyy2/i_am_dave_pottinger_a_lead_developer_of_the_age/ccbjn2n?context=5)|The main difference that we (the three founders, John Evanson, Jason Sallenbach, and I) see is that we can run the studio in the manner we see fit. That sounds a little egotistical, but I don't mean it that way. We've all been in the industry for a long time, so we simply have our strong opinions about how things should work. I am possibly mature enough to realize that our way won't work for everyone, though.
 |We started Bonus with the idea of making a team-focused studio. Everyone gets a design credit. We involve everyone in every meeting. That sort of stuff. It takes a particular person to work at Bonus; you have to be excited about working that team-centric way. It's not something everyone wants to do.
 |So, a lot of the difference is that. Yeah, I'm doing a lot of biz stuff. I'm the HR department. I run payroll. I write the expense checks. I handle the insurance. We're building out a new office, so we're hip deep in picking furniture and stuff. There's a LOT of stuff to do in running a studio. But, it's been fun.
 |And, I still get to program:)
[I've been looking into learning how to develop my own games with some friends. One has a good handle on Objective-C, another has some character and design experience, but the rest of us are fairly new to coding. Is Unity a good place to start for some of us, or should we start to dive right into a language like Objective-C? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mpyy2/i_am_dave_pottinger_a_lead_developer_of_the_age/ccbi94u?context=5)|I'm sure I'll be roasted and shot later, but I'm not much of an ObjC fan.
 |A big reason we love working in Unity (Cavemania and BonusXP's other games are all done in Unity) is that we can use C#. Maybe we're old, but C# suits our programming staff better.
 |I think it's an easier language to learn than ObjC, too. If it helps, I'm teaching my boys to program using C#.
 |Unity is fantastic for getting some up and running. Best prototyping engine I've ever used. I'd heartily recommend it for getting started.
[Which language was used most in developing Age of Empires III? I think I've heard people say it was made mostly in C++ at its core.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mpyy2/i_am_dave_pottinger_a_lead_developer_of_the_age/ccbjr0a?context=5)|All of the client code was C++. Probably a few bits of assembly here and there. Lots of shader programming, too.
 |Server was a mix with a lot of C#.
 |Most of the random map and Computer Player AI logic was done in an internal, Ensemble-built language called XS. An interpreted language built on C++ core.
[Age of Empires was my first video game, and I played Age of Kings and The Conquerors nearly exclusively for several years. I loved AoM, too. The Age games remain some of my favorites, and I was always curious after Ensemble Studios shut down: did you guys have any plans to continue along a historical timeline with the Age of Empires series, like an AoE 4 based on the World Wars or something to that effect?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mpyy2/i_am_dave_pottinger_a_lead_developer_of_the_age/ccbke7n?context=5)|Yes, the loose expectation was that Age would move forward in time. We even put a hint of that in the Age3 art book.
 |That said, I'm not sure that would have worked out so well. So much of what made Age ""Age"" is that romanticized version of history. The closer you go to modern times, the less you can do that. Plus, I think an RTS game is better with believable melee (non-ranged) units. Harder to do that with a gun-centric time period. Not impossible, but harder.
[Another question would be: Did anyone from Ensemble think of including a native observer mode in AoE3, so we don't have to make custom maps to observe games or to stream them online? Thanks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mpyy2/i_am_dave_pottinger_a_lead_developer_of_the_age/ccbk4pe?context=5)|Yes, we did think about an observer mode for Age3. Ran out of time.
[Why did the age of mythology games cease to exist? I played the first one and the expansion. Both were completely awesome games with so much potential for a second one, there are so many mythologies and legends in this world.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mpyy2/i_am_dave_pottinger_a_lead_developer_of_the_age/ccbkrz7?context=5)|After Titans (AOM expansion), we were obligated to work on Age3 (per agreement with MS). After Age3, we tried everything we could to not work on an Age game. We were pretty burned out. We did do the first Age3 expansion, but the second was done in conjunction with Big Huge (in part because we couldn't muster the energy).
 |So, some of the blame (if that's the right word) is on Ensemble for sure. We just didn't want to. We wanted to do something else. Of course, now that time has passed, maybe we'd have been up for it. But, that whole ""out of business"" part gets in the way now;)
[What is your favourite AOE/AOM game? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mpyy2/i_am_dave_pottinger_a_lead_developer_of_the_age/ccbovo1?context=5)|My personal fave is AOM.
 |I loved the art style. The topic was more ""fun"" than history. I thought the gameplay was also better/more interesting (minor gods, god powers, myth units, etc.).
 |I think it also is my fave because that was really the golden time at Ensemble. A couple of us started the engine for AOM right after Age1 (we set it aside to help finish Age2 after a while), but AOM was really the first Ensemble game that was built while Ensemble was 40+ people. Age1 had been started when ES was really small, so it was hard for everyone who came after to feel as much ownership (IMO anyway).
 |AOM was also the last time Ensemble was really unified on the same project. We had a couple of very small attempts at second games during Age1 and Age2, but we had everyone on AOM for the most part. After AOM, we were always split. Wasn't ever quite the same.
[Were there any really difficuly decisions that had to be made, in terms of game content, for any AoE/AoM games? If so, how were they resolved?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mpyy2/i_am_dave_pottinger_a_lead_developer_of_the_age/ccbk0lr?context=5)|Two answers...
 |One, I lost track of how often we ran afoul of the ""historical sensitivity"" stuff. We never set out to piss anyone off. In fact, I think we were generally very sensitive to cultural issues. But, we only know what we know, so we stuck our foot in our mouth a few times and had to go back to edit content that we found out was offensive after the fact.
 |Of course, offensive is in the eye of the beholder. Turns out the historically accurate Janissary (Age2 unit) hats look an awful like like a certain racist organization's attire. But, in the middle of ""being historically accurate"", they got modeled that way. Wasn't until the day before Age2's gold master that someone at MS said ""Hey, wait a minute..."". On the one hand, you could argue that we should have shipped it as is. On the other, it was probably going to be offensive. In the end, the call was to give them some hair and lose the hat.
 |Two... We definitely had creative disagreements about what the content should be. The Age series was known for being ""historically accurate"" (not really ever actually true, but whatever). So, when we wanted to go do a more exciting campaign for Age3, it was a massive uphill battle. We always thought of the Age3 campaign like an Indiana Jones movie (the good ones!). So, yeah, it had a little of the fantastical in it, but it was still clearly rooted in history. We argued, internally, about that for a long time. As did the public. Some folks loved that campaign while others flat-out hated it.
 |Resolution is, thus, a tough word. Yes, things got resolved because the games went out. But, we didn't always agree.
[Huh. So that explains the be-hatted Janissary in some screenshots.  What drove the decision to switch the Korean turtle ship graphic?  I did like the new one, but the old one didn't look atypical of Age2's aesthetic.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mpyy2/i_am_dave_pottinger_a_lead_developer_of_the_age/ccboz0e?context=5)|Feedback from folks in Korea, IIRC.
[How do you get that useless sack of shit Jason Sallenbach to do any work around there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mpyy2/i_am_dave_pottinger_a_lead_developer_of_the_age/ccbj4gm?context=5)|So many ways to go with this one...
 |Honest: Jason is one of the best partners anyone could hope for. Funny: We put up with him because he brings in the ladies. Untrue: No doubt! We fired his ass this morning!
[How long did it take you to make Age of Empires, start to finish?  Also, did you know how big the game was going to get, or was it mostly a surprise?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mpyy2/i_am_dave_pottinger_a_lead_developer_of_the_age/ccbjbrp?context=5)|We had no idea how big it would become. I mean you hope something that you work on will be popular, but none of us really thought it would become that big.
[Any chance of a Cavemania Windows 8 phone version?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mpyy2/i_am_dave_pottinger_a_lead_developer_of_the_age/ccbi6ef?context=5)|Yes. We might, in fact, have started looking at that yesterday.
[Any idea why Windows Phone store is so poorly supported by developers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mpyy2/i_am_dave_pottinger_a_lead_developer_of_the_age/ccbjeh0?context=5)|I can't speak for anyone but Bonus, of course.
 |As much as we are focused on building deep, polished games with a lot of replay (a hacked up version of our mission), we do have to stay in business. I said somewhere else that I don't care about owning 18 Ferraris, but I do care about paying our employees;)
 |As such, market share matters. We have to prioritize where there are more customers. Right now, that's Amazon/Apple/Google Play (strictly in alphabetical order as we love them all equally). But, with those in hand, we're looking at the next round of platforms for Cavemania. Win8 makes sense. We're also looking at FB, PC/Mac, and consoles, too.
[Zynga gets a lot of flack, but you worked for them for a while. I'm sure there was a fair share of bad, but were you able to take away anything positive from that experience? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mpyy2/i_am_dave_pottinger_a_lead_developer_of_the_age/ccbk0nx?context=5)|Yes, I did. Bonfire got acquired by Zynga. I was the design director on CastleVille.
 |Personally, the best thing I took away from my time at Zynga was a lot of learning on how to do things differently. As you mention, yes, some of those learnings top my list of ""Don't Ever Do This Again"". But, I also realized that there were a lot of things I didn't know.
 |We always thought we made casual RTS games with Age. Pfft. No way. I am appreciative of my time at Zynga for teaching me that I didn't know nearly as much as I thought I did. But, yes, after a while, I couldn't take it anymore.
 |From a studio standpoint, my time at Zynga was fantastic for meeting new colleagues;) After dutifully waiting for my non-solicit to run its course, we hired some folks from Zynga Dallas. As of now, Bonus is about half old Ensemble folks and half old Zynga folks.
[What happened to the Spirit of Fire and its crew?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mpyy2/i_am_dave_pottinger_a_lead_developer_of_the_age/ccblnau?context=5)|&lt;Flame-laden debate ensues&gt;
 |IMO, they take a long journey home. Arrive older, but in a time-shifted future (can't muss with canon). Crew ends up feel alone and isolated in a weak analogy to the Spartans/Master Chief.
[Even after that after-credits scene where we hear Serenia wake the captain because ""Something has happened""?  She would have long gone rampant if/when they got back anyway. :P.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mpyy2/i_am_dave_pottinger_a_lead_developer_of_the_age/ccbn0o8?context=5)|Heh, true. There wasn't agreement on that line:)
[What's your opinion on the new AoE 2 HD?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mpyy2/i_am_dave_pottinger_a_lead_developer_of_the_age/ccbl5vb?context=5)|Age2 was fun back in the day. Since Age2HD is a straight-up port, yup, still very fun:)
[ which AoE is the best to start with?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mpyy2/i_am_dave_pottinger_a_lead_developer_of_the_age/ccbl5vb?context=5)|I'd start with Age2HD or Age3. Too hard to Age Online to actually work, if it's even still up?
[Another question: Do you ever play any games you make outside of working on them? aka at home?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mpyy2/i_am_dave_pottinger_a_lead_developer_of_the_age/ccbnii3?context=5)|These days, yes. I think that's because the games are shorter.
 |After being on Age3 for 3 years (WTF!!!), I was definitely worn out on it. I didn't play it much at home. I probably would have if my boys were older at the time, but they weren't.
 |The games we're making now are shorter. Part of that is because we're tired of making multi-year games. We just don't want to do that right now.
 |I've played through the initial 75 launch levels of Cavemania probably 20+ times (more for the earlier levels). I found myself playing level 33 again last night to try to beat my wife's score. I dutifully bragged at her over Facebook when I did.
 |I don't think we're (developers) that much diff than players in that sense. We get bored and worn-out, too. It's hard to maintain the same creative energy on a game after a while.
 |At Ensemble, we really struggled with that near the end. Age3 is a great example. We had a hard time putting together a team to work on it because people were just tired of RTS games. We added a year to the project because we wanted to rebuild the renderer to be ""the best looking PC game ever"" in order to get the team excited about working on the game. It eventually worked, but it was never the natural excitement Age2 or AOM had.
[Thanks so much for Halo Wars &lt;3 And I've read about the 'going out with a bang' speech, really inspirational, respectable and amazing. Any chance of another Halo wars in the future? :D.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mpyy2/i_am_dave_pottinger_a_lead_developer_of_the_age/ccbl4o6?context=5)|You'd have to ask 343 and MS about that.
 |I don't specifically recall the ""going out with a bang"" speech. I'm sure I cussed a lot.
 |But, what I do remember is that we stuck together. We had ~110 people in the studio when the closure was announced. That royally sucked. But, over those last ~4 months of Ensemble's life, we only had 3 departures. Two folks left to start some podunk company that never amounted to much (the Bettners who started NewToy and did a tiny app called Words with Friends;). One person was let go.
 |I am amazed/honored/humbled that we had so much talent under that roof. For a long time, I was point on hiring the Ensemble programmers, but we had the crazy ""Must talk to every employee"" interview process for so long. We played board games with candidates. We were a family.
 |That's what I remember.

We had instantly chemistry and within a month, he told me he loved me. And I found that I loved him too. He went to a college about 3 hours away in another city, so we did the whole long distance ordeal. 

We've had our fair share of problems, and have broken up a couple times and got back together after a day or so. We do have communication problems to where I can't understand where he's coming from and he can't even begin to understand mine.

However, the biggest issue arose actually when he moved to my city after college for his first real job. Nothing has been the same. We fought 2 days after I came back from seeing my family in China where he accused me of being clingy. Suddenly he wants his space all the time, and spending the whole weekend with me is almost like a 'treat' for me now. I'm confused and I don't know how I should act or relate to the situation.

He calls and texts me every day and constantly tells me he loves me, but when I try to push him to ask him to let me know his weekend plans, he gets irritated that I'm not letting him have his space. We don't really see each other during the week because he has work and I have school + an internship. We game together and he's more than happy to game with me, but I guess spending time with me in person is a whole other thing.

What should I do? I want to be with him more, but he doesn't seem to want that. I don't want to be in a long distance relationship anymore and that's honestly what it feels like. I miss him. How can I stop obsessing over him? What should I do to make him want me again, like he used to? Every time we try to calmly talk to each other about it, we just can't understand each other.

Extra: he's a programmer, he's a gamer, he's introverted. I'm very extroverted, emotional, but I game too. We have the same friend group, which I see and interact with all the time. He doesn't do much outside of work other than 'his own thing'.

1mq7m7,1,2013-09-19,Good day gone horribly bad due to one person's greed.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1mq7m7/good_day_gone_horribly_bad_due_to_one_persons/,"**TLDR: On my way to a job interview today, my wallet fell out of my pocket and someone swiped it, causing me to miss out on a job, lose $100, making me have to go through the stress of replacing all my shit. This is despite the fact it was only on the ground for 10 minutes and was lost only a block away from my house.**

To start the story off with some context, I've been unemployed for a while. After a lengthy unpaid internship that didn't manifest into a job I've been having trouble finding a steady job. About a week ago, however, the founder of a company I used to work messaged me on facebook to see how I was doing. I told her about my life since and she told me to come by the office and we'll have a talk, and a talk we had. She told me about this internship that I could apply for through my connection with that company and that I could possibly come by and do some work for them too. The internship was only minimum wage but hey, it's a start. I was excited for the opportunity.

I applied for the internship, got a response, and set an appointment. That same day, another job that I randomly applied for gave me a call back. It was a part time research job that paid quite well. We made an appointment for an interview the day prior to the internship interview. I didn't schedule them for the same day because my mother recently got out of the hospital and is more or less confined to her bed. I didn't want to be out the house too long on one day in case she needed me. This, as you will see, will end up working in my favor.

Now we get to yesterday. I have a little bit of money, so I decide instead of going to these interviews with the same old clothes that I've gone to previous interviews with, I'm going to get myself a new shirt/pants set and a haircut. (I've lost weight since I got them and they weren't cut that well to begin with). This ended up costing me about $85, plus the transportation costs to get to the interviews cost me a full $100. At this point I only have $100 left over. No more money in any form. I get home, prepare everything for the interview and sleep early.

Now it's today. The big day. My first interview for the better paying job. I'm up early. I get all my clothes ready. I have breakfast. I even jump rope for ten minutes to get the blood flowing and to get myself pumped. I shower, I dress, I leave, and I'm ready to kick some ass.

I'm walking to the bus stop, because even though I do have a car, the bus is often faster because I'm not the only person who thinks it's a good idea to drive to the train station, so it's not uncommon that it would take me more time than it would to *walk* from my house than it would to find parking. I get to the intersection where the bus stop is and two significant things happen at once. 

The first thing was that I hear a huge and rather disgusting splat on the floor. I turn my head to see that a bird just took a huge shit. Directly next to me. While I was in shock at how fucking lucky I was that I wasn't standing just a few inches to the right, I noticed something else. While I was at the intersection, not one, but two busses come. This, especially at this time of day, is a death sentence. The direction I needed to take the train, sits across an intersection with a traffic light that takes way too long to change. It's not uncommon that you'll be waiting for the light to change, and as your waiting the light to change the bus will come, pick up and drop off all it's passengers, and leave before the light changes. However, at this hour, busses run slow. That's just the way it is.

At first I'm like ""fuck!"" but then I realize it's no biggie, I'll just run back to my car and worst case scenario just pay to park in the station. So instead of gambling with the next bus time I take a light sprint back to my car. As I start running back I hear a ""clink"" sound as if I dropped some change. I stop for a second, turn around but see nothing. I resume running and I hear it again, but this time I don't stop because I figure it's something irrelevant. I get to my car, drive to the train station and get lucky and found a parking spot immediately. Then, as I was walking to the train, I found out what one of those clinks were. It was my wallet, falling out of my pocket. Which included: My drivers license, My metrocard to take the train, my health care card, and $100 which, by the way, was the last bit of money I owned. I returned to where I was quite certain my wallet fell out of my pocket. I see my lip balm (which was likely the first thing that fell out of my pockets due to the location it was in) but no wallet. I missed the interview because of this.

What kills me about this is that I lost this wallet **one block away from my house**. Instead of being a good person and returning it, even if they stole the money out of it first, they just chose to steal the whole wallet. The worst part is my ID is out of state and last time I had to get it replaced it took them almost a full three months to get it to me. I also need an ID to get past security tomorrow. 

Today really fucking blows. At least that bird didn't shit on me."

I am in a huge office building, several thousand employees. e.g networking at lunch is kind of tricky (un-targeted), except for the people from my floor/direct department.

[How does being a ratings expert change how you watch TV shows?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccb0mn2?context=5)|Honestly it's sort of ruined TV for me, haha. I can tell from the get go which programs will be canceled in the broadcast season, sometimes without even viewing them. The researchers at the broadcast networks likely know this as well, but sometimes networks will throw things on air to either fill space or try to surprise themselves.
[What do you notice in TV shows as a ratings expert?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccb0mn2?context=5)|Ratings boosts really vary for different shows. I'm sure there are studies out there, but it's really hard to pin down certain specific themes such as a pregnancy in danger that actually HELP shows. You'd have to watch every program and take notes on major and minor plot points. Generally anything you hear like that is based solely on opinion and sometimes used directionally.
[Do you see how different shows try to boost their ratings?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccb0mn2?context=5)|That being said, there are big stops networks will pull to boost ratings. A great example of that is having James Franco guest star on last night's season 2 premiere of Fox's The Mindy Project. They were looking for higher ratings, thinking that their viewer base were James Franco fans, that he is popular enough to help the show, etc. Mindy Show was actually down in the ratings for last night's episode so it clearly didn't work. Whether guest stars or other plots like that help a show depends on how its done and whether a show's audience appreciates it. You never really know until it works... or it doesn't :)
[House MD episodes with flavor of the week celebrities, that sort of thing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccb0mn2?context=5)|A lot of decisions made in the television world aren't based on data. Lots of development people push things through to toot their own horns even after us nerds in research warn them against it, and then they wonder why their shows fail. Trust the nerds, damnit!
[A great question and answer. Do you know of any further examples you could share?  Also, are there shows optimised not for a specfic audience (pregnancy in danger / women\) but for a certain geographic reagon (e.g. westcoast\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccbpn0q?context=5)|Not as much for regions - that wouldn't be very strategic because then you're only gearing it to a certain part of the country, thus lowering the possibility for higher ratings. I guess one could argue that for any demographic, but I think regional targeting would be a mistake on any network's part.
[I\) nobody bats an eye at extreme violence (think Hannibal\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccaz3lm?context=5)|I think it really has to do with desensitizing. Sure, people watch porn and have sex regularly, but it's not something that's been dealt with by the mainstream media. A good example of this is the MPAA, the ratings council for movies. They'll rate any sort of gory violence (think Saw) with an R, but it's hard to get any sort of overt instances of female sexuality into a movie without nabbing an NC-17 rating. This same phenomenon goes on in TV. When it's not being hammered home in mainstream media every day, the instinct to push it under the rug is reinforced.  I think over the past few seasons especially, broadcast TV has really been pushing its limits with violence - Hannibal is a great example, as is The Following. I couldn't believe some of the shots that were included in both of those shows.
[What ""bad word"" do you think will be censored less in the next 5 years??](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccazgx5?context=5)|Gotta go with ""fuck"" on this one. Some shows just NEED that word for emphasis.
 |Fun fact: Breaking Bad is allowed ONE censored 'fuck' per season and they always use it well. If you're a fan, r/breakingbad has a great graphic floating around regarding the scenes it has been used in.
[Link to youtu.be , seems like they use 'fuck' a bunch of times on season one alone.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccbji9l?context=5)|Talk to my peeps over at r/breakingbad and give them your correction ;)
[With Netflix changing how a Television series is distributed, do you think this will effect the big 4 networks? Also do you think it will have any effect how a TV show is broadcast?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccazqb6?context=5)|That's a great question. I think Netflix is changing the tv landscape by a huge margin.
 |1) Networks/distribution companies are working WITH Netflix to make the most out of their shows. When Netflix first became a ""thing,"" I remember a lot of backlash from executives thinking the site would hurt our business. Now its been embraced as something that can help. What happened with Breaking Bad this season is a perfect example of what I like to call the ""Netflix effect"" on certain shows. BB has had record ratings this year, and I attribute that majorly to people catching up on Netflix between seasons - if it hadn't been available so easily, I'm not sure if it would have recruited that many new viewers in its last season.
 |2) Netflix's proprietary shows (House of Cards, Orange is the New Black, etc) are showing up a LOT of programming on cable right now. Those two series are some of the best new programs of the past few years in my opinion.
 |To answer your questions: I don't know if it will effect the big 4 networks, as cable has already effected them so much that I think they're at a plateau. They know they have to start developing better shows or they'll be dead in the water. With the advent of DVRs, pirating of programs, Hulu, Netflix, etc., the push is really still toward the content. Content needs to be produced to show up on those platforms, and the fact of the matter is that the broadcast nets have the money to do it. If anything, I think it'll make their programming better as we now have more options for viewing and the competition is fierce.
 |In terms of how programs are broadcast, I haven't seen any change in that so far, but I know broadcast nets are amping up their summer offerings to complement viewing going on elsewhere (cable, Netflix).
[This. I know behibd closed doors you guys discuss what can and can't happen. What's the reason on this one?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccaz7gw?context=5)|There's a certain amount of discussion behind closed doors, yes, but always about sex and not really about violence. The main issue is in my response to Hymen Annihilator (can't believe I just typed those two words together) - what an overarching bureaucratic entity (ie the MPAA) deems as 'acceptable.'
 |Fun fact: Cable TV is actually NOT regulated by the FCC, but is self-governed, so we can really show whatever we want. We don't because a) cable companies have some carriage rules we have to abide by or we run the risk of getting dropped if its persistant, and b) there are lots of interest groups that will inundate us and the cable companies with complaints - that's a major issue. They'll complain about sex but not violence, mostly because they are the sorts of groups that are EXTREMELY conservative socially but don't care about violence.
[In case you're a parent, do (or did\) you enforce the ratings in your home or is (was\) there the occasional ""Meh, gonna let that one slip""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccaznq1?context=5)|I'm not a parent yet, but I will say I don't remember ever having TV or movies censored when I was younger and I turned out just fine. Kids aren't even interested in things people censor them from until an age when their natural curiosity regarding sex and violence comes out anyway. I can sort of get behind the desensitization argument - if a child sees violence over and over again on television, they will be less fazed by it in the future - true. A child can see violence at school and at home as well.
 |I think a lot of problems regarding personal responsibility are blamed on the media, leading to censorship arguments. But, in my opinion, someone who has the capacity to kill/harm another person had that capacity in them regardless of what they've seen on TV or in the movies. 
[How has sex, violence, and drugs changed on TV over the last few decades?  Particularly from a ratings perspective.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccb0pc0?context=5)|In terms of how it's changed over the past few decades, I think in both television and film, viewers are more likely to accept anything. It has to do with desensitization to both sex and violence - we see it so much that we want more and more for it to continue being interesting to us.
[Do you go into things like what types of actors and actresses get ratings, and what kind of people to cast?  For instance zeeva on NCIS or something.  Do you see ratings play a role in people brought into shows?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccb0pc0?context=5)|Before we cast someone in a program or movie, we definitely look into casting. There are entire research firms that deal solely in actors, actresses and television personalities, and how the public sees them and whether or not they're interesting enough. A lot of casting has to do with budget as well. Some actors are more expensive than you'd think, and some are a lot cheaper than you'd think.
[I agree. Until I was around 12 I would gasp and instantly close any window that said anything like sex or gore...Let's say I've gone a complete 180 on one of those.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccb420v?context=5)|Hahaha, haven't we all?
[I realize this probably isn't the focus of your thread, but if one wanted to get into entertainment agency/marketing related business, e.g. casting agency, what are the steps/qualifications needed? Is it mostly about knowing the right people and being lucky? Do you have to be in LA? Do you need a degree? How competitive is it to get a job in the field?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccb3hbq?context=5)|I'd say LA, NYC, Chicago (in that order) are the cities you'd need to be in to be successful in casting. I have friends who are in the casting industry and they all started at the bottom through internships or mailrooms and worked their way up.
 |In terms of qualifications, a media degree isn't necessary but I'm positive it would be appreciated. I think experience in previous casting (college theatre, etc) would be extremely valuable as well.
 |Just keep in mind that not everyone knows the right people, sometimes it's just about being in the right place at the right time. Good luck!
[Do the major cable networks really regard Nielsen ratings that much when in today's world there's so many other ways to gauge popularity and success?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccb0bnj?context=5)|Yes, most certainly. It is the #1 factor in deciding a show's fate. Per rating point, Nielsen ratings bring in way more revenue than online views (via network websites or purchased by ep through iTunes or Amazon), at least for now. Nielsen ratings also account for On Demand usage and, in some cases, network website viewing.
 |It's also interesting to think about all of those baby boomers/Gen X-ers over 35 or so who aren't viewing any programming online at all, and they represent a huge chunk of profitable television viewers.
[If you don't mind me asking what Masters program did you do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccbc3fd?context=5)|Hey there! First of all, GREAT USERNAME! Jealous its yours and not mine!
[ do you think that it was necessary for getting where you are today?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccbc3fd?context=5)|And wow, it's great to see someone so interested in getting into the television research field! It's a great position to be in, as executives and programmers really take what comes from me and my department to heart and trust us to give them good information about our programming and the programming of competitive networks. We are the braintrust of the company.
[What else should I be doing to get into to the industry/make myself more competitive?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccbc3fd?context=5)|I am based out of NYC, and I got my MA in TV/radio/film at the Newhouse School at Syracuse University. I started directly after graduation from my state school undergrad, where I studied general communication. I don't think it was absolutely necessary to have gone to such a prestigious communications school, but it definitely helped me land my first job as it looks great on a resume. That being said, plenty of people I work with went to relatively unknown state schools and I am the only one in my department with an MA - I'm hoping that'll help me more in the future when I'm ready to rule the roost :)
[What's your favorite thing about your career so far?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccbc3fd?context=5)|I think your experiences so far are a great foundation for getting into research; if you can, I'd definitely try to get an internship in some sort of research capacity. If you're not in a major city (NY, LA, Chicago, Miami, Orlando and Atlanta have research communities), most local TV stations in a mid-sized city have at least one research person you may be able to intern with. Also, check your area for research companies that are not part of a media company, i.e. third party vendors. A lot of them are not based in huge cities.
[What has been the most challenging?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccbc3fd?context=5)|My favorite thing about my career so far, hmm... I love being an expert at something, and it feels great to be in a meeting and be expected to know everything. I'm a know it all by nature so that is extremely satisfying to me, haha :) Meeting celebs doesn't suck either! The most challenging is definitely dealing with the politics of a huge multinational company (which most cable and broadcast networks are owned by), but that happens in many industries.
[When networks are picking up shows, what's more important to them: Finding content they thing is actually good, or stuff they think will get big ratings?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccbc3fd?context=5)|When networks are picking up shows, it is definitely a blend of looking for what's good and what will rate, and yes, there is a LOT of discussion about every presentation tape, casting tape, and pilot that we see. A network has to have shows that rate in order to create shows they feel are good because those kinds of shows are expensive to make, and the higher ratings a network has, the more revenue they pull in through ad sales.
[I'm assuming they try to go for both, or somewhere in the middle, but is there a lot of discussion about this dichotomy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccbc3fd?context=5)|Recently, the president of my network axed a show everyone wanted green lit because they knew it could pull big numbers if edited and marketed correctly, but he denied it because he thought it was too low brow. I definitely respected him for that.
[Kind of going off that, some shows seem like such obvious flops (like Fox's new show Dad's\) that it's surprising they're even made.  What is the justification/thought process behind picking up shows like that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccbc3fd?context=5)|Some shows are obvious flops, BUT - Dads actually did pretty well in the ratings even though it's not great. Always, ALWAYS assume that if a show is getting THAT much bad press, the network's PR team is probably behind it in some way, trying to get viewers to check out what is so bad about it, thus possibly getting them hooked and driving ratings.
[ even just what goes into deciding what to pick up in general?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccbc3fd?context=5)|Thanks so much for your question - totally happy to answer any others you have. Good luck in your endeavors! :)
[Wow, thank you for this detailed response! It's incredibly informative (and super interesting\). Thank you for taking the time to write that all out.  I actually do live near NYC, and that's where my internship was. I'll definitely look into research internships.  I didn't really know about the 3rd party research vendors, so I'll check those out as well.  I have another question: How do you go about the research? Is it working with focus groups, going over data from Nielsen etc? What does an average day for you look like? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccbv43w?context=5)|A little of all of the above! Nielsen ratings for the networks I'm responsible for, competitive Nielsen ratings and program scheduling, keeping up to date on everything going on in the TV world, estimating how we think upcoming programs may do, attending development screenings and discussions, focus groups, all of those and much more depending on the day!
[Do you use any advanced or proprietary models to interpret ratings? The kinds of analyses done by and for the public (ie. TVbythenumbers.com\) seem fairly primitive.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccbch7v?context=5)|We can look at ratings literally any way we want. We have tools from not just Nielsen, but 4-5 other companies that push the Nielsen data out in different ways. I can get down to a very granular level and tell you what ONE viewer in the sample watches all day long. The public face of ratings is very simple because the process is very hard to understand.
[How much do total viewers matter vs. getting the right demos? Is it true that advertisers (and by extension networks\) are by and large unenthusiastic about shows that might draw large numbers in demos outside 18-49?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccbch7v?context=5)|Total viewers matter for different reasons than demos. In general, we look at the total viewer number for press stories, which is why you see the term 'total viewers' a lot in any sort of ratings article you see. Those numbers come from people like me. Demo ratings matter more to people at the network when touting a show's successes and deciding whether to keep it. We care more about getting to the demo we want because that's how we make our money. No one sells ads based on total viewer numbers, always on demos. 18-49 is the most popular demo, but advertisers care about a lot of different demos depending on their product.
[What's the feeling in the industry right now about the viability of serialized dramas? They're what gets the most prestige and where you find the most creative risks, but it seems like they're also seen as difficult to monetize - that they're more likely to be DVR'd or binge-watched on Netflix.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccbch7v?context=5)|The viability of serialized dramas is a mixed bag. On one hand, a good serialized drama or two is likely to put a network on the map (think AMC), but they are expensive to produce. They bring in a lot of ad dollars because of their high ratings, but some don't really repeat well. In terms of when they're viewed, they are still monetized as long as they're watched within the first 3 days on your DVR, as sales figures are based on those first 3 days. I myself am a drama viewer, so I hope they continue putting on really good series.
[As cable gets a bigger and bigger audience while the broadcast audience gets diluted, is there some double edged sword action happening where the cable networks now feel more pressure to make hit shows?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccbch7v?context=5)|We definitely feel the pressure to make hit shows, and its really hard to accept that not every show can be a hit. It's up to me as a researcher to keep executives and programmers level headed and try to always be realistic about a show so they don't get their hopes up if we know it won't do well. Sometimes we're wrong but the majority of the time we're not. There aren't very many surprise hits - we tend to know just from seeing ratings day in and day out and being pounded over the head with tv all day every day what's going to work and what's not. BUT - we still put things on the air that we're not overly confident in because you never know. I have been surprised by the ratings for very few shows in my career thus far.
[Do you interact much with creatives in your job? Any crazy stories about showbiz eccentrics?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccbch7v?context=5)|I work with the development team a lot, who are the producers on the network side. They have to sell themselves and their shows, so if you listen to them, every show is the next Walking Dead. Showbiz eccentrics are less frequent in cable companies than they are at production companies - we may be in TV but we're still a corporation with guidelines and HR :)
[Why do networks cancel huge shows like Breaking Bad or House, even though they're still doing well? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccb4lpw?context=5)|There's a difference between being canceled and ending.
 |BB was not canceled, it's just ending. Sometimes from a creative/story standpoint, a show is just over. I actually think most programs tend to get better when they decide on an end date because every episode matters. 
[I was under the impression (from things I read\) that they wanted to do another season because they had some more stuff they wanted to put in, but AMC pulled the plug.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccb4uro?context=5)|I think it was a budgeting issue - they wanted 6 seasons but AMC was concerned a full season would be too expensive so they compromised at a fifth season split into two sets of 8.
[Do the executives really think they will come up with another show that will give a better ROI(of airtime and pruduction costs\)?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccbkg7j?context=5)|I don't know the specifics of the budget for that particular show, only that they wanted a full season 6 and they compromised on season 5 in 2 parts. 
[Why are there some really crap shows out there? And why does it seem to keep going down in quality year after year?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccb1lp5?context=5)|Here here! I totally agree with you, friend.
[I swear, at this rate we will be a society (like in the movie Idiocracy\) which watches an ass farting for a whole hour and are entertained by it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccb1lp5?context=5)|That being said - networks will put on whatever rates, even when they don't particularly like a show. They have to put something on air (that they can afford - each episode of a show costs $) while they're looking for the best stuff.
[How about more science shows on the science channels and comedy (actual funny stuff and not just shock value bs\) on the comedy channels!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccb1lp5?context=5)|I think a big culprit is the huge amount of selection we now have. 
[Do you feel as though Nielson ratings are a fair assessment of a show's fate? I heard, somewhere, that there's only something like 5000 Nielson households in the US. Is that true? 5k out of 300mil cannot possibly be accurate. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccb3dxj?context=5)|I think they're as fair as they can be, to be honest.
 |The sample is generally between 20,000-22,000 households.
[What do you think is the best show on TV?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccb3uxw?context=5)|On right now? Gotta go with Breaking Bad. I've seen most modern drama series in their entireties and I have to say Breaking Bad is among the best ever.
 |Other quality drama programs on right now: Homeland, Game of Thrones, Bates Motel, House of Cards (Netflix). Mad Men is great but an acquired taste and, in my opinion, overrated in terms of awards. Walking Dead was great the first couple of seasons but in my opinion has kind of lost its storytelling luster. Dexter was a great show at one time but this final season has gone downhill.
 |On broadcast TV, I think Scandal is kind of soap-y but it's really well done. I really like The Following as well. There aren't really any hard hitting dramas on broadcast that I enjoy right now. Have seen a bit of Hannibal and want to check it out.
 |In terms of comedies, I'd go with New Girl, Parks &amp; Rec, Arrested Development. Modern Family's first few seasons were amazing, I wasn't as impressed with last season though. I was a huge 30 Rock fan and was sad to see it go.
[The networks all used to be pretty different- CourtTV was pretty different from Discovery which was different from Country Music TV which was different from MTV which was different from History. Now it seems like they're all airing COPS reruns and fake ""reality shows"".](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccb270b?context=5)|In this sort of context, ""real"" is relative. Absolutely none of the reality shows on air right now have never asked one of their subjects to do something again one more time to get a good shot. It happens in every show.
[Is the American public that low that the networks get better ratings that way?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccb270b?context=5)|Some are obviously more factual than others. The lawsuit about Storage Wars isn't as cut and dry as one might think. Dave (YUUUP) was suing based on a perception that things weren't going his way. I believe they settled out of court.
[What are some reality shows that are real and which are fake. I know all those towing shows on TruTV are fake as is Storage Wars (which we found out was fake due to the lawsuit\). I'm assuming Discovery and National Geographic still air a lot of real stuff- I'm assuming Jungle Gold, Alaska State Troopers, etc are real? What about Shipping Wars?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccb270b?context=5)|Definite fakes on TRU, lots of fake on MTV but some is quite real. Bravo shows are partially directed/scripted (Real Housewives). TLC stuff is just awful, I'm sure some of that is scripted (the interviews in Honey Boo Boo are DEFINITELY scripted). The more jobs based stuff like on History, Discovery and Nat Geo are less likely to be scripted. Any reality show that has funny sound bites in an interview style has probably been scripted to some extent.
[What do  think about dexter season 8 ? and what is your best TV show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccbhv3s?context=5)|Dexter season 8 has not been great, I'm ready for the show to end. I long for the heyday of Dexter when it was amazing. That said, I still have affection for the characters so I follow the show still because of that.
 |My #1 show right now is Breaking Bad! Amazing.
[If someone had a neilson box is there any way for you to pay said person to watch your network?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccb0zpr?context=5)|That would be HIGHLY illegal and in breech of any network's Nielsen contract. Oprah once tweeted trying to get anyone with a Nielsen box to watch something on OWN and they reprimanded her for it by not even releasing ratings for the program she was begging viewers to watch.
[How do i get a neilsen box? I know thousands and thousands of people.  not one has a neilson box. how can you have a representative sample?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccbk980?context=5)|Having a Nielsen box isn't something people always talk about and I believe there are confidentiality rules as well, so I'm not surprised you don't think any of them have one. Chances are, though, that someone you know has or has had a Nielsen box in their home at one time.
[Is there any sort of push to make tv less mundane?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccb1gg3?context=5)|Personally, I think we're in a great era of TV right now. Reality shows are kind of whatever to me, but the dramas that are on TV right now are heavy, well written, interesting and addictive.
 |I agree some genres are mundane. Don't worry, every network is pushing to find the next original and exciting thing at all times. Whether or not you or I find that exciting is a different story :)
[Whats the deal with dicks not being on tv?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccbpoqv?context=5)|I wonder the same thing. Daily.
[Does your research indicate how the Al Jazeera America network (the one that's on Al Gore's old channel\) is doing?  I think they really dropped the ball when they cut off Internet access and went strictly cable. What do you think?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccb8bf3?context=5)|Al Jazeera America took over Current TV (which was Al Gore's old channel) on your cable system, that is correct. I'm seeing about a 20% drop in ratings since they switched over, but the ratings are SO small (about 1% of what a network like USA would do). The smaller a rating is, the higher the standard deviation is, so that 20% should be taken with a grain of salt.
[As opposed to all the other networks' israel connections?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccbkhcn?context=5)|Just as an FYI, that is not my personal view, of course. But Al Jazeera is a recognizable name from the Middle East, and while it may be fucked up, I do think that will influence how people view the channel. Middle Eastern countries strike a chord with people in the US that does not have the same influence over them as something from Israel.
[What is your take on AMAZON TV ? Do you see them as a serious player in the industry (or becoming a serious player\)?  Until recently , I had no idea they existed until a friend alerted me to it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccb9fgq?context=5)|I'll likely start paying more attention to them when they start putting out something people talk about and it gets on my radar. I said the same thing about Netflix and they've done a great job with development and releasing really great original programming, so we'll see what Amazon TV has to offer!
[What the hell happen to NBC? Back in the 90s, they were the gold standard of premium television. But if Saturday Night Live is the highest viewed show for the week, then something horribly has gone afoul. What necessary steps can NBC take to resume their prestige?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccb4jxa?context=5)|It's really about developing new shows. I'm not privy to what exactly lead to their downfall, but I'm sure they got lazy with development because they had so many hit shows, but every show fades eventually. That was their big mistake.
[Ok...what network?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccayzrc?context=5)|Can't share that :)
[Okay, I have two questions here. 1\) Why was Lie to me cancelled, what was wrong with it?  2\) Same question but in regards to Breakout Kings.  Both were awesome Criminal shows. What gives? Every regular person I've met loved them, so what were the professional reasons?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccbk0yd?context=5)|In both cases, ratings. If they're not there, they're just not there. Crime shows like that don't have the cult-ish sort of following something like Community has, so they don't have that to fall back on. Dramas like that are also more expensive to produce than a reality or comedy show, so there is less tolerance for low ratings.
[My question more was about how the system itself seems to over exaggerate just how many people are watching TV altogether. Isn't there some sort of bias towards TV watching considering that the samples taken are presumably from households that watch a lot of TV? Are these sorts of things taken into account when numbers like 10 million are decided upon?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccb35at?context=5)|The samples taken aren't necessarily from households that watch a lot of TV - and the sample rotates all the time, so a certain household may only be included for a couple of months. They rotate to keep the sample fresh and representative of the whole country and their television viewing habits.
[Agh,  That's unfortunate.  Nothing against reality TV but i much rather prefer something scripted. I have enough people around me to shake my head at lol.  Do you have a particular preference in the types of shows you watch?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccbkz7g?context=5)|I am 100% a drama viewer. I prefer my TV to be heavy, tragic, funny and well told in terms of story and visuals. I like comedies as well, but only those that are filmed more like dramas (single cam, i.e. The Office, 30 Rock, New Girl, Parks &amp; Rec, Modern Family, Louie, Veep). I'm not a reality viewer at all, the only reality shows I ever follow are documentary style - Drugs Inc, Lock Up, Intervention, etc.
[Do networks factor how rabid a fanbase is for a show? For example, if the ratings aren't good but it has a devoted fanbase with lots of chatter on the Internet, does that help mitigate bad ratings to any major extent? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccbleo7?context=5)|It's definitely considered in the grand scheme of things and whether to keep a show on air or not. I answered more in depth when someone asked about Community in another question so please look for that.
[Here's one that I've been wondering forever and would love to haev an insider's answer to. When it comes to Neilson et al, as far as I know we haven't gottent to the point where every single cable box is reporting on us, right? Therefore Neilson is an extrapolation. I don't know the numbers, but there's like 400M people in the USA and I'd be surprised if there's even 1M Neilson boxes. So TV charges advertisers based on a guess that could actually be COMPLETELY WRONG. With Hulu, Amazon, et al you know EXACTLY how many people are watching. But advertisers refuse to pay as much money for those ads. Or at least I've HEARD so far that if all TV went to Hulu it wouldn't be sustainable. (Even though it's MUCH MUCH harder to skip those ads than when watching it on a DVR in regular TV\) SO why is this? It seems backwards.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mnyct/i_am_a_television_ratings_expert_working_for_a/ccbj3a9?context=5)|Firstly, Hulu, Amazon, Netflix, etc are relatively new technologies. Their ratings reporting is completely proprietary, meaning only THEY can see their numbers. Their advertisers have no guarantee they aren't fudging them up at all. That's the first issue.
 |Regarding your Nielsen question, no, every cable box is not measured. Not everyone has cable/satellite, some get the broadcast stations for free over the air using a digital antenna - there would be no way to get those ratings if that were the case. It's also very 'big brother' (in an Orwellian sense, not in a CBS sense) to be tapping each and every person's cable box. Some people don't want anyone to know what they're watching.

(Sorry, long and sad)",ChiliCloud,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/1mpckc/might_as_well_do_an_intro_also_i_just_had/,"Hi everyone! I haven't done an intro yet but thought this might be a good time since I was going to make a post about my horrible last two days.

I live in northern Sweden with my SO, two dogs and a turtle. We used to have two guinea pigs but sold them about a week ago since we will need the time and space for the baby. We have been together for 4 years and we are both studying to become teachers at the moment (I'm doing my final internship before writing my exam paper). We are also both graduating by the end of January just a few weeks before the baby is due. Today I am 16+5 weeks along. 

My favorite things to do are read books, take walks in the forest with my dogs and watch movies with my SO. 

I had an copper IUD that I removed May 29th. We got pregnant on the first try and I got my positive pregnancy test June 25th. I had an fairly easy first trimester with a lot of exhaustion, sore boobs and some nausea. I only threw up like 3 times or so. By 15 weeks the nausea was gone and my energy levels were almost back up. Finally I felt like myself again. 

Then of course I got sick! Tuesday morning I woke up with some stomach pain. I went to work anyway (couldn't call in sick because my mentor was out of town and I was the only teacher that could take care of his class that day) but the pain kept getting worse through out the day. I just sucked it up until I got home at 4.30. As soon as I sat down on my bed I broke down in tears and my SO had me called the medical guidance line.  They told me to go to the emergency room immediately. Waited there for about 3 hours until I got to see an OB. 


He did and ultrasound and I GOT TO SEE MY BABY! (mom joked that it was all an elaborate plan for me to get a free ultrasound :P ) It was perfectly healthy and I finally felt some relief even though I was still in a lot of pain. The OB referred to it as a ""she"" one time but I'm still not sure what the gender is since the doctor was foreign and ""he"" and ""she"" sounds really similar in Swedish (Han and Hon). I didn't ask about it though, all that mattered was that the baby was fine. I also got my date changed to March 1st. 

Then I got to meet a surgeon and turns out I was not as fine. They suspected that I had appendicitis and transferred me from the emergency ward to the surgical ward. I had to wait a couple more hours and my sister and SO came and visited me until around 1 am. At 1.30  they told me I was going into surgery but they didn't want to use general anesthesia because I was pregnant. Instead I got a spinal one and got to be awake during the surgery. It was super scary and at one point it really hurt. I got a little bit of morphine and local anesthesia but mostly just powered through cause I didn't want to take any risks with the baby. 
The surgery took over 2 hours cause they couldn't find the damn thing but then finally they did and they saw right away that it was guilty. 
So, now I am at home with only paracetamol to help with the pain. If not for the baby I would be doped up and happy but now I am just miserable. I can barely stand up by myself and my SO have to help me when I need to go to the bathroom. I've cried several times because I feel so helpless.




 At one point I had to go to the bathroom and my SO was at the computer with the headphones in another room. Our deal was that I was going to call him on skype if I needed help but I dropped my phone and couldn't even pick it up. I sat on the bed for 20 minutes crying and just hoping that I wouldn't pee myself. Then one of my dogs came and I wrote a note on a paper and told her to go to ""Husse"" (like master in Swedish) and she took it her mouth and went and gave it too him. She is such a good dog.  
I think she knows that I am sick because she's been staying really close ever since I got home and start whining whenever I cry. The other dog is just happily oblivious :P 
This got a lot longer that I intended too but it was hard to tell the story in any other way. Thank you for listening/reading

Anyone else got their appendix removed? how was it? How long after where you in pain? I just want to get back on my feet! 

**TL;DR:  Got to see my baby for the first time on an ultrasound and it was healthy. Had to have emergency surgery to remove appendix. Now I'm in a lot of pain and feeling helpless.** "

I'm currently applying for an internship at UFRJ, the deadline is this Sunday, September 22. I'm a student of political science. I have a couple of questions in relation to this, some of which are really essential for making my application valid. I hope some of you are able, willing and have time to help me :)

Firstly, the webpage of UFRJ is not working, but I need essential info about:

1. How many credits do I need to take a year in order to be a ""full time student""? I have to know this in order to be able to know how many courses to take - it's mandatory for me to study ""full time"". A link to the statemant about full time credits would be very helpful. 

2. Is there by any chance a list of all the courses at UFRJ in English? 

This second question leads to my third question:

3. Is it a stupid idea going to UFRJ not speaking a word of Portuguese right now? I plan to follow a course in Portuguese this spring plus take an shorter, intensive, personal course in Brazil prior to my studies. 

4. Also, my second choice of university is probably PUC in Sao Paulo (I have to prioritize 3). Do you have any thoughts on this? Question 1 and 2 is relevant in relation to PUC SP as well. 

I hope someone can help - please feel free to speak up if you have any ideas, thought or anything else relevant to my plans! "

Part Two: http://www.reddit.com/r/Pitt/comments/1j6p1y/collegeanswerz_redesigned/


I need some advice...  

1) How can I improve the site.  From a design perspective?  From a content perspective (ie. what should I add?)?  I've continually gotten feedback, made improvements, gotten feedback, made improvements etc., but I've sorta hit a wall and don't know what else to do.  

2) The most important thing for me right now is getting people to answer questions.  Let me explain some things, and then tell me your thoughts and ideas.  

- I tried various ways of getting people to answer questions.  Facebook, text people, talk to people I know in person, ask random people, I gave 5 people on campus a free dollar and asked them to answer questions (none of them did; my thinking was that people would do it based on the principle of reciprocity), I've posted on Reddit, other websites, facebook groups etc. etc. etc.  Basically, none of it worked.  Posting on all the Pitt facebook groups got a few people, but the response rate was still very low.  The response rate for the other stuff was also extremely extremely low.  Pitt's page does have a solid amount of content, but it's mostly from close friends.  And even my close friends have been very hard to get to do it.  
- I talked to a Pitt administrator, and he said I can't get all the @pitt.edu email addresses of students and email everyone to ask them.  And he couldn't figure out how Princeton Review does this: http://www.princetonreview.com/how-we-do-it.aspx.  
- I emailed 25 club/organization presidents at Pitt, asking them to answer questions, make an announcement at their next club meeting, and forward the email to their members to ask them to answer questions.  Only one guy emailed me back in 3 days (he said he'd forward the email).  
- It seems like the 'ask people to do it for free' method isn't working.  I'm thinking about various incentives.  1) Give the best answerer at every school $100.  It'd first go by who answers the most, and then by who has the best answers.  I'd probably be the judge of who did a better job answering.  I would try this out at like 10 schools first, paying them with my own money, and if it worked, I'd raise money from investors (with the first 10 schools being proof that the money they give me will be effective).  2) Offer people at different schools... $25 if they could get 5 answers per question for their schools page (60 questions total), $50 for 10 answers per question, and $100 for 20 answers per question.  I started this yesterday with my friend at UCSD who thinks he could easily get the $100.  If any of you know someone who'd be interested in this, let me know.  3) Have an internship program where the intern would be the representative for their school, and would try to get people to answer questions for their school, and in return, they'd get half the ad revenue for their schools page.  

PS: As always, if you could take 10 minutes and answer a few questions, it'd be much appreciated.  http://www.collegeanswerz.com/university-of-pittsburgh/"

I am unhappy right now and I don't know why. 

I am about to turn 27-years-old on Monday. I don't have any plans to go out with anyone. Growing up in high school and my early years of college, I had a lot of friends and a core group of close friends. For different reasons we've all changed and things aren't the same and I keep in touch with a few but on a surface level. My current closest friends don't live in my area and I see them once or twice a year (although one, who is a former college roommate is visiting in October). 

I'm not a big birthday person but I feel sad that I'm going to turn 27 and I'll be by myself. Sure I'll get a bunch of Facebook ""happy birthdays!"" and a good amount of calls from family but all I want is for a group of close friends to take me out for a drink or two and laugh and have fun. And it's not going to happen. 

                                              ***
Another reason I am unhappy is my job. I hate my job. I graduated in the height of the recession with a journalism degree. (Double whammy). I worked two unpaid internships and I hustled and worked my way to having a job with the government that on paper is enviable. I liked it the first few months but I've been here for two years and I can't take it.

The management team is inept. They only care about making themselves look good. You should see how they talk about things that happen in the media and how it reflects on their image. It's not about the tax payer at all, all the work we do in the office is self-serving. 

The morale in the office is bad. There are some lifers who are hanging on just so they can collect the huge benefits and retire. Then there is a younger set around my age who are using the place as a stepping stone. 

I've been trying to leave for over a year and I haven't found a position. I have a pretty strong network and they've sent me opportunities and put in good words on my behalf but I keep getting to the final interview round and not getting the job. 

I started a blog/website and that has found some success. Not as quickly as I hoped but I've thrown events and am planning to do so again in the future. I really would love to work on that full time. But really, I just want to wake up and go to work and feel like I'm contributing towards something that matters. I would love to be rich, but that's not my goal at all. I just want to come home at the end of the day and feel fulfilled, like my effort and time wasn't for vain. 

When I wake up in the morning I dread going to work. Right now as I type this it's 11:32 p.m. and I am shaking my head at the thought of going to work tomorrow for another terrible day in that dysfunctional place. I know it's not just me, there are many people trying to leave as well. 

I've been trying to make the best of the situation, waking up early around 6 a.m. to do at least ONE thing for me like workout, write, work on my site, or just relax for a few hours before work. This way it lessens the feeling like work is the central activity in my life. When I do this, I do find my days are better but the fact remains my work environment is very toxic and I'm there most of the day. 

I'm a contractor and my contract ends December 31 and I have decided I won't be returning, no matter if I have another job lined up or not. My emotional health can't take it anymore. I am looking at other jobs like being a courier or even working at a restaurant if I have to. I'm also saving some cash aside now so I have a few months rent and food just in case. The situation still causes me some stress though and I think the number one thing I want in my life is to just have fulfilling work. And the fact I've been looking and trying to get it for so long and haven't made it happen makes me extremely frustrated and also extremely scared that it'll always be like this. 

                                              ***
The third thing I'm unhappy about is I am realizing I am emotionally unavailable. I was a late-bloomer in terms of women. I always, from the time I was young really was super invested in women and I was always ""the friend"". I thought I was ""too nice"" but the thing is I just wasn't assertive and honest with them about my intentions because I didn't want to face the possibility of rejection and that was my fault. 

I read a book called No More Mr. Nice Guy and from there I learned where I went wrong and slowly became more confident with women. I recently ended an almost 3-year-relationship. For many reasons, it just didn't work out. I love her but she was increasingly extremely needy and insecure and even when I talked with her about this and offered to help her - it just never got better. I felt trapped and drained with her, even though I think she's a great person. 

I miss her but realized I needed to move on, so I did. This was about a month ago. 

I went onto Match.com and met two women. I'm still getting to know both and I've been on 3 or 4 dates with each. I like both for different reasons but I'm interested to see where things go. I can tell that one of the two is definitely full on interested and she's emotionally available. The other one just recently broke up with a boyfriend of two years and although she says she's ready to date, my gut tells me she isn't (or she's just not into me -- although I called her out on this and she says she wouldn't invest time in me if she wasn't). 

Something about the one girl being very into me is something that scares me and I don't know why. As soon to be 27 I imagine I will settle down soon. Also as a late bloomer who has come into his own with women, a part of me wants to see what's out there for awhile. 

I'm seeing her tomorrow night and I'm sure we'll have a good time. I want to tell her part of what I just wrote, about the emotionally available stuff but that's a terrible idea and self-sabatoge. I think I just need to really figure out what it is I want. 

I SAY I want a solid, committed relationship and then when the potential is staring at me, I'm not feeling as excited as I should be. I also feel like I'm cheating on my ex even though we have been broken up for a little over a month. 

Part of the emotional unavailability I think stems from porn addiction. It's something I've been battling with, hence the user name. It's not something crazy where I jack off in the bathroom at work or something. It's just that I've been trying to quit porn for over five years and I haven't been able to do it. Hell I've been on reddit.com/r/nofap for about a year or two years where the first goal is to go 90 days without porn and my best is like 65 days or so. 

I think that connection I have to this porn makes having the connection I want in real life more difficult. Actually as I write this I'm more certain this is a core problem to the emotional unavailability. 

So I know this is a wall of text, and I don't know if anyone actually will read but these three areas are making me unhappy and are cause for trouble on my mind. I'm open to any advice if you have it, or a story of your own that may help. 

Anyway, I feel better getting this out and hopefully someone can relate as well. "

The degree entailed an assortment of molecular biology and computer science coursework. I chose this degree because of the versatility (or so I thought) it afforded me in terms of career paths.

My experiences in my internships gave me a solid understand of the typical medical device and pharmaceutical development process (from R&amp;D to mass production). I've been trying to leverage this in applying primarily to positions calling for entry level Biotech/Healthcare Research Analyst/Associate positions, but I'm worried my experience makes me look like too much of a lab tech. 

Is there more I can do to come off as a better candidate? How can I apply to more general entry level IB jobs (ie. programs preferring 0-2 yrs experience with finance/accounting majors)? Any advice/suggestions/comments would be helpful! Thank you!"

1mt51u,0,2013-09-20,My boss (M/35?) has invaded my privacy. Am I (F/23) overreacting?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1mt51u/my_boss_m35_has_invaded_my_privacy_am_i_f23/,"I sat down at my cubicle this morning to find that my computer had been ""woken up"" since the screen saver was not on. On my chair were receipts from my boss, who was the only other person in the office. I asked my coworker who said he has gone through things in her workspace before. (My computer was password-locked... This time anyway.)

The evening before, he had gotten angry because of a project I had been working on for my other boss. He emailed several questions about it to me, because I had told people I needed to talk to for the project that I worked with him (he typically works more with these people...I also said I was calling on behalf of someone else). Apparently this project is causing a stir, and people were calling him about it. He emailed me about the mess it was causing after his questioning and cc'd my other boss. I was upset because I felt he was basically shooting the messenger; he should have just taken it up with my boss who was responsible for it.

Later today, I come back from lunch to find more receipts from this boss. This time, a document I had left out with a few notes on it had gone missing. This document was given to me by an admin. in another office with a list of each person in our office's contracts, with a list of how much each brings in per month. I do not have another copy. I later find this document in my boss' desk with more notes added, totaling up how much each contract is worth. (It's my belief he's trying to figure out how much each person brings in, and I have a couple guesses as to why.) I should also mention he was given a version by this admin. with just his own contracts.

I willingly admit I just think this guy sucks, so that is clouding my judgment. He also was the only person adamantly against hiring me when I was an intern; he wanted someone older. Basically, am I in the wrong here for thinking this is kind of fucked up that he goes through my stuff and even takes things without my asking?

tl;dr - My boss goes through our stuff, and took one of my documents."

1mt3bv,10,2013-09-20,"/R/DUVAL Exclusive - Ten Questions with @Pkav3, Video Producer for Jaguars.com",spentrent,duval,https://www.reddit.com/r/duval/comments/1mt3bv/rduval_exclusive_ten_questions_with_pkav3_video/,"**Hey Patrick -- or as #JaguarsTwitter knows you, @Pkav3 -- thanks for making time for this interview.**  

**1) Tell us what you do for the Jaguars.**

I am the digital media videographer/producer for jaguars.com and Jaguars television. I shoot, edit and produce all the video on the web site and produce *Jaguars All Access* and *The Gus Bradley Show* for television.

**2) What did you do before you joined the team?**

I worked at the CBS/FOX affiliate in Jacksonville as a sports producer/videographer.  I started there as an intern while I attended Flagler College.  Before that, I graduated from Bishop Kenny.  DTWD.

**3) What does a typical weekday look like for you?**

Each day of the week during the regular season there is a specific routine. On Mondays, for example, my day starts at our television partner's (CBS47) studio with a conference call about content for *Jaguars All Access*. After the call I'll put in graphics for the show, request certain video and write. Once we get that all laid out, it's time to head to EverBank to cover the team. That includes meeting with JP, John and Lageman to talk about *Inside the Jaguars* for the day. I'll shoot a film room segment of that show after the meeting with Lageman. 

Next, we'll go to open locker room to gather sound bites from players and shoot Gus Bradley's Monday press conference. Once we are finished shooting *Inside the Jaguars*, I'll edit and post to jaguars.com. As soon as I'm finished with all the video content for the site, I'll head back to CBS47, for *Jaguars All Access*. During that show I'm in the production booth, timing the show and making sure Brent and Jeff know what is coming up next. Once the show is over, so is my Monday.

**4) How about a gameday?**

My gameday starts four hours before kickoff in the Jaguars locker room. The reason I have to be so early is to get the microphone for *Jags Wired* installed in the player's pads. Once that is all tested and working properly it's pretty much a waiting game. When the mic'd up player comes onto the field I'm shadowing him throughout warmups. 

Once game time comes, I'm responsible for shooting the mic'd up player as well as all the sound you see from behind the bench on *Jaguars All Access*. After the game, it's into the locker room to shoot Gus Bradley's speech to the team followed by shooting interviews with players. Once that is all wrapped up I shoot the *Postgame Report* with Lageman, Oehser and Boselli. From there (on a home game) it's back to the office to edit and post all the content to jaguars.com. 

**5) What do you do during the offseason?**

During the offseason I golf as much as possible. It's funny we get this question a lot from people who think jaguars.com goes dark in the offseason. Our goal is to keep fans coming back 12 months out of the year and not just in season.

There are offseason projects like the *Top Ten Plays*, *Rookie 101* and all our draft preview coverage. We also travel to the Senior Bowl and the NFL Combine to cover our GM and coaching staff at work. This offseason was particularly busy with a new coach, new GM, new logo and new uniform. It felt like we had news around the building every other day.

Also, once you roll OTAs, minicamps and free agency together there is plenty of stuff to cover throughout the offseason.

**6) Who is your favorite Jag of all time and why?**

Fred Taylor. Do I really need a reason?

**7) What is your favorite thing about working for the Jaguars and why?**

Free food all the time and lots of free clothes. The fact that we get to eat lunch at the stadium every day not only saves money but it also saves time. And the free clothes -- well the Nike NFL sideline apparel is just cool.

**8) You've traveled to a ton of NFL cities in your career.  What's your favorite city outside of Jax, and why?**

Nashville. It's always a fun crowd on Sunday, and Saturday night on Broadway in Nashville is tough to beat. 

**9) If you were stuck on a desert island and had to choose between John Oehser or JP Shadrick to join you, who would you pick, and why?  Please be extremely detailed in your response.**

This is a tough one because John brings a boyish optimistic outlook on life that is refreshing. But, JP has the certain musk of a man who could handle himself in any situation. I choose Shadrick.

**10) Where ya from?**

DUUUUUUUUUUUVALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL

**Thanks to Patrick Kavanagh aka @Pkav3 for making time to answer my questions.  He's also going to bring /u/pkav3 to life on reddit and is down to answer some questions you post here :).**

We'll also get some more of Pat's coworkers to join us for a similar interview/AMA in the future."
1mt32w,164,2013-09-20,My little story of IT glory,thespike323,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1mt32w/my_little_story_of_it_glory/,"Good afternoon TFTS. 

So, for the first six months of this year, I, a 3rd year CS student, was doing an internship at the helpdesk of an investment firm. Since this was a quantitative investment firm, they needed a large IT infrastructure, and had a large group of software developers working there as well. 

I was obviously the least experienced member of all the helpdesk staff, so while I would handle most of the tech support requests from the accounting, portfolio management, and compliance teams with relative ease, tickets from the software developers tended to be a little bit beyond my scope, and would get assigned to the more experienced members. 

One morning, however, I see a ticket from one of the devs requesting an extra hard drive (he needed local copies of databases for a lot of his code), and to adjust his partitions so that C: would take up one drive, while D: would take up the extra one. Now, I had never done this before, but when I found out how intuitive Windows Disk Management looked, I figured I could tackle this ticket. Assigned it to myself, grabbed an HD from our supply closet, and strode bravely towards the dev group. 

I arrived and told Dev Guy I was there to get him all set up with the new drive. He seemed surprised. Surely they would've sent one of the full-timers to help with this. But alas, there stood the intern, fresh drive in hand. 

He shuts down, I crack open his PC case, pop in the drive, boot up. All good so far. He logs in, I open up Disk Management. New drive shows up, no partitions on it. Sweet. First things first, let's get rid of the D: partition on his original drive. 

Uh oh. 

The option to delete the partition is grayed out. 

Crap. 

I start thinking I may have gotten in a little over my head, but I wasn't about to back down without a fight. And unfortunately for my opponents, I have a black belt in Google-fu. Scan the search results, and boom. My answer. You can't delete a partition with a pagefile. 

So I get into advanced system settings, and see pagefiles in both C: and D: partitions. Pop the one from D: over to C:, and there it is: I can delete the D: partition. 

Nuke D:, extend C:, create a new D: on drive B. Dev Guy pulls his backup of D: off the networked storage location, and everything is running smoothly. There I was, a degree-less intern standing triumphant over the corpse of ticket from someone vastly more experienced than I was. It's hard to put into words how I felt. Dev Guy thanks me. I welcome him. 

I still really wish something had blown up behind me as I walked back to my desk. "

So I don't go insane wondering,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1mt1mu/someone_tell_me_what_i_did_wrong_so_i_dont_go/,"I met this guy in july and we texted everyday since we met until recently. The way I met him wasn't the best. My friend met him on tindr and they hooked up and then he met me and stopped talking to her. I didn't really think anything would come of it. Well we hooked up (not sex) one night after we had both been out. After that he kept asking to hangout and to go to dinner. I never really could because I had work and his hotel was far, (he was in my hometown for an internship, but we go to the same college in a different state where he's from and lives). I finally agreed to go to a baseball game with him. When we got back to school he started texting me even more and asked to hang out. 

One night, I was drunk and asked him if he wanted and we went back to my house. I still hadn't told my friend we had been talking and she is my roommate. We woke up the next morning and he was normal and flirty. My roommate was on her way home and I didn't know what to do! He offered to jump out the window like it was something he does all the time. He seemed okay and asked to hangout again and was like well figure something out about how to tell your friend, and said he'd fix my window next time he came over.  I texted him once again like three days later when i was drunk (and after i had finally told my friend about him; she didn't care). I was literally wasted and once again we went back to my house. I fell asleep apparently shortly after we got back to my house. I woke up in the middle of the night and he was gone.

Ever since then he has barely texted me. We've hung out once more after all that but I was the one to ask and he replied ""I definitely am down to"", so i thought maybe he didn't hate me. This time I was actually sober. He came over and he helped me with homework and he spent the night and it was normal in the morning and he said we should hang out again. He knew I was going to go out of town that weekend, but it's been a week and I haven't heard from him. Do you think I ever will?"

A couple years back I accidentally met a guy through a site very similar to Reddit. We were commenting on the same topic, the comments got a little flirty, and it led to us exchanging contact information, and starting a very nice online friendship. That friendship grew into a ""crush"" - and it was nice, because I haven't had that feeling of a ""crush"" since High School, and it was mutual.  
  
The problem was that he lived in Canada, and I lived all the way down in South Florida. Being a broke, college student, I just couldn't afford to visit him.  
  
I got really involved in my school work, internships, and jobs, that we sort of drifted.  
  
Fast forward a couple years to this week, and something randomly reminded me of him. I realized that I now graduated, live in LA, have money [for a change], so why not reconnect.  
  
After writing and deleting my message for two days, I finally pressed sent - and I got a slap in the face as a reply.  
  
He met someone, and they were in love. And he mentioned that I don't contact him again, because he doesn't want his partner to think that he's cheating.  
  
Kudos to him for respecting his partner [I really do respect that], but I felt like a piece of turd that someone just stepped on. My intention would had never been to break them up or anything of the sort.  
  
So... I wanted to know if anyone has any similar stories of meeting their partners through gaming, online, or through other ""nerdy"" outlets. Let me live vicariously through you. :) Maybe one day I'll live that magic again. "
1mszi3,1,2013-09-20,22F feels like she never should have met 21M.,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1mszi3/22f_feels_like_she_never_should_have_met_21m/,"My boyfriend and I have known each other for over 7 years. We have been together for 3.5. We used to be super close and called each other best friends. When we got together it felt like it was truly meant to be- especially if you know our weird background story. But now I feel like we should have never met. 

I have centered too much of my life around him. He's not going anywhere, either. He's living with his parents, has never had a job, and spends every cent he gets from his allowance on weed. I mean, I won't judge him for living with his parents but he has 0 work ethic and just sits around smoking weed. I don't like him spending his father's hard earned money on it when he lies to him and says it's for snacks. I go to school full time and have been working internships lately, and he laughs at how ""easy"" they are although he has never done any long term himself.

Marijuana abuse has already ruined a past relationship for me. And I feel like it's happening again. He will ""stay the weekend"" with me and instead go next door to his friend and dealer's house and stay there until 4am smoking because I banned it in my apartment. I couldn't take it anymore. I felt like he and his friend were taking advantage of me having my own apartment and were being rude about it. They would be loud, eat all of my food and leave everything a mess after they would leave at the end of the weekend. I feel like he chooses weed over everything else.

After I recently came back to my apartment from a 6 week long internship abroad, we weren't even alone for an hour before he invited people over to sell them weed and he spent time with them instead. While I was still gone, he was texting this girl he has known for as long as me about how he missed her although he barely talked to me at all the entire time I was gone. Always a ""going to play a round of LoL"" instead of ""I miss you"". He never says anything positive towards me. I receive no compliments. I receive nothing but 100% neutral speech although I flood him with compliments.

We barely communicate anymore. If we do, it's only because of my own efforts reaching out to him. By the time we talk again, I am always upset because of the lack of affection and start ""nagging"", in his own words. He pushes every issue away now, saying, ""this conversation is making me angry. Stop talking about it or I'll get pissed off"" and then goes back to ignoring me.

I can't take it anymore. I used to be such a happy person. WE used to be so happy. Together. I feel like his depression and his marijuana use has destroyed everything we had. Don't get me wrong, I love him. If I didn't, I wouldn't have been able to hold out this long. 

But after an issue of him talking to the same girl again back in March and messaging her ""get your cute butt over here"" (I felt like he was flirting with her judging by the content of the other messages too) I tried to leave him. 

I don't even remember what happened. But the next day his parents drove him back to my apartment to ""stay the weekend"". He had cut himself all over his arm. I felt fucking HORRIBLE. And the next time I almost left him again, he said ""I cut myself for you. I wouldn't do it if I didn't love you"". It left me speechless. I don't understand him anymore.

I have shortened our entire story. It's so freaking long and probably just as naive as many of the other stories posted on here. The obvious answer is always going to be ""just break up with them"". Part of me has been screaming ""what the fuck are you doing still in this relationship"" and the other part tells me ""but you love him and that one little hug you get sometimes makes everything better"". 

I moved to the city closest to him and started attending university there. I feel like with me living 20 minutes away and hardly seeing him, I am not good enough for him to go a little out of his way to see. I have begged him a billion times to please change some things and let's work on this relationship. Even for him to get professional help for his depression. He will agree and then the next day, everything reverts back exactly to how it was before.

What do I do? How can I leave someone I have subconscously formed so much of my life around? I regret meeting him. I feel like he's destroyed the happy person I used to be. Part of me believes he knows exactly what he's doing. And then the other part of me believes he's kind of dense and oblivious to how his actions affect others and maybe he doesn't do it on purpose. 

I thought we would have been living together by now, after 3.5 years together. I live so close to his house and even closer to his school than his parents. But he isn't ready to live with me and I feel like it would honestly be a disaster if he did. I used to be able to see a future with him that I haven't for a long time now.

If I leave him, I'm going to be in pain for a long time. He's been such a huge part of my life for many years. I even started studying his language when I was younger and now I am living in his country. It's become a part of me and my identity. It all reminds me of him. This is exactly why I regret meeting him.

But if I stay with him, I think I'll continue to be taken for granted and practically ignored. I've tried so hard to be there for him through all of his issues. I don't understand why he started acting this way. I begged him to start antidepressants about a year ago and it's been a nightmare of a roller coaster since. Our online conversations consist of him telling me ""going to play a round of LoL"" and then I don't hear from him again or in person, where he tells me ""I'm going next door to dealer's for a bit"" and then he comes back way after I'm asleep. 

Where do I go from here? I'm feeling pretty hopeless. And I know I really am. I am seeking possible solutions/advice from outside sources. Some for staying together, and others for leaving him. I feel like I am only asking for advice on how to stay together because deep down, I really can't leave him. I have been considering going to a therapist. Please give me advice, thoughts or opinions and then I will start looking up practice numbers on Google. 

Thanks for reading."

My school is recruited by all the big 4, and national/regional firms with a Chicago office. I have been working 30-35 hours a week as a staff accountant at a very small (15 person) CPA firm, doing tax prep work, and have a tax internship from a 60 person local firm as well. Additionally I have the EA designation. I plan on being CPA eligible November 2014, and will take the test shortly thereafter. 

I am participating in recruiting season this year, as I want to move to a larger firm with a better, more dedicated, tax department. I just received an offer from a ~250 person firm who is rapidly growing, who seem very happy to have me. I would be a full time staff, very competitive offer and benefits, while I finish my MST, which I was very happy to hear.

My question is, would taking this position affect the likelihood of me securing a Big 4 staff position for Jan 2015, or would it affect my desirability if i participated in next year's recruiting? Would I be better suited trying to obtain a Big 4 internship for Winter/Summer 2014 and hoping for a full time offer? My intention is to stay in public accounting for the long term. My undergrad was from a non-target school, and I do not have a GPA at my grad school yet, and no real organizational involvement since this is my second week of class, but I intend on joining BAP when eligible. I did go to Meet the Firms, and there are upcoming office visits and events to attend to network with Big 4. 

On the same note I guess I am looking for insight as to whether or not for a tax professional that intends on staying in Public Accounting that I need to be at Big 4 over a growing local firm. I understand the basic differences, work/life balance, prestige issues, resources within the firm. One of the main things I find myself struggling with is giving up the possibility of specialization, which I have heard both pro's and con's to. 

Any insight would be appreciated.

My mcat/gpa are roughly those of an average matriculant. I started applying to software development internships recently as a backup plan, with the plan of working an intership through the summer then leaving if I am accepted to medical school. Things have taken a strange turn, and the companies have instead invited me to interview for full-time positions which start after this school year. I accepted the invitations to interview for the Full-time positions, because it's difficult to turn things like that down. 

I'm conflicted on whether or not my actions are ethical. If a company offers me a full-time position (which starts next year) before I have heard back from any medical schools, I am likely to accept it. But it seems wrong to accept a job knowing that I would instantly leave if offered a medical school acceptance. On the other hand, I am an reapplicant and I have to realistically prepare for the possibility of another full round of rejections.

I'm 19, studying for a BSE in Computer Science. English is my native language, and I'm learning more French every day--I read/write/speak/understand at about a C1 level right now. I have a clean record, and alternative destinations...potentially.

I'm from Michigan, but I'm living in France right now as a study abroad student for one year. All my classes are in French; no real problems on that front actually. As I'm only in my 2nd year in my program, I don't know too well the theory side of my CS degree, but I've experience from a summer internship and years of personal projects in a variety of languages--embedded C++, C++ on the desktop, PHP and Ruby on the web side.

I know the situation with France and foreigners looking for employment--it ain't pretty. So, realistically, what are my options? Is this the last time I'll be in France for any long time? I've done a bit of research into gaining EU nationality (and most people around here seem to recommend Germany). But there's so much, and I would prefer to do so in a Francophone country. Is Belgium (Wallonie or Bruxelles) a possibility then?

Education in Europe: Master's degrees are standard. France also reduces the residency requirement for students having studied in an institution of higher education to 2 years--but even if I were to study fora master's in France, I worry getting another 2 years of employment (and the visa for it) would be near impossible.

Okay. I think that's everything--I've rewritten and rewritten and still have nothing but ramble. But I appreciate any help you guys can offer, even if that just means a ""good luck!"" :)"

Just one example of someone who has suffered from Mars Hill teachings is Mary Lambert, singer on Macklemore's ""Same Love"":

Singer-songwriter Mary Lambert formerly attended Mars Hill, but going to a church that teaches that being gay is a sin caused her to cry after church. The line ""I'm not crying on Sundays"" from Lambert and Macklemore's hit song Same Love is her response to the teachings of the church. [41]

[More examples of Mars Hill abuse](http://www.thefalcononline.com/article.php?id=8016)

**Majority owner of Storyville is Jon Phelps.**

Jon Phelps is an investor and consultant to the business. 

Jon Phelps is the founder of Full Sail University in Winter Park, FL.

He's co-credited with Mark Driscoll for Reverse-Engineering Your Life, copyright 2005 - a sort of self-help guide that is used to organize your life around teachings of Mark Driscoll. 

He is also referenced in Real Marriage by Mark Driscoll, a series that [has been critisized](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/01/13/mark-driscoll-s-sex-manual-real-marriage-scandalizes-evangelicals.html) for being offensive to women and it's treatment of homosexuality, including a chapter titled ""The Repectful Wife"". He is also referenced in Mark Driscoll's book, ""Confessions of a Reformassion Rev"".

Full Sail University also has ties to Mitt Romney:
From [Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Sail_University):
Full Sail drew national attention when 2012 presidential candidate Mitt Romney cited it as an example of the way rising costs of education can be solved. Romney did not mention that its chief executive, Bill Heavener, is a major campaign donor and fund-raiser.[30]

[Crooks and Liars article about Full Sail ties to Mitt Romney](http://crooksandliars.com/susie-madrak/why-mittens-loves-full-sail-universit)

Jon Phelps is a friend of Mark Driscoll, an investor, and someone who seems to some roots at Mars Hill.

**Jamie Munson will be involved in day to day operations, leadership, sales, management and community engagement at Storyville Coffee.**

Jamie Munson has had the highest level of involvement of leadership in Mars Hill. 

A short bio: ""Jamie Munson is a long-time pastor and board member at Mars Hill Church and author of Money: God or Gift and Authority: The Leader's Call to Serve. Born and raised in the state of Montana, Pastor Jamie came to Mars Hill as a 19-year-old non-Christian, not long after the church began. He met Jesus, got baptized, and after a stint in the corporate world, became the first Mars Hill intern in June 1999.""

Munson was appointed Lead Pastor of Mars Hill Church in the by-laws Jamie Munson drafted in 2007.  When two pastors disagreed with the by-laws Munson formulated charges against them. One of the charges was a lack of trust or respect for Munson himself.  Munson stated Scott Thomas was in charge of the investigation and Scott Thomas stated the investigation process was not a witch hunt and informed a member that ""a conciliatory process"" had been completed.

From Wiki: As a result of the large growth of the church, their bylaws, which outline how the church is organised, have been rewritten on a few occasions. The outcome of this process in November 2007 led to changes in leadership organization. The new bylaws installed Lead pastor Jamie Munson and preaching pastor Mark Driscoll and pastors Scott Thomas and Tim Beltz as ""executive pastors"" who led the objectives of the church ""under the authority of the Board of Directors"" on which the executive pastors also serve as directors. The change precipitated the firing of two pastors.

""Mars Hill leaders said in forum postings that one fired pastor was removed, in part, for ""displaying an unhealthy distrust in the senior leadership."" They said the other was removed for ""disregarding the accepted elder protocol for the bylaw deliberation period"" and ""verbally attacking the lead pastor"" — charges the fired pastor denied, the leaders added.""[19]

**Kris Rosentrater is a coffee specialist and is involved in roasting and production.**

Rosentrater has ties to Mars Hill through their music programs and has worked with several ""fiery"" Christian acts. A description of one, [""Spy Glass Blue""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spy_Glass_Blue):

Spy Glass Blue, a post-punk / New Wave / Brit Pop band formed by Allan Aguirre of Scaterd Few, is credited for legitimizing and authenticating the post-punk genre in Christian alternative music (ACM)[dubious – discuss] much in the same way that Scaterd Few defined punk rock in Contemporary Christian music (CCM).[1] In the words of the Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music, Spy Glass Blue is a ""rare example of Christian goth music.""[2] As Allan's solo effort, shows Allan's artier (""mellower, artistic"")[2][3] side where Scaterd Few showed his edgier side. Aguirre likens the bands presence to the restructuring of other Christian Alternative bands: Mortal to Fold Zandura or the Crucified to Stavesacre.[3]

After the housing crash of 2008 occurred, the jobs problem began. Why the housing boom occurred? Easy credit. Easy credit from banks from subprime loans because they knew they can profit from these loans as soon as the teaser rate expires and turns into a large interest rate. With easy credit from banks, businesses used them to fund their companies and the salaries of workers and their owners. Once the easy credit dried up, that when the problems began.

Usually, when the Great Recession of 2008 (or Artifical Great Depression of 2008) began, they tend to cut jobs and people have to make do with less. But in this year they figured out that it was more profitable to hire people who are willing to pay for no money (unpaid internships) or hire no people at all. If you combined that with an excess population who have BA and MAs in various degrees, and the need for constant rising profit margins in publicly owned corporations for executives and share owners and you have the situation that for every one job opening you have 650 people applying for a job. Not only college graduates but people who have been laid off or downsized in order to cut costs or gain more profit.

Then to make the job search more of a farce, they put in many hoops you have to jump through. Some of them include: Automatic Job resume scanners that reject your resume if you do not have enough buzzwords, Human Resource members that don’t call back, fake job postings just to collect resumes, multiple interviews,automatic rejection if you have no experience/not enough experience/not the right experience ,mandatory personality tests. Even if you do make it you will get punched in the face by three reasons: Internal candidates, Referrals by other employees (read: Connections via networking), people who look hot and have breasts (read: Females). This has turned into a job market into a job lottery. A lottery that if you don’t win before you’re homeless, you are screwed to lifetime unemployment! (How good is staying positive if you’re going to be homeless?!)

Besides, every human has a limit of bullshit they can take before offing themselves. And they need real help, as underfunded suicide hotlines, therapist that are wait-listed for months and meds won’t help if the root of the problem is the living environment.

Despite the growth in jobs boasted by your politicians: Most of the growth come from food and retail industries. They put you to work in 30 hour weeks, and those those weeks are flexible at the employers end making it impossible to get a second job. If you have a resume that has a B.A., you will be automatically rejected! Even if you do get in, they prefer people who speak Spanish. Which explains the the fact that these days, they tend to employ people who speak Spanish and english. They also offer no benefits or health care because companies are too cheap to offer health care despite record profits because they know Obamacare will be in force by October 1st and it’s expanded medicaid provision will pick up the slack.




To the employees who lost his or her jobs, you will going to hear what I call the “Jobs market Chorus”: Be an entrepreneur and start your business! Network! Temping! Go get new skills! Freelance! Flip some patties! Go to North Dakota in the oil fields! Drive a truck! Join the Military (read: Join the army and die)! Go move where the jobs are! Go teach English at Japan/China/Taiwan/Korea! I promise you that you will hear at least one of these knee-jerk advice in a week in your miserable job market.

The problem is that these type of advice are (for too many people) worthless. Some job hunters have authoritarian parents who want their college graduates to get a actual job. Some job hunters are homeless. Some job hunters have family obligations, or have medical condition (physical, developmental, or mental.) Also, some job seekers have little income or none! Another great reason: EVERYONE ELSE HAS THE SAME IDEA!

Another thing job hunters will hear is the feel-good message which consists of variations of two parts: “Oh don’t worry you’ll find one” and “Stay Positive”. This is before the following if you’re actually trying to network: “I can’t help you!” or “I don’t know anyone.”  Do you know which people say these things? People who are lucky to held their jobs this long or people who are employment advisors but are too lazy to actually help.

So for Congress the real job creation solution is similar to health care: Disappear Quickly! Either by suicide, jail by resorting to crime due to unemployment, or homeless. Because Congress is proudly too politically lazy to actually fix the problem.

This is just a suggestion (please don't crucify me, Reddit) but maybe we can make a new subreddit where we take all our engineering internship questions there (or a new title bracket system) that way we can accomplish a few things, such as:

1. Ask general questions and get them answered by all those lucky engineers with internships already.
2. Interns who got hired can write down where they went to and what kind of stats they had when getting in (GPA, Activities, what they thought solidified them getting hired)
3. Possible networking.

Just a possibility. If this subreddit exists, then sorry for wasting time, but I thought it would help a lot of us. Thanks guys!

Edit: So I read the comments, seems like many people want to stick to this small subreddit. Maybe one of the mods can make a bracket system officially happening. If that doesn't work, we can always go ahead and make that new subreddit. My only concern is this actually happening and not dying. Let's try to make this happen guys! I'll send an email in the morning to one of the mods, promise.

1mshpy,12,2013-09-20,Got my MLS and a part-time job two years ago; not sure what to do now.,MercuryChaos,Libraries,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libraries/comments/1mshpy/got_my_mls_and_a_parttime_job_two_years_ago_not/,"[apologies in advance for the wall of text]

I got my MLS (with a concentration in cataloging) in 2011, and very soon after graduating I got a part-time job cataloging in the Special Collections department at a nearby college. For the first year or so I just worked that one job and used my days off to look for full-time positions. This year I got a second part-time job at a grocery store because I needed the money and I usually work 45 hours a week. I’m not sure what I should be doing next as far as finding a full-time job, and there are a few problems that I keep running into.

1. It’s been really difficult for me to find positions that I’m qualified for. As I said, my MLS was focused on cataloging because that’s what I wanted to do, but most cataloger jobs that I’ve been finding either require much more experience than I have, or they’re part-time paraprofessional positions that pay less than what I make now. I’d be willing to do something besides cataloging (I actually enjoy my job at the grocery store and think I’d be pretty good in a public service position) but because my degree concentration (and related internships, etc.) were focused on cataloging, I don’t have a whole lot of experience in those areas.

2. I’m concerned that the experience and knowledge I *do* have from my MLS is getting rusty, and I’m not sure what I should be doing as far as continuing education goes.This year I got a one-day pass to go to my state’s library association conference - even with my membership discount it put a pretty huge dent in my budget, and the ALA conferences are even more expensive. Besides the cost, my grocery store job requires me to work evenings and weekends, and the store policy requires two weeks advance notice to get (unpaid) time off, which I’m not guaranteed to actually get… it makes planning anything really difficult.

3. I recently applied for a full-time professional cataloger position at the school where I work now, and I made it to the final round of interviews, but in the end they went with the other applicant because I didn’t have as much experience. This isn’t a problem in the way that the previous two things are, just something I’m kind of bummed out about right now. Like, if I can’t get a job at a library where the cataloging department already knows me and likes me, what chance do I have anywhere else? And I can’t help but wonder at what point I should start looking for jobs in another field, and where I would even begin to look if that’s something I decide to do.


**tl;dr**

1. How do I find a job that I’m actually qualified for (or become qualified for a job that I want) when most of my knowledge is related to cataloging?

2. Where can I find library-specific continuing education/networking resources that are inexpensive or free?

3. What should I do if this whole librarian thing doesn’t pan out?"

I am an alcoholic. I've been clean for a while. Not that my parents ever got their head out of their own ass to notice I was drinking in the first place.

I used to go to school for engineering. But drinking was more important at the time and so I moved home and switched to a liberal artsy major. 

I'm on my 5th and final year of college. 
This semester I an taking ""12"" hours. 3 of which is a 40hour a week internship. I hate it. 

If I do two of these internships, one this semester and one my final semester I graduate with a certificate. 

Well I have zero desire to ever practice that job. 

I dropped the ""class."" I'm going to study for the GRE this semester and finish my math minor next semester.

I'm going to try and go to grad school for engineering, which I had quit as a junior.

I told my mom I was doing it and she was surprisingly supportive.

Then my dad found out and shit hit the fan.

Now my parents are livid.  I've gotten so many phone calls about how I'm a quitter and I'll no longer have any purpose in my life. How I'm not smart enough to do it. Etc.....

I think they are just really mad I did it without asking.  

Like how dare I change something without asking. 

I was always planning on going to grad school though. So I never needed that certificate. But I need to get it for the ""sake of finishing something""

Fuxk. They are my loans I can go to school for what I want."

1msf5w,24,2013-09-20,Wandering Through the Desert,ACryintheDark,lostgeneration,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostgeneration/comments/1msf5w/wandering_through_the_desert/,"September 20th is an inauspicious anniversary that I am tired of “celebrating.” It’s a mark of my failure to become the professional that society, my family, and I expected of myself. The date is the three-year anniversary since my first job application. I was just starting my third year (a.k.a. 3L) at New York University Law School. I knew the job process would be harder for me because of my focus on international law and human rights, but in 2008, I wasn’t worried. Never did I imagine that three years later I would be living back home with my mom without a job in sight.

I still remember the day in Contracts in 1L year when half the class couldn't focus on the lesson as they were to busy refreshing the news of the Dow Jones’s record freefall; nothing changing with each refresh except the level of the drop. Everyone knew this was bad and would impact employment; no one knew how bad.

It was the end of that summer in 2009 when people first discovered how bad things were getting. With a number of firms in a tailspin, others already gone, and the rest trying desperately to stop the hemorrhaging, the Early Interview Week recruitment for the 2011 class was one of the worst ever.

With so few firm hires, the job scramble begun in earnest. The lucky ones got jobs in financial institutions that were just starting their massive recovery. Others tried to get hired outside of Early Interview Week or began to court non-Vault 100 firms (think US News &amp; World Report’s yearly school rankings but for a richer and more pretentious industry). Others started competing for public interest jobs, wrongly thinking the public interest sector downturn would be any less vicious.

NYU Law’s Public Interest Law Center (PILC) has a post-graduation “launch grant” that is commonly known as PILC welfare. PILC welfare went from a program that was unheard of by most of the pre-crash graduating class—because everyone gets jobs out of NYU Law—to covering a little more than 10% of both the 2011 and 2012 classes nine months after graduation.  This originally three-month program (extendable to six months upon request) was expanded to a full 12 months for the class of 2011, no questions asked.

Regardless of the “launch grant,” graduates weren’t able to stabilize themselves after a year and often took whatever job they could get. One 2011 grad had a funded fellowship doing reproductive rights work for a year that she loved but took a job working for a county on the other side of the country after the fellowship ended. Another used his PILC welfare doing legal aid work before signing a two-year contract doing work he’s not happy about in a city he loathes. Still another, after a year of clerking for a federal court, is an unpaid intern doing really interesting work he loves. The choice is often between taking an unwanted public interest job or taking a risk and pursuing what you want to do.

I took the latter route, jumping from fellowship to fellowship to fellowship. I can't say that I haven't been able to get some phenomenal experiences, but it hurts to think that the 2L summer fellowship stipend, that I received over three years ago, has been my highest “salary.” I've represented CIA torture victims in an international lawsuit, drafted legal memos for the revolutionary government of Libya, and increased the capacity of a post-soviet human rights ombudsman. Outside of work, I started a fairly well read niche blog, published multiple op-eds, founded a non-governmental organization, and networked more than I could imagine.

For all that work, I have little to show for it vis-à-vis employment. I've impressed countless people with my professionalism, ability to learn new skills, commitment to working hard, and overall capabilities. My last interview with a USAID project went extremely well, especially as I was willing to work for a local salary (less than $1500/month). They fast tracked my hiring process, potentially worried someone else would snap me up. Then after three interviews and having filled out their hiring forms, they tell me that they won’t hire me, but they did offer me a part-time internship. This change was so sudden and unexpected that the original draft of this article was about finally landing a permanent job after a long struggle and how I would finally get to do all the backlogged things I’ve been putting off until I had a job and was a little more “settled.”

I've gone back to NYU Law’s Public Interest Law Center multiple times since graduation. I keep hoping that each time they'll tell me something new, some nugget of useful knowledge relevant to graduates. Instead I'm told to not customize my resume per job because I might introduce errors and to triple-check my cover letters to make sure I don't have any typos. I get the feeling that I'm not welcome; I'm evidence that their cookie-cutter advice of networking, staying flexibly, and proofreading your documents for typos isn't sufficient to get a job in this market.

Let me emphasize that while insecure income sucks, except for my student loans, my financial situation is not nearly as affected by the lack of job as my psychological state. I was able to live cheaply and save money during law school and while working under PILC welfare. I accomplished this by tracking every quarter I spent and ensuring I lived within my budget. My six digits of student loans will be covered by NYU Law’s Loan Repayment Program, as soon as I find a public interest job. Unemployed law graduates are not comparable to people living in poverty. The point of this article isn’t to say that my life is hard but to express the almost unfathomable failure it feels to be a 29 year-old lawyer that has had to move back into my childhood room at my mom’s house. Unemployed, living at home, and depressed, imagine how my dating life has been.

The interpersonal costs caused by the insecurity are a double blow: they’re painful and they stopped me from forming the personal bonds that help one persevere. My required geographical flexibility (yet another PILC recommendation) made me end my two-year relationship with my law school girlfriend after months of being 3,000 miles apart. I hurt another girl when I told her that I could promise her nothing since I had no idea where I might have to move for a job. Since then, I have consigned myself to only casual dating and only forming relationships I would be willing to break. When I graduated in 2011, I didn’t know where I’d be six months ahead. That number decreased to three months as of May 2012 and is now down to two months.

The very worst part is the crying. I'm not the most emotional guy; I've never cried from a movie and only very rarely from a book. Making those times when I spontaneously and uncontrollably start crying especially hard to handle. I force myself to stay busy working. It's when I'm alone and able to look at where my life is compared to where I thought it would be that I completely lose my composure. This has caused some *really* awkward flights for those sitting next to me (Sorry!). Writing this has brought me to tears twice now. And, while it’s good to let these feelings out, it’s not the best to do so on a crowded post-soviet bus. There is no doubt in my mind that I would benefit from therapy, but until I have health insurance, I'll just have to add it to the list of things I'll do once I have a job.

I want a job that is the beginning of a career. The idea of going to the same office day in, day out, year in, year out sounds like an unobtainable dream. I want to get on with my life. I want to write a well-researched journal article, not another well-researched cover letter. I want to teach myself how to play an instrument, not international aid best practices, in the hope that the latter will get me a job. Most importantly, I want to invest in my surroundings, including friends, relationships, and professional contacts, knowing I’ll be able to reap the rewards for years to come.

I don't know what lessons can be learned from this. I write this as a release—as a scream in the darkness—for me and for those in my situation. The only advice I’ve found useful is Churchill’s “if you’re going through hell, keep going.” Here I am, two and a half years after graduation and I am applying for the exact same jobs and fellowships as 3Ls. Wish me luck."

I was born in Australia but haven't lived there since I was 7 years old, my family live in Africa and I need a visa every time I visit them. As I'm about to graduate, my school has suggested that I apply for OPT immediately which would allow me to stay in the U.S for 12 months granted that I can get a job within 90 days of OPT status. This is where my problems begin... I work in the entertainment industry, it's incredibly difficult to be hired as anything but an intern which is fine as OPT but is it worth it? What would be the point of living in the U.S for 12 months without compensation? Experience? I have plenty of experience working in several different fields of the entertainment industry, I want an actual paying job! Do employers really want to take the time to hire an international when they could hire an American and avoid paperwork? Is it realistic for me to think that someone might actually be willing to do that? Also I am very interested in working in theatre, but as it's not Film or Television, would that be possible? It's not a huge jump from Film and TV to Theatre, but would immigration officials see it that way?

I just feel like I have so few options... I've thought about moving to England but it's the same sort of thing that I would be dealing with here in the U.S. And I've also thought about returning to Australia where I can work legally, but I don't know anyone there. I've got no job leads there and it's very far from my family.

1msea4,1,2013-09-20,Advice for HireVue recorded interviews,[deleted],engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/1msea4/advice_for_hirevue_recorded_interviews/,"I'm a new ME graduate and after about a solid month of no luck in my job search I was contacted this week about couple promising jobs, one being an internship in power engineering. I was surprised to hear that instead of conduction an on-site interview (I live maybe 15 minutes from the building), or even a Skype interview, I was going to have a HireVue recorded interview. For anyone unfamiliar, this consists of several questions for each of which you have 30 seconds to prepare and about 3 minutes to answer.

I started on some of the practice questions and just completely froze up like a kindergartener in a school play. It is so strange and jarring to try to talk about yourself to a mostly blank screen with vague practice questions. What's odd is I had an introductory interview just yesterday that went really well; I was talking to the president of a small company and could actually have a conversation with the guy because he could describe what the job actually was beyond the HR tailored bullshit on the company website. I could actually tell him about my experience and how it lined up with the job because we had a real dialog.

I guess I have until Monday to do the actual interview, does anybody have experience with HireVue and have a strategy for not feeling so ridiculous? I'm treating it like a real interview; wear a suit and prepare answers for basic questions."

I had a QA internship this summer and that experience has made me feel *kinda* certain I would MUCH rather go into data analysis/Excel/SQL/whatever than any kind of coding/developing/programming.  But was I just disappointed by that one experience and I'd have loved the job under different circumstances?  I wish I knew.

Anyway.  The class I am stuck taking for this fall, the last one to complete my minor, is a programming languages theory class.  This is the best option I have of the fall classes - it's bleak.  I am not at all interested in this topic.  We're in week 3 and it already has gotten way too theoretical for my taste; I was never interested in theory, only application (this is also true for statistics - I fucking *hate* the pure math classes and love me some SAS).  

I feel like I am contemplating dropping this class just because it's boring and kind of hard and I'm lazy, not because I can't do it.  I would be disappointed in myself for quitting so close to finishing.  But I also have part-time jobs and five other classes and I would rather put effort toward my major classes than toward this one.  How important would that one line on a resume be?

Kind of a weird situation,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1mrj9w/this_has_been_really_bothering_me_so_what_do_yall/,"I met this guy in july and we texted everyday since we met until recently. The way I met him wasn't the best. My friend met him on tindr and they hooked up and then he met me and stopped talking to her. He added me on fb and told me to text him, I didn't because I didn't want to hurt my friend's feelings. He kept messaging me and then asked for my number. I gave it to him, mainly because I can't say no to people, and he started texting me everyday. I didn't really think anything would come of it or even knew if I liked him. Well we hooked up (not sex) one night after we had both been out. After that he kept asking to hangout. I never really could because I had work and his hotel was far, (he was in my hometown for an internship, but we go to the same college in a different state where he's from and lives) and I still felt weird about going behind my friend's back. I finally agreed to go to a baseball game with him. He also asked me to dinner, but somehow I got out of that one. When we got back to school he started texting me even more and asked to hang out. I told him I was about to go to sleep so we didn't. 

Weeeeelll two days later, I was drunk and asked him if he wanted to hang out. He said yes and came and got me from the bar and we went to my house. I still hadn't told my friend about him and she is my roommate. We woke up the next morning and he was normal and flirty. Then my roommate tells me that my roommate that used to talk to him was coming home. I didn't know what to do! He offered to jump out the window like it was something he does all the time. He seemed okay and asked to hangout again and was like well figure something out about how to tell your friend, and said he'd fix my window next time he came over. He texted me at 12 that night but i was asleep so i texted him in the morning and then he took 10 hours to respond. He didn't text me the next day. I texted him once again when i was drunk (and after i had finally told my friend about him, luckily she didn't care) and asked to hang out. I was literally wasted. He said yes to hanging out, though. I fell asleep apparently shortly after we got back to my house. I woke up in the middle of the night and he was gone. 

Ever since then he has barely texted me. We've hung out once more after all that but I was the one to ask and he replied ""I definitely am down to"", so i thought maybe he didn't hate me. I thought I should ask him to hangout when I was sober, so I did. He came over and he helped me with homework and we also hooked up. He spent the night and it was normal in the morning and he said we should hang out again. He knew I was going to go out of town that weekend, but it's been a week and I haven't heard from him. 

Like what the hell? Was it because i was so drunk that one time, even so, is that enough to make someone completely stop talking to you? To be fair college has started again for both of us and he is trying to graduate on time, (he's a second year senior) but i don't want to make that an excuse. I really don't get it, though. Do you think I'll ever hear from him again? Or is this karma for thinking he wouldn't do the same thing to me as he did my friend."

After the concert, we'll go to IHOP and not order anything. Instead, we'll sit in the back of the place and talk and talk about random shit and probably laugh a little too much at nothing. 

You'll drop me off and head home. It'll probably be 4 in the morning, but I'll lazily walk back to my dorm and crawl into bed. I won't think about homework. I won't think about work. I won't think about jobs or internships after I graduate. I won't think. 

But right now, in this moment, I'm feeling it. I'm feeling the happiness come back to me. Well, maybe it's not happiness, but it's something other than nothing. I'm looking *forward* to the next day. I'm looking forward. 

It's happening. Like everyone told me it would. ""You'll move on,"" ""Things will get easier,"" and ""You'll eventually come around.""

I don't really know what this means.

I'm a finance/economics double major (with first class honours, unless something goes horribly wrong..) and gave my CV and cover letter into a government department which organised generic 'corporate finance internships', and I've had a phone interview in which they explained that within the department they have the audit branch and finance branch, which I'll be interviewed and placed into one of them if the interview goes well.

I thought that audit was for accountants, but on the phone the person said 'ok so you don't have an accounting major.. so that leaves you with audit and finance branches'. I have taken a few accounting papers, and obviously know my way around a companies financial statements, but I don't know what is required to work in an audit branch.

The finance department I'm guessing has something to do with forecasting cash flows and... I'm not really sure.

1mrbc0,11,2013-09-20,Tips on clearing negative energy? Low point in life/suicidal thoughts coincided with a move(story inside),[deleted],Paranormal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1mrbc0/tips_on_clearing_negative_energy_low_point_in/,"This happened in the winter/spring of 2010/2011. I moved to St. Louis for an internship. Found a room to rent off craigslist. It was the top bedroom of a three story row house. I imagine the building was pretty old, this was in Soulard in St. Louis and those houses all had to be at least 50 if not 70-100 years old. 

I'll just list the things that happened there chronologically:

* Before I moved there I had started a new relationship with literally the girl of my dreams. She was PERFECT. Perfect everything, the relationship was awesome.

* Move there, I feel lonely and isolated, but that's pretty normal because: 1) it's winter, and 2) I just moved to a new place away from all my social support.

* My car breaks down the first week I'm there. Never had car problems in my life before.

* Start my new job, initially very excited about it.

* Two weeks in - still feel lonely and isolated. Start playing WoW because I don't have anything else to do with my free time.

* Girlfriend seems to be getting more and more distant. I feel increasingly lonely. Probably getting clingy. She breaks it off about a month into living at the house.

* I get super depressed. Again I think it's normal because I'm in a new place, I'm stressed from work, and my girlfriend just dumped me.

* Work sucks. I hate it. I am isolated from everyone there. Make no friends. I just sit doing taxes all day. 

* I struggle to get out of bed every day. 

* Car breaks down AGAIN.

* About 2 months in I start actively fantasizing about blowing my brains out(I own firearms and have some at the house with me). To the point of putting loaded weapons up to my head and putting my finger on the trigger. But I don't think I was ever **that** close to pulling the trigger, still, something's not right when you're taking loaded guns to your head.

* House is extremely cold all the time, I feel just absolutely isolated there. 

* **One day I am laying in bed trying to rest when I experience sleep paralysis.** I've experienced sleep paralysis many times before so it doesn't really bother me. I just go with it and start trying to wiggle my little finger so I can wake up. Then I see my bedroom door slowly opening toward me. At the point I intuit that there is something very evil on the other side of that door(getting goose bumps now writing this). I'm laying there paralyzed. I see my door swing fully open to me and I see this black mass hanging in the air in my doorway. And it looked like the girl from the grudge. My only explanation for this is that my body sensed some sort of negative energy and it just pulled the closest construct my brain had for something really terrifying and evil and pulled the image of the girl from the grudge out(I'm terrified of that movie). I try to scream but am paralyzed and nothing comes out. At this point I lose consciousness. I wake up half an hour later and initially didn't even remember the sleep paralysis episode until something jogged my memory and all of it flooded back. The odd thing is it didn't cause me much fear at the time, but looking back on it now I wonder if all of my problems that winter/spring were because of a negative energy in that place.

* I moved out during the Summer, had an awesome summer, and completely pulled out of my depression. 

So... anyone else experienced something similar where it seems like a LOCATION was the cause of low energy/depression/suicidal thoughts? The reason I ask is because I seem to be experiencing some of the symptoms again albeit not as intense as last time(moved in to a new place with new roommates in August). 

My intuition tells me it might not be the location this time but one of my roommates. He's had some pretty bad PTSD and trauma in his life(bad childhood, was in initial invasion of Iraq in '03 and has bad PTSD from that). His energy is all over the place. Classic manic symptoms. So I wonder if his energy is interfering with mine. 

Question would be - what can I do to cleanse the energy of the house or at least protect myself from any possible negative energy here or disruptive energy from my roommate? Moving is not very feasible and I'd rather find a good solution then be at the mercy of whatever energy each new place I move into has. "
1mraw4,2,2013-09-20,"Which is more powerful: having a job in your major straight out of college, or having a degree from a college more well-known for that major?",drowsavon,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1mraw4/which_is_more_powerful_having_a_job_in_your_major/,"Reddit, straight out of college and in the workforce, is it better to graduate from a small private school with previous internship experience and most likely a guaranteed job, or from a well-known public school with no guaranteed internship or job?

Here is my scenario. 

I'm a college sophomore majoring in mechanical engineering at a small private school known for its dentistry and pharmacy programs, but not its engineering. The school guarantees four-year graduation, which I am more than on track for, as well as a guaranteed co-op with a company which will most likely hire post-graduation. In other words, a secure job. [Price: $50,000/yr]

My parents are pressuring me to transfer to a well-known public university nearby. The school is well-known for engineering, but upon transferring, I would have very little network aside from friends who already attend. There would be no internship or guaranteed job. Additionally, my units may not transfer over in their entirety, forcing me to stay additional time. [Price: $20,000/yr]

If I do not transfer, my parents' financial planners estimate they will each have to work an additional three years to pay for my tuition. When I am financially stable, they expect me to pay half the cost of my tuition back to them, so it's not entirely their money. It's mine, too.

I sound as if I am loath to transfer, which is true. 

super short TL;DR: Would you rather have a first job lined up in your desired industry, or a degree from a school well-known for that major/industry?"

I've been put in charge of the 2nd grade team... help?,therealaug,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1mr1lf/design_team_competition_ive_been_put_in_charge_of/,"**BACKGROUND:** I'm a junior mining engineering student planning on joining the mine design team for my college. A team of 6 students essentially designs a mine from scratch and presents it through a feasibility study. Not only is this great experience, but everyone's resumes are attached to the project before judging, and often lead to a lot of attention through the industry with many people getting job offers. The downside however is you have a month to prepare/study, and then are given the project with 3 weeks to complete it between the 6 team members.


**THE PROBLEM**: In previous years there has generally been one better team with mostly upperclassmen and maybe one underclassman. There have been years where a second team is formed and has never done well due to less upperclassmen and thus lack of experience/knowledge.


This year, it seems there will be one team that is 5 seniors and 1 freshman, and another team.... which I'll very likely be in charge of, with maybe another junior, a sophomore, and three freshmen.


Essentially, my group is set up for failure. The underclassman have little/no experience with anything we will be doing as they are still taking undergrad classes. The other junior and I do have experience in the industry(I've been a paid intern for the last 2 years) and have taken many helpful classes, but we still lack 2 or three classes that are extremely important for this competition. 


So what do I do? I can work with my group as much as possible, gather books, basic tutorials, and seek instruction from professors and working professionals, but there is only so much you can learn on top of school to prepare yourself.


Should I stop now before getting too caught up into things and just do it next year? Or should I give it a shot and see how it goes? What would you do?"

For the past year and 4 months, I've been a Software Engineering intern (sadly it is remote) and did things like program firmware for embedded systems in C, make a server in Java server running on Amazon EC2, and essentially having it all interconnected, and did things like testing, writing documentation for my software, and doing optimizations. I also have many school projects, and also am working on a few small ones of my own. Now, currently I am looking for a full-time job, but here is a thing.

I recently started my graduate studies and am slowly working towards a Masters in Computer Science, since that is the field I really love. I chose part-time and evening classes, in order to make sure I have enough time available during the week for a full-time position. Essentially, what I wanted to do is start working somewhere full-time, while slowly getting my Masters on the side, to get both the degree, as well as valuable job experience. One thing that bugs me, is that some people have told me that doing the Masters will make it much harder to find a job, and I started worrying about it.

The second interview went just as well as the first but in neither was I asked to solve any problems.

Today I got an email that they wanted to hire as a Junior Developer Intern. I was heart broken. I was under the impression that I had been interviewing for a full-time position. The position would be an unpaid internship for 3 months and based on my performance could be offered a 3 month paid internship. After those 3 months (6 month total internship) and another evaluation I could be offered a Full-time position.

I am pretty 100% sure that the job posting never said anything about an internship and in neither of the interviews was it said. 

Did I misinterpret what Junior meant? I have to call tomorrow and ask about the listing. It's not listed on Craigslist anymore as it's expired and couldn't find a cached version of it. Money is tight right now and fortunately I start a decent paying part-time job this weekend.

I have no personal projects and my grades are alright. I'll have four open-ended project courses finished by the time I graduate, but I have nothing to show at this point. The only thing I have going for me is the strong connection between my school and the nearby tech area and the program has a good reputation for being challenging and practical.

The career fair is coming up soon, but I'm not sure if I should apply for post-graduation internships or full-time positions. I feel like if I don't get any solid internships under my belt, it will limit my potential in seeking employment. But from what I've read, for better or for worse, some companies place much more emphasis on GPA and technical interviews. How do you think I should proceed?

I'm considering applying next fall instead of this fall.,throwawayacctah,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1mv243/nervous_about_my_chances_im_considering_applying/,"I am interested in applied economics/agricultural economics and/or possibly public health programs. Either field, I ultimately want to get a Ph.D., since that has always been a dream of mine.

I am currently an economics major. The math and statistics classes I have taken include calc 1 &amp; 2, multivariable calculus, linear algebra, probability theory, R computing and STATA computing. I am also taking an upper division proof linear algebra class, and will take real analysis my next semester.

I took the GRE the other day and got these scores: 162 Q and 160 V. I haven't seen my essay scores yet, but hopefully I did well. I also might want to retake this and bump my quant score a bit...i'm not sure though.

As for my three recommenders, I have one from a biology professor who I did research for and also TAed as an undergrad. One from an economics professor who I am doing research with and got an A in his class. And the 3rd (hopefully, haven't asked yet) from another econ professor whose class I also took and got an A in/did research with. 

As for research, I have research experience in various fields, such as medicine, microbiology, and economics. I also worked in government and political organizations as well. 

However, my main concern lies with my GPA. it is around a 3.4 overall. My major GPA is definitely higher, not sure by how much though. Possibly 3.5/3.6. The main reason for this is because I was very ill my 1st two years of college (I'm a senior now) and my grades plummeted. I was actually a biology major with hopes of medical school, but those were dashed. I switched to economics and quickly fell in love with the field. 

I haven't written any statement of purpose yet and I feel there is not enough time to do so. I think I could make a very good essay if I apply next fall, but I also don't know what I would do for a year, possibly a research internship, etc.

I guess I just needed some advice on all of this, since the deadlines are coming up. For Public Health, apparently, SOPHAS takes 4 weeks to verify, so I would need to submit by late October/early November...

1mussk,5,2013-09-21,Could use a bit of advice/perspective from you guys. Here's my story:,beullucks,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1mussk/could_use_a_bit_of_adviceperspective_from_you/,"I go to a pretty good school, but not that big and not good enough that the jobs i want are coming to our school and asking for students/grads. 

Last year, i transferred to a very highly ranked school in LA, to pursue a degree in Math/Economics. When i got there, i was pretty lost. I had a good group of friends at my old school and i missed it, and on top of that the increased difficulty and competitiveness of the math classes was getting to me. I got okay grades, never anything less than a B- while i was there, but at the time it didn't feel right. My housing situation was bad (i was overpaying), and i wasn't doing well in my math class towards the end of my second quarter there. 

I decided that i would transfer back to my original school, with the idea that the smaller classes would help me get a better relationship with some of my professors (which it did), and the less rigorous course load would help keep my GPA pretty high (which it did). So now I'm back; last year i spent two quarters in LA and one back here. I got a 4.0 this last quarter back in 2 upper div major classes, and secured a summer internship that just ended a couple weeks ago, so that was good.

Lately I've been feeling really down about not being able to get through the tougher challenge. I feel like i should have taken a quarter off and got my head straight so i could make a more clear headed decision, not one that was based more off desperation. 

I'm starting to slightly consider transferring back, but the problem is it's about to be my senior year. If i stay here, I'll graduate on time with a high GPA (3.7+), note: this school is top 100 school. If i were to go back to LA, it'd be probably another 4 quarters (there) to finish, which means 5 total, cause i still will be here for fall. So I'd be about 2 quarters into a 5th year (not that bad); and thats if i pass all my classes etc. 

I'm going to be going to grad school, i believe for economics. So finishing on time, and with a high gpa sounds good for that because then i'll be on the same schedule as grad schools. But on the other hand, going back to LA to finish sounds good too because i know i'd never have the regret of not finishing it up and getting that experience. Plus the jobs straight out of college are much better with a degree from LA than here. I'm still getting email from my old department there with job openings that are all things i'd love to be doing, if i weren't going to grad school, while here our on campus recruitment is a joke, and our career center has no job postings that are in a field i'd be interested in. But none of that matters a whole lot if i end up at grad school anyway. 

I don't really know what to do, i guess i wanted to vent a little bit, but i'd also like to here your perspective on it. I know that while i was in LA, i really wasnt happy, but i feel like that was because of the bad situation i was in with housing (switched housing 3 times within 2 quarters, and then over paying just to find a place). If i were to go back, i think i might be able to move in with my mom and have my own room and free rent. But finishing up here would be quicker and would get me to grad school faster (but thats only if i get into a good program!).

Its all so frustrating and i hate dwelling on the what-ifs and what could have beens. I know that if i graduated from LA with a decent GPA, my job outlooks would be much better, but im not really planning on working straight out of college, but i definitely would if i didn't get into a grad program. Theres also something to be said about finishing up at LA because of its difficulty, it'd be something to be pretty proud of, while here graduating would be nothing too special, nobody really regards this school as any sort of challenge. 

TLDR: Transferred from worse to better school, then back to worse school after some personal problems that affected school work, now i'm back and sort of regret leaving and am considering going back. If i were to go back, it'd take longer to graduate, but i'd have a stronger name on my resume and a lot more job opportunities. But i'm applying to grad school, so do i even need to be concerned about that?

edit: i also feel like i gave up too quickly. i applied to come back after 1 quarter there because i was already having doubts about my future in LA, but i think that was too quick and then it was easy to just go back. "

He doesn't have the best reputation in the department either. I just started my masters this fall as a first year graduate student, but I put in work over the summer and up until now on a research project that I was anticipating using for my thesis. (side note, I didn't want to work that summer AT ALL) If my advisor doesn't get tenure, he loses his position as a professor and my project gets scrapped. 

Best case scenario if my advisor gets canned is I get put into another research group and have to start over on a new project, setting me back a semester or two on graduating. I just want to get this degree and get out at this point; the department isn't good and the research I have been doing isn't difficult or interesting (my summer internship was more rigorous). I'm wondering if its normal for something like this to happen? Why would a professor extend an offer to a student if he knows that the student will not be able to bring a project to conclusion due to lack of advisor? Also, I didn't hear about the tenure thing directly from him, but from another one of my professors. Isn't this something I should be made aware of? This has the possibility of setting back my academic career and I find the whole ordeal to be completely unprofessional. Should I approach my advisor about my concerns? He's not exactly easy to talk to, he's incredibly condescending and throws most of my concerns to the wind."

You raised me to be a self-loathing girl. You told me I would never be pretty like my sister, smart like my brother, or successful like you. Every achievement I had was to please you, to get you to tell me you loved me.

Growing up, you led me to believe that I was the one at fault. I was the reason why the family was unhappy. No matter how many times I was on honor roll or won singing competitions, I was never good enough. I believed it. I constantly pushed myself to do my best.

I thought you would be proud of me when I got a full-ride scholarship for vocal performance. You told me wanted me to work in Finance. I got an internship as an auditor. You told me the company was too small. I finished my internship and joined a bigger company. You told me it was still not good enough.

I hated myself because of you. I thought so highly of you and looked up to you so much. Because everything I did was never good enough, it killed me inside. I blamed myself for everything that went wrong, sometimes I still do.

Finally someone who did genuinely care about me when I was twenty convinced me to see a therapist. I went every week. ""Therapy Thursdays."" I feel much better about myself. Sometimes you get to me with the things you say, but now I am capable of getting myself out of that dark place.

I don't hate myself anymore, and I can't bring myself to hate you either. I feel sorry for you and for everyone in your emotionally destructive radius. That's the only reason I come to visit you. Mom already said that once us three kids are done with college that she is moving in with her mother. Sister, Brother, and I are moving away too when we're done. You will be by yourself, wondering why you're alone. You will only have yourself to blame.

One day you will miss me.

One of them told a waitress (who was relatively fit) that she should lose weight, and gave her a coupon for the gym.  He also hit on her.  They gave the intern manager a D, even though she was the best manager we had.  They made us go to the grocery store to pick up cigarettes for them.  They didn't give us breaks on 14-hour shifts. 

All in all, horrible managers.  Everyone in the restaurant ended up quitting within two weeks of each other.

Anyways, when I was offered the job, I told the manager I would love to take the job, but I needed the weekend of August 2nd off (this was a few years ago), since both my parents' birthdays are on that weekend, and he said that was fine.

Thinking that my manager would keep his word, my parents book a hotel and dinner reservation for us to stay the weekend in the mountains.

A week before, I verify with my manager that I need that time off.  He says that it's policy to not allow weekends off, and I had to work that weekend.  I reminded him that he told me I would get that weekend off, and he said that it was ""too bad.""

I beg to get that weekend off, telling him it's *both* my parents' birthdays, and that we already have reservations, and he still says no.

After thinking for some sort of compromise, I call his office ten minutes later, and offer to work Friday morning and Sunday evening, so I could have the most of the weekend off, but would still work for the weekend--he laughed at me, asked the other manager if he should give it to me, then tells me no.

Next time he comes by my stand, I ask him one more time, and he says, ""Look, you're not getting the weekend off.  Your parents are going to have a lot more birthdays, so it's not like it's important or anything for you to be there.""

Some background:  My dad had gone in remission from cancer after having his larynx removed and undergoing radiation therapy just a year before this, and we weren't (and still aren't 100%) sure if the cancer would come back.

I have studied very hard in my first year of college, made a lot of side projects, and have gotten the maximum grade in my 1st year exams. Teachers have also been nice and gave me recommendations because of my performance. 

All of this materialised into something great recently , because I've just been hired in the industry( not an intern) that I study in recently, on a relevant possition. This was my dream job ever since I had an achievable dream job( not astronaut or musician). My parents are very proud of me, friends look up to me and teachers value me.

I mean I can, and I have made some, but I never really feel like going out with them. Yet I sometimes feel terribly lonely. I'm not the kind of person that usually is a negativist, as I've never used ""depressed"" and ""I am"" in the same scentence ever in my life. Sometimes I'm ""sad"" tho.

 I miss my family and my friends a lot, but now that my career seems to be blossoming, it's really hard to back out.

Is this the kind of sacrifice one does that will pay off in the following years? Is being lonely for until I finish school ( and possibly master's degree from what my parents seem to want from me) worth it?

I missed the US sometimes but I really grew to love Ireland as well. My relationship is amazing. The friends I've made are fabulous. When my boyfriend suggested we stay another year, I was on board.

Apparently, it'll cost him a fortune that he doesn't have to get into the states on a work visa. I can stay here for almost nothing. We're not ready to get married, and we don't want to do it just for a green card. 

So here I am, unemployed in Ireland. I'm living with my boyfriend's family. They're great people, and they're so kind to let me stay there, but they live out in the middle of nowhere. While my boyfriend and I look for jobs, we have to find people to stay with in the city. It sucks to mooch off your friends, but we can't really think of another way to do it. Gas is really expensive here.

The graduate job market here is awful. The job market in general is awful. Unemployment is twice what it is in the States. Education here is mostly free, so the market is flooded with college-educated, unemployed people my own age. People who have parents they can sponge off while they do endless internships. 

My mental health is deteriorating alongside my bank account. My depression deepens with every rejection email. My boyfriend is so incredibly supportive, but there's nothing he can do other than hold me when I lose my shit and burst in tears. It's almost every day now. He pays for what he can, and his parents of course absorb the greater cost of keeping me. It's humbling.

Six years of international university education. An internship. And 100 euro to my name. 

This week I gave in and started looking for a restaurant or bar job. Apparently the standard here is a ""trial"" period before you are guaranteed a job. I have a trial at an extremely busy tourist pub tomorrow. I don't want to do it. I swore I'd never work another bar job. But really, I have to. 

I don't know. I might go back to America. But it feels like such a humongous failure, and who's to say there's work there? My American friends are struggling too. Sure, they have stronger support systems, but... I don't know. I want to be here. I've never been so happy in a relationship. I want to see it through. I want to marry my boyfriend one day. But long-distance relationships are dangerous and difficult. If I move to America, there's a possibility I'll never see him again. I don't want to risk that.

I don't know. I just had to say it to somebody. Therapy is expensive."

I am a junior mechanical engineering student and I am looking for different jobs of mechanical engineers so that I can have an idea where to do my internship. There are no concrete search results in reddit about piping engineering so would you share your time to answer some of my questions?

1. What does a piping engineer do?
2. What subjects in college are you using the most? (my favorite subjects right now are thermodynamics and fluid mechanics. does piping engineering involve lots of thermodynamics and fluid mechanics?)
3. How did you become a piping engineer? what are steps you've taken to be one?
4. What CAD software are you using? (I would love to be one step ahead so that I can impress the companies I would like to intern for)
5. What senior thesis project can you suggest involving piping engineering? (having a topic related to piping engineering will somehow make companies like me more since this shows I have interest in it. do you work with pumps? I think I would love to study something about pumps)

Thank you guys! I hope you can help me. :D

""You just got an internship in a foreign country? Well, but your hair is a little messy today, you shouldn't feel good about yourself."" I'm not even surprised he doesn't understand the concept of being happy with yourself and being positive and loving in general. I just needed a little rant, hope this is ok to post here.

The interview was on friday afternoon, so since i'm sending out an email to him on saturday he probably won't see it until monday. 

ultimately my question is, would it be a bad idea if I tried to make up for my slight awkwardness by acknowledging his humor in my followup thank you email? e.g. the interview is for an intern position and he joked several times about how my daily task will be to make coffee. i know ultimately that this is a judgment call I would have to make since it's hard get an exact feel for this for someone who wasn't in the room, but is it worth the risk for the chance of standing out and making up for my subtle blunders during the interview?

and to add a little more, the company's a medium sized startup, so not really much of that 'to whom it may concern' kind of formality"

Not sure whether I'm overreacting or whether I should call it quits.

Sorry this is going to be quite long. 

So my boyfriend and I have been dating for 3 years. Most of that has been long distance, as we go to different universities, but we live in the same town in the holidays and during the semester we see each other every 3/4 weeks, plus we text and call. I'm currently doing a semester abroad in Australia, and am about halfway through the 22 weeks. 

My boyfriend is an incredible boyfriend and I really never thought I'd ever want to end it with him until recently. This summer he got an internship and its been quite intense. The weeks before I left, we didn't get to see each other or talk that much. But he was really sweet and planned a lovely evening for our 3 year anniversary. When left for Australia, at first he kept putting the effort in, like he wrote me a beautiful letter and sent me a necklace. 

But since then it's very rapidly gone downhill. The only time we can speak (due to time difference) is while he's at his internship. This is because he likes to speak to me in real time and refuses to send me anything when I can't immediately see it. But obviously this makes our conversations very stilted as he's busy and distracted. It makes me feel like I'm just bothering him. He no longer says 'I love you' unless its prompted. He doesn't ask me about my day or what I'm up to. He sometimes doesn't even acknowledge my messages. This has really hurt me, and affected my confidence greatly as I feel like he doesn't even want to be in a relationship with me. It's making me act kind of needy which I hate.

Now I've tried lots of things. I tried putting in loads of effort, sending him pizza as a surprise, sending him cute messages. I tried trying to not make it a big deal and just let him talk to me when he wanted- he didnt talk to me for two days. I have spoken to him about it many times and each time he says he's sorry and asks me to be patient and that he'll try harder, and each time things remain the same. The last conversation like that I told him if it carried on like this I'd break up with him. He was visibly upset and for a week put in lots of effort, which I made sure to tell him was appreciated, but he's just regressed again.

Now I know his job is a lot of pressure so I can understand to a degree. And there is only a week left of the internship. But then he starts uni, and his course is also a lot of pressure and I just can't believe that things will magically change.  

The thing is we ARE FREAKING AMAZING when we're together. We just get on so well. And its the same when we skype. But time difference/ lives means we've hardly been able to do that. He used to make me so happy every day, but recently all I feel is hurt and upset when I should be making the most of being in Australia.

So I feel lost. I know that things will be fine once we're back together in the UK at Christmas. But thats 12 weeks away and I don't know if I can cope with feeling this crappy for that long. Am I just overreacting? He puts so much time and energy into his work that there's just no left for me. "

My wife is in the military and we were relocated half-way through my program. I have about 2 years left, but this arrangement can be as temporary as necessary.

Alas, I can't pay for one though.... so I'm hoping I can trade services with a company that has a few extra desks (or a corner I can put my desk in), a power plug, and Ethernet port.  

So in exchange for desk/office space I can offer the following services:  
* Quantitative Ecologist  
* Modeling and simulation  
* Statistical Analysis  
* ArcGIS work  
* R-programming, seminars for new users, sound board for troubleshooting: If you're interested in switching from SAS to R, I propose I try and get it done as a trial while you maintain current operations  
* A warm-fuzzy feeling and the ability to brag to investors/customers how you support environmental research. I will also acknowledge the company in all works published as a result.  
* Genuine Texan for all your BBQ'ing needs (people have wept upon consumption of my brisket)  
* Home Brewed Beer  
* gopher services 8am-noon 5 days a week.  
* I also have some beginner-level programming skills in C++, Python, and Perl.   
*  tutoring in math and science  

So if you have some space or know of a friend, please pass this along. Thanks!

1mtlkj,28,2013-09-21,"Starting another school year of long distance, reflection and what we learned last year",circuitGal,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1mtlkj/starting_another_school_year_of_long_distance/,"Sorry about the length and spelling/grammar. I'm tired and watching some soccer, so distracted.

My BF and I have been dating for 6 years. Last year (during the school year) was our first of long-distance, as we both started graduate school in different states. It was tough. Not going to lie. I missed him like crazy because he is my best friend and the love of my life. Fortunately he was able to get an internship in my area for the summer and he lived with me. It was amazing.  Monday we start another year of long distance. I will see him over Thanksgiving, Christmas, and spring break. He will make it to my graduation in June. I already have the countdown setup in my room.  Recently I had a few people ask how we did it and I sat and talked with BF about how we could manage the next year.  It is hard since we know when he is done but I'm in a Masters/PhD so I don't quite know yet when I'll be done.  This is the advice we came up with for my friend or a reflection on how we made it work.

Don't let your focus slip. Whether work or school is the reason for long distance, when you are at work/school focus on that. It is easy to start daydreaming about BF when I'm supposed to be doing research. So I don't let myself until I get home. I remind myself that if I want more leeway on taking my full vacation breaks from research to visit him that I have to stay focused while I'm there.

Communicate Communicate Communicate. Whether it be skype, google chat, email, texting, phone calls, or good old fashioned snail mail. It keeps the spark alive. When BF has a huge test and I don't want to distract him I write emails that I save as drafts and send to him after his test with only a brief good luck email before the test.  If I'm feeling lonely or sad or upset, I tell him, even if it is for stupid reasons. I know he has lab work on Thursday and I know it is stupid to be sad he can't talk then, but if I tell him then he knows why I'm feeling down and I don't end up taking it out on him later. And he doesn't end up feeling confused as to why I seem upset. 

Focus on yourself. Find something about yourself that you want to improve and work to do so. Find a hobby that you've always wanted to have and explore it. My BF says he loved that when he visited this summer that I clearly was still developing as my own person. I started playing more soccer and fishing. He developed an interest in rock climbing. We now have something to share and teach each other. We also have something to talk about. We aren't letting our depression from missing each other rule our lives. You can't be miserable the whole time. It is hard the first bit, but worth it. Do I wish I could be sharing the experience with him? You betcha. Am I happy that he has something healthy to occupy his limited free time and de-stress, even if it limits our chats? Yes of course.

On this same line: make friends. We both went to new places and knew no one.  He doesn't always understand my school work and I rarely understand his. It is good to have friends to talk to about school/work and even just chill with. I knew a girl who refused to make friends so her BF wouldn't get jealous. She was never happy and that wasn't a healthy relationship.

Work on trust. My BF goes country dancing with classmates (girls) and lives with two girls. My closest friend is a guy. Both of us trust each other and are very open with each other. Jealously isn't an issue. I have no idea how to advise those who don't have it, but I just know that it is essential.  Things that helped: we both met each others friends on visits (and via skype), we set boundaries with our friends, and we communicate our boundaries with each other (ie. I am okay with him swing dancing with other girls, just no slow dancing).

Respect the other person's time. I have to let him study and he knows that I won't talk much (or at all) on the last week of projects.  

I guess I don't know what this is. I just wanted to share from personal experience. Are we experts? Not by any stretch of the imagination. Do others have it rougher than us? For sure. We are grateful to be in the same time zone.  I'm not looking forward to being away from my best friend, but I know we will survive it. "

Also for the interview portion if any of you guys have tips that would be great. I have had only one interview with an engineering firm earlier this summer and didn't land the job.

1mtiyw,8,2013-09-20,29 F4M My weirdest sexual fantasy involves Star Trek,palatably,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/1mtiyw/29_f4m_my_weirdest_sexual_fantasy_involves_star/,"There's this episode of Star Trek where a very young female crew member who is doing a science/medical internship finds out she has Q powers - she's basically omnipotent. One of the first things she does is kidnap Cmdr. Will Riker, who she has a big crush on, from a date with another woman. She whisks him away to this scenario she's created - outdoors, he's in a top hat, she's in a white dress. Clearly an idea of what's romantic from a teenager with no romantic experience. She then makes the most awkward attempt to seduce him, and he tells her that she's a very lovely young lady, but that things don't work that way and you can't make someone love you. She then controls his mind and makes him love her, and there's some kissing, and then she decides she's not actually into mind control, and then - in the episode - she spirits him back.  
Anyway, in my head, instead of sending him back, she instead just stops controlling his mind, and he's furious with her for what she just did. She then starts crying and tells him that she knows it's not appropriate, but she's worried that she's never going to be able to have a normal sexual relationship - no one is ever going to treat her like a normal girl because she's omnipotent. And she feels awkward and unloved and totally unattractive, and won't he please help her out. And he decides he's been perhaps a bit rash in rejecting the advances of this woman, who is, after all, both quite attractive and clearly in need of instruction. He tells that her really does find her sexy and previously wasn't pursuing her because she was an intern and extremely young, but that he supposes the whole power-dynamic issue has been rendered moot by her omnipotence. He then instructs her that to even things out (since she's omnipotent), as part of the sexual instruction she desires, and as punishment for the kidnapping, she must follow his exact directions, or their encounter will end.  
She protests and he tells her that those are the conditions - and after all, he knows she doesn't want someone she can control, she wants to be the one being seduced. She agrees and he then instructs her to take her clothes off and let him see her body. I'm not actually sure what happens after that - I mean, eventually he fucks her. There might be some spanking involved. I'm definitely open to further exploring those parts. "
1mthls,1,2013-09-20,A rant about a bad friend,btscott456,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1mthls/a_rant_about_a_bad_friend/,"In the beginning, a random bunch of friends got together due to an internship with a company. We hit it off well and became friends (like friends even five years later). I and dude became best friends (like brothers). A long and complicated story short, our friendship broke up when I wanted friendship and he wanted romance. I made mistakes during the fallout and I tried to make amends. However, all attempts have failed and the issue is still unresolved to this day. The main issue is due to his hatred of confrontation. 

I have returned to the company of our internship and most of us friends have remained. I figure my others friends would have a healthy friendship with this friend, but it was a little troubling. I keep hearing that they have not seen him for a month or so and all information was via text message. I would soon learn that only times he would hang out was in big events. The once healthy friendships turn into an occasional thing. In the six months since I moved here, only five events he decided to show up. What happened? I know people get new and other friends, but he barely puts efforts into these friends. He does not invite nor ask, he gets invited or asked. The extent of his efforts are facebook ""likes"" and comments. It feels like everything is a formality and just bringing us up-to-date. 

What is happening is that he is hanging out with departmental co-workers. That makes sense, and understandables. However, these co-workers are his main friend group. Basically, we are being passed over for new friends. Only being brother with when big events happen in our groups - sometimes not even that. He has developed into a terrible friend and actually shitting on my other friends. My friends talk about this friend and usually in dearing terms. Often picking this stuff up by facebook (because he is facebook whore). I sit back and watch this. I felt betrayed by a dear friend and now he is treating my other friends shitty. 

Sure, I don't know how much they message each other. It just seems they are in the dark about things and get most of the information from facebook. He barely hangs out with us (last time was in May). We constantly see things with his co-workers or a new boyfriend. It is real shitty. I don't know if I am a sticking point, but we all pretend he still cares. I am angry and I try to forget about it everyday. However, my friends still talk about him and he treats them like shit. This make me angrier. 

I may be biased and may be misunderstood things, but I am angry. And, it seems I can't do nothing about it and have to deal with bullshit constantly. Thanks for reading....and letting this go  "

Said he had the mole removed and it was stage 2C or 2B, right before it turned to 3. Apparently, 4 is like dead and 0 is ""pre""cancer. But they took it off and he's fine now.

Right? I don't really know anything about cancer, much less a specific type. He's fine now, so that's good. But he said that it'll come back for sure so has to get check ups all the time.

I am having the same pessimism about applying for the DI due to my academics and extracurriculars. I am currently a Junior going through a Didactic program at my state university, but I am an older student (24). 

Right now my gpa is roughly a 3.0, possibly a little less. I still have to go through the guillotine of Biochem/MCB/Anatomy+Physiology (part 2), so I am hoping it hovers around 3.0. I am currently trying to debate on whether or not to apply for a DI. Unfortunately, I don't have much extracurricular activities or volunteer hours. I am hoping to change this over the summer and when I have free time in school, but as of yet, I have nada. I am doing a semester long outreach program teaching pre-school kids about nutrition, so that is one check mark I guess.

I do however have a pretty good personal statement and story. Like many people in the Nutrition field, I lost weight. Except I lost 200lbs, and have kept it off for 24 months now (and counting). I have been told that being a male and having an inspirational story like mine are very good pieces to have on my applications for interns. I also am going for my personal training certificate (NASM) this December to bolster my resume.

I am still concerned about my academics and work experience. I can't afford to take unpaid interns at the moment unfortunately, and I am strongly considering taking a year to gain some relevant work experience, and applying after.

Does anyone have any insight to what I should try and do? I am scheduled to apply next November for an internship. My adviser STRONGLY recommends a 3.3gpa or above, 40-50 volunteer hours, work experience and/or internship experience. All of this is pretty stacked against me, so I am hoping when the time comes, someone really likes my story!"

I hadn't seen him in awhile, but had slept with him once in the past (several months before) when we were both very drunk. This was instigated by him.

The semester ended, and I went home to start work at my internship, but was back once to see him before he had to go away on an eight week trip (school related). While he was away, he texted me ever couple days. It was about an even split between ordinary conversation and something sex-related (dirty talk, pictures, etc.).

When he came back from his trip, I drove back up for a weekend to visit him (about a month before the fall semester started). We hung out, went out to dinner, had sex a bunch of times...it was a fun weekend.

In the last month before the fall semester started, we continued to text just as frequently. The weekend I moved back in for the fall, I saw him twice, and about once a week for ever week after that.

The first problem that came up came to my realization about the time I moved back to campus--I had developed feelings for him. I know, I know, that's the typical end to a friend with benefits situation. Someone develops feelings for the someone else, person with emotions involved gets hurt, situation implodes. I had planned to talk to him about it yesterday or today, whichever day he had time to meet up with me. I had to tell him on the off chance that he had some sort of feelings for me. You never know, right? I asked him if he was free yesterday, but he had work. When I asked him if he had any free time today, he said he and his friends hadn't figured out what they were doing yet. Okay, I can deal with that. I'll ask once they figure everything out.

So this afternoon rolls around, and I sent him a text: ""What are you up to tonight?"" Nothing. At all. For the last six hours. It's not like he's busy and just hasn't checked his phone either--this guy is always on his phone. I can't figure out why I'm suddenly being ignored.

So Reddit...what gives? Am I just paranoid?

This sounds very drama-queen like, but I feel insulted.",Till_I_Win,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1mt6sd/me26f_with_a_girl_i_have_been_texting23f_this/,"**Edit:** it was 2am when I posted this. I am a MALE, the title got messed up. Sorry :)

Here's the short version:

Recently I got in contact with a girl I had a secret crush on. I had seen here around campus a few times a couple of years ago, then she disappeared. A year ago a very close friend of mine introduced her as her best friend, then she disappeared again. I put an ad out because our flat was looking for a new flatmate, and she emailed me (she didn't move in). I told her about how I had been interested in her for a while now, and she takes kindly to it and we start texting.

Thing is, none of us are in the town where we study. She's doing an internship somewhere else, as am I. We'll both be back to Uni in 3 weeks or so. We've been texting basically daily for the past 2.5 months now. Went from sporadic texting, to daily texting, to audio messages, to calls, to skype. 

Anyway, we both really like each other (so far) and find each other very attractive. We basically agree that something needs to happen the second we are both in town. Now, I'm not the one to build his hopes up. I'm not unsuccessful with women, but I'm very reluctant on actually being affectionate towards someone.

Today, she left to see her friends in a different country over the weekend (Europe is small). Those are people she met while she studied overseas for a year (one of those years where she disappeared). After a lengthy call, we wish each other an awesome weekend. She texts me when she gets there. At the end of the conversation I say ""Well, don't get naughty. Talk to you soon."" and she replied ""Well not naughty yet!"". I'm like ""Yet?"" and she says ""Well, I don't know what to expect from those guys, they're crazy. I'll try to behave."" follows up with ""I WANT to enjoy the weekend, and if that in any way means I will be a bit naughty, then that's how it is.""

I'm upset over this. Not because I'm jealous or whatever, as I fully accept her not being tied to me (or me to her) in any way. But fuck, she knows I like her, does she really need to tell me that she might sleep with a bunch of other dudes she knew from way back when?

I'm not going to bring this up with her, as what she does over there is her business... but I can't help but feel offended. I find that stuff like this is better left unsaid. She isn't ""cheating"" on me, but that basically was a big ""well I don't give a fuck what you think right now, I want to have fun.""

All of this feels so... juvenile. *sigh*

Am I in the wrong for being offended and/or feeling disrespected?

Turned out not-so-short. Sorry!

**tl;dr** girl I like and who likes me (nothing going on yet) tells me she might bang some other guys over the weekend because she wants to have fun - I'm thinking about cutting her out."

This part is shorter but it was hard to write and the real fun starts afterwards if my memory serves me well.


Part II.
Opening The Portal

I called my old social worker at the outreach place I use to go to in my home city sporadically to catch up, and through him learned that a good friend of mine (albeit one I used to ""use"" with) had been in jail for a few months for something minor. I was overjoyed because I thought that it was awesome that by fate we had both gone clean, even if he had no choice in the matter. 
I found him and started religiously sending letters and books every week. 

""R.L"" was an old friend and like myself, trustworthy even when he was strung out.
He was one of the few people I've ever met that I could have a really quick ""back and forth"" with because our brains were both really fast, buggy and filled with pop culture references and general snarkiness. 
He was as smart as fuck, funny as hell, a kick-ass writer and always pretty chipper despite having a horrible, abusive upbringing that involved moving from foster home to foster home, being sexually abused, burned with cigarettes, hooked on junk and turned out as a gay prostitute at 15 (even though he identified as straight). 
R.L was even more awesome for living through that hell and still being a person who had some love in him. 

R.L's release date came on fast and when he told me, I was ecstatic! We were both clean and I'd help him finally get his shit together. 
He had nowhere to go and despite the fact that I didn't have the room by any stretch of the imagination, I told him he was welcome to stay with us and I meant it.

I excitedly mentioned my friend coming to Larry in passing with no ulterior motive and Larry said ""he can stay with me if he wants"". 
Sweet! Lonely old guy, charismatic young punk looking to start fresh like I did, and avoidance of the whole ""guy on couch and I want to get laid, argggg fuck!” scenario. 
Everybody's happy! Great!

But…not great.

We had some wonderful time catching up, walking in the park, talking about our new found dreams, but after about 2 weeks past, I started getting a niggling feeling that he was using again. 

One early Saturday morning I was on my way to the clinic internship and decided to go say good morning to R.L before I left.
The door was ajar and I got goosebumps - the moment I saw R.L from the back I knew something was wrong. Larry was nowhere to be seen and R.L was reclined on the couch. I approached and saw he had half of a Mike's Hard Lemonade perfectly balanced on his chest. 

As you maybe already guessed, he was dead. 

Judging by the foam around his mouth and nose it was obvious to me it was a heroin overdose because I had seen them before and apparently it's a standard symptom of an opiate overdose (medulla oblongata suppression, involuntary breathing response stops, lining of lungs comes up in ""foam form"" blah blah blah.)
 
I still think it must have been a suicide because R.L was a seasoned user and any junkie knows never to mix junk and booze, or if you do, be careful.

Or maybe he thought his tolerance was higher than it was after being clean for awhile, which is a  common reason for O.Ds.

Regardless.

His skin was light grey, his eyes the palest China blue. 
I sat next to his body and took a long look at him, asked him why , expressed my anger and my sadness, told him that he was free now.  Eventually I called the cops and a coroner came within an hour, zipped him into a crinkly maroon body bag.

Before they left, one of them took R.L's cuff off his wrist and gave it to me like we give a dog's collar to the owner after euthanasia. Both touching and fucking heartbreaking.
If I hadn't have been there to tell them his full name, he would have been ""John Doe"". 

His birth certificate arrived in the mail the next day. I still carry it in my wallet to this day.

Understandably upset, I called the clinic and told them I wasn't going to make it. 
I sat in that apartment a long time waiting for Stoic to return from work.
Larry came back to the apartment hours later, visibly shaken. I didn’t have any words so I faced the wall struggling to find something to say.
He spoke first.

""I can't stay in this place anymore"" he said urgently, in a strained voice. 
""Ghosts! There's going to be ghosts! He died right there and now it's wide open and it's all your fault and now it's wide open! Wide open!""

""...Open?""  

He shrank and brought his arms up to his head like the sky was falling.

""Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Fuck fuck fuck!"" He shouted, His eyes widened with fear. 
""They'll...hear...you!""

""Who will hear me, Larry?""

He leaned in conspiratorially and whispered 
""Them.  They know now.""

“Wait…who knows? What are you talking about?”

His eyes were wide and mad, rolling around in his head, his mouth agape and twisted into a grimace of horror that contorted is face into one of pure horror.  
He looked me straight in the eye and let out a long, ragged groan that chills me to think about.
Then before I could say anything further, as if answering a call I could not hear, he abruptly got up and walked away muttering to himself with his hands on his ears, swatting at things that weren't there. 

This was the first indication that he was a little...wonky. 
I figured he was just dealing with the death in his own way and respected his space.

I have been looking for a full-time position, and I have recently decided to try to find an internship as well. However, I have seen multiple companies require that a potential intern be in some form of college. Because of this, I have considered applying to a graduate school for a master's degree, but I have also heard that a graduate degree might tell companies that I am overqualified. I am curious of what you guys might think of these potential options and if it would be possible to find a job with 2 exams and no internship. Thank you!

I have done some reading about IT, again, and now I have rounded down to possibly 2 routes. Sysadmin or Network Administrator.
I read about getting as much experience in the field as I can and getting a few certs just to make sure I land an interview and increase my pay.
Even though, I have 2 possible routes, I'm still not sure if I want to do it. Growing up I mostly just deal with hardware side of things and I had a lot of fun in middle school helping teachers with computer related problems. I can be very lazy and I guess is why I'm hesitant.

Anyways, here is what I've been planning.
[Computer Systems Specialist] (http://www.broward.edu/academics/programs/Program%20Sheet%20Library/21491.pdf)
Thinking about doing this program and when I turn 18 I'll look for an internship. Try to really get a feel for what exactly I'm going to be doing in IT. Then, when I finish this program I could probably study for CCNA, or take the CCNA course to prepare for the test at college since I can be very lazy. I consider myself as Jack of All Trades and I guess at the end it comes down to me and keeping up with the technology advancements.

Oh yes, I've done some programming nothing serious because I just don't enjoy it. It helped me a lot with the way I think. I don't mind learning it. I just don't see myself doing it for a living. I'm thinking about picking a language and sticking with it soon. Back in 08 I started with C++ and got as far as making 1/4, maybe, 1/3 of a Tic Tac Toe game, but I just quit. I picked up Visual Basic last year, but I quit as well. I'm thinking about starting Python and hopefully sticking with it. Also, how are things in Europe as far IT goes? I'm hoping in the future I'll be able to move there.
[This] (http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1mvu6q/im_starting_college_next_year_i_have_a_passion/) also helped me a lot just now and our story are pretty much the same. I guess as long as I'm not stuck answering phones for the rest of my life I'm good.

By the way I'll be meeting with an advisor soon as part of a requirement for one of my classes and just want to make sure I'm at least 80% sure how I'm gonna go about things.

I think that is my biggest problems. I have no interests that really stand out to write about. I could write about my personal life, but well, I go to class and then back home and that's about it for most of my days. There isn't much to do in my town either.

Dexter will also be hunting killer, wants to get to him before Quinn.


Private investigator douchebag hairguy will be hunting blondie.


Hairguy douche will visit deb in hosptial, deb will find some info, and she will tip off blondie to watch out for him.


Blondie wants to help dexter stop the killer. Dexter tells her to get the fuck out of town, he will handle it.


Dexter sets a trap for killer but it backfires.


Killer will capture dexter and strap him down in plastic.


Blondie doesn't actually leave town, she shows up to save dexter.


But private i douchebag followed her there, arrests her. Shows over blondie.


Douchebag hair calls deb and says where he caught her.


Deb is still in the hosptial, and tells Quinn where dexter probably is.


Deb says Quinn be careful you dont have to go. But Quinn says baby i love u


Now Quinn will show up to save dexter.


Killer kills Quinn, rip Quinn. 


Quinn was supposed to call deb. He didn’t call.


Deb says what the fuck, pulls out her iv, and leaves the hospital in bad condition.


Deb shows up, she sees dead Quinn.


Killer is about to knife dex, and then woah deb pops out and kills the killer and saves Dexter.


But this time that sweet murder feels so good.


Deb, Dexter, and Harrison move to Argentina 


Show is wrapping up, nice little cliché montage.


The song playing will be the theme song, and it will be a happy ending.

Shots of random shit such as his old apartment, his boat, and bags of bodies under the sea, ah the memories

Angel is working at his beach bar with lil sis, they have framed photos on the wall of Doakes, Laguerta, and he puts up one of Quinn. It is sad but they smile at eachother.

Masuka is promoted because he is now the only one who still works at Miami metro. He is on the crime scene bossing people around and giggling with his new large chested interns.

Last scene will be a shitty beach relaxation scene, Harrison splashing around in the water, Deb and Dexter lounging around with bottles of beer, with horrible monologue from Dexter.  
Harry the dead ghost dad will be there too for no reason, dexter will metaphorically say goodbye and ghostdad walks over to build a sand castle with Harrison.

Dexter and Debora are in lounge chairs. Then we see they are holding hands. Subtle and incestuous to fuel speculation.

Will end with a wide shot from high above as the sun sets, and you hear that 'ding' from the opening theme.

I have been job hunting for about a year now and it has been relatively fruitless and pretty frustrating.

If I happen to get an interview, the majority of places I have interviewed give me little to no feedback, either saying, ""You came across very good, but we found someone better suited to out requirements"" or ""We have chosen to hire internally"".

Without any feedback, I don't know what to improve on and I'm really unaware as to what to do.

When someone says that, I'm good, but they've found someone slightly better, are they saying just that or, are they shying away from giving me any notable feedback?

Any help or advice would be great!"

But here goes. I've been with this woman for quite some time now. We've been to hell and back. We had crazy obstacles. We overcame them. Hope you guys have a campfire and a 6pack nearby....

6years ago, I met this girl in a library while in highschool. I was on my way out of senior year and going to college. She at the the time was in her junior year. I tried to make a pass at her and she turned me down since she was already involved with someone. Right then and there I apologized to her and left her to her devices. Havent spoke or heard from her in 2yrs. One day, I'm in class when I get a text from a friend of mine to meet her awesome dancer friend. Since I was single at the time I went to go meet this person. It ended up being the girl from the library. She imstantly remembered me and told me she was single. Later that week we went out and she went for the 1st kiss. She caught me so unexpectedly I almost fell into an oncoming train. So now that we're involved, I asked her if she was still a virgin. She took this as me wanting to have sex with her anytime soon. She told me if I wanted her so bad, I'd have to wait and yes she was a virgin. Albeit, I wasn't concerned about having sex with her. It was an honest question. She ended up losing it to me a month later. On her terms, on her time and without me asking. We got together in May 2010 and she lost it to me in junJune of that year.

Things went great until it was her birthday weekend in July. Sadly I couldn't be with her because I had prior engagements to a family outing. It was then for some odd reason that she confessed to me she was an illegal immigrant. She only told me she was french and italian initially. But then told me she was also mexican. She really looks like Selena Gomez' doppleganger. Sorry, off topic. Anyway, I didn't care. I'm a mix of puerto rican and domincan. I had people in my own family who are here illegally. She thought I'd leave her because of her woes. Clearly I didn't and worked with her the best I could.

September of ththat year I left to jobcorps way out in cassadaga. She was in college. In my absence, she met a guy. She's a very friendly person, but is oblivious to most guys intentions. She told me about him in december of that year and how he's turned into a stalker and won't leave her alone. I asked her if she allowed any kind of contact with this guy. She said no. So I phone my dad (he's nypd) ams tell him the situation. He says her story sounds off and then phones her. After my dad spoke to her, he found out she infact gave her number to this guy. That raised a red flag for me. Why would she lie? Me miles and miles away from nyc saw it as her cheating and lying to me. We got through that fine.

Fast forward ro march 2011- i got kicked out of jobcorps under false accussations of me stealing money from the pharmacy I interned at. How much? $30. I'm home and my dad sees me as a failure. He kicks me out in June of that year. I'm homeless now. Literally. Coney island was my home until september of that year. My gf stood by me all that time. I got into a non profit school for IT and was going there every day I could. In july of that year, once again its my gfs bday and I can attend. I throw some birthday cake in her face for shits and giggles. Her dad saw it as me being abusive. I found this out as I was going back to coney island from my gf and her dad tried to abuse her (her dad is a very controlling and abusive man. Though he did seem to like me. I was hidden a whole yesr from him until she decided to introduce me. Its now septmeber of that year. I got a very good job from the IT school, my dad welcomed me back to his nest and my gf was now living in her dads hell.

Fast forward to August 2012. Her dad kicked her out because she was still with me. All the savings from my job was then put into an appartment for us so she could leave that life. She also gave me a ring for me to marry her. I found it odd, but I accepted and we were then enagaged. Its unfortunate that when we started living together, she became the abusive one. I had enough to the point where its march 2013 and I leave her. From there I was living my life, talking to other people and exploring the world again. I went out a lot with a good friend of mine. She's VERY attractive, but we never saw eachother in a relationship. We go out for some drinks and she's trying to be my therapist. My ex at that point in time carches wind of this and thinks I'm cheating?? When that wasn't it. I hear about this in April when I decide to give her another chance and she now forbids me from seeing my best friend. I say whatever and continue talking to my friend. We're like brother and sister. Inseperable. Amd I got her a great internship at jpmorgan. She now make more money than me lol.

Fast forward to August 2013. She meets this long lost cousin of hers out of the blue. Her cousin is happy married and runs her own business. Along with her cousins husband, comes this guy. One thing leads to another and she gives him her number. I grew suspicious on tuesday august 13 when she would hide her phone whenever she texted someone. Soon, she goes to take a shower. I hack in her phone by tracing the key strokes on her touchscreen. And what I saw destroyed me. She was having a more than flirtatious convo with this guy. I am in shock and I just layed there in the bed perplexed. She comes back as if she's not guilty of anything. I give her oppurtunites ro confess until friday. Each day I'm seeing this thing get worse. Friday was to be the day she would send pictures and this guy comes over my house while I'm at work. Its Friday now. I take off from work and she takes me out for breakfast. I take her to a store and buy her a new outfit- all the while more trying to get her to say something since I foiled her plans. Eventually we come home. I fall asleep and she disappears into the bathroom. I wake up, almost 30 minutes later she hasn't returned I get up- mt emotions stiring my stomach so much I'm dizzy and I'm ANGRY.I knock on the door and ask her to let me in. I need to use the bathroom. I hear scrambling. So I break the door down and she a razor in her hand, very very tiny hairs in the sink and her phone in hand.

I snatch the phone from her and I tell her I know what's going on. She tells me I'm crazy and that I should trust her. She is going apeshit for her phone guys. Eventually I lock myself in the bathroom with her phone and I saw she sent a picture in the outfit I just bought her, to that filth. I then felt a pain unlike any other. I opened the door and there she was. Other than hit her, went hulk on the apparment. I left the house with her phone. I called that son of a bitch. I knew everything about him. I evem had his pictures. I called him and scared the living shit out of him. I was destroyed reddit.

I call my dad. Tell him what happen amd we get all my shit the same day. I kill the cable. Everything. All the while, I found out she did what she did off the notion that I ""cheated"" on her. I went on to post everything she did on her own facebook. Right down the picture she sent. Her friends couldn't believe this. She opposed adultery and spoke down to anyone who did. And here she is being a hypocrite. Soon after, herr girlfriends contact me saying I hit her? Its news to me. Then I see pictures. This girl has brusies everywhere. I'm not surprised. I'm a blackbelt in krav maga an my bones are conditioned to a point where people will hurt themselves trying to hurt me. She bruises easily. But those two together and it looks like I kicked her ass. That same day, tell my dad. He takes me to one of the labs where they can tell if I hit anyone or not. My hands come up good.

Now I give her another chance guys. I'm madly in love with this woman. We are trying it out again. But now, I just don't know. We're now hiding from the world, facebook is gone amy means I had to commuicate with my friends are gone. Its just her. And I don't feel right reddit. Should I have taken her back? Or should I just close this chapter in my life?

 TLDR- A good relationship that's gone south due to imagination and lack of integrity. I've gone to lengths for the woman I love and moved moutains. She made a very bad choice where others would want to leave their significant other IMMEDIATELY. I want to save the relationship. But; is it worth it?"

1mwl8s,0,2013-09-22,Day 8 - Progress Update,[deleted],NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1mwl8s/day_8_progress_update/,"So it's been a week, and I figured I might as well contribute to the community and keep a log of my progress at the same time.

**Why I started nofap:**

Although I was not really a huge porn ""addict"" per se, I definitely did abuse porn and used it unhealthily. I realized that I had gone too far a little while ago when I started having mild ED, even with porn. I wasn't sure if this was because of other reasons (I had a nasty viral infection at the time) or because I went too far with porn (fapping 2-3 daily to alleviate my viral infection symptoms). I knew about nofap but never really took it seriously until this moment. I decided that enough was enough and started out on my nofap journey.

Prior to this, I did not have the best sexual experiences either, and I do believe PMO was the primary cause of this. I was not able to finish with a girl who gave me a BJ, and also did not finish when we had sex. I think I had major, major DE and we just didn't go long enough; I'm attributing this to my constant deathgripping and PMOing.

Furthermore, I had been developing stranger and more extreme porn tastes, and it was getting to the point where ""normal"" porn was nowhere near enough to get me off.

**My Journey Thus Far:**

For me, my goals are no P, no M, no E. Sex is fine; after all, that's one of the main reasons I'm doing this.

I haven't had much difficulty getting this far. There were maybe one or two moments that I wanted to fap, but I told myself there was no point and I'd regret it immediately. I reminded myself of how shitty I feel after fapping. What was keeping me going was the thought of how much better my sex life, and perhaps social life, would be if I stop PMOing. I've been able to last 7 days with this mentality! The only other time I've gone that far was when I was on vacation.

**Effects:**

I haven't experienced any superpowers, but I've become less anxious talking to people in general, and girls in particular. I went out to lunch with one of my female coworkers (we're both interns), and I never was really nervous as I was before. I didn't think about what to say next or about anything sexual with her. I just tried to have a good time, which we did. I don't attribute this entirely to nofap, but it definitely helped me feel more relaxed and not think about everything sexually.

As for my ED, I can't be sure if it's fully cured or not (I'm not going to test it out), but I have been getting morning erections again and they are pretty hard.

Strangely enough, I'm not sure if this is because of lack of exercise (my sickness prevented me from going to the gym for 2-3 weeks) or because of nofap, I haven't been truly hungry in a while. When I see food, and start eating, there is no problem. But in my mind I never get the feeling that ""I'm really hungry right now and could eat a lot."" Has anyone else had this? I'm really curious what's causing this.

Most of all though, I now have extra time and energy that I can expend on other things, and I'm no longer thinking about the next time I can fap.

**Overall:** I expect to reap more benefits the longer I go. I really want to reboot my brain to not rely on porn to get off and to be able to enjoy sex, which before was not that enjoyable because of desensitization. To everyone: keep at it! Have something motivating you, whether it's a girl you like, your problems in the past, or wanting a better life. Every time you think about fapping, think about your motivators and don't fap! Just don't do it; it's not worth it."
1mwkfr,154,2013-09-22,"""I don't mind paying, but I'm going to have to speak to your manager first.""",gh0stfl0wers,TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1mwkfr/i_dont_mind_paying_but_im_going_to_have_to_speak/,"I have been working in restaurants for about 4 years now, and thankfully the customers who make me want to punch them in the face are few and far between. But this just took the cake as the worst customer experience I have had.

I have been working at this particular restaurant on &amp; off since they opened in February 2012, I took a couple breaks in between to go home for the summer or, more recently, because I was doing a 6-month internship abroad. But I love the business and the owners and they value me as a loyal employee who cares, so they are always happy to have me back. It's a hotpot and sushi restaurant. For those of you unfamiliar with the concept of hotpot/shabu: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabu-shabu

This story took place a few weeks after returning from my 6 month break, about 2 months ago. There were a lot of new regulars who I didn't know from before I left, and this is involving one of them. 

A girl walks in and greets my boss in a friendly manner, so I figure she must be a new regular or a friend of his. She asks him if it's okay if her friend orders something at a take-out place a few doors down and eats it outside on our patio with her while she orders some hotpot from us. I find that a little rude to just bring food from somewhere else, but she's a regular and she will still be paying so my boss says it's okay.

I'm already slightly annoyed just because people eating outside is slightly more inconvenient for me, especially when they're eating the hotpot. I have to bring out the burner and dishes (the tables inside are already set with hotplates and dishes so it just gives me a little more work). But it's a nice day, so it's not an unreasonable request. I bring them their waters, set up the table and then as I'm heading out to see if she has any questions or is ready to order, I see that she is on the phone, so I decide to wait until she is done with her conversation. 

10 minutes later she hangs up. I notice she hasn't even touched the menu yet, but since she's a regular she might just already know exactly what she wants. So I head outside to take her order. She says (with an impatient undertone as if she had been waiting for ages) she will have the vegetarian combo with brown rice and our vegetable broth. And could I please put up an umbrella, the sun is in her eyes. 

Not a totally unreasonable request either. The sun does get at an inconvenient angle in the evening. But you could tell that it was going to disappear behind the buildings in about 5 minutes. I was a little annoyed that she couldn't just stick it out until then, but whatever, not an unreasonable request, I'll do it. 

I bring out the food and everything is going well, except for that slightly bitchy and impatient undertone I keep getting from her. I boss and I inside laugh when both she and her friend start taking selfies. Seriously, for about 10 minutes neither of them were eating, they were just taking selfies. Usually if I see a table taking pictures I will offer to take one with everyone in it, looking back that would have been hilarious (and obviously rude) to put them on the spot like that. 

At the end of the meal I bring the check after asking if they want any dessert. When I swing around to pick it up again is when the fun starts to happen.

""I'm sorry miss, but I come here all the time and order the same thing all the time but it's usually only around $14, I don't understand how this got up to 19$.""

I have a look at the check to see if maybe I punched in something wrong. Nope, everything is right. The vegetarian combo is on there, theres $1 extra charge for the brown rice, and the broth is on there as well. Plus tax, everything adds up fine, I didn't do anything wrong. I remember getting an email from my boss while I was gone (it was a group email to all of the staff, and I was still on the mailing list), that some of the prices had changed. I point this out to her and ask when the last time was she had come here. Nope, it was already after the price changes so that can't be it. I go in to bring her a menu so she can verify the prices. I point out what she ordered, and where it states the extra charge for brown rice. I explain that what might have happened is that others may have forgotten to punch in the broth or the extra charge for brown rice, and also that our lunch dishes are cheaper (and significantly smaller) than the dinner portions, so this might explain the price difference. 

""Okay, I don't have a problem paying for this, I just want to speak to your manager first.""

Sigh.... I send out my manager. He again points out the prices, says that her previous servers might have made a mistake when punching in the order, but that the way it is on the bill is the way that it usually is. Because he doesn't want a pissed off customer raging on Yelp, he tells her he will take off the broth for her, so she will only have to pay for the combo and the brown rice. 

She finally pays for her fucking meal and leaves without tipping. Which is totally fine, I don't want her money anyway. But man, that was the angriest I have ever been with a customer. And even though this was already 2 months ago it still pisses me off. 

Turns out, she never actually paid for her own meals, she usually has her guy friend do that for her. So how would she know how much it costs? And my bosses were annoyed with her already because she always complains about something when she comes there to eat. So they agreed that the next time she comes in, they will bring her the check right after she orders and before her food is brought out, just to make sure everyone is on the same page of how much it is going to cost. She hasn't been back since."
1mwkfn,6,2013-09-22,"24 Years Old, Seeking Advice About Executing my FI Plan",Canescans,financialindependence,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1mwkfn/24_years_old_seeking_advice_about_executing_my_fi/,"Hey Everyone. Thanks for posting in this sub - I've learned a tremendous amount. I thought that I'd post about my situation and ask for some advice/comments/critiques about where I'm going.

A little background on me:

I'm 24 years old. I graduated from top college a few years ago with a very high GPA but two useless liberal arts degrees. Stupidly, I thought more school would solve all my problems so I took a year off and did nothing while I applied to grad school.I was in graduate school for a few months - but after calculating the substantial inputs and the net present value of not being able to earn any money and going into debt, I dropped out. It was a very stressful environment with very uncertain employment prospects. The profession I was going to enter changed substantially during the financial crisis and I couldn't get my head out of the sand. 

In some ways, I've gotten pretty lucky - as my biggest hobby since I was a kid has been investing. In the past three years since I've managed my own money, I have been able to increase my portfolio from 18k to 57k while taking on less risk than the market (through arbitrage and other special situations investing, stub stocks, and good ol' Value Investing). In the average week I probably read between 20 and 30 corporate reports.

I am attempting to reach 100k in that portfolio in the next two years, a number which I view as being able to provide me with much more flexibility and the ability to reach ""escape velocity."" I also have about 70K left over from my educational account (I received some scholarships and attended an undergraduate school in state). 

If I kept going to graduate school I would have run through that and ended up in six figures of debt before getting out. After seeing through the creative statistics my program's administrators used, I found the average salary for graduates was $60,000 - a great salary, just not one that justifies several years of schooling and hundreds of thousands of dollars.   

All in I currently have:
57K in a brokerage account (individual stocks, arbitrage situations etc)
70K in an educational account
~10K in other assets (including some precious metals from when I collected coins as a kid, cash, a few other things) 

I moved back home after dropping out and tried to get a job in finance. I don't live on the east coast (and don't want to move). Of course the finance job market is tough right now. Especially in a non target area and especially if you don't have the degrees, internships or the network. I was a little naive when I saw friends who were 4~8 years older with liberal arts degrees in great jobs at banks, I think those days are gone. 

I was not successful for almost 10 months until I got an internship at a small firm that does company research. It is unpaid currently. They are likely to give me a job offer in one more month - but frankly I don't know how long this firm will stay afloat. If they try to delay me longer, I am going to leave. Unpaid internships are dehumanizing. 

I also don't know if I really want to work with the people and given how the treat other employees and interns, I doubt that they will provide any benefits. It's kind of dodgy all around. I also don't like the intellectual dishonesty that comes with the ""organized"" side of the finance industry. 

I am not without any income however. I currently am on track to make around $20~25k this year writing about stocks for a large website. Aside from that I have no sources of income outside of investing. I currently live at home. 

I am attempting to create sources of passive income that are not related to the stock market - which will enable me to be in a better place mentally as I make investing decisions and to ride out the fluctuations which will inevitably come in the future. My next step is that I want to get into real estate, and even though I hate to rush into anything - I am beginning to become worried that people from my generation may not have the chance to own their own homes after this low rate environment abates. I want to diversify my assets into real property and I also want to move out and have a life. 

I have found some houses near a well established college which are selling for between 200K and 350k - they are 2 or 3 bedrooms. I believe that purchasing houses near colleges is a good investment as their value is somewhat protected by the students attending. My plan is to liquidate the money in my education account, pay the penalty, and use the remainder as a down payment (either 20% or 30%). All of the properties I am looking at will be cash flow positive. The mortgage plus property taxes will be around ~1200 dollars a month, which I believe I can cover on my own. I want to live in one room and rent the other(s) to reduce the out of pocket costs to me by half or even two thirds. 

I am waiting for this internship to finish and then I am going to try to pursue other job opportunities. My dream is to get a job that pays between ~40K and 60K a year with decent hours and low stress. I believe this is necessary to provide me with a much more regular stream of income from which I can obtain a mortgage loan. 

I've spoken with my parents and they can't understand why I'd want to get a job not related to finance - in their view getting paid half as much with no benefits in a ""career"" is better than the alternative. This would be right if my goal was a career in Finance, but right now I am primarily concerned with achieving FI. I'm not the kind of person that needs a prestigious sounding career. I know a lot of bankers and lawyers in major metropolitan areas in huge amounts of debt and living paycheck to paycheck. 

I sort of fell into finance writing and now that I have found there is an audience for my work, I want to take it one step further. I am figuring out how to build out a website for my stock analysis - even though I write for a very well regarded website and have a decent sized following - I don't like the idea of being at the mercy of editors (who often times lack a nuanced understanding of businesses).

Ideally I'd have a page with resources and books on investing to get affiliate marketing dollars, advertising dollars and then potentially publish a subscription based newsletter. If I can offer a subscription based newsletter published quarterly for $100 dollars a year I'm going to be looking at some pretty significant income.

What I have learned from my internship is that large firms pay a huge amount (mid five to mid six figures a year) for research of only decent quality. 

In the near term I think I'm going to take the following steps:

1. Keep interning while looking for a job. If they offer me a job I feel I have to accept the offer - I believe that the salary will be between 24k and 36k a year with no benefits. If the contract is for a year though I will have to seriously think about it as I can spend that time writing and working a minimum wage job as a dishwasher or a bartender and make more money with less stress. 

2. Building out my website and seeking other sources of passive income. 

3. Once I have a job and the pay stubs, I'm going to get pre-approved for a mortgage. 

4. Buy a house and move out.

Any advice from people my age or in my position is much appreciated. Particularly about real estate and how to find a low stress job.

Long story short, my best friends have been distant lately. I found out that it's in part because of my professional successes. My two friends have had a hard time since graduating college. One friend applied to grad school, didn't get in, and continues working a low-paying part time job. The other doesn't know what she wants to do with her life (which is normal of course for a 22 year old). Meanwhile, I have gotten lots of internships, got into grad school, and recently got a new job. It doesn't help that my new job is in my other friend's field of choice (she works with kids in an after school program, and I now teach elementary school science). 


I can understand that it doesn't feel good to hear about other people's success when you're feeling down. But of course when something good happens in my life, the first people I want to tell are my best friends! I don't brag or anything, but of course I am excited about my new job and grad school. 



I am posing a question to your guys: What would a ""good"" friend do in this case? Cover up your success to make others feel better? I understand the difference between going on and on about it, and just stating facts, but I don't think I was bragging in this case with my friends. 

**tl/dr: Should you cover up news about your professional successes to make your less successful friends feel better?**"

(Minor Rant lol)",WantACareer,UKJobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKJobs/comments/1mwc0a/okay_so_this_is_getting_a_little_frustrating/,"I graduated in 2012 having studied Banking and Finance, where I received a 1st with honors, I'm also well rounded, having headed and been a member of quite a few societies.

Alongside this, I have had 3 internships in tier 1 financial institutions, I was accepted to go through to a graduate scheme with one company, but I became VERY ill (hospital for 2 months).
The firm decided to drop me from the graduate programme.

I have been job hunting for about a year now and it has been relatively fruitless and pretty frustrating.

If I happen to get an interview, the majority of places I have interviewed give me little to no feedback, either saying, ""You came across very good, but we found someone better suited to out requirements"" or ""We have chosen to hire internally"".

Without any feedback, I don't know what to improve on and I'm really unaware as to what to do.

When someone says that, I'm good, but they've found someone slightly better, are they saying just that or, are they shying away from giving me any notable feedback?

Help?"

Spent a year or so after a year of internship trying to kill myself (got diagnosed with borderline personality disorder), then started school again this year, in a new major within my program. Hence, I am back in my 3rd year of school.

**Why do you have a crush on her?***

She is breathtakingly beautiful - that's the main thing. She's also neat as a person, in the sense that she is involved in this one pretty cool club (women only, geared at recruiting more women for our program), and has some interesting views on stuff like feminism, etc. that are a new perspective to me. 

**Should we know anything else?**

I am in a group of 5, including her, that is working on a semester long project. Oh also, I made her laugh a lot.

**What have you done so far?**

I created a secret gmail account and emailed her, letting her know that I have a crush on her, but because I am ugly and not someone she would go for a whole bunch of other reasons (the biggest one being that I am a different race from her), I'd like to pretend to be platonic in real life, but then perhaps attempt to get to know her a little bit through email - i.e. ask her the questions I want to ask her (""what do you think about X? what's life like with all the things you participate in? blah blah"") which will help me flesh her out as a person from behind the safety of anonymity, and thus continue to daydream for a while before finally forgetting about her...

**What happened then?**

She never responded. Then I sent her a whole bunch of messages like: ""was that really creepy to do?"". It was pathetic.

**So what do you want to do now?**

I want to message her on facebook, and say ""hi AlphaBetty"". Then ask her what she thinks of me, and then finally admit to being her secret admirer.

**What do you think will happen if you do that?**

She'll be creeped out, and everything will become awkward, and she'll tell everyone, and everyone will look at me weird. Then the police will arrest me for stalking her.

**Do you care that things might become awkward?**

I have begun to care a lot less about a lot of things, and with regards to some things, I don't even know if I should care. Should I care that things might become awkward? I don't know...

**What do you want from us?**

Dissuade me. Persuade me. Give me advice. 

**tl;dr**

I have a crush on a pretty girl. I don't know whether I should admit I have a crush, but for some reason I sometimes really want to tell her that. I am a borderline personality disorder person so I can't really trust myself - I am prone to being intense, and I am in a group project with her."
1mw1kq,263,2013-09-22,"The wrong parent died: Mum's dead, my Dad scarred me and almost destroyed my house, and my boyfriend left me. I need to talk.",stuckhere_throwaway,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1mw1kq/the_wrong_parent_died_mums_dead_my_dad_scarred_me/,"Me: 28, Dad: 70, Ex: 32

In 2007, my mum died from cancer. I saw the whole thing- her eyes rolled back and her tongue protruded, Dad standing next to me in shock, the nurses hovering intently over her hospital bed, the foamy red stuff pouring out her nostrils. I was 21. I replay that scene over and over in my head. It's still vivid.

I was devastated and needed to grieve. My Dad said that if I moved back to my hometown, he'd take care of me while I recovered. So I did. I left my friends and my big city dreams and moved back home. She had left her house to me in the will, so I moved in. Dad was living in a retirement village at the time and seemed very depressed and alone, so I told him to move in with me.

That was a huge mistake.

I ended up being the one to take care of him. If I was crying, he'd ignore me. If I told him I was depressed, he'd change the subject. He sat around in his boxers with his balls hanging out in the loungeroom while I was stuck in my bedroom f5ing 4chan all day. No hugs. No ""are you okay""s. No talking or caring or support. My friends were all in a different city, so I was alone. Sometimes I'd go days on end without being spoken to. I sung to myself a lot just so I could speak. 

Dad sat around watching war documentaries on TV while I cooked and cleaned. He soon started to hoard (I believe this comes from being raised by depression-era parents- when you're poor, you can't afford to throw anything out). The humble little house that Mum had given to me became clogged with his junk and empty boxes. Every time I cleaned, he'd fill the space with more junk. 

I made a huge effort to take care of him- did all the chores, took him out of the house on trips, bought him expensive presents that would end up cast aside and covered in dust. I put my life on hold, turned down job and travel opportunities so I could stay home and take care of him. But he never took care of me. If I talked about going overseas, he'd get upset and say that it was dangerous and I should just stay home with him. He wanted me to stay trapped with him forever, the same thing he had done to Mum when she was trying to leave him way back in 1996.

In 2008, in a fit of grief, loneliness, and depression, I took a bunch of pills in the hopes that I would die. About an hour later, I got stabbing pains in my stomach. It really hurt and I was scared that instead of dying I'd be left with internal injuries, so I drove up to the hospital where they induced vomiting. I stayed in overnight. Dad was called the next day to pick me up. I told him I'd tried to kill myself and I felt so sad and worthless that I desperately wanted to die. He told me about the new brand of dog food he'd purchased from the shops.

It became a pattern. I told him I'd gotten into uni, he'd nod and continue watching TV. I told him I was depressed, he just stood there making a sandwich and talking about peanut butter. I told him I had an internship at a major newspaper, he said ""oh"" and continued fussing over our dogs.

I couldn't bring people over to my house because it was so messy and he was always walking around half-naked. He swears a lot and says a lot of hateful things, the sort of stuff you hear on talkback radio. He never has anything nice to say, never takes an interest in anyone else's life. I tried to confront him about it, I told him how much it broke my heart that he ignored me when I tried to tell him about my accomplishments or problems, especially when I was relying on him to help me get back on my feet after Mum's death. He shrugged and said ""oh well"".

His hoarding and bad attitude became too much for me, and I had to move out of my own home. He didn't seem to care. He'd send me text messages saying he loved me occasionally. I understand that it's hard for old guys to express their emotions, but you don't ignore your daughter when she's begging for help. My cousins were outraged that I had been forced out of my own house. I couldn't have been happier- I was no longer anxious about coming home from a happy day at work only to be destroyed by him ignoring me and walking around muttering hateful things about women and black people. 

However, the condition of the house worsened with his hoarding. He stayed in the house guiltfree because, according to my cousins, he believed that I was just going through a phase and I would soon be back to dedicate my life to taking care of him. It was heartbreaking seeing my beloved mother's house get turned into a dump by that brute. He destroyed her with his hate and viciousness, destroyed their marriage. Although after her death he talked about how happy they were together, as though he'd never turned a gun on her or prevented her from seeing her family/friends so he could control her. He never loved her as much as he did after she was dead.

Thankfully my cousins spent a lot of time speaking to him and helped him move into a retirement village again, where he gets his own apartment and is free to live his life. He is not happy about it and often comes over to my house unannounced just to hang around with the dogs... for six hours. I came back to my home and spent days clearing out an estimated 15 square metres of junk. 

Dad was not the only broken bird I was trying to look after during that time. At the same time, I was in a 4 year relationship with a man who, despite being 32, had never had a decent job and was unemployed for our entire relationship. I paid for everything, I helped him apply for university courses he never stuck with, I drove us everywhere. He had depression - as do I - but refused to see a psych about it. He got upset with me a lot because ""I can't just get a job like you okay, I have actual depression, the fact that you can get out of bed in the morning means you don't have depression after all"" when all I had asked him to do was pay for his share of a meal. It wasn't emotional blackmail- he truly believed what he was saying. 

Last month, he dumped me because he basically didn't have the energy to maintain our relationship. He spends all day in bed, lives on welfare with his mother, and expects other people to pay for him all the time. I went out of my way to make his birthdays and Christmases special, he'd say ""thanks"" and would never reciprocate. I was so lonely, and despite his flaws, I could talk to him about my life and feel validated. I guess you accept the love you think you deserve.

So now I'm alone, desperately missing my hopeless ex, desperately feeling invalidated. For you see, I grew up well below the poverty line. (Dad worked but he wouldn't give us any of his earnings. We piled clothes on top of us for blankets and our dinners came out of cans.)

Both my ex and my father, the two people who were supposed to love and support me the most, relied on me to baby them and would get angry when I challenged them about this task. I feel betrayed by the people I love. Now I have no one close to me that I can turn to, no one who is interested in my life or who will give me hugs. I know at 28 I should be over the need to feel a parent's love, but I'm not. The support and unconditional love of someone who cares about you is something I crave so badly. There's no one who's proud of me, no one who wants to talk to me about my problems, no one who cares whether I live or die. I feel so sad."
1mw1cv,2,2013-09-22,In Need Of Advice,partymixaddict,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1mw1cv/in_need_of_advice/,"I'm 19, young, and stupid.

I had depression that lasted for a year when I was 16, it came back about 10 months ago. I've done my best to seek help, through my university's councilling service and through similar groups. I've been on about 6 different meds, and am on two at the moment, and not a single one of them has worked for me - I get all of the side effects (including a seizure in one case) with none of the positives. My councilling has hit a dead end, and is likely to stop in a month when university closes up for summer.

My degree puts me under a lot of pressure, and most days I can't muster any of the love I had for the subject when I enrolled. I'm only halfway through my degree. Part of the requirements for that degree is that students must get a certain amount of work experience (two summers worth) - the internship programme I've been with all year has turned into a dead-end, and I have no idea what the fuck I'm going to do with myself over Summer. At this point I expect I will probably kill myself in the near future.

I just wanted to ask people who feel like me if there's any other way out of this mess. I'm sick of myself. The only thing that keeps me going is an unwillingness to hurt my friends and family but that's a really shitty reason to live. And I'm struggling to hold onto even that. The thought that keeps going round my head is that godawful statistic about depression relapse - it gets more likely the more often it's happened. I don't want to dig myself out of this hole just to fall in again. No amount of happiness is worth this.

TL;DR : Is there hope outside suicide? I'm doubtful but willing to have my opinion changed."

Why do they use Poser over the industry standards of Maya and 3DS Max other than for sponsorship reasons.

 Maya: they are catered to bigger studios.
it is more bare bone. Complicated things don’t come into play with the smaller application.
It has more of a Gorilla tactic towards animation. 

What's next for the animation team? Is it RWBY from now on or are there other projects in the pipeline?

A lot are on contract for season one. Some projects need a large team of animators. Do not know what is next. No promises. 
It is more of a project to project basis. 

What is the normal day in the office like?

Nerf darts. Very long, Extra hours. Everyone kinda doing their job. Rec\view days. Make sure everything is working since there are Different methods for anyone who is animating. 


How long does it take to make an episode. 

	Depends on how long it is. 
	

 
Why bi-weekly. 

It is what they know. Shorter and more often. Some spit cause they 

Who did the original concept art for the characters and comes up with ideas for Visuals and weapons? Monty, somebody else, or is it a collaborative effort?

Shane and monty. Tilean *Spellling* Cad - monsters

Game industry vs animation

	Games a lot longer. Really invest it. Very dependent on other people. Just because you are good doesn’t mean it will. Games have technical restrictions. Only have 16 frames that have to work as attack jump DJ aoe. All that animation in that slot that works. It will cycle.  Takes a lot of work. If you animate the camera, you can really polish what you will see. 

What kind of artist do you guys look up to or inspire you? 

	Mark histler. Cameron building demo reel. Turomk stuff. Blue skyand stuff.
joe worked on the origanal ninja turtles. 
Monty. Animation

Second season of ruby?

	*Insert Grunt here* Fingers crossed

When first starting out the animation, was there much of a time constraint, having the first episode being shown at RTX

	Time is still strenuous to where we meet a week to week deadline. Cleaned up episode one since there is now time. 

When first asked to help out with this show, what was your initial reaction?

	Yes. Everyone wanted to jump on board. Some were working on a Demo reel. Some were not told about it. didn’t even know RWBY to start. A specific animator walked in late and she found out she was working on a show she didn’t know about. 


What are some lessons/tricks you have learned while working on the show?

	Don’t be afraid to try new things. Just throw art on to the screen. Just put poses on the screen. Just work it out. Monty keeps using the same animations over and over and no one has noticed yet because he always uses it from a different angle and tweaks it a little bit. 

As Monty has said before, Battle has a certain Rhythm that the mind will accept. How much of that goes into the thought process while animating any sort of confrontation?

Not as much. If combat has a rhythm that the mind accepts while it’s on screen. The impacts are important parts. Not much time for the sound. Petty important. 

What mistakes have you learned from. 

	Always plan for more. When he was making the first trailer, did not see it to be as popular. Did not really communicate it was a smaller project. Saving projects. INCREMENTAL SAVES! Keep building your portfolio. Try and know what you are going after. If your reel is directionless then it can confuse employers. 

Did you ever try and camio yourself in any of the episodes. 

	No, not really. 

What was it like when you were first starting out

	Never give up. You won’t get a lot of feed back in the beginning. People were very non-responding. Keep the recourses online. Update stuff all the time. No one is guiding anyone. Everyone in the room is your biggest asset. (Classroom or workplace)

Inspiration for weapons. 

Basically, what they all said was JOHN is Not cool

Were any scenes Mocaped?

Scenes are a combination of mocap and keyframe. Blend a lot of the stuff. 


Negitive criticism? 

Brush past it and keep doing what you are doing. 

When you were first learning to animate, what were some of the obstacles you faced, and how did you overcome them?

Monty: started now. Tech would be farther ahead. Just start now and live with a stamp of tech. 
A lot of doubt and fear to apply and show work just in case you suck. Just do it and do what you can and put it out there. The part where people fail is where they are told they arn’t good and don’t want to push forward. Finish things. Don’t just noodle. 



Are there any moments in your career you would have done differently, if you could revisit them?

	Monty is Perfect. (no)

What do you use for your audio. 

	Goals. Real life action feature. Learn how to take short cuts. Premier. Up to 100 tracks. Sometimes over. Multiple clips for just weapon transformation. 
Rubys scyth. 7 tracks? Exporting to mixhouse. Sends prtools project off to our mix house. 

How much in house recording for sound effects do you use. 

	Mostly stock. We do some custom recording.

What numbers are you generating from the series.

	They are pretty high. Does not keep track but everyone is happy with the numbers. 

	How many episodes are in the first season?

16 episodes. 

Creature design inspiration.

	Bear type creature. –type creatures. Written into script. There is a certain color 

Poly count for a character. 

		 The poly count was not kept track of. Tried to keep it low. Between 8 and 12K

Why do you black out the majority of people in the show? Is this to keep people focused on the story or time constraints? 

	Do not want to fill a bunch of characters that are not important and keeps people to a story. It is just the typical anime style. Sometimes we use a mixture of 2D and 3D.  tons of 2D stuff that they can’t do. It is what it is.

When season 2 comes around. Do you plan to keep the short format. 

	Would prefer to go longer, but It could be a format thing or it could be a promotional thing. How well can you sell it and who you are working along side.	

	Where would you suggest a student to apply for internships as far as animation and what position would you suggest. 

	The best experience is real experience. Being at obsidian showed an animator how much you need to complete in a day. You do not know how much is required until you actually get there. 

2D animation or keep 3d?

	2D is expensive. We have a short Time frame. People are talking to Monty wanting to learn from him. The turn around on 3d is a lot quicker, so you can then bounce ideas off each other. 

	
How/Why did you want to become an animator?

One animator answered tha she loved Disney movies and wanted to do that when she got to school. When it got hard, it hated her. 

Question for monty: Do you feel your work animating RvB for Three seasons help you in getting RWBY animation off the ground?

	Yes. Not just the library of animations. A matter  of a sense of story telling. A steady climb moving into his own animation style. 

RWBY Game?

As far as entertaining the idea of a fighting game, Monty said He knows the stats of the characters so It would translate very well, but there is no plan to make one right now. 

RWBY movie?

	An OBA movie would be great if you were to stitch all the episodes together.  

Characters first or the story first? 

	If you get the Right characters, the story will write itself. 

How much did the map and environment play on the characters? 

	A lot and a little. In season one, they are only touching on one city. Future seasons will want to explore more of the world. Seeing more Cultural diversity. Establishing the world map and saying these areas are in these places. Geography determines culture and people. A lot of fun can be had exploring the world. 





When you are just having a bad day and need to take a step away from it all, how do you blow off steam?

By playing Dive kick. 
Keep it light hearted. You also need Chicken wings in the kitchen. 




Why an anime style feel? Was there any other style up for consideration?

It is Natural for Monty. They like anime and it is easy to do. It is an Easier rendering. It has More of a Flat color.

	A lot and a little. In season one, they are only touching on one city. Future seasons will want to explore more of the world. Seeing more Cultural diversity. Establishing the world map and saying these areas are in these places. Geography determines culture and people. A lot of fun can be had exploring the world. 





When you are just having a bad day and need to take a step away from it all, how do you blow off steam?
By playing Dive kick. 
Keep it light hearted. You also need Chicken wings in the kitchen. 




Why an anime style feel? Was there any other style up for consideration?
		It is Natural for Monty. They like anime and it is easy to do. It is an Easier rendering. It has More of a Flat color.

1mvts7,30,2013-09-22,My story with Mary Jane.,Danda16,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/1mvts7/my_story_with_mary_jane/,"My story starts off when I was in high school and I saw the image of smoking to be an attractive thing. I remember smoking from makeshift pipes of whatever my best friend and I could get our hands on. Smoking whatever weed we could find. The start of senior year I was that typical stoner who would always smoke for the social scene and ditch classes to rip a bong at a friend's apartment. Everyday after school my friend and I would drive over to these guy's house to smoke. We would make frequent trips to get fast food, hackysack, play CoD, smoke prime times. We would do this for hours.
As fun as that sounds- I was unhealthy. I was overweight. I was insecure. I suffered from depression and anxiety- took medication for both. Life was mostly grey.
Anyways, I had always loved my time spent in the mountains (I'm from Colorado). I randomly decided to apply for an internship of a teaching job up near Mt. Evans. A lab school for 6th graders. I got the job and enjoyed my time up there. I would drive home for the weekend and would meet up with friends to smoke. Soon enough though my emotions got in the way of work. I would have occasional anxiety attacks and have weekly breakdowns. For a professional job working with young kids, my behavior was inappropriate. My bosses sat me down and said I need to shape up or my time there might be up.
Over the course of that weekend, with the positive influence of Mary Jane, I pulled my shit together. It was an epiphany moment where color started to shine through areas once of grey. I stopped taking my antidepressants, started to exercise and eat healthy. All while controlling and keeping my emotions positive. 
During that weekend, I also learned how to control my high. Almost every time I smoked I would go on a run or clean my house. I found music that defined me. (Dead head over here.) While staying on top of my school work.
I ended up graduating high school and the internship program with flying colors. I lost a fair amount of weight. I was happy. And I still loved marijuana just as much.
This past summer I flew out to Vermont to work at a Girl Scout Camp where I sobered up for 3 months. They were wonderful months in which I learned a ton about myself while not being high.

But here I am, back in Colorado, at college. Everyday I will walk to a small nearby forest where I set up a small picnic, layout some studying material, and might open a book. All while taking a couple hits off of Tulip- my pipe. 
I'm happy. I have no complaints in life. I cannot wait to see what else it has to offer. I love trees. So much.

Sincerely, a slightly high colorado girl. [5]

If you made it to the end- thank you. :)"

**716** keepers of the forest for **4 years!**

Since 1988, [*My Neighbor Totoro*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096283/) has been a part of Japanese Culture as one of Studio Ghibli's earlier releases. This film has had such a huge impact on Japanese culture that a [replica house](http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7296/9452641393_dcd2fcacf7_z.jpg) was built for the World's Fair back in 2005! Totoro the character, has had quite the influence in modern society as well. How about that little [cameo in Toy Story 3](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/bf/ToyStory3Totoro.png), or the myriad of cross over artwork that has been done?

After finding /r/totoro, I quickly immersed myself in all that is the [fluffy](http://imgur.com/r/gifs/Y7LJy), gray, forest spirit. The community is full of friendly, kind, and very creative people. It is a veritable one stop shop for all of your Totoro needs! Looking for something? Chances are that someone knows where to get it, [how to make it](http://www.reddit.com/r/totoro/comments/1iu5x9/i_made_a_pair_of_totoro_shoes/cb8ejwf), or might offer an [alternate site](http://www.reddit.com/r/totoro/comments/1m4rwg/i_want_one_of_these_so_bad_but_i_cannot_find_a/cc5v766) to purchase it. 

As with many things that have gained popularity in today's internet fueled age, *My Neighbor Totoro* had rather humble beginnings. In fact, the movie flopped at first. ""Back then,"" explains its producer on the film's Blu-ray, ""a story without a hero or a girl with superheroes and the ordinary Japanese scenery wasn’t entertaining enough."" I can see that. I am glad that it's popularity has increased greatly though to brings us to an era where we have [Totoro beds](http://imgur.com/Fse3eQc), [cats being transformed into Totoros](http://www.dramafever.com/news/cat-magically-transforms-into-totoro/) (or into a [catbus](http://i.imgur.com/Qbi1V4q.jpg) for that matter), and a plethora of fan art and crafts. 

There is also a darker side of Totoro too. A glance around the Googles will quickly show you there is a whole world dedicated to Totoro, [God of Death](http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/17szgemfc5ovujpg/original.jpg).  [Here](http://kotaku.com/5926248/totoro-isnt-all-cute-for-some-hes-the-god-of-death) is an interesting article from Kotaku, and [one](http://ihogeek.com/2012/04/10/two-new-ways-to-watch-totoro-you-wont-like-either-one-part-one/) from the International House of Geek.

I managed to get these forest spirits to appear so that I could ask them a few questions.

&gt;##1. Please tell us a little about yourselves.
&gt;&gt; **/u/nebulawanderer**: We are the spirits of the forest. We come from all around the world, bringing joy and living as free as the wind.

&gt;##2. How did you get involved with /r/totoro?
&gt;&gt; **nebulawnaderer**:This place was barren when I found it... abandoned by the previous inhabitants who moved on to their next phase. We started hanging around our own ornaments and christmas lights to make the place our own... people started to come and visit us. Many stayed for awhile because they liked how friendly and cuddly we all were.

&gt;&gt;**/u/Errol**: I personally found it when the number of subscribers was under 10. I thought that was a travesty and immediately joined.

&gt;&gt;**nebulawanderer**: Oh and errol made our squishy snootoro for the header, and all the sprites for our flair after signing on as a mod! It took us about a month to reach 100 subscribers, and with errol on graphics that started to climb even more! :D

&gt;##3. What is your favorite post from /r/totoro?
&gt;&gt;**nebulawanderer**: Personally, I really enjoy seeing the crafts our forest spirits make: plushies, cakes, songs, shoes... you name it. I guess my favorite one was this [one](http://www.reddit.com/r/totoro/comments/1hmug3/just_found_this_sub_heres_a_totoro_plush_i_made/) by /u/seriffim. Just look at that face!

&gt;##4. What is your favorite aspect of the /r/totoro community?
&gt;&gt;**nebulawanderer**:I guess it relates back to #3, I really like how inspired our community is to create things in their world.

&gt;##5. What are your thoughts on the news that Hayao Miyazaki is retiring?
&gt;&gt; **nebulawanderer**: We haven't discussed that amongst the totoros. But I personally am excited for Miyazaki. He's given us such a wealth of great films in a single lifetime, more than one could ever dream of creating. It's great to imagine him celebrating with a giant catbus cake.

&gt;##6. Who (or what) is your favorite character from the movie?
&gt;&gt; **nebulawanderer**: Oh, that's a tough one! We spirits are too capricious to decide such things. And forgetful... and hmm..

&gt;##7. How do you feel about the darker side of Totoro?
&gt;&gt;**nebulawanderer**: Well, hmmm... I don't think many of us are into conspiracies but this one certainly drives new forest spirits to our subreddit.
I think it's curious that there are those with such creativity to share a tale of the ""darker side of Totoro,"" giving him a strange role and so on. Miyazaki has spoken outwardly about the story being inspired by his own childhood. Even the house is designed from memories of his young life.

&gt;##8. Where would you like to see this subreddit go?
&gt;&gt; **nebulawanderer**:Interesting, never thought to take it anywhere. I guess the [Miyazakitopia](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ochre_jelly/sets/72157625146626306/) would be fun.

&gt;##9. Anything you would like to say to the subscribers of /r/totoro or reddit?
&gt;&gt;**nebulawanderer**: Wow, I just want to say thank you for existing! It's great being able to see, meet and know many of you, even if only virtually. All good wishes to everyone!

I am /u/NeonGreenTiger and am one of the Interns here at /r/SubRedditOfTheDay. I've been around reddit for a bit, but have recently changed over to this screen name. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask!"
1mvnu1,10,2013-09-22,"Had a rough night at work, had a breakdown, then had to deal with insensitive parents and brokedown even further. Could use another perspective or just some comfort.",HermitTheBrah_Here,ftm,https://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/comments/1mvnu1/had_a_rough_night_at_work_had_a_breakdown_then/,"Hey guys, 
So at work tonight, 2 of the cooks treated me very disrespectfully. They threw food at me, and when I asked them to explain in words why they were mad, and not throw things at me, they yelled at me and told me to shut up. Two of my other coworkers saw this and felt it was wrong enough that they called the owner and complained. The trouble is the 2 cooks who mistreated me are the brother and cousin of the owner. So I talked to the owner on the phone eventually and by that point I was crying. He told me to go home, he apologized profusely, and said he would talk with the cooks in the morning. 

So I come home totally distraught and explain the situations to my parents. (Both of them know that I'm transitioning). My Dad kept trying to solve the problem and I told him all I wanted was some comfort and them to tell me everything would be alright. He kept on trying to fix it, and then told me to calm down. I lost it a little bit and yelled at them to not tell me to calm down, then I recovered a bit and and told them that I would rather not keep talking about it, and would like to go to my room to relax. 

I went to my room and my Dad came in a minute later and started telling me that I was being disrespectful yelling at them. I was completely taken aback and said that all I was trying to do was vent and that they weren't being very helpful. He keeps digging on me telling me that I'm being rude and overreacting. I keep telling him that I'm working 50-60 hours/week (between school, work, an internship, and being involved in organizations) and I'm transitioning, so of course I'm stressed out. And I definitely don't need them digging on me. I just need someone to tell me that the situation sucked and everything will be ok. But they keep at it. So I snap and yell at my Dad asking if he doesn't think I'm doing enough in my life and and that he doesn't support me in my transition as well as he should. It was a low blow, but by this point, I'm overworked I already had people yelling at me, and now I have insensitive parents telling me I'm over-exaggerating and being rude to them.  

I just absolutely broke down. I am so heartbroken right now. My Mom recovered a bit and THEN started comforting me, and talked me down for like 20 minutes. I ended up apologizing profusely for being rude (even though I honestly don't think I was being that rude). I am in a very emotionally vulnerable state and couldn't even turn to my parents for comfort. 

I'm doing my best to relax and work it off, but to be honest I don't think living at home is working out for me anymore. (I'm 22, for reference). Besides being emotionally unavailable, my Dad has been semi-financially supportive. He allows me to live at home rent-free, pays for school, and sometimes pay for my books. Everything else, I pay for. Food, clothes, phone, gas, hanging out with friends, counseling, and medical co-pays. I'm ok with supporting myself in these ways, in fact I quite like working and being busy. However, being pre-med (I plan on applying to medical school next year), and transitioning is (I think) draining me too much right now. 

I have incredibly supportive grandparents who offer many a times to support me in whatever way I need, they especially put an emphasis on financially. They've been supporting my brother with $2,000 a month for the last year, but recently cut him off because he was using them, refused to get a job, and got another DUI. Do you think it would be too exaggerated of me to quit my job and ask my grandparents to help support me for $1400 a month (that's about what I make working), and if my Dad gets mad and says I shouldn't ask them for money (he's very adamant that I keep my job[even though I've been working since I was 15 and have struggled since then with work and going to school full-time plus all my extra-curriculars). I'm pretty sure my Dad won't approve of this idea, and if he really protests, then do you think if it's a good idea that I move out and ask my grandparents for $2000 a month so I can pay for rent too. 

What are your thoughts? I'm a very independent person and asking people to support me is very hard. I would much rather work and support myself fully if I could. But I really want to go to medical school and be a Doctor, so I have to take on a huge workload school-wise. Is it that far of a reach for me ask for my grandparents to help support me? I'm really conflicted. Sorry for the long post, but I wanted to make sure I got a sufficient summary of my dilemma. "
1mvk6q,2,2013-09-21,Experience/ Cool Opportunities vs. Time Spent in School,daltontogreen,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1mvk6q/experience_cool_opportunities_vs_time_spent_in/,"Hey everyone,

I'm usually the one giving advice on here, but I'd love to hear some feedback on my ""situation"". I put it in quotes because it's a pretty great situation to be dealing with. Anyway this might be a bit lengthy so bear with me.

I entered Penn as a freshman in 2010, planning to studying Bioengineering. I loved the field, but I felt I wasn't gaining any real technical skills (except matlab, I was getting pretty handy with it). So after my freshman year, I decided to take a programming course to see if I liked it. I realized that bioengineering wasn't right for me, but it had already been 2 years!

I was like... ah fuck it. I'm switching to Computer Engineering. It was late, but I thought I would be able to catch up.

And I honestly haven't looked back. I've made some really cool projects, participated in a hardware hackathon, and I've learned a lot of amazing things. My junior year was really fulfilling because I learned to code better and work with on the hardware side as well. I then took my knowledge and applied it right away, something I had never done in bioengineering. This year, I was also accepted into a combined BSE/MSE program that would allow me to complete my Bachelors in CompE and Masters in EE by 2015.

I then got my first real engineering internship (the other ones in the past were BE research related). I did some work for an FPGA startup where I was working with the core technology team to test the FPGA. I ended up picking up Python when designing a new testing system as well as strengthening my RTL coding skills.

I then got an internship from July 2013- Jan 2014 to work in a medical device startup in Switzerland. The job here is basically working on wireless/low-power ECG monitors. Specifically I'm working with a new microcontroller and learning about optimizing serial communication and working with a new RTOS. 

After checking out this subreddit so many times, I learned that I should always be planning for the next internship. So while I've been here in Switzerland, I started harassing a medical device company in Boston that has been working with cool technology that I once read in a Nature article. I eventually harassed them enough to get me an interview with the Advanced Tech R&amp;D team, and I was later accepted for an intern position for next summer.

So at this point you're probably asking... what the fuck is your situation?

A NASA engineer contacted me via email and asked if I would be able to intern in the Spring of 2014. He had posted two new positions and thought that I would be a good match for them and encouraged me to apply. My problem is, I was planning on going back to school in the Spring to continue my studies. 

With my current track, I've already pushed my BSE/MSE grad date to the Spring of 2016. If I get this internship and take it, I would be pushing it back another semester. Is this worth it? I would be spending 6.5 years for my bachelors and masters, but I would have a bunch of really cool experience that would make my resume look really great. 

I also haven't decided if I want to continue schooling and get my PhD, or to go into industry after i get my MSE...

So sorry if this a shitty post, but I'd love to hear some thoughts on whether getting this internship experience is worth it if I'm pushing out my graduation date

Thanks"

1mvixc,3,2013-09-21,My personal story from happy to sad introvert thanks to nursing (x-posted in r/introvert),foxdancer,nursing,https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/1mvixc/my_personal_story_from_happy_to_sad_introvert/,"x-posted in r/introvert.  This is my first post on Reddit. YAY!

I’m not sure if I am writing this to just vent or to actually seek help, perhaps both. Here’s my story.  My first Bachelor’s degree was pretty much a waste, so I went to go work as restaurant server shortly after I graduated.  I felt like a failure because I had done so well and all I could get was this stupid job. {Insert the usually college grad/sucky job argument here}.  Not long after I started working I realized that I LOVED my job.  I am introvert but I loved working as a server, mostly because I worked with some GREAT people and I loved the busy nature of the job, and helping my customers.  Of course there were some awful customers every now and again, and not everything ran smoothly all the time, but those were small potatoes.  How could an introvert love serving? I don’t know, but I did!  Maybe it was because I worked with people that eventually became very good, lifelong friends to me, and there was really no time to make small talk before the next crisis happened.  Plus, the working environment in a restaurant is very diversified personality wise- you have your introverts, extroverts, those in-between, high school educated, college educated, sane, insane, hipsters, religiously conservative, drug addicts, etc.  I just made the assumption we were all crazy.  Judging your co-workers for who they are usually didn’t happen, unless they are just a poor or lazy worker.  Even though I didn’t become friends with everyone, we all enjoyed working together and never let anyone sink. I also trained new employees every now and again, so I knew the job pretty well.  I do understand this is not the same at every restaurant, but this was the restaurant culture that I know.

So I decided to get another Bachelor’s degree, this time in nursing.  The whole time I was working as a server, I really never stopped thinking that I shouldn’t be there.  I graduated from a college prep high school, graduated with honors from college; basically I thought I was an intelligent person who should be contributing to society in a different and better way.  I assumed that since I enjoyed customer service and I’ve always been interested in medicine this would be the way to go.  Fast-forward two years in nursing school, and it was the worst two years of my life.  Thank God this was not my first round of college, I actually was able to enjoy college the first time around and be in an actual academic atmosphere. Nursing is not a very academically challenging profession, and you really do not learn skills or how to work in a hospital. Yes, you do have clinicals, for about two days a week, and the nursing staff is hating that you are there the whole time.  I did have a nursing internship one summer and that did make up for the lack of education I received about the hospital environment I got in school.  I don’t want this to become a rant about nursing school though, that’s a different beast.  I tend to ramble, sorry.  I received all As, graduated with honors, passed the NCLEX, and got a job.  

My job was on a med-surg floor at a hospital that was in a different city than where I attended nursing school.  Great! I was working with people again and helping others.  Now let’s back up to the first paragraph.  Naturally I am an introvert, and my tendencies are usually that I am not fond of small talk and it takes time for me to open up to others, and I do need my time to recharge.  Everything was downhill from the get-go.  I was written up for having no confidence, and this came from an instance where I forgot to clamp the IV tubing while priming it and coldness of it on my scrubs shocked me. This freaked out the patient’s family or something.  I just generally felt like I couldn’t do anything right.  Then I was told I don’t talk to my co-workers enough.  I felt like I talked when I could, if there was even time for that, and I usually like to read during my lunch break to decompress, and this was apparently a problem with everyone, but it’s just what I liked to do.  I must clarify that there really wasn’t any eating your young, though I know that this may come across as such. The hospital over the years really took the hammer to it and any nurse who was seen as a bully was asked to leave. But this initiative to combat bullying prompted everyone to always act fake all the time with his or her happiness and friendliness, so I can see how my innate quiet nature would appear to be seen as a potential problem. They were just really, really worried about me, from what I could tell were my introvert tendencies.  

This was a horrible time in my life; I cried everyday, had a panic attack almost every morning, and I just hated life so, so much.  I hated that I made this stupid decision to be a nurse.  Healthcare is so poorly managed, and nurses are not given the tools in order to develop professionally.  I started to hate myself, my personality, I kept thinking to myself if I wasn’t an introvert and just talked all the time and never needed alone time when I ate my sandwich then I could have made it.  If only I just acted normal.  But I was still learning! As a new nurse you are basically still a student! 

I quit the job with 5 weeks left of my 12-week orientation, and I believe this action saved my life.  Also, thankfully, I have a great fiancé who supported me throughout this, and as an extrovert he keeps reminding me there is nothing wrong with me being who I am, an introvert.  I have an anxiety driven life right now, I am scared to death to apply for a new job, no matter where it is.  I feel like no matter where I go someone is going to have an issue with whom I am.  Why did I have to leave my job as a server?  No pay, no benefits could make up for what I went through.  It has been months, and I do need a job.  I am studying for the GRE in order to go to grad school, hopefully thinking that where I need to be is back in academia since that is a place I really succeed.  My pride also tells me that with two Bachelor’s degrees, the last thing I need to do is be a server again.  I just don't want to hate who I am.

Thanks for reading my rambles :-) x-post in r/introvert as well.

EDIT:  I feel kind of bad for saying in the title, ""...thanks to nursing."" I understand nursing is not to blame.  That's pretty much my bitterness at the moment coming out. I didn't mean to offend anyone :).

I guess I wasn't exactly clear about my quitting, I probably should have explained more clearly. I removed myself from the floor, with my manager's permission and blessing, at that time and the manager and a family member high up in administration tried to get me moved to another area. That didn't happen so after my 90 day trial period I didn't have a home in the hospital, so I was obviously gone. Later I was told that the reason I didn't get a transfer was because of poor inter department communication within the hospital and that I came come back in a year. The manager herself quit not long after I was gone also. My city/area in my state is over saturated with nursing schools and grads, most have to move away (I don't have that luxury for personal reasons, fiancé is a lawyer and this is where his practice is). And most require a year's experience in the hospital to work anywhere, even in an office.

I assumed that since I enjoyed customer service and I’ve always been interested in medicine this would be the way to go.  Fast-forward two years in nursing school, and it was the worst two years of my life.  Thank God this was not my first round of college, I actually was able to enjoy college the first time around and be in an actual academic atmosphere. Nursing is not a very academically challenging profession, and you really do not learn skills or how to work in a hospital. Yes, you do have clinicals, for about two days a week, and the nursing staff is hating that you are there the whole time.  I did have a nursing internship one summer and that did make up for the lack of education I received about the hospital environment I got in school.  I don’t want this to become a rant about nursing school though, that’s a different beast.  I tend to ramble, sorry.  I received all As, graduated with honors, passed the NCLEX, and got a job.  

My job was on a med-surg floor at a hospital that was in a different city than where I attended nursing school.  Great! I was working with people again and helping others.  Now let’s back up to the first paragraph.  Naturally I am an introvert, and my tendencies are usually that I am not fond of small talk and it takes time for me to open up to others, and I do need my time to recharge.  Everything was downhill from the get-go.  I was written up for having no confidence, and this came from an instance where I forgot to clamp the IV tubing while priming it and coldness of it on my scrubs shocked me. This freaked out the patient’s family or something.  I just generally felt like I couldn’t do anything right.  Then I was told I don’t talk to my co-workers enough.  I felt like I talked when I could, if there was even time for that, and I usually like to read during my lunch break to decompress, and this was apparently a problem with everyone, but it’s just what I liked to do.  I must clarify that there really wasn’t any eating your young, though I know that this may come across as such. The hospital over the years really took the hammer to it and any nurse who was seen as a bully was asked to leave. But this initiative to combat bullying prompted everyone to always act fake all the time with his or her happiness and friendliness, so I can see how my innate quiet nature would appear to be seen as a potential problem. They were just really, really worried about me, from what I could tell were my introvert tendencies.  

This was a horrible time in my life; I cried everyday, had a panic attack almost every morning, and I just hated life so, so much.  I hated that I made this stupid decision to be a nurse.  Healthcare is so poorly managed, and nurses are not given the tools in order to develop professionally.  I started to hate myself, my personality, I kept thinking to myself if I wasn’t an introvert and just talked all the time and never needed alone time when I ate my sandwich then I could have made it.  If only I just acted normal.  But I was still learning! As a new nurse you are basically still a student! 

I quit the job with 5 weeks left of my 12-week orientation, and I believe this action saved my life.  Also, thankfully, I have a great fiancé who supported me throughout this, and as an extrovert he keeps reminding me there is nothing wrong with me being who I am, an introvert.  I have an anxiety driven life right now, I am scared to death to apply for a new job, no matter where it is.  I feel like no matter where I go someone is going to have an issue with whom I am.  Why did I have to leave my job as a server?  No pay, no benefits could make up for what I went through.  It has been months, and I do need a job.  I am studying for the GRE in order to go to grad school, hopefully thinking that where I need to be is back in academia since that is a place I really succeed.  My pride also tells me that with two Bachelor’s degrees, the last thing I need to do is be a server again.  I just don't want to hate who I am.

FYI, I am an INFJ

Thanks for reading my rambles :-) x-post in r/nursing as well.

Are there opportunities out there for my skills?,yrocurpantzoff,Seattle,https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/1mvf6q/looking_to_move_to_seattle_in_next_year_and_a/,"I'm saving up to move to move up there rather end of next summer or end of next winter. (I want to try to move up there with at least $15k to cover my cost of living for at least a year). I have a BA in Digital Art, and I'm rather proficient in photoshop, and I also know a good bit of Illustrator, After Effects and 3D molding, though I'm not really good enough to work at Bungie or 343 or Valve. I also have rather solid traditional art skills. 

Unfortunately, my biggest strike against me is lack of any industry experience. After I graduated college a few years ago, I received offers in California for a few internships, yet there were non-paying and in areas I really couldn't afford to live in without a source of income. And the area I live in Texas has almost zero use for my skills But, if I'm given an idea - even the most basic one - by anyone, I can execute it in a way that satisfies their needs. I've touched up wedding photos, sketched tattoo designs, and play around constantly in photoshop just to make sure I keep my skills in constant use and I don't forget things.

So, is my skills/knowledge base remotely marketable in the area? If not, are there any people who could possibly give me a few tips to help me expand my skills to make me a bit more marketable?

(Please don't say coding. Please. I've tried so hard, and I'm not a dumb person by any means, but coding just seems to be the bane of my existence.)"
1mvdif,1,2013-09-21,No Direction,scummz,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mvdif/no_direction/,"I don't know if I'm actually depressed or if this is even the right place to post this. I do know that I'm sad, I'm lonely, and my hobbies no longer interest me.

I'm certainly introverted and I've always been a smart guy.  I definitely found school to be uninteresting and did not feel challenged whatsoever.  I'm in my last year of college (great GPA, respected engineering program) in a place where I had to start from scratch, socially. My closest relatives live a few thousand miles away from the city I'm studying in. I was initially successful at making friends, but acquired a girlfriend who occupied most of my time (same program) and I moved off campus and fell out of contact with them.

I spent almost every second of every day with my gf; this is mostly because we did all of our studying and had all of our classes together.  For three years, I made the mistake of letting her control the direction of my life and helped her pursue her passions, rather than focusing on mine.

This summer was definitely a low point for me. I had an internship at a well-known company, but didn't enjoy it due to issues with coworkers, moral dilemmas, a long commute, and a generally negative company attitude. My girlfriend broke up with me in June, which made it that much harder. To this day, I still have no idea why she left.

I used to be really good at making and fixing things, from cars to computers to musical instruments. I have absolutely no motivation to continue doing this sort of work. I haven't picked up any new hobbies to replace these.

I used to really care about my health, but I've started smoking and drinking excessively as a form of escapism. I spend a lot of time behind a computer screen, playing videogames and drinking until I pass out. Two years ago, I suffered a spine injury that continues to haunt me and renders me almost entirely immobile when it recurs.  I haven't been eating much, and have lost quite a bit of weight.

I dread calls from my family. I don't want them to know that I'm unhappy and questioning my current path in life. I feel like I've just skated by up until this point, and have no idea what to do next. I feel like I used to be ambitious and I know people expected so much of me, but I'm letting everyone (including myself) down.

I've tried getting my life back on track by making to-do lists, finding new music to listen to and love, and improving my living situation. None of it has provided the motivation I need; every setback hits harder and demotivates me even further.

I don't know what to do anymore. I can't seem to be able to make my incessant google searches for ""I'm demotivated"", ""I'm depressed"", or ""help me I'm fucking sad"" provide any new insight.

I've tried going through multiple forms of counseling at my school, but still am not receiving any useful tools to dig myself out of this hole. It seems like the only things going for me are that I'm intelligent and financially solvent (barely). Those two apparently aren't enough to make me happy.

I feel like there should be a really simple solution to my problem, and that is why I'm appealing to you, /r/depression. Is there something I'm missing?"
1mva8r,4,2013-09-21,Need hiring advice.,moros1988,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1mva8r/need_hiring_advice/,"Hi, I'll keep this short.

I graduated in May 2012 with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from an ABET accredited University with a 2.5 (not phenomenal, I know, but I tried). I was active in quite a few extracurricular activities, including my local student chapter of IEEE. I was unable to get an internship for several reasons, none of which are relevant to this post. Since I graduated, I've earned my E.I.T. certificate on my first attempt at the exam (so I'm obviously more competent than my GPA shows).

I am currently working as a clerk in a grocery store for $10 an hour.

I've had professionals go over my resume, I took a class on passing job interviews, I've given my resume to staffing agencies, family, friends and anything else I could think of to get myself hired somewhere meaningful.

I'm at the end of my rope. I can't afford grad school (if I even get in...), nor can I afford to go back for another 4-year degree. No companies I've talked to are willing to hire an intern who's not in school anymore. I keep hearing that engineers are in high demand, but I'm still stuck in my dead-end job, living hand to mouth by my parents' charity.

What am I doing wrong? Am I just permanently screwed because of my poor GPA, or is this a common occurrence among people my age?"

Monday - I leave at 12:00 pm for my class at 1:00 pm. I get out at 5:00 pm and immediately baby sit from 6:00 to 8:30 pm. 
* I am basically free until noon. 

Tuesday - Wake up at 6:00 and go to my 8:00 class. I finish up at 11:00 pm and have free time until 5:00 pm, in which I baby sit my niece.

* I am free until noon

Thursday - Same as tuesday, except I don't have to babysit.

Friday - No class, but I baby sit at 6:00 pm.
* I am free until 6:00 pm.

Saturday - free, usually babysit.

Sunday - free, usually babysit.

I will tell you right now that I do not necessarily want a job for extra income, although that is a great incentive.

 I want both work and life experience, I want to interact with people, and I crave something more than what I have now. I'm 21 years old and feel hungry to take on more challenges. I want to leave my comfort zone ( aka my room )

My question is, what type of job could I get to fulfill my desire for challenge? I feel as though my hours are very odd. I have a resume that I can share with anyone, it has some volunteer experience and internships with athletic teams. 

EDIT: I was thinking perhaps getting certified to become a trainer. I figured with relatively flexible hours, It will throw me into ""sales"" and ""people"" experience. two birds with one stone. I'm wondering if there is anything else I can do with my time. 

In the future, I am considering making a career in medicine. I was thinking physician assistant or Paramedic/ Firefighter. I want to become EMT- B certfied next year and try to get a part time job as an ER tech in the hospital. But I want something that I can sink my teeth into now. I'm trying to volunteer with my time, but I've had a hard time getting calls back.

I ended an internship that lasted a year several weeks ago.  The pay was $200/wk.  Originally, a year ago, the job description on Craigslist said $10/hr but my paycheck has always said ""Salary"" $200 and does not calculate a hourly rate.  

I did not receive pay for my last work week (9/2 -9/7).  When I asked my former employer about this he told me he will not compensate me for this week since I regularly worked less than 20 hours during my internship.  Can he do this?  My understanding was salary pay is not based on an hourly rate and it was clear I only came in two days a week.  

I'm not sure it is worth pursuing since I would like a positive reference when applying for a job and would rather not get involved in a legal battle over $200."

1mzq3b,12,2013-09-23,[F4M] Reversing Gender Interaction,yourlittleslut,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/1mzq3b/f4m_reversing_gender_interaction/,"So the title took me a bit to come up with, but I think it basically explains what I'm looking for; a roleplay in a society where women act as men, and men women. The ""traditional"" male role would be as a homemaker, while the woman goes out to work. Women would be the ones notoriously thinking about sex, constantly hounding men whom try their best to be modest under constant harassment.

When a woman fucks as many guys as possible she is praised as a ""stud"" while a loose guy would be a whore. Women would constantly be leering, grabbing, groping and making crude remarks at the expense of men, who take it due to the social order. I think it would be fun to see how we would interact with our roles reversed, and here are a few scenarios that I think could be a good canvas for it. In descending order of preference. 

1) The Halcyon Days of High School:

The roles are truly reversed. Gone are the days of high school football ruling athletic departments from Ohio to Texas. Rather, women's soccer, volleyball and softball dominate their respective seasons. Cheer leading would still exist, but a female cheerleader would be the unicorn that a male one is at many schools of today. I could be the hot shot three sport athlete: striker, volleyball and star second base. 

You're my boyfriend who I've been trying to get in bed for weeks, but you want to save it. I do my best to be sensitive, but deep down I can't stop thinking about what you look like under your cheer outfit. I constantly think about every muscle, every bit of skin. When you go down on me, I long to feel you inside me. Yet you deny me and I must earn your virginity. Perhaps you have religious beliefs, perhaps you're physically insecure, perhaps you think I just want you for sex? 

2) Office eye candy:

Being an executive has its perks, especially being a hiring manager. I get to see all the talent (sexual and professional) and pick the best for where I want them. One day, you walk into a group interview for an internship and I'm rather taken. I, of course, place you on my team and take you under my wing, teaching you the industry; spending many late nights together. 

Without pre-determining too much of the story, we grow closer and I long to take advantage of you while we deal with the ethical, moral and sexual tension? Where does the tension come from? Perhaps you're taken (dating, engaged, etc), there may be an age difference, power dichotomoy being my subordinate. Lots of fun topics to explore. 

3) Paying Her Debts

Your wife has a gambling problem, with both frequency and skill. Like many degenerates she came to me for a loan thinking she would win her way out of the hole; needless to say she was wrong. So after weeks of dodging me, I finally pin her down at home. When I come knocking on an otherwise peaceful, ordinary Sunday, its a revelation to you. You had no idea she was blowing every pay check at the bookie. 

But regardless of what you know, I know what I want in repayment: you. Your body, your mouth, your hands, your cock. You may not want it, but I'm going to have you, all while she watches so she knows what I'm taking from her. 

4) Unsatisfied

I constantly beg my husband for sex but its never forthcoming. ""I'm tired,"" ""I have a headache,"" ""I have to work in the morning..."" Its always some excuse whenever we crawl into bed and my hands start to roam. I'm sick of it and while not seeking infidelity, my eyes are roaming more freely than ever. Finally one day I go to a friend's bachelorette  party (or the beach, or wherever you fancy) and decide to make a move on you to quench my thirst. 

I am sure I will think of some more, but these should be something to get us started. 

A few notes to begin:

* No Kik or skype. Looking merely for PMs, Gmail if things progress well.

* Please don't respond with, ""I'm up for any of them!"" Its great if you want to respond, but which one connected with you the most, I'm giving options and beginnings so we can start from a place of common interest.
 
* Furthermore, tell me why you liked the scenario you did. Give me some details you'd like to include, or some possibilities that jumped to mind for where the story could go. If you have something in mind for your character tell me. 

* Don't feel the need to write a book, but more than a line or two is sure to be eye catching. 

* Please use proper capitalization, punctuation and passable grammar. Again, you don't need an English degree, and I make mistakes too, but if you can't be fucked to hit the shift button then we aren't looking for the same things in a pen pal. 

Well I hope that didn't come off too demanding and that some of you are still with me. I will be around for a little while immediately, and then readily available this evening (~10PM EST). If I don't get back to you right away that is why. I will give every thoughtful response a response back, even if its a declination. 

Last thing, if you spy something in my post history that intrigues you, please let me know with the above guidelines. I'm very open to many things.

Thanks for reading,

This isn't exactly unexpected news. The last few years his memory and other cognitive functions have been noticeably impaired. The confirmation is still a harsh shock of reality though. 

I'm currently living with my grandparents in order to be closer to school and an Intern job I have. I've found it difficult at times to communicate with him as he often seems confused as to what he's trying to get across, which in turn confuses be and makes for an awkward situation. I don't want to patronize him though; he has his pride and he has moments of clarity and I love the guy to death but knowing it's only going to get worse from here makes me want to prepare myself for inevitable communication barriers. 

So I'm really just looking for tips anyone might have on better communicating with sufferers of Dementia, ways to deal as it gets worse (preferably without coming off as if I'm patronizing or 'talking down' to him.) and really *anything* that experienced persons might be able to add.

1mzhip,2,2013-09-23,I want to gain control of my life... but it just keeps getting more and more screwed up,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mzhip/i_want_to_gain_control_of_my_life_but_it_just/,"Where to even start, it's been so fucked up for a while/majority of it. 

I'll give the super-abridged version: I'm the gay middle son of 3 from a pretty fucked up family with a father who was emotionally abusive (when he was there) and a mother who suffers from almost-crippling dependency issues. Things were shitty and i was diagnosed with depression in high school and put on medication. 

In 2005, I go off to college to learn how to make video games, and I start feeling pretty damn great and eventually the doctor slowly took me off my meds. I even landed a job working about 30 hours a week for over a year (I had to leave because my classes were becoming more difficult and I was starting to falter a little in them) I felt so fantastic and so in-control of my life for almost 3 full years (finally coming out helped a lot too) Unfortunately, about 6 months before i graduated, I just got wave after wave of negativity: ruthless critiques in school, my mother cry to me saying my father was leaving her, failing an important class for the dumbest reason that I had no control of. I just... fell back into depression really badly, but I still had some hope because I had been offered a decently-paying internship in California. But, right after i graduated and moved out to Santa Monica, I was informed that the internship had become non-paying all of the sudden. I couldn't afford to live there without paying work, and while i tried to find work, i was unsuccessful, and was forced to move back to Texas with my family, who lives in this small town with nothing for me work-wise (and also pretty homophobic to boot)

Almost a year later, in 2009, I finally land another job (after not working for almost 2 years) and despite the job being in fast food it was... alright for the moment. I was also talking and eventually in a relationship with a guy from New Jersey. The long distance sucked, but we talked often enough that it sorta made up for it. Almost a year later, he had convinced me to move out there and he said he would help me secure a job. Well, I did... but he didn't. It was one of the biggest mistakes moving to New Jersey. The relationship ended rather horribly, but I managed to find another mindless job and live there for almost a full year after the breakup until a storm of shit fell upon me that forced me to move back in with my family.

I've been back in Texas with them for 2 years now. I've submitted at least 100 applications in that time frame, and might have gone on maybe 7 interviews. Today, I just got back from a hiring event for a store that's opening nearby that i'm really excited for, but... it went worse than horribly. I'm not being overly dramatic either. There was construction going on around the building and I stepped in wet concrete because the construction crew couldn't properly mark off shit, and, while they were only having short conversations with people today, the hiring manager I spoke with gave me the brushoff he was giving to all the people who put zero effort into trying for the job, and I think the only chance I will have for a callback interview is going to be my cover letter, and the wait for the next two days are going to fucking drive me crazy.

I'm at this point in life where I just want to say FUCK YOU to everything and crawl away... but I can't. I've been almost doing that for the past 2 years now and it took me possibly fucking up a friendship/possible eventual relationship (if it goes that far/he's up for it at some later point-in-time in our lives) with a pretty awesome guy I've known for over a year and a half now (who also happens to live 2000 miles away, but at least I'm wise enough now not to go chasing after a guy until I have my shit together) to make me realize that. And I've been trying my damnedest to retake control of my life but... nothing wants to go right, even when I try to steer it in my favor. 

It's not like I want to be rich and famous or anything. I want a normal, well-paying job (I would be happy with 30K a year) live in a location where I don't feel afraid to be myself (that's probably 3-5 years off from now, slowly saving back a bit each month) and find and date a nice guy who understands I'm a bit of damaged goods because of my environment or circumstances, but can see that there's more to me than my worrying, my fears and insecurities, and my slight clingyness when I'm afraid or nervous. But day after day, the simple things I want just seem further and further away and... I seriously don't know what to do. I try my best, and find myself getting my hopes up, only to be rewarded with disappointment and failure. 

tl;dr: I'm a fucking mess trying to climb up from the pool of shit and depression I've been living in, but the more and more I try, the more and more it seems that I get pushed back to where I was or even deeper, and I'm starting to feel like I have no fucking clue what to do. 

**UPDATE:** Well, in a bit of good news, I have NOT fucked up anything with said friend. It was just my derptastic brain under stress jumping from A to ZZ. The knowledge that I can still almost pass as a basic human being is somewhat settling. "

Is research in Sector IV still active?,toasted_muffin,SecretSubreddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/SecretSubreddit/comments/1mzfja/guys_is_research_in_sector_iv_still_active/,"Last week a guy (Dr. [REDACTED] maybe?) came and took one intern from our sector every day, and apparently they've been getting to feed a tiger or something like that. It must be pretty sweet because they haven't come back yet.

Anyway, nobody has come around all day, and I'm the last one here. I could really use some help holding down the [REDACTED]-[REDACTED] hybrid in the genetics lab, it keeps trying to get into the vents."
1mzelb,2,2013-09-23,How many internships are enough (for advertising)?,lambopercy,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1mzelb/how_many_internships_are_enough_for_advertising/,"As a recent graduation (class of '13), I'm trying to get my first real, paying job in advertising and can't seem to get started. I've had four internships, each one taking place during a summer, and I believed that I'm at least qualified for something bottom of the barrel. These internships were unpaid and I hedge on the hope that they would eventually ""pay off"".

However, I'm not hearing much back for the positions I'm applying toward online (majority of which are account coordinator positions and other similar junior/assistant jobs). I'm starting to think that maybe I'm not nearly as qualified to start off as I think I am, since I see a lot of peers with even more internships and experience compared to myself getting the variety of jobs I'm looking for.

Should I go out and look for a 5th internship, not just to help pad my resume and make myself more attractive to hiring managers, but to avoid what could be a lengthy gap?"
1mzdci,2,2013-09-23,Programming portfolio question,n3verlose,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1mzdci/programming_portfolio_question/,"I'm a 2nd year mathematics student applying for internships. One job application suggests that we give a link to a github or something similar to show the projects we work on in our free time. I have two projects, a fairly quick mandelbrot fractal viewer in C, and a 2d celestial dynamics simulator in java (I just use numerical methods to solve the newtonian gravity equations for n bodies). 

Both of these projects were intended to give me a result as fast as possible. Should I put either of these in my resume? I would like to show enthusiasm but I think these projects might not make me look good. 

Thanks"

[Wizeo](http://bit.ly/18QkQIG) is a crowdgiving platform that allows inspiring and influential people (Wizzes) to host video chats/AMAs with fans and anyone else interested. Users donate a minimum of 1 dollar (maximum of  ∞) to get access to these events and proceeds go to a non profit of the Wiz's choice. Once a user has donated, they have the option to submit a question to the wiz. Questions are voted on and the most popular questions rise to the top and are more likely to be read by the Wiz.

Currently we have 2 campaigns going:

1. [Dan Ariely](http://www.wizeo.org/#profile/3), professor of Psychology at Duke University, and very well known TED speaker. 

2. [Ehud Olmert](http://www.wizeo.org/#profile/2), Former Prime Minister of Israel 

We are very excited about the launch and hope you guys are as well. 

As with just about any startup mentioned on this sub, we are more than welcome to any pieces of advice/critique.

1mzaxs,1,2013-09-23,"""I can't believe I'm actually asking this..."" They sent me here...x/post from FatPeopleStories",[deleted],fatpeoplehate,https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplehate/comments/1mzaxs/i_cant_believe_im_actually_asking_this_they_sent/,"What's going on you little piggies? I know it's a surprise and shit, but I've been reading this sub for a while, and this is my first post. Fuck green text. Oh yeah, this story started happened last week.
So be me, mid 20's, 6'1'', 180 lbs, in shape and active guy. I work as a freelancer in the advertising industry and last Monday I started a gig doing account management and creative strategy at a decent ad agency here in the city. So I walk in for work, meet and exchange niceties with everyone, and you know, start earning my paycheck. Booze ain't gonna pay for iself. All of a sudden, my chair starts rolling back. What the fuck? A split second later, I hear the floorboards of this awesome old school hardwood floor start creaking. It's getting to the point where I gotta grab my desk so I don't roll back any further. ""Huh, uhm Hamber. It luuks like we'ah gunna be wurkin' next tuh eachotha."" This stunner must've been 5'3'', mid 20’s, and 350lbs of pure curves, the kind of curves that scream ""I fuck black dudes.""
Shit. Now don't get me wrong, I hate fat people as much as the next guy. But working right next to a god damn mini moon? Fuck me.
We shake hands and and after wiping the crisco from my digits, I get back to sending out emails.
Then it starts. crunch chew crunch chew It's not even 10 am and this bitch is eating onion rings. Motherfuckin' onion rings. Where she got 'em from? Damned if I know. I squint my eyes and look over at her from the corner; I must have looked like an evil villain plotting someone's demise or something, when I notice her wiping her greasy pig hooves on her pants. Nice. Then the smell hits me. That smell. Ever drink coffee at the fried food tent at a county fair? Me neither, but I'm pretty sure this odor and experience was pretty damn close. Every 10 minutes on the dot, no joke, this cocktail of nothing is talking to me about things I couldn't care less about. ""Yuh know thut band 1 Duhrection, they so cuuute."" ""Aren't they like 16?"" ""Haaay, what do yuu thunk abuut gurls wearing white pants after labor day?"" ""If my girlfriend tried it, she'd be eating by herself for a week."" ""HUH HUH HUH HUH!!! YUH SOOO FUN-NEE!"" ""What makes you think I'm joking?"" Like you need to be seen in white pants anyway...
So it's like 11:00 at this point and this she-cow just started on her second bag of potato chips and is eyeing up a box of cheez-its like it's name is Jamal Williams. You know how as soon as you meet some people you just automatically don't like them? I'd rather hang out with those people for an entire weekend then work next to this abortion for a minute longer. I wanted to drown this bitch.
Lunchtime rolls up on me. Not a minute too soon. Some of the other employees who I met earlier approach me at my desk and ask me if I want to go out to lunch with them. No doubt. As I get up to walk away, I glance in Hamber's direction and notice the slight look of rejection come across her fat face as we walk away. That's right bitch, I'm going to sit with the cool kids and you ain't invited.
Lunch is pretty uneventful and we start walking back to our office building. On the way, we stop at a Whole Foods. Some of the guys wanted to grab something to snack on for the rest of the day. Oh, that's cool. As I'm walking around with some of the group, I see hummus is on sale. No. Way. See, like anyone else, I have my vices. Booze? You fat-asses couldn't tie my drinking shoes. Gambling? My dad once drove 4 hours up to my college to slap me around after he found out I blew half my tuition check at the black jack table in a weekend. Strippers? I'm known as the guy who walks into the strip club screaming ""who wants to go to college?!?!?!"" But hummus? Ohhh hummus. I could eat 2 pounds in a day...ask me how I know. So bam, I jump on that pack of hummus like a fat kid on a cupcake. Now where are the baby carrots? Boom. How about some cucumber? I’ve got plans for you, too. Okay, back to work.
So it’s around 2:00 and I hear that hummus calling my name. I'm coming baby. I take my cucumber and carrots to the kitchen, wash 'em off, slice and dice 'em and go back to my desk…your man's about to get busy. I dive into that shit like Scrooge McDuck. That's when Hamber starts staring at me. I mean STARING at me...like I called her kids ugly or some shit. Fuck her. I enjoy my Middle Eastern treat for the rest of the day and am so wrapped up in it that I completely forgot Hamber’s existence 8 feet to my left, you know, until she started wiping her crumbs off of her gullet/stomach and they came flying at me like some fucking shrapnel. Fat bitches, always trying to share their empty calories…who do they think they are?
Tuesday rolls around like it normally does. I get to work, start typing. Boom, email from HR comes in. Oh, okay, probably something for me to sign, right? I mosey my way down there and get to homeboys office. ""Hey, I'm Paul_El, you emailed me?""
""Oh yeah, come on in Paul, have a seat. So Paul, I know you just started freelancing here, but an issue has been addressed.""
What the fuck? Should I not have slept with that hot intern after I took her to the bar last night?
""You see, Hamber has filed a complaint.""
""Oh, this oughta be good.""
He actually laughs when I say that, ""Oh, it is. Paul.."" he actually looks down and shakes his head…”Jesus Christ, I can’t believe I’m actually asking this…Did you go out and buy health food yesterday and eat it at your desk in order to fat-shame Hamber?”
I actually burst out laughing. I'm in full on hysterics. As you can tell, I don’t really take anything too seriously. Life’s too short and I’m just trying to live. (In between breaths) “What?!?!?!”
“Yeah, I know, I know…”
“No I didn’t finish…did she actually write ‘fat-shame’?!?!?!”
“Yeah, man.” Round two of laughing commences.
As I wipe the tears from my eyes, I notice HR dude even sees the humor in this, but then I realize, this is corporate America, and I get serious for a second. “Listen, HR Dude, can I call you HR Dude?”
“Yeah, go right ahead, Paul_El.”
“HR Dude, I didn’t have to take PSYC101 in college to tell you this is a clear cut case of her insecurity. That woman was eating onion rings at 10am yesterday, by 11am sh-“
“She was eating onion rings at 10am?”
“YEAH! By 11 there wasn’t a Cheez-It in the building that was safe.”
He looks down at his desk shaking his head… ”Jesus…”
“That’s what I’m saying! So back to it, HR Dude, she knows her eating habits are atrocious at best and the fact that I choose to eat healthy pissed her off, even more so because I was eating healthy in front of her. I wasn’t trying to ‘fat-shame’ her (oh you better believe I used air quotes), the only shame she felt was her own. All I was doing was dipping some vegetables into hummus and enjoying my snack.”
“You didn’t look at her or suggest that she change her diet?”
“WHAT?!?!”
“She feels that you were ‘silently judging and suggesting she change her lifestyle.’ “
“Oh, this is priceless,” I say. “Honestly, HR Dude, I find it unbelievable you’re wasting your time with this. This is like me taking a car to work while you choose to bike in and then I have the audacity to say you’re ‘envio-shaming’ or ‘green-shaming’ (more motherfuckin’ air quotes) me by saying that you’re silently judging me and making me feel inferior because I choose to drive and pollute the environment.”
“Dude, you’re preaching to the choir. Listen man, just go back to your desk and enjoy your day. I’ll take care of all of this.”
“Thanks. Can I ask you something?”
He already knows. “Yeah, I get a lot of complaints from her.”
We both laugh. HR Dude is good people.
I walk back to my desk, and there she is, all 350lbs. of disgustingness. “Just getting in? Luttle late huh?” Bitch, the word little has no business coming out of your mouth.
“No.”
“Oh, where wurr youuu?”
I can't fucking stand people like this. Snitches who need to know what happened by acting all nonchalant about the situation. “You know I was down at HR dealing with your complaint.”
“Ohhh, well I hope uh got muh point across. Uht’s not nice tuh do whut yah did.”
Oh bitch. Ohhhh bitch. At that, I calmly got up, walked to the kitchen, took a handful of my baby carrots out of the fridge and walked back. When I got back, I walked up next to her desk and stared at her and when she looked up at me, I shoved all 6 baby carrots in my mouth and began chewing. I must've looked like a goddamn hamster trying not to laugh. That's about the time she ran out of the room. I wonder where she was going?
My first thought, “See you later HR.”"
1mzasx,4,2013-09-23,Recruitment process is technically over for me. What's the next step?,Nideas,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1mzasx/recruitment_process_is_technically_over_for_me/,"So, i'm finishing my degree this december, attended the career fair this month and only had one interview even though I applied to more accountant offices than my colleagues.

Since the information available of what comes next if you don't get an internship is like a blackbox in Canada, what should I do now to work in accounting?"
1mz9ew,27,2013-09-23,22 and befuddled,dat_retirement,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1mz9ew/22_and_befuddled/,"I had an internship this summer, and was recently extended an offer for a full time position when I graduate in December. I need some help figuring out which account I should focus on. 


1. 401(k): Through Fidelity. I get a 6% match, of which the first 2% is matched 300%, and the other 4% is matched 100%. Does this mean I effectively get a 12% match? I currently have this as 50/50 US Bonds and US Tips Bonds, with a fee of .05% each.

2. Roth IRA: Through the family broker at Baird. This currently has half Vanguard 500 Index Fund and half iShares Russell 3000.

3. Taxable account: Also through Baird. Currently has 40/40/20 of Vanguard 500 Index Fund/iShares Russell 3000/WisdomTree Emerging Markets ETF.

My starting salary is $64,500, plus end of year bonuses and potential for a merit raise based on my performance. I plan on matching the 401(k), maxing my Roth, maxing out the rest of the 401(k) and if I have any left, putting it in the taxable account. I have no debt at all, but do plan on saving for a new car some time in the next 2 years. Does anyone have any suggestions for me? Thanks in advance!

[What's the funniest thing you've seen penguins do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1myw05/im_ron_naveen_the_only_person_on_the_planet_whose/ccdvbtg?context=5)|Fall flat on their face, then stare at the ground like it was the ground's fault!
[Seriously, birds are the best. I love their expressions. I wish I had a bunch of penguins.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1myw05/im_ron_naveen_the_only_person_on_the_planet_whose/ccdx3m2?context=5)|I wish you could too, but the customs folks aren't going to let you bring them in!
[Do you ever name them? If so, which one has the most unusual name?  If not, please go name them. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1myw05/im_ron_naveen_the_only_person_on_the_planet_whose/ccdv92f?context=5)|Ha! I've certainly tried doing that, but of course, they speak ""penguin"" and I don't. So, whether I give them a friend's name or that of some Antarctic explorer, I get the same non-response. They seem more interested if I kneel down (to their size) and start doing imitations of their mating calls. 
[Have you ever gotten any ""interest?""  Edit: And a more interesting question (in my opinion\), did you get more males or females interested?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1myw05/im_ron_naveen_the_only_person_on_the_planet_whose/ccdxbpp?context=5)|They ALL look alike, males and females. And both sexes do the same displays.
[Is this you?  (Source\)  Just kidding.  Actual question: Have you ever intervened in a life threatening situation for a penguin?  I don't mean like it is going to get eaten by a predator.  I am specifically talking about if one gets stuck in the ice and it can't climb out of a crevasse.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1myw05/im_ron_naveen_the_only_person_on_the_planet_whose/ccdwk2h?context=5)|The official watchword (and the way we're permitted by the government) is: Hands off. I once had the experience of counting a large group of Adélies when a huge elephant seal started lunging upslope and in my direction. The ellie finally noticed me and then, stopped, right where it was, meaning that it didn't proceed past me and into a large group of penguins, many of which it would have crushed.
[Is that when you became king of the penguins?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1myw05/im_ron_naveen_the_only_person_on_the_planet_whose/ccdzzws?context=5)|If only!
[Do they ever attack you or appear hostile? I always thought penguins could bring it if they needed to.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1myw05/im_ron_naveen_the_only_person_on_the_planet_whose/ccdw5er?context=5)|Yes, they can bring it. Always wear protective glasses in the field. And if you get too close — they'll ""flipper-whack"" you. Which hurts. And really hurts if the penguin's a king penguin that's 3-4 feet tall and weighs 30 pounds. They're fiercely protective of their nests and chicks. 
[So essentially, it makes you its bitch.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1myw05/im_ron_naveen_the_only_person_on_the_planet_whose/ccdxib4?context=5)|You can walk away and not get whacked!
[I would like to second the question of climate change impacts on penguins (that you have seen personally\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1myw05/im_ron_naveen_the_only_person_on_the_planet_whose/ccdwcm1?context=5)|Climate change impacts I've seen personally: The populations of 2 of my species (Adélie and chinstrap) falling significantly in my Antarctic Peninsula study area; Antarctic glaciers receding (Paradise Bay); ice shelves collapsing (part of the Larsen Ice Shelf in the Weddell Sea).
[Have you found that individual birds have personalities/traits (other than physical differences\) that allow you to recognize them over and over?  Do they show fear of you (or are they indifferent or even react positively to your presence\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1myw05/im_ron_naveen_the_only_person_on_the_planet_whose/ccdwcm1?context=5)|Personality traits: On the species level, yes. Chinstraps are pretty fearless, marching right up and wanting, seemingly, to yell at you and check your passport! Adélies do a lot of growling before lunging or snapping their beaks at you. Gentoos are more laid back, and seem much more relaxed about you being in their vicinity. As noted above, they're fiercely protective and fearful of us big, tall humans towering over them. Better to hunch down to their level, which ""lowers their temperature"" quite a bit!
[Has the calving of major ice sheets in the Antarctic had a significant effect on penguins (population, habits, habitat, etc.\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1myw05/im_ron_naveen_the_only_person_on_the_planet_whose/ccdwcm1?context=5)|Calving of ice shelves, effects on penguins: The climate change in my study are is huge: over the last 50 years, an increase of 5˚F year-round and 9˚F in winter. We're still sorting it all out but populations have shifted (in my study area, 2 species declining significantly, one increasing significantly); warmer weather means more precipitation and could be that gentoos are adapting better to more variable snow/ice/wind conditions when they return in October to start another breeding season. The fair answer, again, is that we're just sorting this out, and hoping to paint a more detailed picture as we proceed.
[What is your educational, etc. background that prepared you for this career, did you aim for this or is it more something that just sort of came along?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1myw05/im_ron_naveen_the_only_person_on_the_planet_whose/ccdwcm1?context=5)|Educational background: I've been a birder all my life, which probably explains what I am ""doing biology"" today! That said, I majored in political science in college, went to law school and practiced law (including a stint as the US government's marine mammal attorney, in which job I learned all my statistics and population dynamics), I've been an expedition tour leader, and since 1987, when I founded Oceanites, doing what I can to  provide the data so Antarctica may be conserved for future generations. Happily, I've learned both science and policy, which provides a great perspective on what to do (and what might happen) with the data my Antarctic Site Inventory project is collecting.
[Ever gone swimming with penguins?  Stupid sounding, but honestly the footage I've seen makes them so graceful underwater, I just had to ask...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1myw05/im_ron_naveen_the_only_person_on_the_planet_whose/ccdwcm1?context=5)|Swimming with penguins? I really try NOT to swim in freezing water with my penguins! But I've had them porpoise more times than I can count into my zodiac. Penguins are quye near-sighted on land, but remarkably agile and, as you say, graceful, in the water.
[How many penguins are there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1myw05/im_ron_naveen_the_only_person_on_the_planet_whose/ccdxnfb?context=5)|Chinstrap, 7.5 million breeding pairs; Adélie, 2.5 million breeding pairs; gentoo, 350-500,000 breeding pairs.
[Do you ever fall asleep whilst counting? I've heard this is a serious issue for sheep counters. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1myw05/im_ron_naveen_the_only_person_on_the_planet_whose/ccdx7zs?context=5)|No!
[How many penguins have you counted?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1myw05/im_ron_naveen_the_only_person_on_the_planet_whose/ccdvl35?context=5)|Millions. We sometimes count up to 1/4 million nests and/or chicks each season.
[If I wanted a job in an Antarctic research station, how would I go about doing it? I'm just about to start my zoology degree and such a job would be quite heavenly for me.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1myw05/im_ron_naveen_the_only_person_on_the_planet_whose/ccdvdc0?context=5)|Get in touch with the folks at the Office of Polar Programs at the US National Science Foundation. They run 3 stations — Palmer, McMurdo, South Pole — and are always looking for help (from cooks to carpenters).
[Is there a UK equivalent?  Thanks a lot for your time!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1myw05/im_ron_naveen_the_only_person_on_the_planet_whose/ccdwzb6?context=5)|Yes, the British Antarctic Survey.
[Ever mistake a robot in a tux for a penguin?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1myw05/im_ron_naveen_the_only_person_on_the_planet_whose/ccdxac3?context=5)|No!
[Now, in my opinion, I think that lax gun laws are to blame for the current state of climate change. My colleague Wayne Lapierre of the NRA says that we need MORE guns in order to combat the spread of climate change (which obviously isn't even real anyways\). Your thoughts on arming the penguins?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1myw05/im_ron_naveen_the_only_person_on_the_planet_whose/ccdx1n4?context=5)|Don't get me started! Suspect that penguins can't shoot straight anyway. 
[Whereabouts do you do most of your counting? I was lucky enough to visit Aicho and Deception Bay about 15 years ago, and it was absolutely unreal -- though frankly the sheer number of penguins would NOT make me want to have your job, especially at the latter location.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1myw05/im_ron_naveen_the_only_person_on_the_planet_whose/ccdxe37?context=5)|Deception is, truly, a miserable place. Which will be perfectly obvious when [THE PENGUIN COUNTERS film](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1871897047/the-penguin-counters-documentary-film) comes out. That was the toughest counting experience I've had in 20 years. Bad weather. Couldn't use our zodiac. Hiking. Whiteouts. You name the bad circumstance, we had it.
[Do they mostly smile and wave or is it much harder to count them because they are sneaky and keep hiding?  But seriously, thanks for your contribution and efforts for making people aware of climate change. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1myw05/im_ron_naveen_the_only_person_on_the_planet_whose/ccdvbv2?context=5)|2 of my 3 species (Adélie and chinstrap) are going to hell in a hand basket, while the third species (gentoo) is thriving. Trying to understand ""why"" is what we're into now . . . could be food, too much ice in the Antarctic spring (September/October) when they're trying to get back to their nests from the previous season, and try mating again. Yes, they do wave . . . but it's just part of their mating routines, not saying hello to me!
[Have you got any pictures for r/aww?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1myw05/im_ron_naveen_the_only_person_on_the_planet_whose/ccdvhs6?context=5)|Check out the pictures associated with our KICKSTARTER campaign!

[Your team gathers data, but who makes use of it? Is there a place you post it for other scientists or organizations to analyze it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1myw05/im_ron_naveen_the_only_person_on_the_planet_whose/ccdw4f1?context=5)|Our data are posted publicly in various places — data banks that the US National Science Foundation utilizes, and most especially in a raft of scientific papers and publications we've done. Many of these papers can be found at the Oceanites website ([Link to www.oceanites.org](http://www.oceanites.org/science/index6.php).)
[How do you cope with being away from family/friends for so long?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1myw05/im_ron_naveen_the_only_person_on_the_planet_whose/ccdxdoh?context=5)|It was worse during the years we camped at Petermann Island, at 65˚S. That was a month or more at a time. Now, utilizing expedition ships and yachts, time's a bit more manageable. That said, the worst pair is lack of communication — WiFi's not yet as big in The Ice as we're used to everywhere else.

I burned out leading Antarctic expeditions, and started Oceanites in 1987, hoping to give something back, somehow, some way, to this incredible place I loved. Then, in the early '90s, the Antarctic Treaty parties passed a new Environmental Protocol that required environmental impact statements for all human activities, including tourism. But, at the time, there was no compilation of data and information to take this forward, and so . . . the Antarctic Site Inventory was born. I'm happy to say that, now, almost 20 years later, EVERYONE in the Treaty system uses the data and information we've compiled.

The penguins are really good at recognizing each other, but they look all the same to us. Some colleagues band penguins and those banded birds, of course, can be recognized. Don't hesitate to send in a C.v. to Oceanites, but . . . at the moment, all the counting is done by grad students and experienced, long-term staff.
[I'm an avid waterfowler, so I'm familiar with counting populations of certain duck species.  Do you know the science that goes into it? And do you have any recommendations for improving their estimates?  While I know it's all estimates, some tomfoolery went down a few years ago where they totally mis-estimated the population of some ducks.  If you look at the historic trends of certain species (the trends of estimates\) there's insane swings.  While disease could certainly cause a population to decline, the rebound wouldn't be so dramatic (see for yourself here Link to www.flyways.us.  They make these estimates by plane (generally\) and I think a Ouija board, but do you know any of these guys and can you tell them to get their shit together?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1myw05/im_ron_naveen_the_only_person_on_the_planet_whose/ccdwf7w?context=5)|I'm not familiar with the methodology the duck folks are using . . . but on our side, we're on the cutting-edge using remote sensing technology, particularly, satellite photo analyses. Colleagues already have done a world emperor penguin census by satellite, and located populations never before known. We've started similar analyses regarding our 3 species (Adélie, chinstrap, and gentoo) and the next few years, in these regards, will be quire exciting. This work involves lots of ground-truthing by continuing our counting from ships/yachts, so, hopefully, we'll be avoiding some of the difficulties experienced using other methods.
[So let me just understand here. you are located somewhere in the antarctic and count penguins? how do you live and what do you eat there? how do i get this job, i love cold weather and im good in places of solitude and with animals.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1myw05/im_ron_naveen_the_only_person_on_the_planet_whose/ccdy517?context=5)|No, I live in Washington DC. My nonprofit, Oceanites, is based in Maryland, and my counters and I travel south each season, between November and February, to count the Antarctic Peninsula's penguins. We work from ships of all kinds/sizes, which is usually where we get our food.
[Zoology grad student here. Can you elaborate on why those species' numbers are falling? Is their prey population also dwindling? Can they adapt to warmer conditions? Could they relocate where they breed?  What in your opinion, would you say the average citizen can do to help?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1myw05/im_ron_naveen_the_only_person_on_the_planet_whose/ccdzl3u?context=5)|We're now into the ""why"" question. Certainly, there's a strong correlation between the increased temperatures in the Antarctic Peninsula and the changing penguin populations (gentoos up; chinstraps and Adélies down). Some suspect the krill population has shrunk? Others suggest that the weather conditions when the penguins start breeding in October has become too variable. Gentoos, obviously, have adapted (if krill's the issue) by eating more fish. But chinstraps and Adélies also can eat fish . . . why don't they eat more? Maybe they will, over time. Lots still to investigate.
[What do you find the most frustrating part of the climate change ""debate""?

The scientific evidence is there. Some parts of our planet are warming. Glaciers are melting, etc. But, as noted in an answer above, arguing who caused it or whether it's a cycle perhaps isn't key. Are we humans going to be like the gentoo penguins, who are adapting well to their warming climate? Or like the Adélies and chinstraps, who aren't? The question in my mind is whether we humans will be flexible and be able to adapt, if and when we're faced with the same kind of changes my Antarctic penguins are now experiencing. 
[How in the world do you keep count!? How accurate do you think your count is? Would it be easier to take a high def photo of an area and count them vs. while they are waddling around?

And too, again as noted above, lots of analyses now being done with satellite photos, which is taking us toward higher levels of achievement. 
[Have you ever been out counting and encountered an attack by polar bears? What's your protocol for this scenario? How do the penguines react?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1myw05/im_ron_naveen_the_only_person_on_the_planet_whose/ccdy4xy?context=5)|No polar bears in the Antarctic. When the supercontinent Gondwana split apart eons ago, land predators evolved to the north, not south. Nor are there foxes or wolves in Antarctica. Penguins didn't need to fly to survive. Up north, their flying counterparts are the puffins, murres, and guillemots.
[Who pays for you to count penguins?  What do you think about central banks trading carbon credits and making huge sums of money ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1myw05/im_ron_naveen_the_only_person_on_the_planet_whose/ccdy4qn?context=5)|I only keep the Antarctic Site Inventory project going by raising funds via my nonprofit organization, Oceanites.

To keep the margin of error down, our research protocol requires three counts of each penguin group within 3-5% of one another. With smaller groups of 10 to 50 nests or chicks, that goal is not too difficult to achieve. But when you get huge colonies with many hundreds of nests and chicks, that 3-5% target is a challenge. And requires oodles of practice.
 |To avoid double counting and keep track of what's been counted and what's not, you have to find one singular vantage point from which you do all the counting; or you have to walk the same line right to left or left to right, while holding your free hand or field-book in front of you.
 |And of course you need to know what is being counted! In the nest phase, the three penguin species we monitor all construct stone nests, some more elaborate than others. But there are always ""fakers"" sitting tight in their nests, looking like they have eggs, when they really have nothing!
 |And of course, we don't count in our heads. We use those little hand-held tally whackers, clicking the plunger for each nest or chick.
 |All the time, we're aiming for complete, site-wide counts and even if we're good and efficient, it sometimes takes a very long time to get an entire site counted. At a place like Petermann Island, which is about a mile long and a half-a-mile wide, it will take two of our best counters at least 4-6 hours in decent weather to count the entire island which has about 2,400 gentoo penguin nests and 450 Adélie penguin nests. The huge Baily Head chinstrap penguin colony at Deception Island had more than 50,000 nests and took us two days to count. 
[That's pretty incredible. But if you're going from left to right or however you orient yourself, how do you account for the penguins roaming about?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1myw05/im_ron_naveen_the_only_person_on_the_planet_whose/ccdy4pp?context=5)|In the spring, the nests don't move.

[Great AMA - love penguins and recently published a paper with collaborators regarding climate change in Australia and the impact on parasite infections in Little Blues.  My question is with the increase in traffic to Antarctica, both research and tourist, is there concern about about spread of Infection Bursal Disease Virus to these large penguin populations? Do you think climate change will contribute to an expansion in viruses and disease vectors in penguin populations that previously had little risk because of the environmental conditions?  Edit: grammar.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1myw05/im_ron_naveen_the_only_person_on_the_planet_whose/cce0cub?context=5)|Definitely worried. At our Petermann Island campsite (2003-08), with snow cover melting away earlier and earlier, we saw an increase in avian tick infestation during the breeding season. No question that climate change may contribute to an expansion in viruses and disease vectors in penguin populations — and it's a factor we've got underlined in red to follow!

 |Everywhere, including Antarctica, assessment and monitoring are the keys to long-term environmental protection. So . . . whatever support can be given to projects like the Antarctic Site Inventory, the more data and analyses are in place to, hopefully, sway the mangers to conserve whatever they're intending to conserve.

But I will say that one of the best parts of working there is that there are no distractions — no radio or TV, no politicians or newspapers . . . just you, the penguins, the fresh air, incredible scenery, and hearing your heartbeat thumping loudly through your parka. It is, truly, biological (and emotional) overload to be there.

Which species do you have? I'm most fascinated by the way they live — my three species perhaps live 10 years in the wild, live in the world's coldest climate (air and water), and somehow survive. It's a testament to how some creatures succeed, evolutionarily speaking. And where I work in western Antarctica, the Antarctic Peninsula, it's warming faster than anywhere else on the planet — over the last 50 years, an increase of 5˚F year-round and 9˚F in winter. That's HUGE. The change is causing lots of adaptation and those penguins who are showing some flexibility (e.g. in what they eat, or when they start breeding) are making it. More specifically, Adélie and chinstrap penguin numbers in the Peninsula are falling significantly, while gentoo penguin numbers are rising significantly.
[Has anyone come up to you while you were counting and started saying numbers to mess you up?  ""21...22...23...24...""  ""12! 32! 7! 66!""

[I always wondered what pinguins act like if they see a human approaching.

I moved out to New Jersey to live with my bf and ended up working in a bookstore. We recently moved to NYC, Brooklyn specifically, and I'm having trouble finding work.

My background: As an undergraduate I was enrolled in an Americorps program where I volunteered a gazillion hours for very little pay. I volunteered primarily with the local historical society and the local art museum. I also held down a part time job on campus working for the college libraries. I had two paid summer internships in museum work and one unpaid internship with a fancy-pants museum.

The plan: I've been applying to library/bookstore/museum jobs and haven't had much luck. The original plan, and by original I mean the one I thought of as a dewey-eyed freshman, was to apply to graduate schools and get my masters in museum education after graduation. However, having been thrust out into the real world a while now, I've reconsidered that position. I would like to continue my education at some point but I'm not interested in paying 60k to do it. I know far too many people un and underemployed with the debt from their masters looming over them.

Specific skill sets: I write grants. I have cash-handling skills. I'm great at customer service. I'm very well organized. I research. I lead tours. I know a lot about books. I run workshops. I use social media. I'm a decent editor. I work well independently. 

Other things I have going for me: I don't have any debt from my undergraduate degree! I have some work experience. I write a mean cover letter. My bf is covering expenses until I find work.

New plan?: I guess what I'm looking for is other jobs that might work with my existing skill sets. I will continue to apply to jobs that are in familiar territory, but I need to branch out. My bf, who is a computer software engineer, would like to see me do something tech-related, but I don't know if I have the motivation to teach myself something as complex as coding. Any thoughts? I'm all ears.

I have worked two internships in the past, one of which was mainly design work and the other was heavy field world. I was working in quality control on a large industrial site. I am primarily looking for field work as opposed to the everyday desk job, however I know that the two go hand in hand. Should any of you have any contacts or are able to help in anyway, please message me with your contact information and proof of your employment for I will not hand out my personal information if not validated for security reasons. Thank you all for your time.

I'm using a throwaway because too many people know my regular username. 

I'm trying to figure out what the best way is to maximize my savings and what I should be doing in terms of paying off loans and investing in my retirement. I'm 25 years old and I graduated from law school in 2012. 

I had to take out a lot of debt to go to law school to cover tuition, books, and living expenses, and I currently owe almost $175,000 including my undergrad loans. This figure is daunting. If I were to make standard payments, they would be $2,073 a month. There is absolutely no way I can afford that much right now. 

For a long time after I graduated I couldn't find any work. Back in April I got a temporary job that lasted until June where I was making $22 an hour and even had overtime occasionally. I was living with my parents and my expenses were almost entirely gasoline and food I bought during the weekends when I would visit my boyfriend, who lived 100 miles away from my parent's house. The rest of the money I earned was thrown at student loans because I figured the best plan was to pay them down quickly. 

In August I moved in with him because I finally found a job in his area. I currently have a part time job where I work 28 hours a week at $20 and another job where I work 12-16 hours a week at $15 an hour. The second job is a temporary internship that will probably only last another month. There is a chance they will receive funding to re-hire me for another internship. I am applying to jobs 5 days a week trying to get something full time, better paying, or both. 

I just signed up for Pay As You Earn and Income Based Repayment and they calculated that my monthly payments should be $0 for now. I understand this will increase as I make more money. 20 years from now the remainder of my loans will be forgiven and I will have to pay taxes on that money. I would like to start saving for that now.  

My boyfriend and I just signed a lease for a 2 bedroom apartment that we're going to share with a roommate as soon as we can start showing the apartment and find a responsible person to live with. The apartment is $1969 a month, plus utilities. 

I don't have a car payment, because I have an old car that is paid off. I am lucky enough to have my parents still pay for my car insurance, health insurance, and my cell phone. I am turning 26 in March. At this point I will no longer be covered under their health plan. I don't have any credit card debt.

I don't have an emergency fund right now, because I just started earning money again and because I know that my parents would be able to help me if anything were to happen. I would like to have some kind of cushion built up but it doesn't necessarily have to be the 6-12 months of expenses that is the usual recommendation.

 My basic questions are:
1. Should I be paying more than the minimum on my student loans? 
2. What is the best way to both set money aside to pay the eventual loan forgiveness tax and save for retirement? "

Of course we all believe we can rise above any situation and meet our goals, and I think that's really not a cliche thought.

I'm talking about goals you set for yourself that go beyond what you're doing at this exact moment.  A software engineer that finally decides that his passion for music is at a breaking point and he decides that he wants to go forward with his band, so he quits his job.  

There was a speaker in one of my classes today who really set off a spark in me.  

He's around 26-27.  He was a former student of the program I'm in at the moment.  He has a successful magazine in New York.  It's also viewed worldwide.

Hearing his stories, from humble beginnings in College of getting published in a nationwide VW magazine and starting an Ice Cream Truck business for one summer, to getting an internship for Rolling Stone magazine, to visiting India and having some powerful experiences.  It pops out as one of the best motivational speeches I've ever heard.  It had nothing to do with presentation, but his advice.  

It all came back to pushing yourself and making connections that will further you for your entire life.  He knew two people in New York when he moved there for his internship.  Now he knows some of the biggest heads of advertising, marketing, photography; anything to do with magazine publications.  How did he do it?  He asked questions constantly, pushed editors to see if they needed stories, made sure that his presence was known.  

It comes back to perseverance in your particular niche.  Making those calls, interviewing, going to a concert and screaming to Method Man that you want an interview (which he did, and he got the interview).  The thing the motivates me the most is that he's so young, yet he's done all of this in a span of about 8 years.  I've done fuckall in those 8 years, and now I'm ready to take the next step.  We'll see where that brings me."

1myt9d,4,2013-09-23,How do I [21/F] foster a relationship [3mo] with a great guy [25/M] who's moving away?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1myt9d/how_do_i_21f_foster_a_relationship_3mo_with_a/,"Where to start.

So I had an internship this summer at chemistry lab in the city I go to college in and met an alumnus from my college who graduate the year before I came (I'm a senior now). We were both chemistry majors and he tried to talk to me a lot more in the beginning but I was totally oblivious to his interest. When I started working in his department in mid-July, he got bolder and was super flirty (tickling me, cracking jokes, lingering looks). He grew on me very quickly. We started to go out for drinks after work, despite him working 2nd shift and I worked 1st shift. After I left the lab, the past month and a half we have been going to shows (he took me to a Talking Heads cover band last weekend) and movies, along with drinks and dinner. He's hilarious (he's into clowning), a realist, smart, responsible and good in bed. We are pretty smitten with each other. I’m so excited to get to know him even better, have great experiences, conversations and adventures. We are really good together.

What's the problem?

He got a research position 4 hours away in another state and moving today.

This whole weekend has been bittersweet. I had drinks with him and his friends on Friday and he asked me to be his girlfriend. He's was like ""Ehh, long distance, but it'll work"" or something along those lines. I stayed over that night and we went out for a usual breakfast the next morning. He's a great conversationalist as well very observant of his surroundings in a comical sense. So am I, I haven't found someone like that, ever. We always notice the ridiculous things people do and just find them super amusing despite the average person not finding it funny.

This maybe weird, but he was casually dropping marrying me. He was joking about how we are gonna have 6 kids and I jokingly added that they will all have biblical names starting with the same letter like Malachai, Matthew etc. Yesterday he continued to make comments like that. We went for breakfast again and there was this super pregnant petite lady in front of us. He said that I will probably look that when I got pregnant, super cute and glowy and petite (I'm 5'2"", 103 lbs) He asked me if I wanted kids but I sort of laughed nervously as he stated he wanted no more than 3 kids. He's one of those guys that will be such an amazing husband and father in the future.

It must be hormones or something, but I think that I'm having this weird marriage fever feeling recently. I fantasize about marrying an awesome guy and just having a great life and family together. It was something I never had. Only child of a single mother (only child too). What a combo man. My guy grew up with 3 older brothers and family is super important in his life. His oldest brother just recently got married and it’s probably getting to him too.

Anyways, we had a bittersweet moment last night after one last dinner. He says he slightly regrets taking the job since he met me, but he’ll probably feel differently in 2 weeks once he gets settled. We exchanged CDs (I made him a mix and 2 Old Crow Medicine Show albums, which is my ""band""; He lent me 5 Phish albums, which is his ""band"")He was super nonchalant (despite being pretty  glum and anxious about moving in general)about the interaction. I went home super crushed, I was surprised, because I’m normally a pretty level headed person when it comes to emotions. I’ve been in a funk all morning, I can’t really stop thinking about him.

I’m slightly worried about him meeting someone in his new city, but (as conceited as this sounds) I’m a really good catch especially for him. I guess when you see us together, you may wonder “How did he get her??”. He’s a super awkward nerdy looking guy, not particularly cute or handsome, but damn, he has a great personality. I’m honestly not into anyone at my college or in my city. I’m also super busy with my senior thesis and school so I haven’t wanted to date anyone, other than this guy.

I graduate in May 2014 and will be looking for chemistry related jobs. I’m fantasizing that he may be able to get me a job and I can move down there. (The city is a very old southern coast town, close to very awesome city that I would love to live in)

So r/relationships, I really want to make it work with him. I plan on visiting him, mailing him stuff, and potentially staying with him for a week in the winter. I see him one last time tonight (hopefully) and I want to really talk to him about what will happen in the next few months. He constantly mentions a “future” of us doing stuff together (me visiting for his birthday in November, coming to see my thesis presentation next semester). Any advice or observations?


*tl;dr: Met an awesome clown, but he’s moving 4 hours away and I want to still foster our relationship, as it has the potential to be really great.

I’m looking at myself in the reflection of my window. 

*I’m not happy*

Its quarter to 5 in the morning. I spent my night drinking a bit, going to a few parties then going back to my fraternity house to hang out with my friends. 

*I’m happy.*

Last night, I was drunk as hell. I drank a shit ton of beer, was very drunk, ended up taking a girl home and having sex with her. 

*I’m fucking awesome*

I woke up this morning, had sex again, took her to her car… came back… slept… see paragraph 3 for my night so far. 

*I’m pretty “meh”*

I have a life many people would want. I’m not rich by any means, but I am blessed with a great family who love and support me, friends who love and hang out with me, and am currently pursuing a higher education. 

*Ah, fuck.*

*What the hell is wrong with me?*

I can’t study. I can’t go to class. I take that back, I CAN do both of those, but my laziness/anxiety is hindering both. I say “hindering” because I could fight through it, but it’s difficult. 
I keep shoving this taco bell in my mouth like it’s going to make me feel better.

*I’m debating whether or not to crack open another beer. I feel like it will make my writing better… not grammatically, but entertaining.*

For some reason, I’m obsessed with how people view me. To a certain point, that is a normal feeling. People are always worried about what their image is. I think my view is different. I have a huge amount of anxiety about how my classmates, who literally couldn’t give two shits about me, see me. When I skip a class and go back, its not the normal “shit, better get notes from someone” its “holy fuck, everyone in that class is going to see me as a douchebag, failure, fuck up, and tell everyone they know about how that kid with the shaved head skipped class.” So, naturally, my reaction to these thoughts is to never, EVER, go back to that class again. 

*I hate myself.*

*By the way, the beer is cracked.*

*Holy shit, its 5:15.*

*I want to go to sleep, but I’m afraid that when I wake up and become sober ,I won’t be as honest.*

Am I really depressed? The hwole reason I became depressed is because I put off a paper. I put it off, then never did it. And because I didn’t do it, I started skipping that class. “Well, fuck, I’m skipping this class and probably going to fail it, might as well not go to any classes.” Then, started realizing my life was falling apart and broke down.
I brought this on myself and I haven’t learned from it. I know I haven’t learned, because ive been skipping classes this semester… A lot of classes. 
I’m wasting my life.
I’ve always been a shitty student. I can remember the first time I didn’t do an assignment… It was 4th grade, I forgot to draw something ( or whatever) and I pretended to look in my desk for it. I looked frantically, knowing full well there was nothing there, for my missing assignment. I was late for my bus, so I pointed to a girl in my class ( I think it was Kelly) and asked her to look for the assignment. Of course it wasn’t there. Nothing happened. I’m pretty sure nothing happened and I went on with my 4th grade self. Pretty sure that is how my whole “not doing homework” thing started. I say that because 5th grade is when I started having problems with not doing assignments and parents getting involved. I was constantly yelled at and punished, sort of, for not doing my homework. This carried over to high school. I never did homework. I was always brought up during parent-teacher conferences and how I never did anything. Up until my senior year of high school, I never got above a 2.5 GPA. Senior year I had a 3.1. 


Best part is, every year of high school… and college for that matter… I said/say to myself “ this year will be different.” It never is.



*I fucking hate myself.*

So here I am... 23 years old. Starting a new major, won't graduate until after this year, fucking up like I always am. No relative internships in what i'm now going into, shit GPA, and the same old fucking bullshit. Idk what to do.

*fuck*


Edit: Little back story... I was going through depression for most of 2012. Didn't get diagnosed until later in the year after failing 2 semesters of college. I was on medication for about 2 months then stopped. Was a little better when it came to school but still only got like a 2.5 for the semester. I decided to switch my major and go into something different and here i am... 5th year of college, new major, old habits."

Except one from my UG college others didn't agree.",[deleted],gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/1myp05/recommendation_letter_problem_from_whom_to_get/,"I am applying for MS in computer science around this year end. I am from India(finished my UG in CS). I will be mostly applying to European universities and to some in the USA too.

My problem is that my university department was relatively new in my college and there were mostly temporary and visiting faculty. So, now after 4 years there's only one who I think will agree to write me recommendation letters. 

However, I can arrange for many from my work. And maybe from my internship guide too(which was a professor at another US college/University at the time where I did my internship).

How do you think I will manage? Because there's just one guy in my college who is ready to give me recommendation. Others (in another department who taught me) have simply refused giving lame excuses(yes, this happens here) like he is already writing for others(no use trying to fight them because after that I would rather not have them write it for me). This has nothing to do with my performance in college and so, this is just college politics and the faculty members are mostly shoddy and autocratic. It's a government college here.

Problem is:

- Most universities need more than or at least 2 recommendations from college/university.
- But there's just one guy who has agreed.

How to handle this? Can I talk to the university I am applying to and ask them to consider my internship recommendation or recommendations from work instead?"

The last ""informational interview"" I had the guy (who is at the top of his field) told me I won't find a career with advancement opportunities without an MA and I should go back to school now rather than struggle to find an admin assistant job which I'll keep for a year or two before realizing I need to go back to school to get anywhere.

Granted he also said having an MA isn't a guaranteed ticket to a job either, but with one my applications will be taken more seriously and I have a chance of getting a meaningful professional career.

I am an active reader in this subreddit and have seen some people say getting an MA is a waste of time and money, but it seems to me that in DC and in the international studies field (think tanks, government, NGOs, etc.) it is a requirement for any job above admin assistant / event planner (and even those are difficult to get).

If I do go back to school starting fall 2014, what is the best way to use this year so there isn't a random gap on my resume? Keep looking for ""entry level"" jobs?

Fortunately (unfortunately), I got myself an SE1 position. I was actually applying for a more junior position at the company but HR recommended I try for this other one as well and see where it goes.

I actually did well in the interview and received the good news a couple weeks later.

When I looked at the job posting afterwards (yes I know), the requirements were actually pretty intimidating. More than what I would normally apply for. Same language and field, mind you, but a couple years of experience higher.

What's going on you little piggies? I know it's a surprise and shit, but I've been reading this sub for a while, and this is my first post.  Fuck green text.  Oh yeah, this story started happened last week.

So be me, mid 20's, 6'1'', 180 lbs, in shape and active guy...I know, I know, what a catch right??  I work as a freelancer in the advertising industry and last Monday I started a gig doing account management and creative strategy shit at a decent ad agency here in the city.  So I walk in for work, meet and exchange niceties with everyone, and you know, start earning my paycheck.  Booze ain't gonna pay for iself.  All of a sudden, my chair starts rolling back.  What the fuck? A split second later, I hear the floorboards of this awesome old school hardwood floor start creaking.  It's getting to the point where I gotta grab my desk so I don't roll back any further.  ""Huh, uhm Hamber.  It luuks like we'ah gunna be wurkin' next tuh eachotha.""  This stunner must've been 5'3'', mid 20’s, and 350lbs of pure curves.  The kind of curves that scream ""I fuck black dudes.""

Oh fuck. Now don't get me wrong, I hate fat people as much as the next guy.  But working right next to a god damn mini moon?  Fuck me.  

We shake hands and shit, and after wiping the crisco from my hand, I get back to sending out emails. 

Then it starts.  *crunch chew crunch chew*  It's not even 10 am and this bitch is eating onion rings.  Motherfuckin' onion rings.  Where she got 'em from?  Fuck if I know.  I squint my eyes and look over at her from the corner of 'em, I must have looked like an evil villain plotting someone's demise or some shit, when I notice her wiping her greasy pig hooves on her pants.  Nice.  Then the smell hits me.  The motherfuckin' smell.  Ever drink coffee at the fried food tent at a county fair?  Me neither, but I'm pretty sure this experience was pretty damn close.  Every 10 minutes on the dot, no joke, this cocktail of nothing is asking me shit I couldn't care less about.  ""Yuh know thut band 1 Duhrection, they so cuuute.""  ""Aren't they like 16?""  ""Haaay, what do yuu thunk abuut gurls wearing white pants after labor day?""  ""If my girlfriend tried it, she'd be eating by herself for a week.""  ""HUH HUH HUH HUH!!! YUH SOOO FUN-NEE!"" ""What makes you think I'm joking?""  Bitch, like you need to be seen in white pants anyway... 

So it's like 11:00 at this point and this she-cow just started on her second bag of potato chips and is eyeing up a box of cheez-its like it's name is Jamal Williams. Jesus Christ, you know how as soon as you meet some people you just automatically don't like them?  I'd rather hang out with those people for an entire weekend then work next to this fucking abortion for a minute longer.   I wanted to drown this bitch.

Lunchtime rolls up on me.  Not a minute too soon.  Some of the other employees who I met earlier approach me at my desk and ask me if I want to go out to lunch with them.  No doubt.  As I get up to walk away, I glance in Hamber's direction and notice the slight look of rejection come across her fat face as we walk away.  That's right bitch, I'm going to sit with the cool kids and you ain't invited.  

Lunch is pretty uneventful and we start walking back to our office building.  On the way, we stop at a Whole Foods, some of the guys wanted to grab something to snack on for the rest of the day.  Oh, that's cool.  As I'm walking around with some of the group, I see hummus is on sale.  No. Fucking. Way.  See, like anyone else, I have my vices.  Booze? You fat-asses couldn't tie my drinking shoes.  Gambling?  My dad once drove 4 hours up to my college to slap me around after he found out I blew half my tuition check at the black jack table in a weekend.  Strippers?  I'm known as the guy who walks into the strip club screaming ""who wants to go to college?!?!?!""  But hummus?  Ohhh hummus.  I could eat 2 pounds in a day...ask me how I know.  So bam, I jump on that pack of hummus like a fat kid on a cupcake.  Where's the baby carrots? Boom.  Cucumber? I’ve got plans for you too.  Okay, back to work.

So it’s around 2:00 and I hear that hummus calling my name.  You got it baby.  I take my cucumber and carrots to the kitchen, wash 'em off, slice em and dice em and come back…your man's about to get busy.  I dive into that shit like Scrooge McDuck.  That's when Hamber starts staring at me.  I mean fucking STARING at me...like I called her kids ugly or some shit.  Fuck her, she ain't dipping her chips into my hummus. This MY hummus.  I enjoy my Middle Eastern treat for the rest of the day and am so wrapped up in it that I completely forgot Hamber’s existence 8 feet to my left, you know, until she started wiping her crumbs off of her gullet/stomach and they came flying at me like some fucking shrapnel.  Fucking fat bitches, always trying to share their empty calories… 

Tuesday rolls around like it normally does.  I get to work, start typing.  Boom, email from HR comes in.  Oh, okay, probably something for me to sign, right? I mosey my way down there and get to homeboys office.  ""Hey, I'm Paul_El, you emailed me?""  ""Oh yeah, come on in Paul, have a seat.  So Paul, I know you just started freelancing here, but an issue has been addressed.""  
What the fuck? Should I not have slept with that hot intern after I took her to the bar last night? 
""You see, Hamber has filed a complaint."" 
""Oh, this oughta be good."" 
He actually laughs when I say that, ""oh, it is.  Paul.."" he actually looks down and shakes his head…”Jesus Christ, I can’t believe I’m actually asking this…Did you go out and buy health food yesterday and eat it at your desk to fat-shame Hamber?”  
I actually burst out laughing.  Like full on fucking laughing.  As you can tell, I don’t really take anything too seriously.  Life’s too fucking short and I’m just trying to live.  (In between breaths) “What?!?!?!”  
“Yeah, I know, I know…”  
“No I didn’t finish…did she actually write ‘fat-shame’?!?!?!” 
“Yeah, man.”  Round two of laughing commences.  As I wipe the tears from my eyes, I notice HR dude even sees the humor in this, but then I realize, this is corporate America, and I get serious for a second.  “Listen, HR Dude, can I call you HR Dude?”  “Yeah, go right ahead, Paul_El.”  
“HR Dude, I didn’t have to take PSYC101 in college to tell you this is a clear cut case of her insecurity.  That woman was eating onion rings at 10am yesterday, by 11am sh-“  
“She was eating onion rings at 10am?” 
“YEAH! By 11 there wasn’t a Cheez-It in the building that was safe.”  
He looks down at his desk…”Jesus…”  
“That’s what I’m saying man!  So back to what I was saying, she knows her eating habits are atrocious at best and the fact that I choose to eat healthy pissed her off, even more so because I was eating healthy in front of her.  I wasn’t trying to ‘fat-shame’ her (oh you better believe I used air quotes), the only shame she felt was her own.  All I was doing was dipping some vegetables into hummus and enjoying my snack.”  
“You didn’t look at her or suggest that she change her diet?”  
“WHAT?!?!” 
“She feels that you were ‘silently judging and suggesting she change her lifestyle.’ “
 “Oh, this is rich,” I say. “Honestly, HR Dude, I find it unbelievable you’re wasting your time with this.  This is like me taking a car to work while you choose to bike in and then I have the audacity to say  you’re ‘envio-shaming’ or ‘green-shaming’ (more motherfuckin’ air quotes) me by saying that you’re silently judging me and making me feel inferior because I choose to drive.”  
“Dude, you’re preaching to the choir.  Listen man, just go back to your desk and I hope you enjoy your day. I’ll take care of all of this.”  
“Thanks.  Can I ask you something?”
He already knows. “Yeah, I get a lot of complaints from her.”
We both laugh.  HR Dude is good people. 
I walk back to my desk, and there she is, all 350lbs. of disgustingness.  “Just getting in? Luttle late huh?”  Bitch, the word little has no business coming out of your mouth. 
“No.”  
“Oh, where wurr youuu?”  
“You know I was down at HR dealing with your complaint.”  
“Ohhh, well I hope uh got muh point across.  Uht’s not nice tuh do whut yah did.”  
Oh bitch. Ohhhh bitch. At that, I calmly got up, walked to the kitchen, took a handful of my baby carrots out of the fridge and walked back.  When I got back, I walked up next to her desk and when she looked up at me, I shoved all 6 carrots in my mouth and began chewing.  She ran out of the room.  I get back to my desk, sit down, and look at my computer, smile all full of bits of carrot.  My first thought?  “See you later HR Dude.”

1myin6,0,2013-09-23,I wrote this when I was drunk the other night. Guess I needed to get it out.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1myin6/i_wrote_this_when_i_was_drunk_the_other_night/,"Who the fuck am i?


I’m looking at myself in the reflection of my window. 

*I’m not happy*

Its quarter to 5 in the morning. I spent my night drinking a bit, going to a few parties then going back to my fraternity house to hang out with my friends. 

*I’m happy.*

Last night, I was drunk as hell. I drank a shit ton of beer, was very drunk, ended up taking a girl home and having sex with her. 

*I’m fucking awesome*

I woke up this morning, had sex again, took her to her car… came back… slept… see paragraph 3 for my night so far. 

*I’m pretty “meh”*

I have a life many people would want. I’m not rich by any means, but I am blessed with a great family who love and support me, friends who love and hang out with me, and am currently pursuing a higher education. 

*Ah, fuck.*

*What the hell is wrong with me?*

I can’t study. I can’t go to class. I take that back, I CAN do both of those, but my laziness/anxiety is hindering both. I say “hindering” because I could fight through it, but it’s difficult. 
I keep shoving this taco bell in my mouth like it’s going to make me feel better.

*I’m debating whether or not to crack open another beer. I feel like it will make my writing better… not grammatically, but entertaining.*

For some reason, I’m obsessed with how people view me. To a certain point, that is a normal feeling. People are always worried about what their image is. I think my view is different. I have a huge amount of anxiety about how my classmates, who literally couldn’t give two shits about me, see me. When I skip a class and go back, its not the normal “shit, better get notes from someone” its “holy fuck, everyone in that class is going to see me as a douchebag, failure, fuck up, and tell everyone they know about how that kid with the shaved head skipped class.” So, naturally, my reaction to these thoughts is to never, EVER, go back to that class again. 

*I hate myself.*

*By the way, the beer is cracked.*

*Holy shit, its 5:15.*

*I want to go to sleep, but I’m afraid that when I wake up and become sober ,I won’t be as honest.*

Am I really depressed? The hwole reason I became depressed is because I put off a paper. I put it off, then never did it. And because I didn’t do it, I started skipping that class. “Well, fuck, I’m skipping this class and probably going to fail it, might as well not go to any classes.” Then, started realizing my life was falling apart and broke down.
I brought this on myself and I haven’t learned from it. I know I haven’t learned, because ive been skipping classes this semester… A lot of classes. 
I’m wasting my life.
I’ve always been a shitty student. I can remember the first time I didn’t do an assignment… It was 4th grade, I forgot to draw something ( or whatever) and I pretended to look in my desk for it. I looked frantically, knowing full well there was nothing there, for my missing assignment. I was late for my bus, so I pointed to a girl in my class ( I think it was Kelly) and asked her to look for the assignment. Of course it wasn’t there. Nothing happened. I’m pretty sure nothing happened and I went on with my 4th grade self. Pretty sure that is how my whole “not doing homework” thing started. I say that because 5th grade is when I started having problems with not doing assignments and parents getting involved. I was constantly yelled at and punished, sort of, for not doing my homework. This carried over to high school. I never did homework. I was always brought up during parent-teacher conferences and how I never did anything. Up until my senior year of high school, I never got above a 2.5 GPA. Senior year I had a 3.1. 


Best part is, every year of high school… and college for that matter… I said/say to myself “ this year will be different.” It never is.



*I fucking hate myself.*

So here I am... 23 years old. Starting a new major, won't graduate until after this year, fucking up like I always am. No relative internships in what i'm now going into, shit GPA, and the same old fucking bullshit. Idk what to do.

*fuck*


Edit: Little back story... I was going through depression for most of 2012. Didn't get diagnosed until later in the year after failing 2 semesters of college. I was on medication for about 2 months then stopped. Was a little better when it came to school but still only got like a 2.5 for the semester. I decided to switch my major and go into something different and here i am... 5th year of college, new major, old habits."
1myhpu,8,2013-09-23,"Am I building a tolerance to Adderall, also will switching up doses influence its effects?",[deleted],ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1myhpu/am_i_building_a_tolerance_to_adderall_also_will/,"I'm fairly new to meds so I'm not exactly sure how long it's supposed to take to find a working solution, but right now, I've worked my way up to 25 mg of adderall per day and it still isn't doing much. I was diagnosed with ADD back in March and since then, I've tried Strattera, which barely did anything, Ritalin which seriously affected my appetite, which made me lose 10 lbs in a month, and now Adderall, which doesn't have any side effects.

I switched to Adderall XR at the beginning summer to help with focus on my internship work and I started with 5 mg per day and worked up to 20 with minimal results. The doctor at my school prescribed me 25 mg per day. It worked great the first day or two, but after that, the effects haven't been very noticable. However, the thing is, I still have over a dozen 20 mg pills left, so I've been taking those on the weekends when I don't have as much work to focus on, and I'm starting to wonder if the change in dosage is affecting how the adderall is working. Also, I can't get a new dosage until I run through my current supply.

I'm a full time college student, and in addition to my normal schoolwork, I'm working 30 hours a week for my internship, so needless to say, focus is a critical factor in my success right now. I've been able to complete my work so far, but it takes me a long time to focus enough to actually complete it. For instance, it can take me 4 or 5 hours to achieve 2 hours of focus.

I looked it up and it says the average dosage is 20mg per day, so I was worried that I'm building a tolerance too fast. Also, in case it's relevant, I'm a 19 year old male and I weigh about 120 lbs. I'm also on 10mg of Buspar twice a day for anxiety.

**TL;DR: I'm on 25mg of Adderall XR per day, and I've been taking my left over 20mg pills on the weekends instead of the 25mg ones, does this affect how Adderall works?**

Should we be ""public"" with our relationship?",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1myh8f/ethical_dillemma_with_me_24m_and_my_gf_19f_should/,"Hey everyone, I need some advice. I currently just made things official with my gf, like a few days ago. We have been hooking up for about 5 months and going on dates since the summer. 

It took me awhile to get over the age difference (about 5.5 yrs), but I finally asked her to be my gf, of which she's been waiting for me to do. (Anyone have any encouragement on this part? not what the post is about but it still kinda bothers me that we are so far apart, I think bc of the social stigma)

Anyway, she is also an intern at a small start-up company that I founded. She became an intern last semester and did a great job. We were flirty and she is also intertwined in other social aspects of my life so I saw her quite often. After the internship ended we hooked up for the first time. 

At one point she asks if she could intern again, I run it by my partners (they didn't know we hooked up) and they said sure she did a great job. So she's back again this semester. 

Fast forward several months, we get more serious over the summer and enter a relationship. Everyone at this point knows what has been going on and we put it up on FB. 

However, one of my partners is upset, he says that the relationship shouldn't be ""public"" on FB. He says it's an ethical dilemma and if the school found out about the relationship they wouldn't let us do internships through the school anymore. But he has no evidence of this and in my opinion is being very far fetched (a usually characteristic).

I'm obviously biased, and I don't think it is a big deal, only our friends can see we are in a relationship on FB. We don't even know what the ""rules"" are for internships and if we would be breaking one. Who would even pursue such action over a start-up that doesn't even pay its own employees? Is this even a big deal? 

What ethical ramifications (if any) are going on? I have not taken advantage of her in anyway, I took it slow and we are in a happy consenting relationship. I feel as though my partner is causing me grief because it's just the way he is, but I want to see what other people's thoughts are. 


---

TLDR: I am dating an intern at my own company (very small start-up, we don't even pay ourselves) and we just went public with our relationship on FB. My partner thinks it's a bad idea (he has known about the relationship but doesn't want it on FB)."

I am really just exhausted. I don't know what to do. I have to get out. I can't travel too far because I am still in school, but I need a new job quickly so I can live while I finish school.

I have anxiety and suffer bad panic attacks and I let them know this and they put me on a register with no training at lunch rush. I was the only open register. 

I really need help figuring out how to get out. Tech support, data entry, being a receptionist. I have been searching on Indeed, CareerBuilder, SnagAJob and Monster, and I just can't seem to get anybody to respond to me. How do I get out? What do I do? I have posted to job boards, gone to employment agencies, and done everything I can, but is there some kind of trick I don't know about? What is wrong with me? Why am I trapped in retail?

I have a B.S. in Soil Science and Hydrology from UC Davis and live in CA. I did a year long internship at Davis and than worked for over two years with a small company that did environmental monitoring. The job was very low key, and did not require many formalities (certs). I have no regrets and enjoyed the work, but the company went under and I have to start from scratch. I do not want to work in environmental monitoring anymore. I just don't see much promise in the field (cue someone in EM handing me a job).

I have NO environmental certifications, but I have time and money to get them. I cannot however go back to get an MS or PhD. Grad school would be nice, but I want to pick a real career first. I'm ok with entry level and not getting paid as much as I used to. Just want a career I can build and I can respect.

I'm not a ""follow your dreams"" kinda guy. Been there, done that. i want to make money and work my ass off. I also can move to nearly any location as long as my fiancee can work (she's a a psychologist).

* What kind of certs should I go for?  I'm OK with getting certs I might not use. I'd rather have options.

* I'm not sure which field I want to work in right now, but I'm open to many things. Any suggestions with my skill set?

* Last time I looked for work, the state was crippled by the recession. Is anything different?

* I tend to dislike the public sector. Am I doomed to work for them?

* Is being a Environmental Health Specialist any fun?

* If I had (insert a certification), would I have a better chance of being hired?

* Are there any bullshit certs that I should avoid or are a complete waste of money?

* Should I do HAZWOPER online or in person. If in person, then with whom and where?

* What kind of jobs can you get with a Registered Environmental Forester, Registered Environmental Biologist etc?

* Is a professional geologist impossible for me?

Thanks for your help. I'm a bit frustrated what to do here.

1my2iw,3,2013-09-23,Choosing my career path: eSport vs. Regular sport?,tetrismaan,starcraft,https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/1my2iw/choosing_my_career_path_esport_vs_regular_sport/,"Hi Reddit,

I'm writing this post here, since I don't know a more dedicated eSport community for online gaming than the Starcraft community.


In a year I will be done with my BA in **Sports Management**, and for the last semester I have to go on an internship in a sports organization or club.

Having followed eSport for the past 10 years I am aware of the growth and potential of the market, but I am still in doubt of whether I should try to get an internship in a eSport organization/club, since I don't know if it is worth following this branch of sports.


I love both football (soccer) and eSports equally. 


* With a career in the football business I will get a stable income and future, but in a line of business that already are developed, and my chances of doing anything groundbreaking is smaller than with a career in eSport.


* E-sport is a young line of business, where I can't be sure to get a job and an income where I can live of it, but on the other hand, I will be doing what I love, and I will be able to combine hobby with job (every ones wish, right?). Except somewhere in the future I want to actually be able to provide for a family.


So my question for you r/starcraft is, **do you think that eSport will grow large enough for me to have my entire life-career in the business?** If anyone got any statistics, inside knowledge or anything else that would be useful, I would be glad if they where to be posted here :-)

*TL;DR: Do you think that eSport will grow large enough for me to have my entire life-career in the business?*

1my1vc,3,2013-09-23,Transferring to Brown?,Sidd26,BrownU,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrownU/comments/1my1vc/transferring_to_brown/,"Hey there,

I'm currently a freshmen in my university (UC Merced) and started to think about transferring recently. I had a couple of questions, so I thought I'd just ask this subreddit since it exists.

1. Is it better to transfer after your 1st year or wait till you finish your 2nd year and transfer into the school as a junior? I know for other UC's you need to be junior standing to apply (so you apply the 2nd half of sophomore year), but that's just for the UC system. How does it work for Brown?

2. If I did pretty poorly in Highschool, can I expect that to be a dealbreaker for my admission? I wasn't spectacular in HS and to be completely honest I'm just happy I have a fresh new start in college, so now I know not to make the same mistakes I did back then. Also, my SAT/ACT scores were pretty average/subpar, so do you guys think it might be a good idea to just try once more before I apply?

3. Do they have tours sometime in early January? Until then I'm pretty much busy with school here in CA and have break up until the 14th of Jan, so I was wondering if tours go on a daily basis. 

4. The supplement is honestly crazy long, so I'm planning on starting it sometime in the upcoming months; how can I write them as clearly and concisely as possible without making it sound like I want to tell them what they want to hear?

5. Has anyone ever tried to get their Masters in 4/5 years here? Is it possible to double major, and if so, is it common? How are the opportunities in RI(volunteer, research and internships)? 

6. Finally, how can I know which of my classes are transferable and which aren't? 

Thank you, sorry if it feels like a bunch of questions just asking random things, I just thought I'd get some concerns cleared. Again, thanks."

HIMYM, or How I met Your Mother is a comedy of a father telling his kids the story of how he met their mother.  He ends up going way off track, and telling about all the fun times he had with his friends, things he did at the bar, and dating. People love the show's mix of comedy, romance, and seriousness.  

The [first episode](http://media.tumblr.com/ca5695005c71ab44ecb0914809abe7ee/tumblr_inline_mfjvetyYPk1r5g3i5.gif) of the final season of How I Met Your Mother starts tonight.  [Ted, the main character and father](http://i.imgur.com/6fDxMJk.jpg) has yet to meet his future wife, who was shown on the final episode of the previous season, so this season will be filled with their relationship.  Also, the majority of the season is said to take place at [Barney](http://i.imgur.com/lZ7TqJx.jpg) and [Robin](http://i.imgur.com/5J60hHT.jpg), two of Ted's best friends, wedding.  Me and many others are going to be sad that the show is over, and remember our favorite moments from the show.  Mine would have to be the slap bets, and Barney losing the bet with Lily and having to wear a [duck tie](http://images5.fanpop.com/image/photos/25900000/7x03-Ducky-Tie-barney-stinson-25935299-1280-720.jpg)

Many people like the show for its mix of [comedy](http://i.imgur.com/qU0lOrH.jpg) and [romance.](http://i.imgur.com/jiQkEqH.gif)  I personally like the awesome things in the show that they spend tons of time on.

Here are some Q&amp;As I had with the mods of /r/HIMYM :

****

&gt;##1. Favorite episode of HIMYM?

&gt;&gt;**atticus138** Oh wow, loaded question... S02E09: Slap Bet is definitely a classic. I love how this joke continues throughout the series. 

&gt;&gt;**dlm04e** Favorite ep would have to be the one where Marshall finds out his dad died. Jason Segal didn't read the other lines in the scripts, so he didn't know what the countdown was for and his reaction at the en of the ep was genuine. The feels man, the feels.

&gt;&gt;**Thlowe** Hard to answer, but the one that sticks out in my mind is Bad News. Some people think the whole countdown aspect took away from a very poignant moment, but I really feel like it added a lot to the episode.

&gt;##2. How do you feel about the show coming to an end?

&gt;&gt;**Atticus138** I hate when any show I enjoy finally ends. Honestly though, it's run its course. As much as I don't want to admit it, it's time. 

&gt;&gt;**dlm04e** I'm not going to know what to do with myself. 

&gt;&gt;**Thlowe** Hate to say this as the (more-or-less) creator of this sub, but I am glad it's ending. I still love the show, but like atticus says, it's definitely run it's course. It's time.

&gt;##3. Any other shows that you especially enjoy?

&gt;&gt;**Atticus138** Oh man, where to begin? Some of my favorites are Modern Family, The Office, Parks and Recreation, Trailer Park Boys, Breaking Bad, The Walking Dead, It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia... I could go on all day, but I'll stop there. 

&gt;&gt;**dlm40e** Long list here. Scrubs, Entourage, True Blood, Breaking Bad, Simpsons, Family Guy, Futurama, Eureka, Warehouse 13, Stargate(all of them), Jeopardy and so many more.

&gt;&gt;**Thlowe** Breaking Bad, Firefly, Black Books, Louie, Arrested Development, Buffy/Angel, Dollhouse, The Wire, Game of Thrones, Parks &amp; Rec, Community, Chuck, The IT Crowd, Deadwood, Justified, GIRLS...I watch a lot of TV, and love most of what I see.

He's letting me intern there 3 times a week, and I'm literally recording artist/bands, mixing them, with the help of my mentor of course.  In the next couple months he said he's going to hire me as a producer along with him because he has a lot of other things he's doing.  I plan on making my own music studio in the future; that's what I'm going to be as my career; a music producer.  So I'm definitely getting the experience to become one, and I don't need to ""impress"" a company with a 4-year degree at Berklee or some other school.  I'm really stuck on whether I should go to a music college or not.  I've heard many people say that I should, and many people say it's a waste.  What are your thoughts?

However, I'm having a bit of trouble finding credible reviews, and all of the websites for the schools are... not so great. I'm in the DC area, I see there's Transcon Aviation in Manassas, VA. That would be close, but I have no idea what this school is like. I suppose I can go to an interview there, but I wont really have anything to compare it to.

Are any of you familiar with dispatch schools? If so, which are the best? I'm able to travel anywhere in the US for the course. I'd like to find one that helps you find work, even if it's an internship or something. I'm also not interested in a degree program for it, just the license.

I'm an EMT and pre-nursing student in Michigan, and part of the honors college at my University. One of the things that's a requirement for the honors program is some form of study abroad or internship before you graduate. I am all for this, as it comes with a huge scholarship that makes my trip essentially free and I would love that life experience. Ever since I heard of it I've wanted to go to Australia or New Zealand and study abroad there. 

My only problem is, the only two established options for a nursing student are trips to Cambodia and Kenya every year, neither of which are particularly appealing to me. In order for me to go to Australia, I have to find an opportunity in the next few months and get it approved by the University. I've tried emailing some professors over at Australian universities but I haven't gotten any responses, and I guess I'm just not sure if I'm looking in the right way. I should probably email a few hospitals as well but I feel like that isn't the most efficient manner of searching. Ideally I would like to do something in a hospital, clinic, or nursing home, or even on an ambulance as I am already EMT certified here in the states.

If anyone here has advice on how to find a study abroad program, or has some connection in Australia, please respond! I would love someone with experience to throw me some information. Thank you in advance.

I’m looking at myself in the reflection of my window. 

*I’m not happy*

Its quarter to 5 in the morning. I spent my night drinking a bit, going to a few parties then going back to my fraternity house to hang out with my friends. 

*I’m happy.*

Last night, I was drunk as hell. I drank a shit ton of beer, was very drunk, ended up taking a girl home and having sex with her. 

*I’m fucking awesome*

I woke up this morning, had sex again, took her to her car… came back… slept… see paragraph 3 for my night so far. 

*I’m pretty “meh”*

I have a life many people would want. I’m not rich by any means, but I am blessed with a great family who love and support me, friends who love and hang out with me, and am currently pursuing a higher education. 

*Ah, fuck.*

*What the hell is wrong with me?*

I can’t study. I can’t go to class. I take that back, I CAN do both of those, but my laziness/anxiety is hindering both. I say “hindering” because I could fight through it, but it’s difficult. 
I keep shoving this taco bell in my mouth like it’s going to make me feel better.

*I’m debating whether or not to crack open another beer. I feel like it will make my writing better… not grammatically, but entertaining.*

For some reason, I’m obsessed with how people view me. To a certain point, that is a normal feeling. People are always worried about what their image is. I think my view is different. I have a huge amount of anxiety about how my classmates, who literally couldn’t give two shits about me, see me. When I skip a class and go back, its not the normal “shit, better get notes from someone” its “holy fuck, everyone in that class is going to see me as a douchebag, failure, fuck up, and tell everyone they know about how that kid with the shaved head skipped class.” So, naturally, my reaction to these thoughts is to never, EVER, go back to that class again. 

*I hate myself.*

*By the way, the beer is cracked.*

*Holy shit, its 5:15.*

*I want to go to sleep, but I’m afraid that when I wake up and become sober ,I won’t be as honest.*

Am I really depressed? The hwole reason I became depressed is because I put off a paper. I put it off, then never did it. And because I didn’t do it, I started skipping that class. “Well, fuck, I’m skipping this class and probably going to fail it, might as well not go to any classes.” Then, started realizing my life was falling apart and broke down.
I brought this on myself and I haven’t learned from it. I know I haven’t learned, because ive been skipping classes this semester… A lot of classes. 
I’m wasting my life.
I’ve always been a shitty student. I can remember the first time I didn’t do an assignment… It was 4th grade, I forgot to draw something ( or whatever) and I pretended to look in my desk for it. I looked frantically, knowing full well there was nothing there, for my missing assignment. I was late for my bus, so I pointed to a girl in my class ( I think it was Kelly) and asked her to look for the assignment. Of course it wasn’t there. Nothing happened. I’m pretty sure nothing happened and I went on with my 4th grade self. Pretty sure that is how my whole “not doing homework” thing started. I say that because 5th grade is when I started having problems with not doing assignments and parents getting involved. I was constantly yelled at and punished, sort of, for not doing my homework. This carried over to high school. I never did homework. I was always brought up during parent-teacher conferences and how I never did anything. Up until my senior year of high school, I never got above a 2.5 GPA. Senior year I had a 3.1. 


Best part is, every year of high school… and college for that matter… I said/say to myself “ this year will be different.” It never is.



*I fucking hate myself.*

So here I am... 23 years old. Starting a new major, won't graduate until after this year, fucking up like I always am. No relative internships in what i'm now going into, shit GPA, and the same old fucking bullshit. Idk what to do.

*fuck*


Edit: Little back story... I was going through depression for most of 2012. Didn't get diagnosed until later in the year after failing 2 semesters of college. I was on medication for about 2 months then stopped. Was a little better when it came to school but still only got like a 2.5 for the semester. I decided to switch my major and go into something different and here i am... 5th year of college, new major, old habits."

I think I'm losing my mind.,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1n2blv/my_trip_to_new_orleans_isnt_it_isnt_going_like_it/,"I am wholly and utterly exhausted by the time I get off the plane.  I don't know how my boss does it - flying all over the country. It's probably one of the worst damn experiences of my life .  Flying from Washington State into Louisiana's Louis Armstrong International has no perks at all - I was squashed between a fat man who didn't realize deodorant had been invented, and a woman whose toddler was intent on tugging my hair every time I tried to doze off.

My best friend from childhood, though, is a sight for sore eyes.  The second we see each other, I forget how exhausted my eyes are or how smeared my makeup probably is.

""Lana!"" I exclaim, throwing my arms around her.

""Ash!  Jesus, it's been forever!"" she practically squeals, her short-cropped black curls pressing against my cheek.  ""Damn, girl, you've gotten pale as hell. You're gonna fry out here, you know.""

I shrug as I pull away, tossing my strawberry blonde hair over my very pale, very freckled shoulder.  Lana's mocha skin is as perfect and bronzed as ever.  ""I'm Irish, Lana.  The terrible downside of no skin cancer also means no skin pigment for people like me.""

""Whatever, let's get you settled in and then we're heading out,"" she says very matter-of-factly.  ""You need to experience some damn fine food, drinks, and men while you're here.""

""My research-"" I start to argue.

She puts a finger to my lips, her brown eyes narrowing.  ""No arguments.  Grab your bags, let's go.""

…

Lana and I met in Elementary and have been best friends since.  We were never apart - it was always Lana and Ashlin, or Ashlin and Lana.  We didn’t work as separate entities.  

When she graduated from High School, the free loving and gorgeous African Goddess got married to an older man and jet-setted across the globe while I suffered through college.  While I was taking unpaid internships and eating ramen noodles out of their packets on a dirty boarding house floor, she was rubbing elbows with celebs and having affairs on her trophy husband with those same celebs.

It was scandalous, it was crass, and it was certainly nothing I would have done with my life.  Looking at the photos on Facebook through those years, there were quite a few times I made some rude or hurtful comments.  But Lana was happy, and if Lana was happy, I was happy for her.

Lana's husband died this year, which didn't leave her too heartbroken.  She took his money, his estates, and began playing the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  She was evidently doing well on it.  I mean, she added two more houses (one of which was where we would be staying here in New Orleans) to her holdings.

On the other hand, I was working as an underpaid, overworked journalist while trying to write the next bestseller.  All I wanted was something to make me rich so I could stop working at The Guardian and do stuff I actually enjoyed.

…

""So what's the book about?"" she asks as she languidly drapes herself over the patio chair.  The live band playing at this outdoor club is loud and boisterous and utterly fabulous, but the late-evening heat and drone of mosquitoes has me uncomfortable.

""Huh?"" I ask, waving a hand in front of my face.  Damn bugs.

""The book!"" she repeats, louder this time.  Her mint julep looks close to spilling across the cobblestone floor.  ""The one you're working on!""

I shrug, not really sure what to say.  I hate when people ask me that. No one ever really cares.  I'm sure Lana does, but still… explanations seem silly out of context.  How can anyone understand without being in my head?

""I'm not sure yet,"" I admit, watching the grenadine in my drink swish around and discolor the clear liquor.  ""Something about the Civil War and its effects on New Orleans.  I definitely want to see how the sugar plantations functioned, hit a few tours.  Maybe stop in a few voodoo shops.""

""Ooo,"" she grins, sipping more of her drink.  ""I know a few places we can check out, but they're probably overly commercialized, giving jobs to 16 year olds who don't know shit about it.""

I shrug before swallowing the rest of my drink in one burning gulp.  ""I have to run to the restroom.  Watch my purse?""

Lana nods and waves me off and I teeter across the uneven ground toward the closest bathroom.  As I do, I pass a man who smells like something sweet and spicy and smoky.  I take a long whiff of it as I pass, heading into the ladies room.  It smells amazing at first, but it seems to cling to me and begins to make me nauseous the more I smell it.

I do my business and wash my hands, feeling the beginnings of a tipsy buzz starting in the base of my skull.  I don't think anything of it - after all, that was a main reason we came to an outdoor club was to get buzzed.

As I exit the bathroom, though, that heady, cloying scent I had smelled entering the restroom seems to suffocate me.  It is everywhere - like it has crawled up my nose and rooted itself into my sinus cavity. 

I stumble into a man, probably the one who smelled like sweet smoke, and muttered an apology.  The man doesn't even turn to me, just keeps watching the band playing with a glass of scotch in his hand.  He is wearing a light gray suit and a plume of dust rises up from it when I collide with him.

I quickly make my way back to the table, the sickly scent was beginning to lessen.  ""Did you see that?"" I ask Lana, who is on her phone's Facebook app, uploading pictures of us and commenting about how great the music is.

""See what?"" she asks distractedly. Tap tap tap tap, her fake nails are clicking against her phone screen in maddening, rapid-fire bursts.  It takes all my energy not to grab her phone and throw it.

""The guy I ran into,"" I murmur.  ""He's totally creepy and smells like an incense shop had an illegitimate love child with a hookah shop.""

She snorts.  ""Haven't done hookah in years - I wonder if they have a hookah bar nearb-""

""Lana! Seriously, just look at the guy!""

She rolls her eyes and turns, scanning the crowd.  ""Which guy? There's, like, a bajillion.""

""The creepy one by the women's bathroom!  He has a gray suit.""

""I see three guys, all gray wearers, and they are all near the ladies' room.  If you didn't notice, this place is packed and gray suits are, like, pickup wear of half of this town.""

I roll my eyes and turn around, scanning the crowd.  And for some dizzying moment, I can't remember what the man's face looked like.  I am drawing a completely blank.  I gape for a few moments, my eyes beginning to water as the sweet smoke stings my eyes again.

""Do you smell that?"" I ask, throat thick.

""I smell booze and sweat, babe,"" she sighs, back to tapping away on her phone.  ""Here, take a picture of me and try not to look peaked.  Jesus, did someone give you something in the bathroom, because you're acting like you're tripping balls,"" she jokes, leaning in close to me and giving the camera a fishy-kissy face.

I attempt a smile, which I am pretty sure turns out okay.

When the temporary blindness from the flash recedes, I am able to look at Lana's picture.  We look good - Lana all dark skinned and flawless, and me like some pale, dreamlike figure with red hair.  I am in the middle of asking Lana to tag me so I can use it for my profile picture when I see him in the picture, just a few paces behind us.

The sweet, smoky smelling man.  

He's practically right there, within arm's length of us, and despite how crowded the place is, there is no one between him and me.  He is still holding his glass in one hand, but the other is holding up four fingers.  His eyes are black and emotionless, but a large, freakish smile twists his mouth in a completely disproportionate way.  And he's looking right at the camera lens.

I feel the beginnings of dread clenching my heart. I turn around quickly but I don't see him - the crowd is back and he is melding into it.  When I look back at the photo, he is gone, as if he was never there.

Fuck it all, I think I'm losing my mind.

I realized what an actuary is two weeks ago and I have managed to land an interview on Friday the 27th for an entry-level casualty actuary position.  I double majored in finance and economics at a mediocre state university and have not studied math since calculus in high school.  

These are my questions for you, the helpful reader:

1.    Should I cancel this interview?  From my readings online, the general consensus is that an individual is more likely be born with a tail than land a job without an internship or the completion of exam(s).  Furthermore, I do not need interviewing experience because I practiced it extensively as an undergraduate and I have read, reread, and practiced the supposed questions for an actuarial interview.  My concern is that it would be a waste of time because the interview is a two-hour drive away and my mom or daddy would have to take me, effectively ruining one's day.
2. How should I proceed from here?  ~~With my degrees, I'm seemingly in an excellent position to pass the VEE exams in Finance and Economics.~~  Nvm, see the edit posted below.  Should I take P, FM, or some other exam first?  I've looked through practice problems for P and it would take a lot of work for me to pass it, but I'm not really sure about FM or the others.
3. I will need to rebuild my foundation in calculus.  Do you have any suggestions for the method of doing so, and can you tell me to what extent I should learn calculus?  My initial plan is to work through the Khan Academy videos and practice problems for Trig and Pre-Calc (yep, going back that for to ascertain my understanding) through MV Calc.  Is this a sufficient amount of calculus?  Should I throw this idea out the window and use something else, use something to accompany it, such as calculus on coursera, or some other option?  
4. Can you make referrals for: studying tools/guides for the exams and search tools so that I can find info without making topics (I searched for beginner and career switch in this subreddit, but the information didn't really pertain?

As I stand, I'm quite nervous.  I've been out of school since May and my father is displeased that I'm unemployed.  I doubt he would be in favor of me hanging around the house for months more so that I can study for an exam which doesn't even guarantee a job offer.  However, he does view the career favorably.

Please feel free to offer any advice.  Anecdotes are welcome.   
 

Yours in anticipation,

SlingBlade

Edit 1: Okay!!  Turns out that I have already taken the necessary courses for each of the VEE reqs. "

I'm an intern working in brand management at a large FMCG firm. Now that I'm just starting out in this career, I am getting curious about how lucrative field is. My intern pay is great, I'm getting paid between $50,000 and $55,000 annualized as an intern, but could somehow tell me what a full-time brand manager/assistant brand manager makes? Is there bonus? Also, how does that salary progress through the ranks &amp; years?

The reason why I ask is because I read an article about a former VP of Marketing at Oral-B having to flip burgers now because he didn't save up for retirement, and he used to earn ""low six-figures"" at the height of his career.

I will be doing an internship in Dublin for 6 months, starting next week or the one after.

Playing League with someone (in the same room) is definitely one of the things I will miss the most and I actually enjoy the most in my life. So if you guys want an other player or just want to have fun in general !

I can link you my couchsurfing profile if you guys want to have a better look at me.

Have a good one,

I'm fairly new so most of my work involves assisting end-users via ticket system, creating/styling site collections, building infopath forms, etc. However, I assume that I will eventually be managing site farms, and doing other administrative tasks.



On the other hand, I was recently offered a position working for a smaller company (less than 1k). The company is, for lack of a better word, ancient. They would like to train me in COBOL, VB.net, and other main frame technologies. My main responsibility would be to maintain and manage legacy software.


My ultimate goal is to be a software engineer, but I do not want to work with legacy software after I graduate, and I do not want code in COBOL/VB.net any longer than needed. However, I'm always told that getting paid to code before graduation is the #1 thing a CS student should strive for.

I have wanted a dog for years but I was away at university and moving around for my internships so it was never the right time. I started grad school and have settled back in with my parents (for the next two years minimum).

I was hoping that maybe I am a unique case and /r/shiba would be the best to judge whether or not it would be a good fit. (keeping in mind I am well aware of the responsibility and work I will have to put in)

things to consider

* I live in a detached house with my retired parents and a huge back yard
* I spend 5-6 hours a day at school (during the week) but have no other commitments so all the free time in the world
* I also have a cottage a couple hours north of my house that's on a lake which I spend many weekends at during the summer... (do shiba's in general like water?)
* I don't know may people with dogs so I'm concerned about socializing him as a puppy (do people use dog parks in the winter?)
* I prefer the Shiba mainly because of its unique look but also because i have heard they do not bark very often and are very clean and intelligent and of course like many dogs they are loyal and loving.

also just a side note: I think a lot of people that say the Shiba Inu is not right for a first time pet owner may only consider it through their own experienced point of view... while very valid of course, I think you can sometimes forget that from my perspective having nothing to compare it to may work in my favour. making a more difficult dog to train just seem normal, which may reduce the amount frustration because I have no expectations other than the broad (but large) responsibility of owning a dog.

He's not having much luck with full time employment right now for whatever reason.

My rent is pretty low compared to his (right under $475 with utilities) so if he could find something even decently paying in the area, it would be a step up financially. He graduated in Business from VCU awhile back, has done internships in finance and consulting, but his most recent job dealt with accounting, client service, and a little bit of sales. Are there full or part time jobs like this in the area that pay somewhat well? Anything over $9-$10 in this area is better than what he's making in Richmond.

So I met this girl through a friend in February or so and I thought we hit it off so I kept on trying to schedule something with her and every time she had some excuse or flaked on me so I assumed she didn't like me so I stopped trying.  But then she began talking to me (facebook, texting) like every day all summer while we were apart (across the country at home for the summer) and we told eathother we liked eachother and stuff.  So I figured there was a chance maybe we could have some sort of relationship.  Now for this school year while she is at school I am on internship continuing to live at home so I am a 3 hour drive from my school and I'll be back for my final year next year with her.  

Anyways since I both wanted to see her and visit other good friends I drove up last weekend and we went out for drinks on the Saturday.  I thought the night went well, we had a good time, laughed, walked around town barhopping, I kissed her a the end of the night after walking her home (kinda sloppy though as we had both drank too much) and she texted me while I was walking back to my friend's place (where I was crashing) telling me thanks for a good night, had a lot of fun and some drunk flirty stuff and to text her when I get back safely (not the safest area of town where I was staying).  She was sick on the date and I think drank too much and wasn't feeling great which is why I wasn't invited in. Also I think she wouldn't do that on the first date, which is fine, its not why I took her out.

So the next day I text her saying I'm glad she had a good time, I did too.  No response.  I text her the next day just to chat like usual and she sends a few short messages and then stops responding.  I don't know, maybe I'm being paranoid or over thinking this but I can't stop feeling like I messed up or freaked her out or something.   Should I stop messaging her and wait for her to message me?  In 2 weeks (my school's homecoming that I am going to drive up for regardless) at my school my faculty is hosting a semi formal and I want to ask her to it but I'm not sure of how to go about it while I'm unsure of her she's feeling. 

Any advice or related stories/ experience would be greatly appreciated.  Maybe I am just being an idiot and everything is fine.  Basically I have no one around here I can talk to about this so I turn to you reddit.  Thanks.

tldr: Not sure if I freaked out girl as she now seems unresponsive to me after date/ kiss.  I want to ask her to semi formal but unsure of it.  Am I being paranoid about this stuff?"

A background about myself:
Graduated from a state school in Business Administration in Finance Degree a few years ago. Lowish GPA (because i took on 5-6 classes per semester and being a naive kid, I didn't take my  grades as seriously as I should have.) Now working in a government consulting/contracting company that placed me a niche industry for business operations that is imo a dead end job as relevant experience to anything outside the industry is non existent. I have applied to jobs sporadically throughout 2 years, and I have made it a few last round interviews, but no offers.

Fast foward to now,

Currently just started in a certificate program that lasts about 9 months (Intermediate 1+2, Advanced, Cost, Tax, Audit, AIS) for accounting at a university that is heavily recruited (Big 4, Regionals, Nationals firms). 

MTF Night is coming up next week for students in the undergrad and certificate program. Taking this networking op seriously even though my program just started and I'm about to finish the Intro course (Financial Accounting) only. I was looking at some firm websites and job boards for internships for busy tax season (Jan-March of 2014) and for Summer internships. 

Now, my question is will firms recruit from the certificate program for internships or only Juniors from the undergrad for both of the internships? Also, my undergrad gpa is low, but i'm aiming for a good gpa in this program to make it up. Will that affect my chances as much as I think it will? I planned to do some volunteer activities such as VITA and apply to Accounting clerk positions if I don't have any internship offers early next year.

Any suggestions and feedback is greatly appreciated.

EDIT: I believe I qualify to sit for the new California CPA Exam in 2014 after completing my program so I could study for that if I receive no offers, too.

Also, there will be a career fair specifically for this program after it ends as well as being able to attend next year's MTF night. Not as many firms attend the career fair compared to MTF night, but big 4 and the bigger Regional/Nationals attend at least).

We had been on the phone with tech support from the manufacturer who told us to remove the voltage controller and power it up and see what happend. We said we would try that and call him back.

I landed an amazing full-time job at a small company about 4-5 months ago – the pay was awful, but I'm doing what I love to do, I have tremendous agency/responsibility, all very good stuff. My boss (the president of the company) also offered me part-time work when I go back to class, and a job after I graduate.

When I started, it became immediately clear that my boss is extremely high-strung. That was no problem for me; I can deal with high-strung.

But as the weeks drew on, I realized how little he values his employees. He publicly and condescendingly disciplines/shames them, refers to his employees as ""fucking idiots"" within earshot, etc. When my position unexpectedly and suddenly went from ""make-work underling"" to ""sole developer,"" he told me he felt my former teammate was ""overpaid,"" and offered me a meagre ""raise"" that left me $4-6/hr below a reasonable wage.

Then, after a few more people quit/were fired, he started to make dramatic scenes about these former employees. He always paints himself as kind and fair and a ""laid-back guy,"" and paints the former employee as someone who somehow betrayed his trust or was otherwise unworthy (even if they were the one to quit, and even if it was a clean break).

He flips out on a daily basis, sometimes about money, sometimes about the fact that someone put the wrong kind of staples in the stapler. Incidentally, I'm submitting this post because today he was very literally *screaming* profanities in his office, slamming things around, etc. All this not 5 minutes after being introduced to a new hire, who's sitting in the other room, well within earshot. *Welcome aboard, new girl!*

I can deal with high-strung people, and I can deal with high-stress environments. What I *can't* deal with is the childish, unprofessional, and volatile behaviour he exhibits daily. The way he undervalues, disrespects, and undermines my coworkers and myself is also completely unacceptable. Though I have caught myself reasoning that I deserve this treatment, that I'm somehow lucky to have earned a place here.

I'd like to finish out the remainder of my work term here, because I need the credit to graduate. At first, I was completely on board with part-time work when I go back to class and the full-time position after graduation. Now, though, I plan to leave this place once I'm done and never think about it again.

The problem is that I still have 3-4 months left in this internship. How do I deal with this guy? How do I shrug off the disrespect, and ignore the screaming?

Equally important, how am I going to tell him that I don't want to work here part-time during class, and I won't be accepting their job offer out of graduation? Based on his history, I *know* he's going to bad-mouth me to my former co-workers after I leave; I'm resigning myself to that fact. But how do I tell this guy ""no"" in a way that will avoid a huge scene? I'd like to tell him as early as possible, so that he has time to hire someone else to replace me.

Also, HR isn't an option for any of this. Even if we had an HR department, which we don't (very small company), he's the president *and* incredibly self-righteous. He is not going to change his behaviour."

What do I need to know about the team?,zbeg,ColoradoAvalanche,https://www.reddit.com/r/ColoradoAvalanche/comments/1n0zho/getting_back_into_hockey_after_a_long_layoff_what/,"So I used to be a diehard NHL fan starting about 1992 until the lockout, and I just wasn't able to maintain interest in the NHL after that. I guess I was mad or disappointed or heartbroken or *something*. It doesn't really matter why. Anyway, I'm going to give it another go.

I was a pretty serious Avs fan since the day they moved from Quebec. I even talked my way into an internship with Mike Haynes (then with the radio team) in the 98-99 season and got to go to a bunch of home games for free on the ice, had press access, etc. It was pretty sweet. I don't think I missed more than 30 Avalanche games *combined* from 1999-2004.

But since the lockout, I've watched and followed the NHL zero. Zip. I couldn't tell you who won the Stanley Cup in any of those years. I've looked at the previews to get an idea of the team, and I've just gone through the NHL rosters to see who's still around. 

I've learned something: if I recognize the name, they're old. I guess Radim Vrbata isn't a young up-and-comer anymore. Are the team previews enough? It's weird starting over almost from scratch, though I've watched thousands of hours of hockey. 

Any major rule changes since the lockout?

Is Mike Haynes still doing play by play? Who's doing the TV and radio broadcasts? I live in Washington State now, so I'm trying to figure out my best option for watching games.

Thanks for any help you guys can provide."

I really want to find a job or a graduate scheme back in London but I'm not sure how to go about this. 

I have an EU passport so will not be needing a visa, which is a definite advantage, however I have a feeling that the moment potential employers see that the address on my CV is in SEA they will throw it in the bin. Do I lie and use a friend's address in London, since I am willing to relocate asap once this internship is over? I'm not very comfortable with lying, but I'm worried that good opportunities are being passed up because of this. 

I am also worried about timing conflicts with interviews or assessment days. While I would have enough money to fly back to the UK and keep myself afloat for a month or two, I don't want to risk getting there and being unemployed for a long period of time. So it's not an option to move there without employment. 

Does anyone have any advice on this?

My GPA within accounting is 3.8-3.9 or so and overall I am at a 3.4 GPA. I have a little over 3 years of private accounting experience working for the CFO of a company that imports goods from Europe and I think it's given me some substantial experience (not just bookkeeping and QB data entry, for example). I've led a team of interns and I do some interesting business analysis work. I have plans on attending graduate school for Tax here in NYC (My #1 choice at the moment is Pace with Baruch, Fordham, NYU, etc as other options accounting for acceptance rate and cost).

My questions are - how can I begin taking the steps into public accounting? Would it seem odd if I begin applying to various tax internships as a senior, or is it okay considering I plan on entering graduate school? Should I try applying to smaller size firms in the NYC area on general resume submissions or am I better off just waiting until grad school and seeing what a college that is recruited can do for me? I know Pace has amazing job placement but I would just like to do everything I can starting now. Anyone know of firms in the area I should try applying to? I have a classmate who landed a position (contract, I think) in O'Connor Davies with a much lower GPA than me so I think I will start there."

She did an internship where I work (professional environment with random drug testing) where I have been for five years. I never did anything out of line in high school; not a drop of alcohol until college and still never smoked pot or done any drug due to random testing. Lyn goes to college 4 hours away, so we werent planning on much more than a summer fling, but we hit it off really well and our personalities meshed quite a lot, so we have decided to give an LDR a try.

Now, I knew already that Lyn smoked every now and then, and now and then doesn't bother me much. However, I'm not really cool with an all the time regular thing. I have a lot of family issues over drugs and it makes me uncomfortable, which she is aware of. However, we were talking about a lot this weekend while she visited me. Somehow the topic came up and she told me that she probably smokes more than I'm cool with. I thought about it for a bit and asked some questions (she told me it was a solitary thing when she's lonely or had a bad day) and I told her it was fine, that it didn't change my feelings for her but that I was hurt that she intentionally hid it from me.

This has been bothering me for the last couple of days, so I confronted her tonight about it. I asked how often, and its basically every day or two. I'm not really okay with this. I don't know exactly why it makes me so uncomfortable (my thoughts didn't immediately go to my family, so I don't feel like it's that) but it does and I especially don't get it when she complains about money but is buying enough weed to smoke almost daily.

I told Lyn that I'm not really okay with that and she immediately went on the defensive. In no particular order: ""What the hell does that mean?"" ""I don't get why it affects you what I do in my personal time or see how that's your business at all."" ""If you tell me to stop I'll stop."" I find it hard to remain calm and rational when someone else can't, but I tried to explain to her that I just don't understand why she does it so much and that it makes me uncomfortable, and that it still bothers me that she hid what clearly is a big part of her life. I also said I'm not going to make her do anything because I know that she would resent me for that just the same as I'd resent her if she asked me to give up a hobby. If she gives it up I want her to want to.

Here's the thing: through this conversation, there was never even mention of a compromise, and that bothers me. She never asked me how much is ""okay"" in my mind or if I would accept her doing it less. I know I've never been high, but I just don't understand why its so appealing to smoke that often, and she kept avoiding it when I tried to ask her why (I even asked if I could smoke with her once to try and understand a little better and it seemed to only piss her off). Still, regardless of the 'why', she is knowingly doing something that isn't cool with me and getting defensive when confronted about it and like I said avoiding it and just telling me its not my business.

I really like this girl and except for this I feel a very strong connection to her and everything else is great. We have a great time together, the sex is phenomenal, and she is otherwise extremely loving and caring. I don't want to end the relationship. How can I tell her that I am hurt by the fact that she didn't even mention compromising and that that makes me feel like the relationship isn't important enough to her to want to make what seems to me should be not a huge change to help it (when she has said before she wants to do whatever it takes to make us work), but without seeming like I'm guilt tripping her? I just want her to be aware of how she's making me feel, but I'm afraid of it being taken as an attack on her. Thanks for your advice.

Update:For the record, to clarify, ""hiding"" it from me was her phrasing, not mine. Perhaps that's part of why I felt the way that I did. 

I took what several of you said to heart and took a couple steps back. I sat down and tried to figure out where I got such a negative view on this, so I looked at all the experiences I've seen with it and quickly figured it out. I organized my thoughts and we had a long and productive conversation. Long story short, we were both able to communicate a lot better after some time to cool off and collect ourselves; we both felt that we had ended up just attacking each other originally rather than attacking the issue at hand. She was able to explain to me why she likes to do it (and, as many of you said, better than being drunk) and that its not something she wants to keep doing forever anyway, I was able to explain to her where I got such negative views and that I was concerned because I care and I didn't want it to become a crutch, not because I want to dictate her life. We saw each other's points and she told me that she would cut back. I told her that I would prefer it not be an all the time thing and I truly do appreciate that, but that I'm by no means giving her an ultimatum or requiring that she change at all and that my feelings won't change regardless. I have no guarantee of whether it will be lessened or not, but after talking about it I'm okay with that and I trust her to use her best judgement. And, as was said by a couple of people, if it doesn't really affect me or our relationship then it doesn't matter a whole lot.

I'm really glad that we were able to work through this. I care a lot about her and have honestly fallen quite hard for her considering the length of our relationship. As I said, my feelings for her haven't changed through this (which I made very clear to her) and whether or not it changes now or down the road isn't a major concern to me anymore. I still am not a huge fan, but I've decided that I'm going to try it with her sometime to try and understand better, which she agreed to do. I really truly appreciate everything that all of you said (even the negatives). It helped immensely to have several more opinions to show me that neither of us was necessarily right or wrong and I couldn't be happier with how things turned out; I now realize that the weed wasn't really my biggest problem in the end, it was that it scared me that we couldn't talk about a problem and deal with it without ripping each other's head off. I'm just glad that we ended up being able to talk about it, understand each other, and compromise. I didn't want to lose the relationship over it and I don't see it being an issue anymore.

Thanks again everyone for your advice."

I'm Sarah, and I'm from Sydney, Australia. I'm gonna be moving to Seattle (or Redmond?) for three months next year, since I got an internship with Microsoft.

I've read the sidebar stuff about moving, and I have some questions that haven't been answered yet, mainly regarding medical stuff and health stuff.

I've only heard horror stories about the US health care system; is it really as bad as it sounds, especially given that I'll have Microsoft's health insurance, which I've been told is excellent?

Does anyone have any recommendations for a good doctor I can have as my primary care physician for while I'm there? 

I have ongoing chronic health problems, so I'll almost definitely need to see a doctor while I'm there, and I figured finding a good doctor is something that's worth doing before I move, rather than once I get sick.

Is there any online resource I can use for doctor reviews or something?

Thanks!

1n0o5s,1,2013-09-24,What is unique about you which is explainable as an INTP thing?,Galaxymac,INTP,https://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/1n0o5s/what_is_unique_about_you_which_is_explainable_as/,"As on the tin.

Mine are as below, wall of text warning.

&lt;**body**&gt;

&lt;**Money**&gt;
I have a tick about money, which I think is understandable, as it is one of the few things in daily life which can be measured with numbers. Money is easy to deal with logically and in a frugal manner. Not only am I frugal, but I hate it when other people spend money on me. I can't stand when people buy things for me, and if asked what I want, I will often choose the most efficient use of the money being spent, if choosing at all. Part of this, I think, is tied to my desire for autonomy, and it really makes me feel shitty when I feel as though I can't deal with it myself. Another part of my dislike of money spent is the social obligation to return the favor, and I have a really, really shitty time with that.

When I went to prom with my ex-gf, it was paid for by her parents; tickets, tuxedo, the whole nine yards. Even so, I had a really hard time accepting that, and I was very concerned that the tuxedo be the most efficient use of the cash at hand, my date less so, willing to spend almost anything. Looking back, the tux was stupidly expensive for the quality, and I was more than a little dismayed about that. This being a little redneck town in the boonies, I think I could have worn my navy suit with gold buttons and I would have been fine, but no, she insisted that it match her dress and that it be a tuxedo. The matter of the tuxedo brings me to my next topic.

&lt;**Fashion**&gt;
I am concerned with looking nice when I go out at all. Beyond basic hygiene, which everybody should make an effort about. I take pains to make my shaving clean and razor-burn free, I put an effort into grooming my beard, and I get annoyed when my hair is shaggy. I like to wear snarky/geeky graphic tees, but more so I prefer to wear a dress shirt and waistcoat. It isn't so much fashion as it is a desire to look professional or respectable. I am really quite technical with clothing, and I know my way around a man's wardrobe. I really like the dress of the early 1900s, and I think that I try to emulate my grandfather a little. I like old things, I guess. I think a lot of this is related to my desire to perform, on the stage and on the street, which brings me to my next topic.

&lt;**Performance**&gt;
I am a performer, an entertainer. I street perform during summer (dressed very well while at it) and I perform with community theater when I get the chance. I am told this is common for introverts, though I have no idea about INTPs, and it seems to be an inherently extroverted activity. I certainly have the voice for it, and the radio station is interested in hiring me for an internship. Surprisingly, I have a lot of talent for theater, and I'm able to communicate ideas very well on stage and with the director. I think a lot of the reason for this is the release I get out of it. When I perform on the street, I adopt a persona, and I am outgoing, talkative, charismatic, and flirty. I have a weird amount of success with flirting when I'm in performer mode, having had several free meals as the result of dates. I guess what I'm saying is that with  performance, I don't have to be me, I get to be whoever the heck I want, and it is quite liberating.

&lt;**Correctness**&gt;
I really hate being incorrect. I try to be very humble and unassuming, and when criticism is offered I will listen. I appreciate candor and honesty in people, and I will ask people to enlighten me on topics about which I have little knowledge. I actively ask participants in conversation to correct me. I am also concerned with having sources for the knowledge. I don't like being wrong, and I will accept criticism easily, and adjust  my words or myself based on what was said. I also ask that participants in conversation tell me their thoughts and feelings on what I'm saying, and that they tell me when to shut up, as I don't enjoy bad socialization and I have a tendency to go on tangents and long monologues.

&lt;**Chivalry**&gt;
I am almost entirely certain that this one is just me, but I make a big deal out of chivalric values. Chivalry in its original form is outdated and rather patriarchal, so I prefer a more modern approach, which has the same ideas at its core. Part of the reason for this is that I am a history nerd, and I partake in the SCA. I read books like ""King Arthur and His Knights"" and ""Robin Hood"" when I was young. The combination of the SCA and old tales of chivalric knights, who were honorable and loyal and brave, really stuck with me. So, I try to behave with chivalry in mind. I think one reason I find chivalry important, from an INTP standpoint, is that it is really concerned with being fair and just, and that the loyalty it describes isn't arbitrary; as a guideline for being an excellent person, chivalry is pretty logical.

&lt;**/body**&gt;

I'd like your input and what you think. I look forward to some interesting responses.

I could make a whole other thread about my relationship with my ex, both during the span of it and currently. It was a really interesting and confusing time, I must say. I do have a few things about it which I would like to share with a like-minded group, though I do not think a relationship thread would necessarily be welcome. If there is interest, or better, a good place for that, I would appreciate it if you would make me aware.

**TL;DR: Money, fashion, performance, correctness, and chivalry. Also, share your ideas.**

I'm trying to become a grown-up man. I'm trying to stop being so immature. A blue-pill horror story from 1.5 years ago has left an indelible mark on me and has removed most of my naivette. So has this subreddit.

But I still get crushes, apparently. Today, in my mid-20s, I began my first real job. It's not an internship and it's well-compensated. But of the two HR vixens who initiated the workplace tour for me, one has pre-occupied my mind most of the day and even this evening. She kept staring at me and smiling incessantly. And laughing at my occasional jokes. And then staring at me some more as she walked by at later times.

Now, with my Red Pill knowledge and maybe with some general common sense I've gained over the years, I know the following:

1) Be professional at work. That means try not to hit on the women at your workplace. I'm in a geeky field, in a trendy city, so hot (and smart) girls are hired for HR and probably get hit on incessantly by all the nerdlings.

2) Men tend to overrate how much they perceive their female interests to be into them. I'm referring to a study I read on reddit, possibly on this subreddit. I know that, at least for me, I overcompensated for my many years of being overly shy and introverted by assuming that girls liked me more than they actually did.

So I probably won't hit on this chick. I don't have much game. I might as well forge my skills in the streets and bars of my city and not risk my career by making dangerous moves in the workplace. But maybe I can indulge in blue-pill-esque fantasies while I slave away in my cubicle during the long days?"

Chapter 2.
Opening The Portal

I called my old social worker at the outreach place I use to go to in my home city sporadically to catch up, and through him learned that a good friend of mine (albeit one I used to ""use"" with) had been in jail for a few months for something minor. I was overjoyed because I thought that it was awesome that by fate we had both gone clean, even if he had no choice in the matter. 
I found him and started religiously sending letters and books every week. 

""R.L"" was an old friend and like myself, trustworthy even when he was strung out.
He was one of the few people I've ever met that I could have a really quick ""back and forth"" with because our brains were both really fast, buggy and filled with pop culture references and general snarkiness. 
He was as smart as fuck, funny as hell, a kick-ass writer and always pretty chipper despite having a horrible, abusive upbringing that involved moving from foster home to foster home, being sexually abused, burned with cigarettes, hooked on junk and turned out as a gay prostitute at 15 (even though he identified as straight). 
R.L was even more awesome for living through that hell and still being a person who had some love in him. 

R.L's release date came on fast and when he told me, I was ecstatic! We were both clean and I'd help him finally get his shit together. 
He had nowhere to go and despite the fact that I didn't have the room by any stretch of the imagination, I told him he was welcome to stay with us and I meant it.

I excitedly mentioned my friend coming to Larry in passing with no ulterior motive and Larry said ""he can stay with me if he wants"". 
Sweet! Lonely old guy, charismatic young punk looking to start fresh like I did, and avoidance of the whole ""guy on couch and I want to get laid, argggg fuck!” scenario. 
Everybody's happy! Great!

But…not great.

We had some wonderful time catching up, walking in the park, talking about our new found dreams, but after about 2 weeks past, I started getting a niggling feeling that he was using again. 

One early Saturday morning I was on my way to the clinic internship and decided to go say good morning to R.L before I left.
The door was ajar and I got goosebumps - the moment I saw R.L from the back I knew something was wrong. Larry was nowhere to be seen and R.L was reclined on the couch. I approached and saw he had half of a Mike's Hard Lemonade perfectly balanced on his chest. 

As you maybe already guessed, he was dead. 

Judging by the foam around his mouth and nose it was obvious to me it was a heroin overdose because I had seen them before and apparently it's a standard symptom of an opiate overdose (medulla suppression, involuntary breathing response stops, lining of lungs comes up in ""foam form"" blah blah blah.)
 
I still think it must have been a suicide because R.L was a seasoned user and any junkie knows never to mix junk and booze, or if you do, be careful.

Or maybe he thought his tolerance was higher than it was after being clean for awhile, which is a  common reason for O.Ds.

Regardless.

His skin was light grey, his eyes the palest China blue. 
I sat next to his body and took a long look at him, asked him why , expressed my anger and my sadness, told him that he was free now.  Eventually I called the cops and a coroner came within an hour, zipped him into a crinkly maroon body bag.

Before they left, one of them took R.L's cuff off his wrist and gave it to me like we give a dog's collar to the owner after euthanasia. Both touching and fucking heartbreaking.
If I hadn't have been there to tell them his full name, he would have been ""John Doe"". 

His birth certificate arrived in the mail the next day. I still carry it in my wallet to this day.

Understandably upset, I called the clinic and told them I wasn't going to make it. 
I sat in that apartment a long time waiting for Stoic to return from work.
Larry came back to the apartment hours later, visibly shaken. I didn’t have any words so I faced the wall struggling to find something to say.

This was the first indication that he was a little...wonky. 
I figured he was just dealing with the death in his own way and respected his space.

1n0b5b,5,2013-09-23,Looking for guidance about presenting myself after some missed opportunities,cs-senior,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1n0b5b/looking_for_guidance_about_presenting_myself/,"I am a nontraditional student at a great university for computer science, now entering my senior year. Overall I am very proud of what I have accomplished but am unsure of how to frame my accomplishments for a larger audience (ie interviewers). Looking for guidance with this as background:

At 30, I decided to pursue my computer science degree. Enrolled in community college for two years and did very well. Earned a 4.0, got involved in some on-campus research (with a CS component) and received campus-wide awards in physics in computer science. On the strength of these accomplishments I was accepted into a very selective CS program at my ideal university. 

Good stuff, but that was always to be just a means to get to the 4 year. I fully intended to pretend that the two years at community college never happened, given the stigma that might come attached. In order to do that, I knew that I would have to knock it out of the park for sophomore year: Maintain the GPA, get some projects under my belt and land a great internship. I was able to handle the first part, but due to a series of medical emergencies in my family, I was unable to make even an attempt on the resume builders.

I find myself in a strange position now as the career fairs approach. If I strike the community college period from my record, I have to lean strictly on academics. I fear that a great GPA may not be enough to land the interviews that I really desire, but my projects and awards come with baggage. The extra-curricular stuff is in association with my 2 year stint, and I don't know how that would be received. My personal portfolio has a few projects but they are older and not really fit for public consumption. I believe that I could put together a decent little personal project in the month that I have before the fairs, but would that be enough to really make a difference?

**TL;DR**ing it down to just some concrete questions:

1. **How do the larger companies view nontraditional students who may have attended a 2 year first?**
2. **On my resume, do I mention work I did at CC or just highlight the university academics?**
3. **I am 34 now, but appear quite young. Should I avoid mentioning anything that gives this away?**
4. **Should I be angling for an internship or full-time employment? If the later, how do I overcome not having had the former?**
5. **Would a small personal project be enough to change your advice about any of this?**

I am really aiming high for my employment. I do not worry that I will find myself unemployed, but I went for the degree to work on  interesting problems. Sitting across the table from the interviewer, I think I can deliver what they want. I just don't want to be culled before I get there."

Some background:

I'm going to be graduating in 2014 with a B.S. in Computer Engineering  from Georgia Tech. So far I have a 4.0 GPA and although that might change in the next semesters, I will still have a fairly decent GPA come graduation time. I also have a couple of good projects to talk about right now and will be involved in at least two more before I graduate.

  I did an internship last summer in California doing embedded software development with a big semiconductor company and they have offered me a full-time position paying ~73k/year and fairly standard benefits. I know I would enjoy the work, and I love the location. However, I have been interviewing with many other big companies that come recruit at Georgia Tech and I have a few options lined up which are very interesting too. 

 I don't want to be too cocky and think I deserve more than I do, but I obviously want to make the most of my strong points (School, GPA, experience) and not settle for less than I deserve. What do you guys think about this? Any hiring managers willing to give me their opinions?

In July I applied for a research position with a top tier university. I got a call from HR in July about some of my application information. Mid-July I get an email from the head of the group I would be working with if I got the job. He wants to interview me the last week of July. I agree. It was a phone interview with three people. They tell me at the end of the interview that they want to do a Skype interview in two weeks. I end up interviewing near the end of August. It is over Skype, 4 30-minute interviews with a group of 3-4 researchers every time. Very long and stressful. The head guy said I would hear back ""next week"". The end of ""next week"" rolls around, and since I have heard nothing, I email him. He says they will be making their decision in ""about a week"" and will let me know. ""About a week"" rolls around, and still nothing. I emailed him last Monday (10 days after our most recent interaction) to hear if anything had happened. 

He hasn't even emailed me back.

My question: what.

It's been nearly an entire month since my second interview. I (and all of those researchers) put a lot of time into all of this, and I don't even get a polite ""No, we picked someone else""? Could something else be going on here? Do I try emailing again. I feel like an idiot now, and I have too much pride to just write him every day like I require all of his attention, but the fact that I am just being ignored... it is extremely unprofessional.

If it will affect the way you'll respond, here's a little bit about me, otherwise just ignore, I guess.
__________
-I'm 23.  I realize this is young and I'm a ""stupid pothead child"" for wanting to do this.  Please respond anyway, if you don't mind.  I'm not ""running away"", I've been discussing this with both my parents ever since I thought of it.

-I dropped out of college and moved back to mommy's house.  *That's a very long story, basically I'm not cut out for college.*  Have been delivering pizzas for a few years and have saved up 10,000.  $3,000 in the bank, $7,000 in cash.  **(is that incredibly stupid for not being in the bank? It feels safer to me.)**

-During college, I had 4 different internships in four different states.  The idea of moving ""across the country"" really doesn't phase me anymore, it's quite exciting, actually.  Each internship was 4 months, and I never brought more than a suitcase with me.  (xbox and TVs etc will be slightly more of an issue for this permanent move)

-I began saving for this trip since I first found /r/trees back when I was 18ish.  I know it sounds retarded but my ""dream life"" is to be able to smoke weed comfortably/legally.  Ever since my first hit, that's all I've ever wanted.  Totally lame, right? I know. :/

-I've been researching traveling costs almost daily, for years, and am prepared for that.  My original goal was $1,000 to cover the flight ticket, 1 month's rent, and some food.  I hoped to find a job quickly, but I was always too nervous, and after each new ""thousand"" on top of the last, I've grown more and more comfortable with the idea.

-My parents got divorced a few years ago, are still living together, and I'm the mediator between them.  My dad will give me papers from his lawyer, I'd give them to my mom, she'd go to her lawyer, repeat.  They still live together, they still argue over everything, and it's been like this since before I was born.  I'm ready to leave my family.  Not like ""fuck you I never want to see you again"".... more like ""I'm tired of taking care of my childish immature parents, maybe I'll visit for christmas next year""

-Also, I haven't smoked in about a month now, because I'm thinking the time is now, and I'm just trying to get all the money I can before I leave.

**-I'm thinking the main issue will be to get new car/life/health/whatever insurances, and have them all updated to say I'm a Colorado resident?  Possibly my school loans and credit card and checking accounts as well?**

First off let me introduce myself, I'm thrwayengineer, a process engineer. I'm responsible for a portion of the parts that flow through the plant. About 10% of the parts (roughly $2 million a month) in the plant are my responsibility to make sure they run with low scrap, get to the customer on time, and the operators know exactly how to process them. Any problems with one of my parts is suddenly my problem. It is a very stressful job.

I work at a factory that employs of about 1200 people and around ~40 engineers. I don't hate my job, but I don't like it either. This has to do with the work environment, but that is not important. I want to do something different, either go back to school or find a new job.


I want to start applying other places, either school or work, but I don't know what to tell my boss about it. I feel gut wrenching guilt just thinking about it. I was one of about 20 interns picked for the only open position they had. It feels like winning the lottery and being like, ""oh sorry, I don't actually need all this"". Not only that, but my friend and mentor's workload would literally double if I quit. I'm gone, suddenly there is no one to take care of my parts, and the responsibility falls to him because he is my senior. He goes from 40 hours a week to 80 hours a week in a day. And it's not like I can put my two weeks in and they can have someone trained in that time to take over, the training time for an engineer is roughly 6 months. Thinking about telling him I'm leaving makes me sick to my stomach, since he has invested so much time and energy into me to make me self proficient. I can just imagine him thinking ""shit why did I even waste my time with this kid"".

But I can't handle the stress. I've started drinking. I hate waking up in the morning. I don't know what to do. I need a different job, a happier job. I'm so depressed. 2/3 of my waking hours are spent in misery. I loved my old retail job. I got to hang out with friends, talk with customers. I enjoyed it. I wish I could go back, but I'm $50000 in debt now because of school, and I made 1/5 of what I make now. I'd be drowning.


How do I tell my boss that I want to go work at the plant across the street? Or that my experience with engineering was so bad that I'm going back to school to switch careers entirely? I feel so guilty.


But I can't do it much longer..

**Issues I am aware of in resume**

* Typo of ""numerous""
* Typo of ""Expectional""
* Lack of GPA (Sitting at around 3.0 hope to get 3.15-3.20 by expected graduation date
* Graduation date is a semester or two off (May 2014 or Summer 2014)

**My Situation**

My main issue and hopefully I can address this effectively in an interview is the lack of work experience in the past year or so. I transferred to the state university in 2012 (Think top 15 public b school in the south). The main reason I was able to transfer to this cheap, but relatively pricey compared to alternatives down here, resulted in me being logistically unavailable to do an internship. Another issue is extreme lack of leadership experience and club involvement. I hope to join some clubs next semester and incorporate that experience in my resume.

My plan right now is to develop some of the skills I have listed in this very rough draft of a resume that I threw together in 30 minutes. In January and February, a Global Fortune 500 investment bank is seeking analyst interns for the summer as well as hiring various mid-level finance roles. The institutional director is an alumni of my school and was recently on campus. We have a strong alumni network so I plan to email the recruiter and possibly the director to ask him about his experience with graduating into the workforce as well as the finance industry. My school is the strongest in the state and possibly my region so I am hoping that there is a large majority of graduates that work there.

I understand that for most of us here the competition for the jobs in the finance industry is extreme. However, I feel that in this specific situation the level of competition is going to come from mainly my university. In this specific city the only universities that are competing are state colleges and a directional university ranked in the 300s. Further, I am under the assumption that relative to most cities that my peers will be moving to that this one is very undesirable. A majority of the students from my university live in South Florida so I don't think that many will be jumping on the chance to move to Jacksonville.

I have been somewhat following their strategy to move these roles away from NYC. They have been soliciting tax incentives from state and local governments and the city in my hometown won the bid. Their workforce at that particular office is going to increase by around 300% around the time I am graduating. I also believe they plan to move some of these jobs back to NYC to their headquarters there so this could potentially be a big break. On paper I personally would most likely not hire myself for the reasons I initially listed. I hope to convince the recruiter (Linkedin? Email?) and show that I am very eager to learn and join their team. Any advice and insight on a plan to achieve this goal would be great.


EDIT: I should clarify by mid-level finance jobs I meant entry-level jobs that were a mix of FO and BO.

1n512z,3,2013-09-25,My idea: Turn college football into a paid internship,Sosen,CFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/1n512z/my_idea_turn_college_football_into_a_paid/,"Okay, I'm probably an idiot, but I'm goin' for it:

There's this absurd notion that if college athletes were paid, it would be in a merit-based system. This is the main argument against paying student athletes, based on the fear that college football will just become a giant bidding war, where the richest schools get the best players (even more than they already do). I actually saw CNN run a graphic that showed which school's players would have the highest net worth. Texas was #1, and they estimated that a player playing from Texas would be worth over $400,000. I don't even know why people are talking about this kind of thing. Money already controls the game, but I think that the game's integrity - already tarnished - would be completely *demolished* if schools paid whatever they wanted to.

I don't know of a solution to the problem of merit. I'm thinking about a different problem, one that too often gets ignored in this debate: there are student athletes who can't afford basic living costs. A full-ride scholarship only pays for so much, and football takes up way too much time for athletes to work year-round.

College football is approached as if it's a CLASS, but it's just far too demanding for that to be fair. I think it should be more like a job. A paid internship would be even better, because then students could get credit, AND get paid. I assume the pay could easily be regulated by the NCAA.

I admit I don't know a whole lot about these things; it just seems like a fairly simple solution that I've never heard anybody mention. Prove me wrong?"

My situation is a bit unorthodox.,throwaway1090806,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/1n4wu9/will_i_be_unhireable_my_situation_is_a_bit/,"Hey fellow engineers! I've been feeling a lot of anxiety lately over my hireability, and was wondering if I could get some advice.

I graduated from college with a degree in ECE in 2008 with a GPA of 3.2 - 3.3 (I don't really remember, but I did graduate with honors, which has a cutoff of 3.2). I had an internship with the Army in the summer of 2007, and decided to go work for a private defense contractor after graduation. I didn't really like it, and decided to change my career path, and took some post-bacc classes in premed with the intention of going to medical school (which seems stupid given my low GPA). I got A's and A-'s in the premed classes and did pretty ok on the MCAT, but didn't get into medical school unforch (waitlisted, probably because I applied pretty late.) 

I was intending on doing the post-bacc part-time while working full time (the program was designed to for working professionals), but about a month after I started the program I got laid off after working for about 1.5 years. I thought ok now is a good time to focus on getting into medicine, do the coursework and volunteering etc. Of course that didn't work out, and I thought that given I had spent the past three years trying for medicine that I would be unhireable, so my first attempt to get a job after all of this was to go back to my internship. They hired me back (a little too easily I would say), and I've been there since january of this year. However, now that sequestration has happened, and with very deep budget cuts looming in the future, I'm a worried about my job security at my current job, and wondering if anybody will hire me if I start looking for a job. What do?

Also another question: I want to become a better programmer because I think that would be a good skill that I can use no matter where my job takes me, as well as something I can put on my resume. What can I do? I have already taken a programming course in college, so I have a pretty good handle on the basics, but wouldn't mind brushing up again."

That being said, up until now I have been a lurker in the most traditional sense. However, I find myself in great need of advice and can think of no better springboard than you fine folks. I am 25 years old and my life is kind of a mess.

I graduated from a respected college last year and had planned to move to Los Angeles a month or two after. Instead, my health quickly deteriorated and found out that I needed a gruesome surgical correction and spent the better part of this year bedridden and essentially immobile. I'm still in a huge amount of pain and my overall health is about what you’d expect after being immobile for that long.  	As of a month ago, I made it to central LA and am crashing at my friends place. but now I'm trying to find a job and it is proving to be uniquely difficult. I had a difficult/strange childhood which prevented me from working. I now find myself with a liberal arts degree and little practical experience. My resume consists of a smattering of internships and the odd summer job.  

However, I’m a creative, smart and hardworking guy. My life revolves around storytelling (with an emphasis on film) and I plan in the near future to try my hand at penning (or filming) reviews. I also have some video editing and music production study under my belt but these are all things I plan to improve on in my free time. But really, I just need a job to feed myself and pay rent. But as mentioned previously my resume is not impressive and the combination of high education and no consistent jobs isn’t impressing any employers. I’m not even getting callbacks for fast food employment. I’m a great interviewer but I haven’t been able to secure a single one. It’s embarrassing to admit it but I don't even know how to properly search for a job. I try to find places with hiring signs (can’t find many) and i scour Craigslist all day to no avail. 

I know this is getting pretty long so I’ll sum up. I would deeply appreciate ANY advice, I have been at this for over a month and things are starting to feel pretty bleak.     "

On my cover letter, should I list my internship first because it has the most relevant skills and was my most recent activity, or should I lead with my education since it's still pretty recent?

My concern is that my educational background won't be a good hook to get them interested in my actual skillset, even though I did go to a great university. 

Currently my 'base' cover letter has an opening paragraph that's always job specific. The second paragraph leads with my educational background, the relevant details (with an emphasis on skills) from my internship, and then some relevant and important work I did in college. I have just a line about my retail job, which was of course focused on customer service. My final paragraph contains a plan to follow up on the position as well as a thank you. 

Does this sound appropriate? Does it sound exciting? 

As background, my internship ended about two weeks ago so I've only been seriously searching for a job (as opposed to reaching out to contacts and networking) for about a week. I knew I wasn't going to continue in the company, since it ultimately wasn't a field I wanted to pursue. That said, I think I learned some great skills there and combined with my degrees would lead to a solid career in the field I'm currently looking at. 

Thanks in advance!

*  Is there really job market for a Django developers? I think the whole framework was made for medium to large scale websites, so my guess was there will be a lot of companies working with it.
*  What is your stance on single-page-frameworks like Angular-JS or Backbone. I've been learning Angular for about 2 weeks now, and i'm starting to get a hang of it - are they made purely for small portfolio like sites or are they usable for larger projects too?
*  What would you advise a beginning developer to do, up to now most of my projects have been test sites, not really a show-off material, but i decided to start working on a portfolio, are there any sites where you can deploy it for free.
*  I'd really love to get my hands dirty even if it was pro-bono work, i know working for free is a bad thing that destroys the industry but do you know any places where people or organizations who can't afford a full blown website commission work from freelancers?

1n47b9,1,2013-09-25,"When did you start taking ""accounting classes"" in University?",Elliot_SH,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1n47b9/when_did_you_start_taking_accounting_classes_in/,"First semester sophomore here, currently majoring in nursing (at UW-Madison, if it matters). However, I've been working in an office to pay for my tuition, and after talking to the accountants (who most of my bitchwork is for), it seems as though they have an interest career that may be a good fit for me.

So, next semester, I'm planning on taking a general business &amp; accounting 101 class. I did a flow diagram of the major, and I will still easily be able to complete the program before I graduate.

Now, keep in mind I've only been taking science-based classes (except for Econ 101) as a Biology, Anatomy, Physiology, Microbio/Chem, etc. So here's my list of questions, thank you so much for your time:

- As long as I have the pre-requisites out of the way for the Business school application, would a Business school see my science-dominated background &amp; think I wasn't committed to the program? I don't want to give the impression that accounting is a last-resort type thing for me.

- A lot of the students I've talked to have taken accounting classes in High School and have generally stuck to accounting/finance courses in university. Other than my 2 intro classes, I won't start learning accounting until my Junior year, will this screw me over, in your opinion?

- My school has both an MBA program and an IMAcc 'accelerated' program for accounting students. The MBA program is 36 credits post-grad, and the IMAcc program is an extra year post grad with an internship. Does strolling into an entry-level job with an MBA appear as a little...overqualified? Just strikes me as a little odd.

Thanks kindly!"

So  i don't know what the fuck i am doing.  For the last year i have had a painful condition in my feet.  Right now only my right foot.  Left foot has healed so far.  Pretty much the tendons in the bottom of my feet got inflamed and sore.  From a combination of probably, bad life style, bad genetics, shitty shoes.  However i have been making progress in trying to heal them.

The long story short is my parents are the (""get a job in 1 month or live on the streets"" type)  I just finished an internship and thus finishing my college program two weeks ago and i now have 1 month to find a job.  While i have a serious problem.  The longer this goes on the more likely it continue to develops until the whole thing is mostly scar tissue.  Then i am probably screwed.

The fucked thing is i want to join the military or the police.  If my foot was not hurting i would sign up for basic training tomorrow.  It just really nukes my dreams since i was a kid.  I always wanted to be a cop and have thought about the military.  I need pretty much 2 months off my feet.  No labour jobs and nothing but working on stretching and losing about 20 pounds.  With luck it will go away like my left foot.

I am 25, just finished a 3 year course in Canada.  Currently job hunting.  The problem is my typical job i have experience doing is general labor (landscaping) or kitchen work (prep cook) where i am on my feet all day.

My parents either do not believe me or simply do not care.  To them having a job is a must no matter what.  They just as always refuse to listen to anything.  I just finished school.  I worked for free for 4 months.  You would think i had done nothing for the past year on a couch.

TLDR

Foot is painful
Really painful
Could be come permanent
Parents think i am lazy and don't want to work, or don't care that i am in pain and demand i work anyway.

My question is regarding moving far away with your degree, preferably America, because the wages are ( &amp; yes, I know, so are living expenses ) much higher and some other things. I was there all summer on a working holiday, in San Francisco and it was the best time of my life.

My question is, do you think it would be difficult to get a job in possibly the pharmaceutical, oil or really any industry with good pay, with a European Chemical &amp; Biochemical Engineering Degree??

Some background on it &amp; myself: 

* The University is in Ireland and the course is accredited with IChemE, the European equivalent of AIChemE, and 

* I hope to graduate this time 2 years with a 1.1 degree, 

* only 3 semesters left with an 8 month internship at a semiconductor factory called Analog (or Analog Devices) coming this January. I should note I felt very comfortable with the internship interviews, a lot of companies were lining up to take us, and the one that eventually did, put in a lot more effort in the interview to convince me than I had expected, they were very nice.

What do you think, do you know people who have done so without having connections in America already ??

Thanks so much if you decide to help me out with your opinion :)"

A little about my background:

* I am 24 years old, graduated in May 2013. 
* Chemical Engineering degree from an ABET certified university in Mexico. Minor in Environmental Engineering. 
* 2010-2011 spent a year in Germany: The first semester in Applied Chemistry Faculty in some German university. The second semester in an Internship at a lab in Robert Bosch's headquarters doing research with PEM Fuel Cells.
* 2011-2012 after that I went to Chicago's IIT Stuart Business School to pursue a dual degree program with a Master's in Environmental Management and Sustainability
* 2012-2013 came back to Mexico to finish ChemEng (I must say coming back to ChemEng after two years aways was quite the challenge)

Now I started working at a small Sustainability consulting firm in Mexico, which is very business oriented. I have a decent wage but it could be a lot better. To be honest I am in love with Chemical Engineering and I want to be an Engineer/However I am a little biased towards thinking that business-like jobs will provide better opportunities in the future. I like business, but I love science and engineering.

I am thinking of looking for jobs in Australia, Germany or the States. As a Mexican I can legally work in the States with a NAFTA visa and I also think I have a good shot in Australia. I could work out some connections in Germany. 

My problem is that I feel that I lack experience (I do lack experience) and for now I am willing to sacrifice a shitty wage for quality experience that could nail me a better job in the future. However, I am unsure what I should be aiming for in terms of pay. I am very interested in the environmental field, would love to work in something related to biofules, pollution control, etc. 

I do not know what to do, where to go or how I should be looking at my situation. I am a very capable individual and could work in many fields but I'm lost right now because I think what I am doing will not be of worth for the future.

I'm about a month in, and it's a year long internship. So far a lot of things have been frustrating. But the biggest is the way my CT handles classroom management. Most of the classes are fine, except my 5th period. It's a Sophomore World History class, and they are all retained Sophomores. Not a lot of respect in the classroom for the CT or me. The biggest issue is kids talking nonstop and just refusing to listen. But all my CT does is say ""stop talking"" or ""do you want me to call your parents?"". The stop talking command really has no repercussions, so the kids obviously ignore it. Phone calls kinda work, sometimes, but not really. I don't know what to do for classroom management, and I don't know how to tell her what she is doing isn't working. She has been doing this for 20 years, and I've been here a month. So I don't want to come off as abrasive or arrogant. I know you need to follow through with discipline and be consistent, but I don't want to step out of bounds. She just had an evaluation in one of the more well behaved classes, and she did poorly because she could not control the class.

How can I step up and try to get more respect and management in the class without undermining my CT?

My other question is about teaching abroad for a bit and then trying to get a job in the states. Basically, I want to try and teach English abroad for a year or two since it's a lot easier to get a job. And my other reasoning was that this would be relevant to my position as a History/Social Sciences teacher. Is this a valid assumption? Or will employers look at this as a negative since I have been gone for a year or two? Also, teaching English would mean I'm certified to teach English as a foreign language. So would this count as some sort of ESL certification, or are they totally different? Thanks in advance."

1n39t7,95,2013-09-25,When did the show fall apart?,CharliePancakes,Dexter,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dexter/comments/1n39t7/when_did_the_show_fall_apart/,"Season One: There's obvious clinks and clanks that 99% of new shows have. I would have preferred if Brian/Rudy/Biney stayed a little longer. Dexter actually almost gets caught this season because Masuka notices and investigates a needlemark on one of his victims necks. Dexter isn't seen as an a poor mans Batman he's a complex killer trying to blend in not because he wants to but because he doesn't want to get caught. Flashbacks were 1000X better than GhostDad. Overall solid season.

Season Two: Best season imo. I know a lot of people hated Lila and thought she was annoying but that was kind of the point of her character the Dex and Doakes scenes were amazing. None of the plotlines were wastes and they even affected eachother. The best part is Season One had a bunch of fallout that affected this season. Unstable Deb leading to relationship with Lundy, Paul in prison causing Dexter to go to rehab, Doakes suspions that were increased led to an amazing plot.

Season Three: This is where it starts getting bad but this season isn't as bad as people say. Jimmy Smits was amazing as Miguel and the Prado brother storyline was great. The whole Skinner plot dragged down the season and so did Masuka's emoness that went to nowhere, Deb dating a pothead and Batista dating a prostite/cop/whatever. There was little fallout from last season affecting anything I think Doakes got mentioned once by Miguel but wouldn't the fact that the most profilific serial killer in Florida history was working there cause some kind of overhaul or investigation? Quinn was tolerable this season he was a potentially corrupt cop and not a Deb obsessed crackhead who ruins everything. Interestingly Miguel notices Dexter's computer activity and GhostDad was well done this season.

Season Four: Amazing season just because of the Trinity family. The plot between Arthur/Dexter and Quinn/Daughter made sense. However most people forget the stupid Anhel Maria plot where they get married for no reason. There is also little fallout from last season. Rita's death seemed brilliant at the time but ended up being a copout so the writers could have Dexter have less collateral and go back to basics. A single father of three killing wasn't going to work unless they planned for him to be discovered next season but Rita was also an anchor.

Season Five: Rita's death while somewhat of a catalyst for Dex helping Lumen was swept under the rug. Early on there's a scene where Astor says Dexter doesn't even care about their moms death but I wouldn't be surprised if the actress said that to the writers and promptly got sent to PlotHolelando. Batista easily forgets about seeing Dexter talk to the Trinity killer. It was cool at first to see Quinn investigate Dexter by the end of the season he decides he'd rather fuck his sister and drops the investigation forgetting about his murdered friend Liddy like viewers would the next season. The writers show their cowardice when Deb doesn't discover Dexter killing and [Lumen leaves because ...](http://i.imgur.com/vE1aHYQ.gif) It was remarkably like season 8 with missed opportunities and cowardice throughout the writers room. Lumen could have easily stayed and Julia Stiles would have been stupid to refuse to do more than one season and if she did they could have gotten thousands of others who would gladly take her role. On the plus side the show still has it's dark humour.

Season Six: Starts with a timeskip just because. Batista and LaGuerta get divorced but are still cool just because. Debra doesn't want to marry Quinn just because. Dexter officially gives up trying to hide his secret and hires Batista's never mentioned sister to babysit Harrisson 24/7 in a bikini while he's killing. There is no fallout or mention of the barrell girls, Lumen or Liddy's death. The villian for this season was always over the top with his tableaus. Speaking of tableaus Anderson was a good addition. The villian could have been great if it was Olmos and not Tom Hanks jr. Olmos was a lot more convincing, menacing and had the religious cult leader presense to him butthe producers decided to rip off fight club and put a very uncomfortable looking Hanks in the drivers seat. Dexter doesn't learn from his mistakes with Trinity and Miguel and makes Travis his partner for a couple episodes. Quinn spirals out of control because he has the maturity of a 17 year old rejected from prom when Deb isn't ready for marriage and continues to fuck up the season and not investigate Dex anymore even though his only real tie to him is gone. The tableaus become increasingly more stupid escalating from a somewhat cool stomach of snakes and decapitated horsemen to a gas attack that doesn't kill anyone, a small fire in the ocean and the kidnap of Harrison for 7 minutes (that won't ever be mentioned again). There are some decent references to the past killers during the intern plot and Louis seems interesting as a character. Eventually the season culminates in what the writers were too scared to do last season and ends with Debra finding out Dexter.

Season Seven: The writers do the first few episodes really well. Sirko has all the charm of Ray Stevenson, Speltzer the Skyrim fanboy was a cool villian. Debra dealing with Dexter was interesting and had lots of callbacks to former seasons. LaGuerta secretly investigating Dexter was well done. However the show kills of Anderson (get them to sign for more than one season it isn't that hard) and Louis for no reason after reducing his character to the only person more immature than s7 quinn, Hannah is forced into the plot in an unconvincing way, Sirko is killed by bad hair nightclub owner, who is killed by Quinn because he fucked a stripper. Quinn never has any reaction to killing bad hair club owner and Dexter doesn't really care about Sirko's murder even though at this point he's a Bruce Wayne wannabee. Dexter doesn't even work anymore or spend time with his son and the Batistas never discuss that ""Hey Angel can you stop working Dex so hard i'm in college I need to go to a club, or study for finals or have a some sort  life"" or ""Hey Jaime can you stop halfassing this babysitting job we need Dex at the office"". Dexter orchestrates LaGuerta's murder and we wonder is that really our guy who is killing a detective after causing her lover to die so he can keep killing. Debra shoots laguerta and is worse off than before.

Season Eight: Dexter decides to do another time skip because that worked so well before and LaGuerta is reincarnated as a bench that nobody uses. Angel doesn't give a shit anymore. Quinn is focussed on banging every female Dexter knows. Masuka is interested in trying to get his daughter who popped out of nowhere to quit drugs and possibly even sleep with him. The season starts with Dr. Vogel appearing and retconning the whole series. We don't get attached to her character and don't care when she dies. Dexter investigates with a computer that would make HAL look like a calculator while neglecting his son and sister (who magically becomes stable and accepting of Dexter). The writers forget the point of Jaime and show us her fucking Quinn instead of preventing us spending time with Harrison who has grown up to be a 7 (briefly 42) year old shit. Hannah returns for no reason to the city where she's most wanted and becomes bff's with Debra. Dexter who hasn't spoken spannish in several seasons decides to move with her to argentina with Harrison. There's so many holes in this season that I'd get an anerysm listing them. But the point is the slate is again wiped clean pretty much and pointless less than a season characters are added (zach, vogel, cassie, marshall). Dexter finishes off by dumping his sister in the ocean depriving Quinn of going to the funeral of a woman who shouldn't want him back and abandons his son in Argentina with a serial killer to live out his dream to become a Lumberjack. Nobody found out about Dexter's secret, nobody wondered why he dumped Deb in the ocean and commited suicide, nobody is curious to where Harrisson is, Elway is defeated with temporary horse tranq and Dexter kills in front of Batista who is still too stupid to realize anything. Maybe they did succeed in making Dexter darker it's not the story of how a serial killer got caught or how a sociopath discovered love and empathy it's the story of how an intelligent, hard working family oriented man became a deadbeat dad, husband, friend and brother to fulfill his dream to become a lumberjack. Even Walter White somewhat cares about his family. Dexter truly is the most selfish and evil being to star on television but only after Scott Buck himself."

Throughout the year, I saved up enough so that while I was job hunting, I could still afford rent. Got several interviews and finally landed a job two months after I graduate. This nice full-time job has great benefits -- health, dental, vision, even life insurance and insurance for accidental dismemberment [not applicable for my job but nice to have the option hah] -- and I'm doing research with the university, and I just love my job. Took out my own loan to get my own car, paying for my own apartment, and now that I don't have to devote my down time to studying, I volunteer at the animal shelter. By the age of 23, I had all I needed to call myself independent. By 24, I got promoted and adopted a special needs dog to care for and love him to bits. My point is that I took my goal seriously and worked hard to achieve it [sorry if it seems like I'm bragging].

Are my parents happy? Nope. My mother especially. She's incredibly upset that I didn't move back home [we're two hours away] and sees it as me being ungrateful. She's accusing me that for 18 years, I was only using their house as a temporary hotel, and that I couldn't wait to leave, and that I was just using my parents. She keeps saying she's proud of me, but then say something negative right after. ""I tell everybody how proud I am, BUT that you're so disrespectful/you can't wait to get away from family/you only know how to use people, and one day, you will have no one left [she rotates these].""

The only times I have asked for was when I needed my dad to cosign my student loan, sharing a costco membership [where I pay for my own stuff anyway], and when I borrowed my mom's car [that she never drives] while I saved up for a down payment, but during those few months, I paid for all the insurance, gas, and did all the necessary maintenance, plus washing it often, waxing it, rotating tires, things more than just an oil change now and then.

No, she does not know what my job is and doesn't try to understand my research.  She owns her own salon and wanted me to help her in it, so she holds it against me that I got a degree instead [mind you, she got her salon about a year before I graduated, so it's not like I could just drop out of college, and now that I have my degree, I'm not going to let it go to waste]. She has never visited me and did not attend my graduation. Once, I felt bold enough to point out that maybe I could get a little respect than how she's treating me for what I've done to get to where I am now, but she laughed at me and said no because parents don't have to respect their children.

When I do visit my family, she refuses to take a day off work, which is fine, I'm not demanding her to, but then she'll say that I never spend any time with her [and cue the rant about me being ungrateful]. She actually had surgery about a month and a half ago that she never told me about, and I only found out about it from my brother right before the surgery. When I called after the operation to ask how she was doing, she didn't want to speak to me. I told my dad that I was going to visit [it was on a weekday], and he said not to take work off, so then came the weekend, I was on my way up, but my dad said to turn back because she was angry at me. I called my mom up to ask why she didn't want me to visit, and she yelled at me for not going up anyway, that I'm cold-blooded and that I don't care.

At age 18, my goal was to help my parents out by not being a leech. At age almost-25, I'm glad I am able to achieve that, not only so that my parents can focus on helping my brother, but also because this opened my eyes to how controlling my mother can be and that I now have all that I need to get away from her, and that I asked for little from my parents so that there is not much they can hold against me. I may be an ungrateful daughter after all, but if she could make me this depressed and give me this much anxiety from a hundred miles away, then what would I be like if I were one of those ""adults"" who still lived with her parents?

Thank you, r/offmychest. It's nice to finally vent."

I was offered two and I wish I could do both, but I'm stuck on which one to choose. I am trying to work in the entertainment industry after graduation.  

Internship #1  
Pros: Known company name, MUCH higher chance for networking (especially with other companies I want to work at in the future), opportunity to work on some high level-ish profile events (very important to me).  
Cons: Unpaid, shorter term, most likely very similar or exactly the same type of work I've done in the past (so, comfortable with that, but not growing my skill set as much)  

Internship #2   
Pros: Really great office atmosphere/environment, felt comfortable with the team I'd be working with, opportunity to learn something new (slightly different focus than what I've done in the past) and step out of my comfort zone, paid (definitely need the money due to current financial situation)  
Cons: Unknown name, smaller company, not exclusively entertainment focused"

Description starts here:

So the title took me a bit to come up with, but I think it basically explains what I'm looking for; a roleplay in a society where women act as men, and men women. The ""traditional"" male role would be as a homemaker, while the woman goes out to work. Women would be the ones notoriously thinking about sex, constantly hounding men whom try their best to be modest under constant harassment. When a woman fucks as many guys as possible she is praised as a ""stud"" while a loose guy would be a whore. Women would constantly be leering, grabbing, groping and making crude remarks at the expense of men, who take it due to the social order. I think it would be fun to see how we would interact with our roles reversed, and here are a few scenarios that I think could be a good canvas for it. In descending order of preference. 1) The Halcyon Days of High School: The roles are truly reversed. Gone are the days of high school football ruling athletic departments from Ohio to Texas. Rather, women's soccer, volleyball and softball dominate their respective seasons. Cheer leading would still exist, but a female cheerleader would be the unicorn that a male one is at many schools of today. I could be the hot shot three sport athlete: striker, volleyball and star second base. You're my boyfriend who I've been trying to get in bed for weeks, but you want to save it. I do my best to be sensitive, but deep down I can't stop thinking about what you look like under your cheer outfit. I constantly think about every muscle, every bit of skin. When you go down on me, I long to feel you inside me. Yet you deny me and I must earn your virginity. Perhaps you have religious beliefs, perhaps you're physically insecure, perhaps you think I just want you for sex? 2) Office eye candy: Being an executive has its perks, especially being a hiring manager. I get to see all the talent (sexual and professional) and pick the best for where I want them. One day, you walk into a group interview for an internship and I'm rather taken. I, of course, place you on my team and take you under my wing, teaching you the industry; spending many late nights together. Without pre-determining too much of the story, we grow closer and I long to take advantage of you while we deal with the ethical, moral and sexual tension? Where does the tension come from? Perhaps you're taken (dating, engaged, etc), there may be an age difference, power dichotomoy being my subordinate. Lots of fun topics to explore. 3) Paying Her Debts Your wife has a gambling problem, with both frequency and skill. Like many degenerates she came to me for a loan thinking she would win her way out of the hole; needless to say she was wrong. So after weeks of dodging me, I finally pin her down at home. When I come knocking on an otherwise peaceful, ordinary Sunday, its a revelation to you. You had no idea she was blowing every pay check at the bookie. But regardless of what you know, I know what I want in repayment: you. Your body, your mouth, your hands, your cock. You may not want it, but I'm going to have you, all while she watches so she knows what I'm taking from her. 4) Unsatisfied I constantly beg my husband for sex but its never forthcoming. ""I'm tired,"" ""I have a headache,"" ""I have to work in the morning..."" Its always some excuse whenever we crawl into bed and my hands start to roam. I'm sick of it and while not seeking infidelity, my eyes are roaming more freely than ever. Finally one day I go to a friend's bachelorette party (or the beach, or wherever you fancy) and decide to make a move on you to quench my thirst. I am sure I will think of some more, but these should be something to get us started. A few notes to begin: No Kik or skype. Looking merely for PMs, Gmail if things progress well. Please don't respond with, ""I'm up for any of them!"" Its great if you want to respond, but which one connected with you the most, I'm giving options and beginnings so we can start from a place of common interest. Furthermore, tell me why you liked the scenario you did. Give me some details you'd like to include, or some possibilities that jumped to mind for where the story could go. If you have something in mind for your character tell me. Don't feel the need to write a book, but more than a line or two is sure to be eye catching. Please use proper capitalization, punctuation and passable grammar. Again, you don't need an English degree, and I make mistakes too, but if you can't be fucked to hit the shift button then we aren't looking for the same things in a pen pal. Well I hope that didn't come off too demanding and that some of you are still with me. I will be around for a little while immediately, and then readily available this evening (~10PM EST). If I don't get back to you right away that is why. I will give every thoughtful response a response back, even if its a declination. Last thing, if you spy something in my post history that intrigues you, please let me know with the above guidelines. I'm very open to many things. Thanks for reading,

I know there are general rules, and normally I would wear a suit, however a family member advised me that this might be too dressy for the position I'm applying for.

The internship is with a Fortune 500 oil and gas company, and the job entails data entry, Excel work, etc. Pretty basic stuff. Like I said, from what I have learned as a business student, my first instinct would be to wear a suit - if I'm overdressed, then it's not the end of the world, and it's surely a hell of a lot better than being underdressed.

But if there's a consensus here that a dress shirt and slacks would be more appropriate then maybe I should consider it. "

I currently passed all my CPA exams and now I am looking into the CPA experience requirements in NY. To qualify, it says I need:

1. one year full-time experience under a CPA (35-40 hours per week) or,
2. part-time (no less than 20 hours per week) experience will be considered on the basis of one week of experience for every two weeks worked.

I worked at my tax internship for 22 months during my last 2 years in college. Within the 22 months, 8 months were full-time and the remaining 14 months were part time (some weeks more than 20hrs, some less than 20hrs, and even ~4 weeks of 0 hours.) I calculated that I had 2208 hours worked under a CPA certified accountant.

I am glad this subreddit exists. I want to share this experience because I think it may be useful for someone going through a similar experience. 

I am 3 months away from being a medical intern (currently in 6th year). In my country in the last two years before going to the internship there is a chance of a 3 hour paid job giving out classes and reinforcement in Physiology, Pathophysiology and Pharmacology to years 3 and 4. 
The positions are open throughout the year and one has to go through a pre-selection process (requisites such as your average, previous professor recomendations, your grades in the before mentioned subjects), also a written and oral exam is required. The results are known at the end of the first year. Over 100 entered this contest, there were only 5 positions free. 
Long story short I won first place.
What I did not know is that 50 of the people that didn't made the job (namely places 2nd to 50th) got an *ad honorem* contract and I was supposed to ""coordinate"" all the activities that were to be made. I was in charge of the class groups, meetings, chief and department meetings and a lot of Excel and Word stuff (so much for a 3 hour job).
I was practically the boss of a bunch of peers (same year as me) and also seniors (which were a year ahead of me at that time). They did not like it and I personally HATE coordinating people, telling them what to do, making them work and giving out orders.
They started talking at my back, I lost ""friends"", they went as far as saying the whole contest was fixed and that I had payed so I would get the job.
Everything started going to hell. No one listened, they did not submit their work on time, and we were getting bad responses from the professors. There was this time that I was about to quit the job. I did not know what to do, I was desperate. I thought they had won. 
One of those sleepless nights I found [this](http://inoveryourhead.net/the-complete-guide-to-not-giving-a-fuck/). It is not all that good but it was exactly what I needed. I decided it was time to start working on it regardless of what they thought or the imaginary obstacles they made up.
After 6 months of planning, reading about leadership, very little sleep and even studying less for the rotation I was in, the program's results rocketed, we were getting great feedback from the students we taught and their performance was better than ever so the professors were thrilled and congratulated our coordination team every time the could.

Now I think back and ask myself what would have happened if I had given up a year ago? How little would I have learned about dealing with people? How little 3rd and 4th year students would have taken benefit? How little would I have grown as a person and a leader? 

At that time those people that backtalked and made me feel useless and unqualified for the positions I had just received, have just learned that their attempts to mess you up are as useless as their career expectations. They keep going about that I just had luck and that they had a lot to do with the results. We both know that that is not the case.

Indirectly (and most certainly unwillingly) these people gave me renown, tons of professor recomendations and an opportunity for overseas education. How did I transmuted their ill will and hate into this? Simple. I Did Not Give a Single Fuck.

After reading some of these posts, I'm almost too embarrassed to post my scores on here at all.  I was planning on taking the June LSAT, but for personal reasons this was not an option.  Instead, I did an unpaid internship at a law firm and worked an additional job; I was working 55+ hours/week all summer.  I didn't have the time nor the energy to study then.

September 3 I took my first LSAT starting my Kaplan course.  On my diagnostic, I scored a 151.  I was okay with that considering I had no idea what to expect, nor had I seen any of the question types before.  Since it was crunch time and I had not studied, I figured Kaplan would be the best choice for me.  We meet for about 10 hours per week and I have a book out just going through LR questions in every free time I have, and I do the games when possible (this is my strong section).

However, between the stress of studying, classes, homework, papers, and work, I've been completely and utterly overwhelmed.  On ""Test 2"" last tuesday, I only scored a 144 and was CRUSHED.  So, what did I do?  Every extra moment I've had in this past week I've had my LR book out doing problems and I've hit the games sections when I have the extra time.

I took ""Test 3"" tonight and felt sooo confident when I was done.  However, only a 145.  Once again, I was crushed.  I actually started crying.  I am SO overwhelmed because law school as been my dream since Freshman year of high school.  My first section of LR I only got 7 correct (horrible, I know) and on my second I managed to boost it up to 19.  When I do practice problems, I NEVER miss this many.  But when it comes time to take the test, it's like I can't do anything right.

I feel like I'm so completely overwhelmed that I can't handle this anymore.  I'm falling behind on school work because I'm studying and going to my Kaplan teachings and working when I'm scheduled.  I'm about to reach a breaking point.  I take the LSAT in 11 days and my scores are laughable.

At this point, I'm banking on my GPA, personal statements, and letters of recommendation to get me in.  I have a 3.7/4.0 GPA, so I'm hoping that is high enough to kind of ""cancel"" out my horrible LSAT score.

I know this is a really long ramble, but I've been keeping this bottled in for so long because there isn't anyone I'm close to who I can talk to because they just say, ""It's not that bad.""  I'm hoping at least someone here understands just how hard this is and can offer some advice."

**Timetable 9/17**


**19:30** 

I started feeling contractions that are hard to ignore. I cannot continue cooking dinner as I had to sit every time they come. My husband had to take over finishing the noodle soup.


**20:00 to 20:30** 

I tried timing them and they were all over 40 seconds and less than 5 minutes apart. I ate dinner and watched a movie to distract myself.


**21:00**

I asked my husband to clean up the kitchen, to freshen up and do last minute preps.


**21:30** 

I freshened up, and the pain of the contractions are still there.


**21:45 to 22:30 ish**

We sat together in the living room and timed contractions again. They were all under 3 minutes. At this point, my husband insists we have to go now. I wanted to wait out since I do not wanna be disappointed. I have been dilated 4cm since last Tuesday after all. What if I go now and I will just be 5 cm? Anyway, off we went.


**23:15** 

At the hospital IE room, I was checked to be at 6-7 cm and officially in active labor. Off to the labor room.


**23:40** 

My doctor showed up to check on me. She reminded me I can ask for a pain reliever if the contractions get too painful too handle. She left me with her resident and one intern who is constantly monitoring my contractions and the baby


**Timetable 9/18**


**00:30** 

The contractions are becoming ~~painful~~. The Resident asked me if I wanted to get the pain meds. She says it actually is a sedative that will help me relax b/w contractions and they will no longer administer it if I am 9-10cm since it would be useless and might also sedate the baby prolonging labor. I said I want them NOW. She advises to wait until my next IE at 1:15 AM. They continue distracting me with light conversation in between pain. I play along :)

**01:00** 

She sees my increasing pain and I can no longer stick to a topic, so she decides to IE me and I am at 8-9. She orders for the sedative and informs me she will break my water to hasten the baby coming down. The intern keeps rubbing my back to help out.

**until 01:40** 

Sometime between 1 and 1:40 the pain meds were administered (injected), my bag of water was snipped ( I saw the elongated scissor thing slip into me as the intern was just casually chatting up the Resident), and my Doctor arrives to sit by my side.


At this point I am weaving in and out of sleep is during contractions so I could not really hear what they were talking about. All I can hear is myself ""oooohing"" and ""ahhhhh-ing!"" and moaning through contractions. My solace was watching the clock tick as the pain starts and ends. I can comfort myself with the thought that the pain comes in waves so it is manageable and I should not panic.


I started having the urge to push or I just need to poop really bad. It tell my doctor this and she says ""Just poop if you want to"".  They then let me do practice pushes while they counted ""Inhale 1,2,3,4. Push 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10"". By the third or so practice push I see something change in my Doctor's face and she barks out sweetest thing I have yet to hear all through 3 hours of labor ""Delivery room now!""


**2:05** 

Two nurses comes in to wheel me out into the delivery room, just 2 doors down the labor room.

**until 2:35** 
They let me climb up the delivery bed and strap me in. My doctor orders me to just push when I feel the urge to. So I do that. By the second contraction, after the second push, they instructed to push one more time. I know something is up since they only taught me to push TWICE PER CONTRACTION at 10 counts per push. So I pushed anyway. The next wave comes I push again. On the last push, they told me to lift my head up as I push. I did this as well. I closed my eyes, listened to the counting and PUSHED. 

**When I opened my eyes there he was and I could not believe it!**

If my counting is right I did it in 7 pushes!
7.1 lbs Sam is born at 2:35 9/18.
He was placed on my chest and guided to suck. He did not cry at all, he gave out this soft ""Ah ah ah"". He finally belted out the full ""Waaaaaaa"" when the nurses took him away.

I feel truly blessed and grateful for the normal delivery of my baby. :)

I wish and pray the same for all the expecting Moms out there, especially first time Moms like me. 

Just listen to the Doctors.

Do not panic with the pain, they come in waves so you can comfort yourself with the thought that they will not last forever and you can manage it.

It is going to be painful.

**IT IS GOING TO BE WORTH IT.**

I've been trying to get an interview for a programming job with Blizzard, here in Austin, Texas. For those of you who have never applied to work for Blizzard, their process is very closed and automated, from the applicant's perspective. It's difficult to make connections with Blizzard employees and get to know them, etc. They don't really advertise their contact information, and for good reason.

But!

They do have several job listings for programming jobs here in Austin that I would be a great fit for. I've wanted to work for Blizzard since before college, during college, after college and still now. I applied for internships during school and all of that. I've applied via their careers page, but that process is probably their plan-B. I'm sure they favor personal references and things over the web-based applicants. But now, I am trying to make my most epic attempt at somehow landing an interview. Not necessarily a job, just an interview. I say that because I'm confident that if I can just get an interview then I will have a good chance at getting a job there.

So I ask you, r/Blizzard, does anybody know of a good way to break through this difficult barrier? Would it be bad to actually visit their offices in person? I haven't done that because I haven't seen anything that has given me the impression that it's acceptable. I'm willing to attempt anything before I accept the fact that you may not be able to work at the place that you want to.

Thanks!"

Chapter 2.
Opening The Portal

I called my old social worker at the outreach place I use to go to in my home city sporadically to catch up, and through him learned that a good friend of mine (albeit one I used to ""use"" with) had been in jail for a few months for something minor. I was overjoyed because I thought that it was awesome that by fate we had both gone clean, even if he had no choice in the matter. 
I found him and started religiously sending letters and books every week. 

""R.L"" was an old friend and like myself, trustworthy even when he was strung out.
He was one of the few people I've ever met that I could have a really quick ""back and forth"" with because our brains were both really fast, buggy and filled with pop culture references and general snarkiness. 
He was as smart as fuck, funny as hell, a kick-ass writer and always pretty chipper despite having a horrible, abusive upbringing that involved moving from foster home to foster home, being sexually abused, burned with cigarettes, hooked on junk and turned out as a gay prostitute at 15 (even though he identified as straight). 
R.L was even more awesome for living through that hell and still being a person who had some love in him. 

R.L's release date came on fast and when he told me, I was ecstatic! We were both clean and I'd help him finally get his shit together. 
He had nowhere to go and despite the fact that I didn't have the room by any stretch of the imagination, I told him he was welcome to stay with us and I meant it.

I excitedly mentioned my friend coming to Larry in passing with no ulterior motive and Larry said ""he can stay with me if he wants"". 
Sweet! Lonely old guy, charismatic young punk looking to start fresh like I did, and avoidance of the whole ""guy on couch and I want to get laid, argggg fuck!” scenario. 
Everybody's happy! Great!

But…not great.

We had some wonderful time catching up, walking in the park, talking about our new found dreams, but after about 2 weeks past, I started getting a niggling feeling that he was using again. 

One early Saturday morning I was on my way to the clinic internship and decided to go say good morning to R.L before I left.
The door was ajar and I got goosebumps - the moment I saw R.L from the back I knew something was wrong. Larry was nowhere to be seen and R.L was reclined on the couch. I approached and saw he had half of a Mike's Hard Lemonade perfectly balanced on his chest. 

As you maybe already guessed, he was dead. 

Judging by the foam around his mouth and nose it was obvious to me it was a heroin overdose because I had seen them before and apparently it's a standard symptom of an opiate overdose (medulla oblongata suppression, involuntary breathing response stops, lining of lungs comes up in ""foam form"" blah blah blah.)
 
I still think it must have been a suicide because R.L was a seasoned user and any junkie knows never to mix junk and booze, or if you do, be careful.

Or maybe he thought his tolerance was higher than it was after being clean for awhile, which is a  common reason for O.Ds.

Regardless.

His skin was light grey, his eyes the palest China blue. 
I sat next to his body and took a long look at him, asked him why , expressed my anger and my sadness, told him that he was free now.  Eventually I called the cops and a coroner came within an hour, zipped him into a crinkly maroon body bag.

Before they left, one of them took R.L's cuff off his wrist and gave it to me like we give a dog's collar to the owner after euthanasia. Both touching and fucking heartbreaking.
If I hadn't have been there to tell them his full name, he would have been ""John Doe"". 

His birth certificate arrived in the mail the next day. I still carry it in my wallet to this day.

Understandably upset, I called the clinic and told them I wasn't going to make it. 
I sat in that apartment a long time waiting for Stoic to return from work.
Larry came back to the apartment hours later, visibly shaken. I didn’t have any words so I faced the wall struggling to find something to say.
He spoke first.

""I can't stay in this place anymore"" he said urgently, in a strained voice. 
""Ghosts! There's going to be ghosts! He died right there and now it's wide open and it's all your fault and now it's wide open! Wide open!""

""...Open?""  

He shrank and brought his arms up to his head like the sky was falling.

""Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Fuck fuck fuck!"" He shouted, His eyes widened with fear. 
""They'll...hear...you!""

""Who will hear me, Larry?""

He leaned in conspiratorially and whispered 
""Them.  They know now.""

“Wait…who knows? What are you talking about?”

His eyes were wide and mad, rolling around in his head, his mouth agape and twisted into a grimace of horror that contorted is face into one of pure horror.  
He looked me straight in the eye and let out a long, ragged groan that chills me to think about.
Then before I could say anything further, as if answering a call I could not hear, he abruptly got up and walked away muttering to himself with his hands on his ears, swatting at things that weren't there. 

This was the first indication that he was a little...wonky. 
I figured he was just dealing with the death in his own way and respected his space.

1n2llq,1,2013-09-24,[Ohio] Restraining Order Appeal/Advice,[deleted],legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1n2llq/ohio_restraining_order_appealadvice/,"My sister and her ex (21-22 years old) got into a verbal fight a few weeks ago over their relationship. It's a typical on-again-off-again thing and he was cheating. Pretty typical stuff. He called the police because she didn't leave after being kicked out of his house because she needed to get her textbooks and stuff for school the next day. He refused to answer the door or answer her phone call. They are both college students in Columbus, OH. He called the police and they went in to get her stuff for her. She was compliant and no police report was filed (except for a ""compliant incident report""). This happened off-campus and was handled by the Columbus police.

After that, he filed to have a restraining order against her. They are both seniors at the same university, so this poses a bit of a problem since they'll both be on campus. She went to her school's legal aid and they told her that it looked good for her. She wasn't violent, on drugs, etc. and compliant with all requests. She cut all communication off with him until her court date today. While I wasn't there, it sounds by all accounts that getting a restraining order was overkill and done in a heated moment on his side. This is what the university's legal aid pretty much agreed upon. There was flimsy if any evidence against her and she did not pose a threat to him.  Her university offers legal representation that I assume she took advantage of as well as consultation beforehand.

However, she went to court today and the judge proceeded to hit her with a 6-month restraining order. She's a wreck now. Even the sheriff that escorted her out said that she didn't deserve this. This is her senior year and she was hoping to get an internship and graduate. Now she's only allowed to go to her classes and hope she's not in an area where he is. He works at various student rec centers, so she can't use any of the facilities she is paying part of her tuition to use.

So here's my questions:

1) Can she appeal and how soon?

2) Will this affect her getting work, internships, etc. (i.e. will it show up on a background check)?

3) Can she file a restraining order against him?



I feel this was a dirty move by him and our family doesn't have much money. It took her a lot of work over the summer to make enough to cover this year's tuition and now she's emotionally wrecked and has to worry about this for the next 6 months (nearly until school is over). I fear she will drop out right when she's very close to graduating and not have employment opportunities. Any advice would be great. I know she's going to back to the campus legal aid services for advice, but I want to cover our bases and see what options there are. Our family was already resting assured that she'd be okay since all legal council she sought said that it'd most likely get dismissed, but here we are."

I started college this semester and my grandfather drives me to school and picks me up each day.  He's always been my ride- to work, to extracurricular activities, and now to college.  I saved up enough money and made the grades myself, no thanks to you high school dropouts, to go to a local college.  When my Pell Grant came in, I used it to buy a car.  You didn't contribute a penny.  You wouldn't even let me go around test driving multiple vehicles.  I could only pick one to try and if I didn't like it, I was fucked.  Luckily, I did like it.  Now I'm trying to get insurance and you refuse to put me on yours because you're afraid I'll get in an accident?  You've never driven with me.  You've never made an effort to help me learn to drive.  My girlfriend's mother helped me infinitesimally more than you.  And now you're afraid that I am going to get into a wreck?

We could have had a nice life.  Maybe.  We finally started to have money, but then, you decided to have another fucking kid.  If you're on goddamn welfare, don't start fucking breeding again.  Can you really be that irresponsible?  When we finally have the means to support ourselves, you decide to fuck that up?  What is the reasoning?

Yeah, you're so fucking smart.  1240 on the old SAT.  I got a 1500 on my English and Math portions.  But of course, you're the fucking genius.  With your nice IT degree that you took out loans to get.  So you could stay at home and pop out kids like the white trash you are. Then you try to give me monetary advice.  Yeah, next I'll get the blind guy to describe colors to me. He'd certainly do a better job of it than you could.

I've put time and effort into internships, networking, and independent study to work towards my electrical engineering degree.  I chose to use protection with my girlfriend so we didn't end up 16 and pregnant like you. I'm sick of you judging me on every fucking little thing.  ""Oh, you atheist.  You're going to go to hell.""  If you're in heaven, then I'll take hell in a heartbeat.  ""You don't work out enough.""  I'm sorry, let me balance that with my 18 course hours and my job hunting.  And now I have to pay higher insurance rates because I got my license two years later than everyone else?

All of my friends had their parents help with their car and insurance while they were in school.  I've had absolutely nothing from you but oh-so-sage advice and insults.  No, I don't respect you.  Why should I.  You can't provide because of your own shitty life choices, and when I offer alternatives, you say ""It's not your money, you don't get to decide what we do with it.""  What a shallow worldview.  Everything you do impacts the entire family.  How are you so narrow-minded?

I truly despise you.  Thanks for giving me the fuel I needed to get into heavy metal, to teach myself guitar, and to work towards my own goals.  Thank you for providing me with one or two meals a day, depending on the day.  Thank you for giving me a place to live.  Honestly though, you've given me the pure will to work for anything I want.  I developed it so I could get out of the lifestyle you'll die in.  I would rather be underground than live like this the rest of my life.  I didn't get willpower from you, but in response to you.

I feel like a dependent on the tax forms. Not your child. You'll never be a parent to me.  If it weren't for my loving grandparents, I don't know how I would even function.  If it weren't for my friends who helped me visit my girlfriend or would pay for me when they went out to eat, I wouldn't have any social life.  They never judged me because of what I couldn't do or have because of you.  But you even disapprove of them.  You insult them constantly.  You say one is crazy gay and wants me.  I don't fucking care if he has a shrine to me he masturbates to each day.  At least he fucking gives a shit and helps me.

Never wonder why I don't speak respectfully to you.  Doing something half-heartedly after weeks of hounding-once in a blue moon when the moon and the stars align- doesn't count for shit.  Not anymore. I can see through your bullshit.  Stop asking why I'm emotionally unstable.  Why I have flashes of anger and depression.  You are the root cause of everything wrong in my life.  I'm actively trying to fix everything.  To fix my health, lose weight, gain muscle mass.  Improve my grades, make friends, become self-sufficient.  Eventually I'll get there.  I know I will.  But it won't be because of you.  The worst part of it all is that I truly need help.  I can't get through life alone.  And I keep trying to rely on you.  And it always turns out the same.

This became longer than it was supposed to.  But I don't care.  It's what I've felt for years now and I'm tired of keeping it inside."

Edit: He just put up an apology on his site.

Last night, he started up this website claiming to be the leaker from Pokebeach last night. He is NOT the leaker from last night. If you click that site, it currently says this:

&gt;In case you haven't noticed by now, I'm not the original leaker from pokebeach last night. I'm just a troll, but so far this website has received over 100,000 views! Great job everyone! Now, on all of your forums... Did you like any of these ideas? Why did I do this? For shits and giggles, honestly. It started off as just a small social experiment to see what people would say but then the website went viral and was on every freaking pokemon forum I could find, so I toyed with you, adding stuff and changing stuff.

&gt;I have a friend who works at a EB Games (Canada's equivalent of GameStop) who let me know when the official game sleeves came in to the store. They put one copy of each sleeve off to the side for me and I put it into my game cases. Please note that these are the official Canadian game sleeves and I will scan them for you as soon as possible. (Hopefully tonight if I can get to my scanner).

Here is a link to see the info that was previously posted by the leaker. He copy pasted the possibly true leaks from Pokebeach then added his own into the mix. Scroll below that and you'll know which info not to believe. http://pastebin.com/iejv4LrT

Here is confirmation from the Pokebeach webmaster that this guy really is a troll and wasn't the Pokebeach leaker from last night: http://www.pokebeach.com/forums/thread-2-new-set-of-x-y-rumors-xerneas-yveltal-half-decks-9-23?page=32

&gt;Been at my internship all day.

&gt;Some random overnight website =/= our source. However, I won't deny that part of the evidence I was sent was indeed the box art. Whether or not we're being duped is still up in the air, but even so, I've said repeatedly to treat the front page post as rumor / unconfirmed / fake until Pokemon says otherwise. I want to remind everyone to always be cautious of rumors and to always take them with a grain of salt until part of them can be validated. The only reason I did not hold back on posting this set was because I wanted us to see together whether or not any of them would be confirmed by Pokemon's Facebook tomorrow, just like last time with Helioptile and company's names (though on second thought they could just switch what they're revealing since I did it a little too early, unlike last time, which was only like 12 hours before - oops).

&gt;Anyways, if they're fake, they're fake - I did not present them as fact and did my job of reporting what could potentially be real. I think it's my duty to report any rumors whenever they may have some hard evidence to back them up, as was the case several months ago. And if it's wrong, it's wrong - we can move on. Personally I'm always a skeptic. "

We spoke about our last session, analyzed it, spoke about studying in different countries etc. We joked and laughed a bit but she has to go to another section of the hospital in a different part of the city after lunch. As we were walking towards where we split I simply asked for her number, gave her a kiss on the cheek goodbye, then we had a little awkward moment cause in Europe they do the two cheek things and I only kissed one side. Jokes were said, we split up and that was that.

Just a little background about myself. I am a social worker intern working at a high school in the New York City Area. Part of my internship is creating an after school program with the youth. I really want to do something creative, innovative and fun yet also meets the requirements of building professional skills for our youth. I have been assigned to building public speaking skills.

For me there was only one thing that I can could think of that would build interest in an after school program about Public Speaking… Wrestling Promos. It is my belief that wrestling promos are great examples of public speaking with the added benefit of being fun.

1n7by9,0,2013-09-26,Why Ted Cruz was wrong according to my family,[deleted],Libertarian,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/1n7by9/why_ted_cruz_was_wrong_according_to_my_family/,"""difference between Obama and Cruz: Obama was popular with the liberals (those who didn't favor Hilary), independents, and some moderate Republicans. He had a wider base is what I want to say. Cruz has ENORMOUS popularity with a very small subset of people. Maybe not very small...but certainly not anything like Obama. So not sure how much merit that comparison has.

 I also can't help but agree that a 1-day delay, with no achievable aim, in an important 5 days to deadline time period is crazy irresponsible governance. He could have done the same thing by taking out a full-page ad in the NY times or WashPo; he could have done it on social media; he could have written a letter and had an intern read it aloud in every senator's office; doing it on the Senate floor and holding up proceeding like that - that's grandstanding without aim in a CRUCIAL time period. and it gets my blood boiling. To people who think gov't is ineffective and irresponsible, Cruz causing a gov't shutdown proves their point. So they're now more likely to approach any gov't legislation with skepticism and derision because they assume that gov't can't be anything other than ineffective and irresponsible.

 You can say his voice was important and that he has a right to voice the opinion of all the people that agree with him and the rest of the country has an obligation to hear him. Um okay, except he was talking about the unconstitutionalism of obamacare -- which the supreme court has already ruled as consitutional -- and the House has taken 37 VOTES on it in the last 3 YEARS. WE KNOW HOW PEOPLE FEEL. IT WAS NOT NEWS in any way. Government is about compromise, not digging your heels in. I just fundamentally disagree with what Cruz did. I think it hurt gov't in a huge way.

 However, on the above point, I will distinguish what Rand Paul did a few months ago about drones.Paul also was filibustering a nomination that had no chance of being stopped, just as Cruz was filibustering a bill that was definitely going to be taken up. However, Paul went in with the intent to use the proceeding to vocalize a minority stance that not many people were thinknig about or writing about. He made that into a national issue where it wasn't before; Cruz is literally beating a dead horse into the ground, one that has played out already on multiple stages (SCOTUS, 2012 election). 

 Wendy Davis's filibuster can also be distinguished as she might have been able to make a real change in the procedure regarding the vote of the law (if she'd survived past midnight without getting 3 ""x's"" of being off-topic, the law wouldn't have been up for a vote before the session ended); it wasn't just grandstanding.

Filibusters can be useful and appropriate. But what Cruz did was irresponsible. Plain and simple.""

Any ideas how to rebute this argument?"

About me:  I have two vehicles with full-coverage insurance on both, both are pretty new and in perfect mechanical/aesthetic condition, one of them is a 4WD that has never had any issues getting me around in any of the storms we've had since I've had it, and I have a clean driving record.  My day job is flexible because my work is based on what I do and not necessarily when I do it, so I can be off each day and at work anywhere in town by 4 pm daily, and would be available for the odd day shift if the need were to arise (and I had maybe just a little notice.)  I'm safe, punctual, and have excellent customer service skills.  I'm looking for a delivery driver job specifically because to me, driving is a nice way to clear my head and relax after a long day of work at my primary job.  I'll also be happy to provide any other information which might help.

As I said, my day job pays fine, I'm not looking to get rich here, so I'm not looking for any unrealistic wage.

I am, of course, looking on my own by stopping in places, checking websites, etc., but if anyone needs or knows/has a lead on someone who needs a reliable driver, please let me know.

1n79p0,19,2013-09-26,An interview with the RWBY animation team.,scheatum,RWBY,https://www.reddit.com/r/RWBY/comments/1n79p0/an_interview_with_the_rwby_animation_team/,"**This is from /u/saskure**

*Hey guys. i wanna thank yout o those who submited questions for us to ask. i know it has been a long time since an update came, and that was cause of finals weeks. To let you know, this is not written out the best because i was giving the questions and also taking down the answers. I hope you enjoy the read. i did my best to get all the information. Once again, this is not really put together other than the direct question and the direct answer, but don't let that discourage you from receiving great information. Thank you to the RWBY team and my animation teacher who set this up for the school. we really appreciate it.*

**Why do they use Poser over the industry standards of Maya and 3DS Max other than for sponsorship reasons?**
&gt; Maya: they are catered to bigger studios. it is more bare bone. Complicated things don’t come into play with the smaller application. It has more of a Gorilla tactic towards animation.

**What's next for the animation team? Is it RWBY from now on or are there other projects in the pipeline?**
&gt; A lot are on contract for season one. Some projects need a large team of animators. Do not know what is next. No promises. It is more of a project to project basis.

**What is the normal day in the office like?**
&gt; Nerf darts. Very long, Extra hours. Everyone kinda doing their job. Rec\view days. Make sure everything is working since there are Different methods for anyone who is animating.

**How long does it take to make an episode?**
&gt;Depends on how long it is.

**Why bi-weekly. It is what they know.**
&gt; Shorter and more often. Some spit cause they

**Who did the original concept art for the characters and comes up with ideas for Visuals and weapons? Monty, somebody else, or is it a collaborative effort?**
&gt; Shane and monty. Tilean Spellling Cad - monsters

**Game industry vs animation?**
&gt; Games a lot longer. Really invest it. Very dependent on other people. Just because you are good doesn’t mean it will. Games have technical restrictions. Only have 16 frames that have to work as attack jump DJ aoe. All that animation in that slot that works. It will cycle. Takes a lot of work. If you animate the camera, you can really polish what you will see.


**What kind of artist do you guys look up to or inspire you?**
&gt; Mark histler. Cameron building demo reel. Turomk stuff. Blue skyand stuff. joe worked on the origanal ninja turtles. Monty. Animation

**Second season of ruby?**
&gt; *Insert Grunt here Fingers crossed*

**When first starting out the animation, was there much of a time constraint?**
&gt; Having the first episode being shown at RTX Time is still strenuous to where we meet a week to week deadline. Cleaned up episode one since there is now time.

**When first asked to help out with this show, what was your initial reaction?**
&gt; Yes. Everyone wanted to jump on board. Some were working on a Demo reel. Some were not told about it. didn’t even know RWBY to start. A specific animator walked in late and she found out she was working on a show she didn’t know about.

**What are some lessons/tricks you have learned while working on the show?**
&gt; Don’t be afraid to try new things. Just throw art on to the screen. Just put poses on the screen. Just work it out. Monty keeps using the same animations over and over and no one has noticed yet because he always uses it from a different angle and tweaks it a little bit.

**As Monty has said before, Battle has a certain Rhythm that the mind will accept. How much of that goes into the thought process while animating any sort of confrontation?**
&gt; Not as much. If combat has a rhythm that the mind accepts while it’s on screen. The impacts are important parts. Not much time for the sound. Petty important.

**What mistakes have you learned from?**
&gt; Always plan for more. When he was making the first trailer, did not see it to be as popular. Did not really communicate it was a smaller project. Saving projects. INCREMENTAL SAVES! Keep building your portfolio. Try and know what you are going after. If your reel is directionless then it can confuse employers.

**Did you ever try and camio yourself in any of the episodes?**
&gt; No, not really.

**What was it like when you were first starting out?**
&gt; Never give up. You won’t get a lot of feed back in the beginning. People were very non-responding. Keep the recourses online. Update stuff all the time. No one is guiding anyone. Everyone in the room is your biggest asset. (Classroom or workplace)

**Were any scenes Mocaped?**
&gt; Scenes are a combination of mocap and keyframe. Blend a lot of the stuff.

**Negitive criticism?**
&gt; Brush past it and keep doing what you are doing.

**When you were first learning to animate, what were some of the obstacles you faced, and how did you overcome them?**
&gt; *Monty*: started now. Tech would be farther ahead. Just start now and live with a stamp of tech. A lot of doubt and fear to apply and show work just in case you suck. Just do it and do what you can and put it out there. The part where people fail is where they are told they arn’t good and don’t want to push forward. Finish things. Don’t just noodle.

**Are there any moments in your career you would have done differently, if you could revisit them?**
&gt; Monty is Perfect. (no)

**What do you use for your audio?**
&gt; Goals. Real life action feature. Learn how to take short cuts. Premier. Up to 100 tracks. Sometimes over. Multiple clips for just weapon transformation. Rubys scyth. 7 tracks? Exporting to mixhouse. Sends prtools project off to our mix house.

**How much in house recording for sound effects do you use?**
&gt; Mostly stock. We do some custom recording.

**What numbers are you generating from the series?**
&gt; They are pretty high. Does not keep track but everyone is happy with the numbers.

**How many episodes are in the first season?**
&gt; 16 episodes.

**Creature design inspiration.**
&gt; Bear type creature. –type creatures. Written into script. There is a certain color
Poly count for a character. The poly count was not kept track of. Tried to keep it low. Between 8 and 12K

**Why do you black out the majority of people in the show?**
&gt; Is this to keep people focused on the story or time constraints? Do not want to fill a bunch of characters that are not important and keeps people to a story. It is just the typical anime style. Sometimes we use a mixture of 2D and 3D. tons of 2D stuff that they can’t do. It is what it is.

**When season 2 comes around. Do you plan to keep the short format?**
&gt; Would prefer to go longer, but It could be a format thing or it could be a promotional thing. How well can you sell it and who you are working along side.

**Where would you suggest a student to apply for internships as far as animation and what position would you suggest?**
&gt; The best experience is real experience. Being at obsidian showed an animator how much you need to complete in a day. You do not know how much is required until you actually get there. 

**2D animation or keep 3d?**
&gt; 2D is expensive. We have a short Time frame. People are talking to Monty wanting to learn from him. The turn around on 3d is a lot quicker, so you can then bounce ideas off each other.

**How/Why did you want to become an animator?**
&gt; One animator answered that she loved Disney movies and wanted to do that when she got to school. When it got hard, it hated her.

*Question for monty:* **Do you feel your work animating RvB for Three seasons help you in getting RWBY animation off the ground?**
&gt; Yes. Not just the library of animations. A matter of a sense of story telling. A steady climb moving into his own animation style.

**RWBY Game?**
&gt; As far as entertaining the idea of a fighting game, Monty said He knows the stats of the characters so It would translate very well, but there is no plan to make one right now.
RWBY movie? An OBA movie would be great if you were to stitch all the episodes together.

**Characters first or the story first?**
&gt; If you get the Right characters, the story will write itself.

**How much did the map and environment play on the characters?**
&gt; A lot and a little. In season one, they are only touching on one city. Future seasons will want to explore more of the world. Seeing more Cultural diversity. Establishing the world map and saying these areas are in these places. Geography determines culture and people. A lot of fun can be had exploring the world.

**When you are just having a bad day and need to take a step away from it all, how do you blow off steam?**
&gt; By playing Dive kick. Keep it light hearted. You also need Chicken wings in the kitchen.

**Why an anime style feel? Was there any other style up for consideration?**
&gt; It is Natural for Monty. They like anime and it is easy to do. It is an Easier rendering. It has More of a Flat color.

I'm taking 19 credits in which one class requires at least 40 hrs of work a week. On top of that, I'm a lawn and garden/tools/ fitness sales representative at Sears. In my department, 3 of my other coworkers also go to college and are entering higher level/ graduate programs. Once classes started in September, my department manager has been MIA and has not shown up for work for at least 20 days, none of the coworkers know what happened to him and the other managers won't talk about it. When he finally comes back, he abuses our availability worksheet and makes the workers who are also students( Including me ) work for an absurd amount of hours per week. We are working more than the other workers who dont go to school. For example, last monday, he had 6 of us workers open and close in which we had $1000 in total sales in our department that day (When you work on commission, that means it was a really  slow day).Yet he has 3 people working for both friday and saturday, our busiest days. So we went to our manager to tell him to cut the hours off so we can have time to do homework, research and study, but he absolutely refuses. The store itself is still hiring and they need us more than we need them yet they treat us like crap, forcing us to lower our commission by using store2home, using the IPad they give us for EVERY transaction (no registers allowed). I got a text from my manager earlier, he texted me if I could possibly work a full sunday shift even though he didn't schedule me for sunday. A hour later, he texts me again saying ""Okay I had to change it. I need you Sunday 11 to 6:45. Sorry I have no choice."" The only reason that I still work at that awful place is because I need money to pay for food and rent. I have multiple internship opportunities, but none of them pay the bills. When it comes to choosing school vs work, I have to choose school, but I feel like they dont see it that way. So after all that ranting, are their any suggestions on how to handle the situation? "
1n769w,6,2013-09-26,Question about cauliflower ear,RxMoreCowbell1,bjj,https://www.reddit.com/r/bjj/comments/1n769w/question_about_cauliflower_ear/,"Hey /r/bjj!! Hope training is going well.

A few weeks ago I got kneed in the ear when playing double leg X-guard and I got a little cauliflower ear (the size of a small pea) very close to where my ear meets the head.

Fast forward to 2 nights ago. We were working on omoplata sweeps and transitioning into a triangle choke when the opponent posts that far hand on the mat. My training partner is gearing up for competition soon and was ""in the zone"" and kneed the shit outta my ear when going for the triangle. And I wasn't wearing any headgear (when I have cauliflower ear I tend to only wear the headgear when rolling, but not drilling). The swelling went from the size of a small pea to the size and shape of a large almond.

So, I make an appointment at the Health Center at school (I'm a graduate student) to get the ear looked at and drained. The doctor said that I shouldn't do anything to it and it will just go away on its own. I told the doctor of my previous experiences with cauliflower ear on the other ear, and respectfully disagreed with him. I said things like, ""I was under the impression that... yada yada yada"" and he replied with a snide question asking me which medical school that I attended. I asked to be referred to an ENT, but he refused b/c of his initial diagnosis. And for the record I can only receive medical treatment through school as I do not have health insurance from my internship. So, seeking a second opinion isn't really an option.

What are your thoughts, /r/bjj?

TL;DR: Doctor said cauliflower ear will just go away on its own and refused to drain/treat and refuses to refer to a specialist/ENT. What would you do?

EDIT: Spelling and Grammar

UPDATE: Thanks for all the helpful info guys! I really appreciate it. I got the ear drained by a friend who used to be a vet tech. I'm having trouble putting enough compression on it due to the location on the ear. I'm going to have her drain it again, and then try compressing with magnets like Kintanon suggested."

(Again!),erdero,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/1n75uw/career_fair_tips_again/,"For the third year running, I'm posting some career fair tips for those of you who may be attending them soon.  I've been recruiting for my company for three years now, and these are all the things that have jumped out at me as things to do or avoid. These are really aimed at college career fairs, but most of it is universal.

* **Wear a suit / nice dress or skirt.** There was a surprising number of people there who looked like they just came from class, wearing whatever they were wearing, like a t-shirt and sweats.  If you've only got an hour between classes to go to the career fair, there's no shame in going to class in a suit, and you won't be the only one.  And when I say suit, that means black or blue, not tan. Don't do ""crazy"" or neon ties. If you want to stand out, make your resume stand out. Unique clothing can only negatively impact you. This year I saw some women wearing evening or party dresses. Please, wear work attire. If you don't *have* work attire, *get* work attire. That's the idea, isn't it?
* **Research the companies you want to work for.** If you come up to a recruiter and the first thing you say is ""What do you guys do?"" then you're going to have to fight your way out of the rejection pile. If you have a specific job posting or program you're looking for, that's perfect. It takes 30 seconds to step aside, take out your phone, and Google a company and what it has to offer.  If you're an aerospace engineer asking a video game company what they do, you're wasting your time, the recruiter's time, and anyone in line behind you's time.
* **Make eye contact.** There was very little behind me, but some people sure seemed to be looking for something. I want the impression that you're excited about what I'm telling you.
* **Points on resumes:** If there's something you really think the recruiter should see that's relevant, be sure to point it out, because we don't have time to go through the whole thing word-by-word. Before you talk to each recruiter, have one or two items on your resume that are relevant to the job, ready to point out. Also, use bullets, don't write paragraphs. Make sure everything's well-formatted and good-looking. Get someone, or even better, lots of people, to critique it for you. Make sure you keep it to a page. If you have so much stuff that there's just no way you can keep it to a page, make different resumes for different jobs (I have one for aero, one for general ME, etc).
* **List your objective.** Be as specific as you can be. If necessary, even print out different resumes with specialized objectives (CAUTION: Don't list the specific company. It can come off either as pandering or it gives away what you're doing). This gives the impression that you're excited about a certain field. A generic ""job in the mechanical engineering field"" is far too broad. I got a resume that just said ""Job.""
* **Be professional.** A few years ago, someone came up to me, put down a briefcase, handed me a seven-page resume (at least), patted me on the back and put his arm around me, and said ""get me a job."" ""What are you looking for?"" ""A job."" I was immediately looking for reasons to not give him a job.
* **List your GPA.** If you don't, I'll either ask or assume the worst.
If necessary, list your citizenship status. A lot of companies, including mine, can only hire US citizens or permanent residents due to government contracting. If you think I might have to ask, put it on the resume. It takes up practically zero room.
* **Ask questions.** What's the culture like where you work? What do you do on a daily basis? What benefits does the company have outside of work (sports, grad school, etc)? *Do you like it?* What *don't* you like about it?
* **Don't be nervous.** We're at the career fair because we want to find great people like you to work for us. You already know you'd be great, so just show us why.
* **Follow up.** If the recruiter gives you their contact information, and on the chance that resumes aren't already sorted into ""yes"" and ""no"" by the time the they leave, it's nice to send a follow-up ""Thank You"" email to whoever you talked to. If they were particularly impressed by an internship or project, re-highlight it to remind them (even the candidates we really like can run together after four hours).

I don’t know if he realises or not but his efforts affects his audience, atleast me, a lot, in a positive way ofcourse. Whether it may be a 50-min uncut unedited RollerCoaster Tycoon’s video or a 1-min MORE!!! or Cookie Clicker video, he makes me smile every single day. He uploads his video at around 12:30 - 01:00 AM (according to my timezone) and truly speaking, it is the only high-point of my day. I stay up late just to watch his video.


I am a guy who is seriously depressed due to all the current scenarios and all. I ~~am~~ was a well-deserving undergraduate who did some awesome international internships (the only one from my college) and some kickass projects too. Then when the placement-semester started, due to this annihilating economy, I got a job (so to say) but didn’t get my joining date. When all my friends started earning some handsome salaries in June/July, I was just crying and begging the company for a joining date. I got so depressed that I was ready to work anywhere. Meanwhile, to keep myself away from the miseries of the “real” life, I started searching for more channels and I found yours. From June till this date, I have watched each and every video from your main channel, life-vlog channel and Dad^3 channel. I am so much addicted that now I say “hello” just like you and “woopsie-daisies” &amp;amp; “I lied” have become my faviourite phrases.


I do a jobsearch for almost 6 hours daily, then some Battlefield 3, followed by yours, Cayin’s and D00M49’s video. I just stay awake waiting for your videos, daily. I have known your channel, and certainly you for 4-5 months only, but you have become an integral part of my day, literally!



Thank you Dan

Sincerely,

a random Procrastinator!

EDIT: **TL;DR:** I watch daily your videos to cope up with my depression. :)

I live in a very expensive city, and have been saving little to no money each month. Most of my paycheck has gone towards rent, parking, and gas. I have alleviated this problem a little bit by leaving my car at a friend's house outside of the city, and commuting by train.

Moving on, the job itself has made me miserable (market research, for anyone wondering). My supervisor is dishonest, quick to judge, and there is little to no actual research done with each project I work on. It took me a few months to pick up on this, but according to a coworker who has been here for 5+ years, this is how it has always been done. Every day spent here feels like a waste of time, and that I could be learning so much more elsewhere, rather than sitting on Reddit for a part of the day, and listening to my supervisor pull data out of her ass for the rest of it. Therefore, I have decided to look for another job.

Thinking long term, I cannot afford the city I live in much longer, and rent prices continue to skyrocket. I also want to change my career path to something other than market research (considering marketing and advertising). I have been looking for jobs near another major city by my hometown, about 5 hours away from where I currently live. 

My problem is this: It seems as though I am in a terrible position to make a career switch. Many of the entry level positions I am looking at in marketing and advertising require skills and experience that I do not have. I have done some of my own research, and am considering getting AdWords certified to boost my resume a bit. I have also looked at internships, but the vast majority require candidates to be enrolled in a university program, whereas I graduated in 2012. 

I understand that the choice is ultimately mine, but I'd like to get some other opinions on the matter: If you were completely miserable at your current job, would it be worth quitting and moving back home for a bit to find something better? I am also keeping in mind the fact that if I do decide to quit, I risk being unemployed for much longer than anticipated. What, in your opinion, is the best course of action in this scenario? And for those of you in marketing or advertising, what advice do you have for someone with one year of work experience who is trying to make a career change and break into those industries?"

The main reason for this is my lack of internship or work experience.  I was an athlete through my second year of college, and I was not able to take courses in the summer afterwords. 

It's been a few months and only recruiting agencies are contacting me.  Will creating a website, hosting personal projects on it, and placing the url on my resume entice companies to pursue me?  

Also, could it be that my location has a lack of need for programmers?   I live in near a major city in Ohio where most jobs are Java / C# .NET positions.  Are these employers averse to hiring young programmers?

EDIT: Every recruiter I've spoken to has said they will contact me with jobs that have salaries in the range $35,000 - $40,000.  This seems much lower than the average.  At four months without employment, should I take anything that comes up to get experience, or is it worth finding a higher paying position? "

I really REALLY do not want, nor plan to go back to school as ive already got quite the debt racked up. I've heard people suggest looking into miami ad school or vcu or other programs, but I would rather get some full time experience first before jumping into anything like that.

In order to keep myself productive I've just been spending my days exercising and i've started teaching myself how to code/program (it's been an interest of mine), but other than that I'm worried that theres not much I can do that would be relative to any future job positions, and I'm just dreading the moment in an interview when they ask ""so I see the last thing on your resume was from a couple months back. what have you been doing since then?""

Would getting a part time job look bad or is there something else I can do to make myself more valuable??

Thanks for the help

Edit:

Sorry I should preface, I'm not a creative and so I don't have any portfolio to work with or anything... I don't know if freelance or similar things would still apply for non-creative positions, but any advice would be welcome

Also if you have any job searching resources for agency/client positions or otherwise it would be great to hear them

[Will I owe a penalty if I do not pay &amp; file quarterly for stock option exercises?  I've read that so long as its your first time exercising, and you pay more to the IRS than the prior year you are free from penalties?  if so, how much more do I have to pay this year to avoid the penalty?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n4wjk/iama_certified_public_accountant_ama_for_all_of/ccg0sk2?context=5)|The rule is you have to pay 100% of your previous year's tax amount, or 90% of the current year.  So if you owed $5,000 last year, but will owe $30,000 this year, you can pay in $5,000 without penalty.  This changes for people making over $150,000 (I think.  It changes).  In that case, you have to pay in 115% of prior year.  But it would still be $6,500, not 30,000.

I don't think my hard earned taxes should go to pay for some shmuck just cause he has some shitty kids.  I think we need 100% more transparency.  Ideally you should be able to decide where your taxes go.  Say 40% goes to the government, and 60% you are free to split as you feel needed, between education, national defense, or infrastructure.

It's overly complicated and skewed towards destroying the middle class.  I think we need an additional high income bracket.  I think we should consider a flat tax system, getting rid of all the deductions available to only the top bracket.
[1\) My brother got behind on his mortgage, I am going to give him money to get caught up. It will be more than the gift tax exclusion of $14k, actually much more. To avoid potential IRS problems I am going to attach a lien to his property; a second mortgage. He claims that he will pay me back P&amp;I every month but I'm not going to beat him up over it. If he does pay me, how do we report the interest to the IRS?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n4wjk/iama_certified_public_accountant_ama_for_all_of/ccfttpl?context=5)|You may want to consider an outright gift.  Even if it's over the $14k annual, you still have $5,000,000 lifetime exclusion to work with, so there will not be a taxable issue.  Messing around with a lien and second mortgage on a family member gets messy.  You would have to report the interest income, and he would take the expense.  And he may not even be able to deduct all of it.  In fact, if you are covering that much of the mortgage, you may even want to consider purchasing the house from him and renting it back to him.
[As soon as I get one myself! Any idea on my question #2 if we go with the second mortgage?

[Starting my first day tomorrow at a CPA consulting firm and graduating with Accounting/Finance this December and can't wait! Quick question- Is there a likelyhood with this accounting internship/job and two other non-accounting, yet finance related internships, I could get an Associate position at a Big 4 firm with a 3.1 even though I am a year into post-grad life?

They hire constantly.  Do you want one? Probably not.
 |The lucrative private firm will give you good experience, and it's all about what you make of it.  I'm not in the Big 4, but a few friends are, and I don't see that much benefit other than marginally higher pay.

[Is there any way we can get a tax deduction for gifting a week at our cabin to a silent auction to benefit our children's school? Our CPA said it's not allowed. If true is there any creative way around it ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n4wjk/iama_certified_public_accountant_ama_for_all_of/ccghtze?context=5)|Unlike cash, you cannot deduct the cost of a stay that you donate to charity. Donating a stay in your vacation home is considered ""right to use property"". This falls into the category of ""partial interest in property"". The IRS is very clear that this is not deductible. They even go so far as to provide an explicit example involving the donation of a stay at a vacation home to a church charity auction. This is covered in IRS Publication 526.

[I am potentially interested in buying a new house.

However I don't really have enough for a downpayment on a new house without using the equity in my old house.

If I understand the rollover rules, I think I could 1. cashout the ira, 2. buy new house, 3. sell old house 4. fund new ira for the same amount of money with the proceeds from the old house and as long as I got all that done in 60 days then it would be a rollover and there would be no tax consequence. Have you ever seen anyone do that? Does it seem like a bad idea to you? Am I inviting an audit or other pain in the ass?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n4wjk/iama_certified_public_accountant_ama_for_all_of/ccg2n9j?context=5)|That actually seems like a decent option, but I have not seen it before.  The big danger is missing that 60 day window in paying into the IRA.
 |Have you bought a new house recently?  Because there is an exception to the early withdrawal penalty for new house purchase. You would still have to pay tax on the whole thing, but you wouldn't get hit with the 10% penalty.
 |You may be onto a good strategy, but you need to be VERY careful.  There's no audit risk at all, but there is a very high ""raped with taxes"" risk.  
[How do you feel about Free Tax USA for filing taxes? I'm a full time college student, full time worker, no kids or wife and no house. I make around $20,000 but I usually get back maybe $90 from returns, does that sound right?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n4wjk/iama_certified_public_accountant_ama_for_all_of/ccffx5w?context=5)|Do your parents claim you, or do you claim yourself?  See the above comment about education credits getting you some money back if you pay for college and claim yourself.
 |I can't tell what sounds right. Unfortunately, that's now how it works. 
[I claim myself and I no longer live with my parents, I don't pay for school I get grants ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n4wjk/iama_certified_public_accountant_ama_for_all_of/ccfg9f6?context=5)|Most tax programs can't go wrong.  If you have any major expenses, such as kids, houses, or education (But not cars), then you can get a little more money back.  But it usually comes back to what you paid in.
[Ok cool! Thanks! Now I normally claim 02 for six months then claim 0 for 6 months to even out how much money I can keep per check since claiming 0 takes so much money from me. Is it bad doing it that way? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n4wjk/iama_certified_public_accountant_ama_for_all_of/ccfgz3a?context=5)|It's not bad, it's just silly.  Just claim 1 for the whole year.  It's a small difference going by 1.  The more you pay in now, the more you might get back at the end.  Having to pay at the end of the year SUCKS.  Err on the side of too much paid in.

[But thats not my question.  My wife started a business a couple of years ago that has earned almost no income (literally, $50\).  Will I be sure to be audited if we try to claim startup expenses of $5000 or so?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n4wjk/iama_certified_public_accountant_ama_for_all_of/ccg0gaa?context=5)|Here's the deal with business losses.  Three year of straight losses on a schedule C raise a red flag and double the audit risk.  However, if it is actually a business and not a hobby, there is nothing they can do, even if audited.  But in your case, you may not want them to look too closely at your return.  Startup expenses are normal, but three years of losses are questionable.
[This is probably an incredibly rudimentary question so mockery will be expected.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n4wjk/iama_certified_public_accountant_ama_for_all_of/ccg0gaa?context=5)|Oh, i'm a snot guru, Mock mock mock.  There you go.

[I was thinking of getting an international accountant, but would one really know all the necessary tax info for all 3 countries? Are they any sources online that can help me understand the requirements and further explain tax treaties? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n4wjk/iama_certified_public_accountant_ama_for_all_of/ccfguva?context=5)|International Tax can be tricky, and I'm sure an international accountant can help you in your struggle, as it's a very specialty field.  If any of those countries are the US, you can check this out: [Link to www.irs.gov](http://www.irs.gov/Individuals/International-Taxpayers/Tax-Treaty-Overview)  Tax treaties reduce the U.S. taxes of residents of foreign countries. With certain exceptions, they do not reduce the U.S. taxes of U.S. citizens or residents. U.S. citizens and residents are subject to U.S. income tax on their worldwide income.
[In the past decade, what law or regulation has made your job easier?  Which one has made it more difficult?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n4wjk/iama_certified_public_accountant_ama_for_all_of/ccfvmrn?context=5)|Alright there Mr Making Me Think.  Slow down for a minute.
 |Sarbanes Oxley has required 100% more pain-in-the-ass forms, but it's a good thing making sure Enron doesn't happen again.  To be honest, there should be more regulation in banking and stock trading now or we're going to see it again.
 |It's not a regulation, but becoming a CPA is like obtaining a superpower.  People question me less, I get discounts and preferential treatment, and I mingle with a lot of consummate professionals.  Good times.
 |No law or regulation will ever make my job easier.  The whole tax code is a convoluted nightmare.  They should throw the whole out and start over. I just don't think super rich lawyers in Congress should legislate taxes.  But I digress. 
[*No law or regulation will ever make my job easier.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n4wjk/iama_certified_public_accountant_ama_for_all_of/ccg18p4?context=5)|Clarification.  The government will never make my job easier until the average person can do their own taxes.

Do you have any auditing experience?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n4wjk/iama_certified_public_accountant_ama_for_all_of/ccfhd1m?context=5)|I audited for several years, and still do from time to time.  Auditing requires a set fee or budget each job.  Tax and Consulting can be much more lucrative.
 |Auditors tend to know specific areas like Accounts Receivable, and concepts like ""risk"".  But Tax Preparers know payroll issues and taxes, which are more useful for common folk.  
[I just bought my first new car at 27. Why the hell are my property taxes at almost 1,000?! How do I lower that?! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n4wjk/iama_certified_public_accountant_ama_for_all_of/ccfk30b?context=5)|What now?  You must mean personal property taxes?  Not every state taxes property like autos, so you could move.  Property taxes are also based off the value of the property, so you could have a crappier car.  Sorry friend, the things that come with having money include taxes.  Cars are always painful tax investments.
[That makes sense. I have worked at a Big 4 firm practicing audit for a couple of years. I never got into tax and know much less about it than most people think. Assuming tax and audit were equally lucrative - which would you prefer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n4wjk/iama_certified_public_accountant_ama_for_all_of/ccfhv67?context=5)|Probably still tax.  Auditing is more systematic, and I prefer the diversity that tax provides.
 |To each their own.  It's a question of what fits your skill set better.  That's the beauty of accounting, is there's enough area for everyone to find their specialty.  And you make money by specializing. 
[Any tips for a single member LLC filing a Schedule C with their 1040? Especially if income goes from &lt;$30k to &gt;$100k from one year to another?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n4wjk/iama_certified_public_accountant_ama_for_all_of/ccfmxz5?context=5)|Yes.  File an 8832 and become an S Corporation.  LLCs give you no tax benefit.  Your schedule C profit is entirely subject to the additional 13% FICA tax.  If you have an S corporation, you get to determine how much of the profit is ""wages"", and only that much is subject to FICA.  Could save a couple thousand a year.
[I'm curious about irs behavior in audits. A few years ago (long enough that I'm probably in the clear\) I was deducting health expenses and several months after my return was filed I figured out that I had (completely by accident\) included some receipts in my pile to deduct which had been reimbursed by insurance. I contemplated filing an amended return but it was a pretty small amount of money and I thought I might draw more attention to myself if I did that, so I just let it go on by. So my question is: if I had been audited would they likely have figured out that it was reimbursed (are they that thorough?\) and would they have accepted that it was an honest mistake or would they have outright declared me a fraud and come after me?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n4wjk/iama_certified_public_accountant_ama_for_all_of/ccg2xcz?context=5)|If the dollar amount is small, you shouldn't be too worried.  They may find it during audit, but it sounds like an honest mistake.  One time, honest mistakes are common, and you would just have to pay up.  Fraud is more like a pattern of intentional avoidance of taxes.
[Want to do my taxes for me?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n4wjk/iama_certified_public_accountant_ama_for_all_of/ccfm4nz?context=5)|Sorry friend, you probably can't afford me. 
[Is there anyway I can claim my MBA tuition as a business expense?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n4wjk/iama_certified_public_accountant_ama_for_all_of/ccfuwaw?context=5)|Possibly, but probably not.  Good try!
 |Do you have a business or are you already in a line of work you intend to continue? (For example, if you are getting your masters for teaching, are you already a teacher?)  You may have a better shot.
 |You cannot deduct anything that will qualify you for a new trade or business, or anything that you need to meet minimum job requirements of a job you don't have.
 |There are education credits available (Lifetime Learner for Grad School).  Be sure to bring all tuition information to your tax prep, without a doubt.
[Do you mind telling me about how much you/the average accountant makes? I'm considering majoring in the field but it seems very difficult to make a lot of money.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n4wjk/iama_certified_public_accountant_ama_for_all_of/ccfqz5c?context=5)|Well, yes and no.  The key with accounting is it's bracketed income.
 |The first 2-3 years you work very hard, and you make $35-45,000 depending on the area.
 |The next 3-5 years you work even harder and make $50-70,000 per year.
 |If you become partner after 10 years or so, you can make $100-500,000 minimum, depending on the size and location of the firm.  Or you can work 30 hour weeks and make $80,000.  Still a nice option.
 |It can be very lucrative, but it is very difficult.  Requires patience and persistence.
[Any tips for small-time landlords? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n4wjk/iama_certified_public_accountant_ama_for_all_of/ccfhw6v?context=5)|Landlord on the side?  Try to break even.  Money you lose comes out of your pocket, and may not always be deductible if you make too much otherwise.  If you make money, that's a better problem to have.  Be sure to note ALL expenses, every drive to the rental, every lawn mowing, etc.
 |Landlord starting off?  Get your real estate license and flip a house every once in a while.  Gives you some tax options.
[I own a home (mortgage,\) have a family of 6, and the sole income earner - am I still better off filing the EZ form, or will I be getting more back through itemization?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n4wjk/iama_certified_public_accountant_ama_for_all_of/ccfhcrw?context=5)|It all depends on amounts paid for mortgage interest, real estate taxes, and charity.  You should file the regular form just to make sure you get all the credits, including child and child care.
 |Take your time, and consult a tax preparer if you have questions.
 |Have the wife start a small business out of the house, if she's up for it.  Something small, like Avon or PartyLite or something.  
[If you sell a property, you have to pay capital gains tax's if you received an income from it. As in if it was a rental at any time.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n4wjk/iama_certified_public_accountant_ama_for_all_of/ccfqu0e?context=5)|The rule is, if you owned and lived in the property for 2 of the past 5 years, then you aren't taxed on the gain of sale up to $250,000.  The key is you can only use this once every 5 years.
[As I only have to keep tax documents for 5 years, if I own a property for 10 years, rent it out for the first 5 then live in it for the next 5, do I need to pay capital gains tax's or can I assume I lived it in for the whole time considering my documents don't go back that far?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n4wjk/iama_certified_public_accountant_ama_for_all_of/ccfqu0e?context=5)|However, you may need to recognize a gain related to any depreciation taken for the rental.  If we want to get technical about it.  Be sure to consult a tax pro if you are showing a major taxable gain. 
[I have non qualified stock options at a non public company. They have already risen in value to much more than their strike price. As I understand it there's essentially no way for me to sell them and pay the cap gains rate because the minute I exercise them the difference between the strike price and the current market value is subject to ordinary income rate ( so waiting a year will do no good as it would with isos\)...do you know of any way around this problem?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n4wjk/iama_certified_public_accountant_ama_for_all_of/ccg2fcq?context=5)|The stock options were given to you as a form of compensation I assume?  Anything that takes the form of compensation is subject to ordinary rates.
 |What you can do is gift the stock options to charity instead of other contributions you would make.  You get the deduction for the full value, but don't have to recognize the ordinary income.  Not a bad option, if you are feeling charitable...
[I have a contractor business. My CPA doesn't write off my home office (empty bedroom\). He says that when I go to sell my house, it might bite me. What do you think?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n4wjk/iama_certified_public_accountant_ama_for_all_of/ccffr7l?context=5)|The benefit for home office is not as much as you would hope, and it's a big red flag.  If you sell your house, you may have a gain to pay tax on if you deduct it's depreciation.
 |If you actually use the home as an office, then you should absolutely deduct any related expenses.  Offsetting your Schedule C income with legitimate expenses is the best way to save on taxes.
[Say I buy a run-down house for 40k, put 20 into it and sell it for 90k.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n4wjk/iama_certified_public_accountant_ama_for_all_of/ccfj0x1?context=5)|If you are in the business of real estate, any losses on your other rental properties will be deductible against your regular income.  Capital gains at 15% vs Ordinary losses at 18% (Minimum).
[I have a gain of 30k that I have to pay 15% on? How does this benefit me or effect my other rentals? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n4wjk/iama_certified_public_accountant_ama_for_all_of/ccfj0x1?context=5)|If you really pocket $25,000 after the whole thing is over, I would count that as a win too.
[The new safe harbor thing on the home office thing sounds like a good deal though. no decpreciation recapture.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n4wjk/iama_certified_public_accountant_ama_for_all_of/ccfmc88?context=5)|I agree.  That's going to be easier, more beneficial in several cases, and less risky.
 |For those who don't know, instead of the normal home office percentage of actual expenses, taxpayers can take $5 per square foot, up to a $1500 max.  Easy peasy.
[I am a partner at a new start up grossing 500k year currently , however I have a full time job also making 95k while this new start up takes off.  Should my partners and I issue dividends rather then salaries from our business to reduce our tax rate?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n4wjk/iama_certified_public_accountant_ama_for_all_of/ccgj64e?context=5)|It all depends on the business set-up.  Dividends are a good option, but there may be other options as well.  If you have a start-up already grossing $500k and expecting to take off, you should hire a good CPA to do the business returns, and all the partner's individual returns and do some good tax planning.
[I have a regular W2 job and I also became a independent contractor for 3 months, making total of $15,000 which I will get a 1099-MISC at end of year.  I have not paid any self-employment or estimated taxes.  But I am withholding X amount each pay check to make up for it.  Is that approach ok?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n4wjk/iama_certified_public_accountant_ama_for_all_of/ccfit6t?context=5)|That approach is ok.  I would recommend doing a schedule C for your 1099 Misc income and writing off expenses like mileage, cell phone, and all other costs of generating that income.  This should help soften the impact.
 |Be Careful.  Self-Employment tax is 13% on top of regular tax.
[Do you have any tips for someone trying to get into the Accounting profession?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n4wjk/iama_certified_public_accountant_ama_for_all_of/ccfijgl?context=5)|I think a CPA (Or CMA possibly if going corporate) is much more important than ANY BS or Masters degree.
[So is income earned as a real estate professional subject to the medicare surtax? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n4wjk/iama_certified_public_accountant_ama_for_all_of/ccfmatk?context=5)|Do you mean self employment tax?  It all depends on the nature of income.  Income from the sale of houses is capital gains, income from rental gains may be subject to FICA.  If you are getting paid by a third party, then definitely.
[If I have a home office, can the business cover a percentage of the rent and utilities? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n4wjk/iama_certified_public_accountant_ama_for_all_of/ccftl1a?context=5)|Yes, as long as its legitimate.  It depends on the business set-up in order to take the most advantage.
[It is legitimate. Whats the percentage, if you happen to know?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n4wjk/iama_certified_public_accountant_ama_for_all_of/ccfuark?context=5)|Percentage all depends on how much of your house you actually use.  10% of house, 10% of expenses.
[I don't make alot of money or have a house or business. is filling a 1040ez still the best option, or am I missing out on savings that a CPA could get for me. IE. tax breaks and things i'm not aware of.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n4wjk/iama_certified_public_accountant_ama_for_all_of/ccferq8?context=5)|1040 EZ is super simple, and probably fine.  If you don't have a house, business or kids, you are probably not missing out on much benefit from a CPA.  Turbo Tax, etc. would be fine for tax prep.
[Verified.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n4wjk/iama_certified_public_accountant_ama_for_all_of/ccff7dn?context=5)|Thanks friend.  Still lovin' the flair.
[Will i get back any money by filing my income taxes, i am currently a student and have never filled before. and my parents still claim me on there tax form. i work a super part time job probably make 10k a year. thanks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n4wjk/iama_certified_public_accountant_ama_for_all_of/ccff8m9?context=5)|Nope, probably not.  You get back what you pay in, and you probably didn't pay much in.  Without claiming yourself, you may not even get that back.
 |Your parents are getting a credit for you going to college.  Or they should be.  Couple thousand bucks for dealing with you for 20 years.
 |Sorry my friend, but it is still better than paying a ton in taxes.
[Yeh with the student debt, i feel uncle sam will be in my back pocket for many years to come!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n4wjk/iama_certified_public_accountant_ama_for_all_of/ccffj1o?context=5)|He's in mine, pretty deep.  Good luck!
[My job illegally paid me as a contract employee. I am a 8-5 every day office worker. No one can give me a straight answers on what percentage I'm going to have to pay on my wages. I made about 6,000 before I quit. So now I'll have to fill out a 1099. Google sucks on answers. MANY THANKS!! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n4wjk/iama_certified_public_accountant_ama_for_all_of/ccfk59o?context=5)|Your percentage depends on your total income, but 1099 wages are hit with a 13% FICA on top of this percentage.  The key is you need to write off expenses against this income on a schedule C.  You may be able to get that down significantly.
 |If your employer is screwing you, just bring up the DOL.  They have been doing LOTS of employee vs contractor audits.
[My girlfriends dad is on disability from Social Security. Is there any way for him to receive an income tax return. He is 61 and that is his only income. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n4wjk/iama_certified_public_accountant_ama_for_all_of/ccfny3j?context=5)|No probably not.  The good news is Social Security is usually minimally taxable.   The bad news is he's not going to get money back.
 |A lot of people expect money from doing their taxes, but that's not how it works.  Sorry my friend.  Good luck!

[Did any of you guys see South Park last night?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n6ftb/we_are_members_of_the_stopwatchingus_coalition/ccfu71n?context=5)|There are two really important differences between Facebook and your friends knowing a lot about your life, and the NSA knowing the same information (although in practice, it's far more). The first difference is **consent**. Like most things in life, gathering information about someone with their consent is not very similar to doing it without their consent. In this case, the NSA's been doing things without consent, lying to keep it secret, and even sabotaging and breaking digital locks to do what they're doing. The second difference is that Facebook and Twitter don't have jails and police forces. 
[If not, it presented a pretty sharp counterpoint to this whole way of thinking. The argument was that it's absurd to complain about being watched when we broadcast so much about ourselves anyway. Another point they made was, 99.9% have absolutely nothing of NSA interest going on in our lives anyway.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n6ftb/we_are_members_of_the_stopwatchingus_coalition/ccfu71n?context=5)|I think it's very interesting that the rally in the show was called ""Stop Listening to ME"", whereas the real rally is ""Stop Watching US."" The fact is, programs like this in many ways have bigger impacts on the fabric society as a whole than they do on most individuals at a particular point in time. I've already found myself thinking twice before making a joke in an email, or visiting a website, or signing a petition online. It may not change my daily life too much to have a voice in the back of my head that says ""how will this look to the NSA in 5 years"", but over time it will have a very negative impact on freedom of speech and the types of political and social conversations that happen in our society.
[Would be interested to here your response(s\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n6ftb/we_are_members_of_the_stopwatchingus_coalition/ccfu71n?context=5)|Sometimes the NSA turns information over to the DEA and the IRS, and then those agencies figure out another way to pretend to discover the information they already have. Then they lie in court about where the information came from. This technique is called [parallel construction](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/07/us-dea-irs-idUSBRE9761AZ20130807), and it means that none of us can be sure whether the information the NSA collects could impact our lives or not.
[I'm trying to talk to friends and family about these issues, but they seem overwhelmed. What small steps can I encourage that will help to engage them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n6ftb/we_are_members_of_the_stopwatchingus_coalition/ccft1l4?context=5)|What aspect of it seems overwhelming? That there's too many things to do, or that they're all too difficult, or that it's not clear what will work? Or all of the above?
[I think, like a lot of Americans, it seems like the fight is too big, and too scary, so they just want to ignore it and hope it goes away.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n6ftb/we_are_members_of_the_stopwatchingus_coalition/ccftmju?context=5)|Well, this is always one of the debates of political action; how do you balance individual action (changing your behavior online, using encryption) and collective action (petitions, rallies). The real answer is always a combination of both, but I think this fight will be won by collective action.
[I'm trying to suggest the small things: get rid of FB, encrypt email, etc. but they don't seem willing to hear me.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n6ftb/we_are_members_of_the_stopwatchingus_coalition/ccftmju?context=5)|Are your Senators and Rep. in the House on record on NSA surveillance? If so, have your friends and family make a quick call to the office and either thank them for their stance, or let them know you're disappointed. Contrary to popular belief, those calls really do make a difference, and they take less than 2 minutes.
[Any ideas on how to make it clear how important the fight is? Other small steps I can encourage?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n6ftb/we_are_members_of_the_stopwatchingus_coalition/ccftmju?context=5)|For most people, getting rid of FB is just too big of an impact on their social life, and email encryption can be too complicated. I would focus on small ways for them to participate in collective action, and focus on the aspect of NSA surveillance that seems to bother them. Do they think it's creepy, are they worried it will be used to target political dissidents, are they upset it's unconstitutional, etc. Different concerns can be addressed different ways.
[I can relate to this issue, and to me, people just don't care. They just want a comforting lie that everything is fine. That surveillance isn't a big issue if you're not a criminal, bullshit like that.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n6ftb/we_are_members_of_the_stopwatchingus_coalition/ccftmzj?context=5)|According to [the latest AP poll](http://bigstory.ap.org/article/poll-public-concerns-rise-spying-privacy), ""close to 60 percent of Americans oppose the NSA's collection of data on telephone and Internet usage. A similar majority opposes the legal process supervised by a secret federal court that oversees the government's classified surveillance.""
 |It's certainly understandable to be skeptical about our political process, but cynicism is a much bigger obstacle to winning this fight than apathy. If everyone who's posted on reddit that rallies are pointless shows up in DC, we'll have all this sorted out in no time!
[Awesome question. We're going to have a really professional livestream for the event, and we're hoping that folks who can't attend will organize viewing parties in their areas. You can still RSVP at Link to rally.stopwatching.u even if you're unable to attend, and you'll be kept in the loop about other ways to participate.  We also really need everyone who can to donate so that others can attend: Link to www.indiegogo.com.  And, as always, you can take action by tweeting, sharing, emailing everyone you know who lives within a few hours of DC and asking them to attend. Become an organizer! Do you know of any activist organizations, unions, faith based groups, or celebrities who should endorse this rally? Contact them and tell them to contact us!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n6ftb/we_are_members_of_the_stopwatchingus_coalition/ccfso8k?context=5)|All of this is great advice. I'd also make sure you [fill out the rally volunteer form](https://rally.stopwatching.us/volunteers.html)!
[As serious as this issue is, does it bother you that right now, considering what you are trying to do, you only have a total of three questions? What does that say about how not only the majority of the American public but the supposedly in0the-know online community seems to perceive this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n6ftb/we_are_members_of_the_stopwatchingus_coalition/ccfsibc?context=5)|It says that we were up really late last night getting everything ready for the launch, and so we didn't spread the link very widely in advance :(
 |EDIT: up to 79 comments, also might say it's not fair to judge an AMA only 4 minutes in :)
[What are you attempting to accomplish with this rally? Tentatively, what would you like to see happen next?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n6ftb/we_are_members_of_the_stopwatchingus_coalition/ccft7we?context=5)|Well, right now there are a ton of different bills being proposed by various lawmakers (the ACLU has a handy chart [here](https://www.aclu.org/blog/national-security/nsa-legislation-leaks-began), though it doesn't have bills from this week yet). Some of them are great, some of them are weak, and some of them are total distractions that won't help at all.
 |If we can demonstrate that people are paying attention, and care, it makes it much harder for legislators to support one of the crap bills and then go home and claim they've solved the problem. Some of these bills are going to pick up steam, others won't, and our energy and visibility can play a role in that process.
[Can you name some of the cases where people have gone to jail based on information obtained illegally by the NSA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n6ftb/we_are_members_of_the_stopwatchingus_coalition/ccftd98?context=5)|Well, as it turns out we wouldn't necessarily know that it happened. When the DEA or IRS receive intel from the NSA, they then try and figure out another way they *could* have found the information, and then lie in court and say that's how they caught someone. They call it ""parallel construction."" [Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/07/us-dea-irs-idUSBRE9761AZ20130807)
[When will you be announcing the physical locations for the start of the rally and for the Friday training? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n6ftb/we_are_members_of_the_stopwatchingus_coalition/ccftypy?context=5)|Probably in the next week or so. It'll all be right in the Capitol Hill area, so the exact locations shouldn't change anyone's travel plans or anything like that.
[How would they know? Nothing they're doing does anything. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n6ftb/we_are_members_of_the_stopwatchingus_coalition/ccftk6f?context=5)|Just curious, what are you basing that judgement on?
[My county in California has hired a contractor that plans to use plate tracking, and cell/GPS data for traffic analysis. The part that bothers me is they claim that they're going to use the plate numbers to look up peoples names and addresses from DMV records to send surveys. Something that I didn't think was possible for anyone to do. Is it possible? Is it legal? Who should I contact to stop it?  Edit: Article about it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n6ftb/we_are_members_of_the_stopwatchingus_coalition/ccfvvlw?context=5)|License plate tracking is an issue that the ACLU has done research on. You might think about filing some freedom of information act requests to find out more about how the system works, I can connect you with someone who's filed requests like that in the past in regards to license plate readers if you'd like.
[What would be the single worst possible thing to happen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n6ftb/we_are_members_of_the_stopwatchingus_coalition/ccftkp3?context=5)|Nothing. If it turns out the government's been spying on everyone and lying about it, and nothing changes, then we're in trouble. Luckily that's not what's going to happen!
[Since nothing gets us into trouble, it seems that we are already in trouble. What do you think will be the turning point in this battle?  My compliments on the ninja edit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n6ftb/we_are_members_of_the_stopwatchingus_coalition/ccfvb6r?context=5)|Well, obviously we think this will be the turning point! The lobby day will, I think, be really effective in driving home to lawmakers that their constituents are watching, and care enough to travel from all areas of the country. The rally will help in a lot of ways, not just as a show of numbers but also in connecting different people who care about these issues and bringing together an incredibly diverse coalition of groups unlike really any other coalition I can think of.
[How can I, a Canadian, support you guys?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n6ftb/we_are_members_of_the_stopwatchingus_coalition/ccftsbi?context=5)|You could definitely support our [Indiegogo campaign](http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/stop-watching-us-a-rally-against-nsa-surveillance-on-october-26th--2/x/4790552) to help us throw a successful rally and help more people get there 
[What are your thoughts on Kim Dotcom, is he helping you in any way?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n6ftb/we_are_members_of_the_stopwatchingus_coalition/ccft44d?context=5)|Kim Dotcom's not a part of the coalition; I assume he could be if he wanted to, but he hasn't been in touch. The coalition is extremely diverse, so I'm sure some groups view him as a criminal, others as a hero, and some probably couldn't care less. Coalitions are interesting beasts; if you look at the diversity of the groups in ours (Green Party &amp; Libertarian Party, Occupy &amp; Tea Party), there's probably not a single thing we all agree on except NSA surveillance!
[I see that one of your donation options is to sponsor a bus. Any chance you're planning on providing buses so people on the West Coast could attend, if funding allows?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n6ftb/we_are_members_of_the_stopwatchingus_coalition/ccftbuw?context=5)|If funding allowed, we'd love to provide buses to everyone who needs one. Realistically, the cost from the west coast will probably be too much to cover, but maybe there are companies or groups on the West Coast who'd be interested in sponsoring a trip? Definitely worth checking!
[I want to help and participate, but I can't make it to DC on that date.  What are my options?  Will there be a rally in my city?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n6ftb/we_are_members_of_the_stopwatchingus_coalition/ccfwlgd?context=5)|There'll be a way for people to participate, with viewing parties for the livestream and we're working on other possibilities too. I'd [RSVP](http://rally.stopwatching.us) to get more updates on that.
[Perhaps not directly related to your AMA's intent, but why do an AMA with so many usernames answering questions? Did you consider making a StopWatching username? I feel this AMA would have gained a lot more traction with a unified responder. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n6ftb/we_are_members_of_the_stopwatchingus_coalition/ccfw67p?context=5)|Do you mean that all 10 of us could have used the same account at the same time, or that one person should have answered all of the questions? Neither would really work too well, since there's far too many questions for one person to answer, and we all have our own views and can't speak for the coalition on everything.
 |In terms of traction, we've been having really productive conversations with people and we're at #8 on the front page, so I think it's going quite well!
[I want so badly to help and be a part of this. Passionate is an understatement for how I feel. Where can I go to link up with a volunteer for transportation to the event?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n6ftb/we_are_members_of_the_stopwatchingus_coalition/ccfuwcq?context=5)|It's really encouraging that you're so passionate! If you [RSVP](http://rally.stopwatching.us), you'll get more information about transportation. Where are you based?
[This might not be the best place to ask but are any of these organizations looking for summer interns for the next year?  Edit: Awesome, thank you both for the responses ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n6ftb/we_are_members_of_the_stopwatchingus_coalition/ccfur8g?context=5)|Definitely a tough place to ask. I would research the different organizations, figure out what kind of work sounds most interesting (blogging? organizing events? policy? social media campaigns? fundraising?), and go from there.
[For those unable to come to DC, is there any nationwide coordinated action happening on the 25th/26th? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n6ftb/we_are_members_of_the_stopwatchingus_coalition/ccfum6y?context=5)|[RSVP](http://rally.stopwatching.us) and you'll get more information about local viewing parties and other ways to participate. If you have any ideas, definitely let me know!
[Where can I go to find somebody organizing a ride from my area? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n6ftb/we_are_members_of_the_stopwatchingus_coalition/ccfvotz?context=5)|[RSVP](http://rally.stopwatching.us) and you'll get more info on that. Where are you based?
[I get the feeling that this entire thread is filled with paid shills from the organizations above. How can politically motivated groups possibly convince me and others here that what they are trying to accomplish isn't just a means to an end. I personally do not agree with several positions held by these groups, but ""Stop spying on us"" seems like something we can all agree on. In other words, how can we trust you, these politically motivated groups, to have the people's best interests at heart?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n6ftb/we_are_members_of_the_stopwatchingus_coalition/ccfu93z?context=5)|What specifically are you concerned about? I can assure you that anyone at any of these organizations could get a more relaxing, higher paying job as a consultant or a lawyer at a bank. What motivation would any of us have to pretend to care about these issues?
 |And trust me, if we had money to pay shills we'd just use it to pay for the rally instead of launching an Indiegogo campaign!
[Why is the title of this post so hard to grok?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n6ftb/we_are_members_of_the_stopwatchingus_coalition/ccfvptz?context=5)|Damn, is it? What did I do wrong!
[With regard to the ACLU track record, how do you expect to be taken seriously?  At this point you will probably just be doing more harm just by the mere association of your organization with this topic.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n6ftb/we_are_members_of_the_stopwatchingus_coalition/ccfty70?context=5)|Huh?
[Thank you kindly, but don't let it take time away from more important matters please.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n6ftb/we_are_members_of_the_stopwatchingus_coalition/ccftq1j?context=5)|Man, you're going to feel super guilty when the EFF starts losing all its court cases because all the lawyers are updating the Humble Bundle stats :)
[Hello guys, I just have ask you guys a quick question. I signed your petition for stopwathingus a while back, and I'd like to know if the petition has affected or changed anything with the outcome of the NSA to stop spying on us. Anyways thanks for the AMA, and have a good day.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n6ftb/we_are_members_of_the_stopwatchingus_coalition/ccft2z4?context=5)|It's hard to say what impact came from the 570,000 signatures, and what impact came from the passion that drove all those people to sign the petition. The fact is, DC insiders were **blown away** that the Amash Amendment even made it to the floor for a vote, let alone almost passed. That would never have happened if lawmakers weren't hearing about the NSA from their constituents, full stop.
 |A big part of the rally is going to involve delivering all those petition signatures in a dramatic way, so they haven't fulfilled their whole purpose yet!
[I just want to say thank you. please let us know if there will be anything i can do to help in la.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n6ftb/we_are_members_of_the_stopwatchingus_coalition/ccfw1b7?context=5)|Fill out the [volunteer form](https://rally.stopwatching.us/volunteers.html)!
[While I agree with you that 7 votes isn't a great deal, it looks, to me at least, that interest in this is waning. That, unfortunately, means it's going to be more difficult to get those seven votes.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n6ftb/we_are_members_of_the_stopwatchingus_coalition/ccftjqb?context=5)|Everything I've heard and seen from people who are experts on these matters (DC insiders and journalists) indicates that this fight is very winnable. It looks like if the Amash vote were held again today, we'd win. What makes you think that our chances have gotten worse?

I'm a veteran player. No seriously, I was in the 82nd Airborne Infantry. I've also been playing League since beta. I recently got a very well paid internship at the VA in the Human Resources field. I lived in Wichita, graduated from Wichita State, and now I live in Topeka. I'm also married and unfortunately my ELO had nothing to do with it! Forgot to say I have three plat accounts, though two of them recently fell to ELO decay back to gold 1 since I moved to Topeka. Literally just got internet hooked up yesterday in our new rental.

I main top. It's the role I prefer, it's a role I'm pretty good at. A lot of my friends play top well too, but I'm more consistent than most of them and I carry well and build smart. If a jungler camps me and they get more than one kill, it's my fault. I understand I make mistakes and I admit them.

I like to play with other people (I have several friends I que with regularly at various skill levels). I do use skype. I would prefer gold and above players reply, but I'll certainly play with silvers too. I have lots of silver friends I play with already and I guarantee some of them are worse than you.

Ranked teams:
I prefer 5 man ranked because I take almost every game seriously, whether normal or not. I'm a sore loser, and I apologize for that. I have become a much nicer friend during losing games than I used to be and usually just laugh about it. I recognize positive attitudes make everyone's experience better, and negative attitudes just create more butthurt-ed-ness. Butthurtedness. Yes.

If I'm adding someone off of reddit or vice versa (they add me) I will have to play a little bit with them to know if I like them. Same with them and me. You shouldn't play with someone you can't stand.

Likewise this isn't ""I'm creating a team to go pro."" I expect my team to be closer to the gold or platinum range, regardless of the ranks of its members. I know it's possible, we got gold already this season with only two platinum players and a bunch of silvers. 

My goal here is to have fun and to learn. I want to make new friends who are on around the same time I am. I'm not expecting someone to promise they will dedicate two hours every night to playing together and scrimmaging. I can't even promise that.

I'm also not here to say it's my team. I could even join an existing team. I have three accounts (though one of them I am trying to get a PW reset), I can have more than one team. Technically I could have 15. 

If you're interested just add mrelram. If you're not interested please do not add mrelram, instead just type something rude in a comment below. Please make it funny or original though.


PS: Also please let me know if anyone is interested via comments. I may or may not login tonight. I still have to put my computer desk together and unpack one billion boxes. "

I got 'let go' from a job that I truly thought was going to open the door to the rest of my life. I feel terrible, but at the same time, I feel so relieved.

Truth is, it wasn't a good fit. I had no connection with my middle-aged office-mates. I wanted to like sitting at Quickbooks all day, sending out invoices for loans. I tried to get something better out of it, but being a non-profit, it wasn't like I could pick up hours or really delve into my own projects and interests. I think the organization is great- if I could've essentially gotten a creative role or anything where I could feel myself learning or being of actual use. There was no chance to move up, and even when I started, I knew I didn't have the patience to stay there long. 

The job kind of fell into my lap after a meeting about volunteering. Even though I had no real experience or interest in clerical work (I've got a background in marketing, social media, and entrepreneurship), I was so enamored by my name being attached to the kind of organization I spent 4 years and $100,000 to be a part of, I didn't think twice.

The worst thing about it is I don't know what to do next. It was only PT (I still work FT as a server) so the money part isn't a real issue. There's just so few similar organizations around or even other gateway positions that I can get involved with. 

I'll take an internship, I'll volunteer. Both would end up being more rewarding, I think. There's slim-pickings where I'm from and I'm not in the position to move anytime soon.

On the bright side, I haven't had a day off since I started in June. I get to spend a few whole days with myself. I need a haircut, to clean the house, call my parents and catch up on BrBa. No more 70-hour weeks, no more lonely days in a quiet office. 

I wish the organization well and thank them for the opportunity- the opportunity to remind me that I'm NOT the silent, sitting-at-desk, getting-headaches-from Quickbooks type. I need to talk to people and make connections and see growth and feel like a useful cog. I'm not a scapegoat, I'm not uneducated, I'm not shy, and I'm not afraid. I'm ready to kick some ass."

I am not in film school, or anything of the like, but I might be interested in a career in production, so I wanted to ask some things.

1. Is this the kind of industry where one has to move around constantly?

2. Is there an area with more opportunities than others?

3. What's the pay like?

4. How does one move from a PA to the higher ranks?

Regardless, here I was, riding the elevator towards their office. After six weeks, one of the three interns would be hired as junior paralegals, and I wanted that job. *Relax, you can do this*. Steeling myself, I step out as the doors open. Stopping at the front desk, I ask the assistant where Mr. Clark's office is. Introducing herself, she guides me back to a few chairs seated outside a frosted glass door, letting me know he'll be with me in a minute. I swallow, gathering my thoughts. Each of the interns had been assigned to one of the three head lawyers, and Mr. Clark was going to be my boss for the next month and a half. Lost in thought, I fail to notice as you sit down across from me. After a moment, I feel myself being watched. Looking up, I try not to show my surprise at the incredibly beautiful woman who has appeared in front of me. ""My name is _____,"" you say extending your hand. I take it, noting its soft warmth, but also the firmness behind it. Clearly a girl who's used to being in charge. ""You must be Zach,"" a knowing smile flashes across your face. Taken aback that you know my name, I briefly stutter, caught up in your eyes.  ""That's right. Do we know each other?""

""Not yet,"" you reply, a mischievous glint in your eye. Before I have a chance to digest what that could mean, Mr. Clark opens the door to his inner office. A large, broad-shouldered man, his voice booms when he talks. ""Zach, sorry to keep you waiting!"" He steps out of the doorway and I stand, extending my hand. He takes it, shakes it vigorously, and slaps me on the back. Guiding me inside, he continues, ""No time to waste, we've got plenty to do. Glad you were able to meet my daughter!"" Turning towards you, he beams. ""It'll be just a little bit, sweetie."" Glancing behind me, I can't help but swallow nervously as you shoot me an aggressive smile. Daughter?!

1n6liq,7,2013-09-26,[26/M] My girlfriend [23/F] just dropped an ultimatum. . .,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1n6liq/26m_my_girlfriend_23f_just_dropped_an_ultimatum/,"Backstory:

So, my girlfriend (23/F) and I (26/M) have been dating for a little over a year. We had known each other through work for about a year or so before. Which brings me to Part One:



We both worked in retail, and I was her manager for about a year. It was my first job out of college, and it was her job on breaks from college. Long story short, apparently everyone at the store knew she had a crush on me, and I never knew (because I'm oblivious). Always thought she was very attractive, but I'm not the type of guy to outwardly (or slyly) hit on or flirt with someone. So I never knew that she was into me. Granted, she did use me as a reference for an internship, and I usually called her when I needed someone to fill a shift - because she was a hard worker and very versitile. Nothing more to it than that.



Part Two:
Fast forward to February of last year. I quit my job (career change that turned out to be for the best), and was on the outs with my girlfriend (at the time). By the end of March, my relationship had ended, and my current girlfriend and I started to talk fairly regularly. Again, being that she was 22, and still in college (I was 25), I didn't really see her as a prospective partner. But the more we started talking, the more we hung out. Eventually (by the end of May), we were hanging out and hooking up regularly. At that point, we were both open about our expectations and wants, because both of us had recently exited long-term relationships. We both had the ""let's just see where this goes"" mentality, and we weren't in a rush to get serious. But by the end of July, we were ""official"".



The first few months were great. She was living at home, and I had an apartment with my younger brother; she would stay with me a couple times a week, and most weekend nights. We went to parties, baseball games, out to the bars, and always found something to do that both of us enjoyed. Best of all, I never felt smothered, and I continued to have ""me"" time to do the things that I like to do (play music, work out, read, etc.). This helped tremendously, as we don't share a ton of common interests, although we do see eye to eye on most issues. We both expressed doubts about the idea of marriage, having kids, and about how many of our friends rushed into marriage too quickly out of college. We both talked about how our previous partners had pressured marriage and long-term plans against our will, so I was happy to be relieved of that pressure.



Part Three:
In April, my brother started dating his current girlfriend. From the start, my girlfriend never really liked her - for what seemed (to me) to be arbitrary reasons. She (my girlfriend) didn't like that she was quiet, and snuck out in the mornings after spending the night without saying anything, even if we were on the couch in the living room. Now, I'll be the first to admit that I don't get upset about a whole lot. I knew my brother's girlfriend from when we were kids, and so I was always giving her the benefit of the doubt. I constantly had to tell my girlfriend to ""just let it go"", ""it's none of our business"", and ""she's not doing anything to you"". A couple times, my girlfriend got into it with my brother about how she didn't like his girlfriend, and thought they got drunk too much, and were ""rude"" to her. Now, I don't really care what my brother does, or what his girlfriend does, as long as they're not hurting themselves or anyone else. I do think my brother blows through money too quickly, and I think he'd benefit from slowing down...but I'm not going to tell him what to do. I'm open with him, and let him know when he's doing something that bothers me, but for the most part my motto is ""live and let live"".



Part Four:
Nevertheless, in June of this year, we moved into a bigger apartment in our complex, so that my girlfriend could move in. This was after much discussion between the three of us, and my girlfriend and I had decided that it was a logical ""next step"", and that it would be less pressure than moving in together right away. But due to the issues mentioned above, it seems that this has caused stress on our relationship. I don't quite understand it, but sometimes she'll want to hang out with my brother and his girlfriend, and sometimes she'll want nothing more than to be as far away from them as possible. If my brother's girlfriend comes over, and they go to his room to hang out (door open), she gets offended that they ""don't want to hang out with us"". But other times, she says (to me) ""ughhh - why is she always here?!"" Most of the time, it seems like she is looking for me to approve of what she says, and complain along with her. In truth, I don't care of my brother's girlfriend comes over to hang out, if they go to his room and fuck or if they hang out in the living room. It really doesn't matter to me. But when I express that opinion, my girlfriend gets upset with me, saying that I don't ""support her"", and that I should talk to my brother about his behavior. Two things here: (1) If she has a problem with my brother or his girlfriend, I think she should have a conversation with one or both of them. I think it's unreasonable for her to expect them to know what she expects, and it isn't my job to communicate for her (especially when I hold a different opinion). (2) When I try to explain that we were the same way when we started dating (going out all of the time, drinking, spending money, and hanging out in my room), she insists that ""that was different - we weren't THAT bad"".



Also, over the last few months, she has been dropping hints about saving for a ring, and talking about ""our"" future. She had never done this before, and it appears that her feelings have changed about marriage and children - but she won't have a conversation about it when I ask her how she feels.



Here's the icing on the cake. This week, my mother (who lives out of town) invited my brother and I to go to dinner with her and my grandfather. Originally, we were supposed to go on Tuesday, and it is always implied that girlfriends are invited. Of course, my brother had something to do on Tuesday, and it was rescheduled to Wednesday; which sucked, because my girlfriend had a hair appointment that night. So, not only does she blame my brother for having to move dinner, she tells me that I should tell my brother to not invite his girlfriend, because ""if she (my girlfriend can't go)"", it's not fair. I tell her that I understand she's frustrated, but I'm not going to tell my brother to not invite his girlfriend, and if she wanted to ask him to do that, she could. But I wasn't going to do it for her. (Context: There have been plenty of times where my girlfriend has been at family events that my brother's girlfriend couldn't make.) So, of course, I wind up going to dinner with my mother, grandfather, my brother and his girlfriend. When my girlfriend finds out, she flips out on me, saying that I ""don't respect her feelings"" enough. I reiterated that I understood that she was upset about not being able to make it, but again, I'm not going to tell my mother or brother to uninvite someone just because you can't go.



When I got home that night, she was watching a movie in the living room. My brother and his girlfriend walked in, said hi, and proceeded to his room to watch a different movie. So at this point, not only is she upset about dinner, but she is also upset that they ""didn't want to hang out with her"". I said ""why would you want them to hang out with us; it seems like you don't like them anyway"". She proceeds to turn the volume on the TV up so loud that my brother closes his door. The following conversation ensues:
 


Me: Why are you doing that?
My girlfriend: Because they annoy me.
Me: Is this really how it has to be? 
My girlfriend: Yep.
Me: Fine, I'm going to go to bed.



I proceeded to brush my teeth and go to sleep. She gets in bed about an hour later, doesn't say a word. We get ready this morning, doesn't say a word. 



She texts me when she gets to work: ""If you're never going to love me you should just tell me now."" 



What. The. Hell. 



I don't even know how to answer that. I don’t like ultimatums (in my experience, a relationship shouldn’t hinge on them), and it seems like she’s putting the ball in my court. Frankly, right now she is making it very difficult for me to feel connected to her, let alone to say I love her. Honestly, I don't think I am ""in love"" with her, and I don't want to use that word if I don't mean it. I'm pretty sure she loves me, but she won't say it or open up about her feelings.



At this point, I don't know what to do. I care about her tremendously, and for the most part, I greatly enjoy our relationship. But her attitude towards others, and the way she behaves when she doesn't agree with someone, or merely doesn't like someone is a huge turn-off. It's things like this that make me question whether we should be together long-term, let alone get married or have children. If and when I have kids, I don't want them to act that way, and it would be extremely hard to enforce behavior if she acted like that.



I know we need to have an honest conversation about our relationship, and it could very well mean going our separate ways. Any advice?



**TL;DR:** Girlfriend said ""If you're never going to love me you should just tell me now."" Shit's getting real...need some input."

So I met this girl through a friend in February or so and I thought we hit it off so I kept on trying to schedule something with her and every time she had some excuse or flaked on me so I assumed she didn't like me so I stopped trying. But then she began talking to me (facebook, texting) like every day all summer while we were apart (across the country at home for the summer) and we told eathother we liked eachother and stuff. So I figured there was a chance maybe we could have some sort of relationship. Now for this school year while she is at school I am on internship continuing to live at home so I am a 3 hour drive from my school and I'll be back for my final year next year with her since she is a year younger than me.

Anyways since I both wanted to see her and visit other good friends I drove up last weekend and we went out for drinks on the Saturday. I thought the night went well, we had a good time, laughed, walked around town barhopping, I kissed her at the end of the night after walking her home (kinda sloppy though as we had both drank too much) and she texted me while I was walking back to my friend's place (where I was crashing) telling me thanks for a good night, had a lot of fun and some drunk flirty stuff and to text her when I get back safely (not the safest area of town where I was staying). She was a little sick on the date and I think drank too much and wasn't feeling great which is why I wasn't invited in. Also I think she wouldn't do that on the first date, which is fine, its not why I took her out.

So the next day (Sunday) I text her saying I'm glad she had a good time, I did too. No response. I text her on the Monday just to chat like usual and she sends a few short messages and then stops responding. Now its Thursday and I've heard nothing from her.  Does she not like me anymore, I don't know, maybe I'm being paranoid or over thinking this but I can't stop feeling like I messed up or freaked her out or something. Should I stop messaging her and wait for her to message me? In 2 weeks (my school's homecoming that I am going to drive up for regardless) at my school my faculty is hosting a semi formal and I want to ask her to it but I'm not sure of how to go about it while I'm unsure of her she's feeling.

Any advice or related stories/ experience would be greatly appreciated. Maybe I am just being an idiot and everything is fine. Basically I have no one around here I can talk to about this so I turn to you reddit. Thanks.

tldr: Not sure if I freaked out girl as she now seems unresponsive to me after date/ kiss. I want to ask her to semi formal but unsure of it. Am I being paranoid about this stuff?"

The way my course works is that you just expect to do a masters and so that is what I had always planned, however I recently had it pointed out to me that if I wanted a job in the financial industry then I could just graduate with a bachelors. My worry is that my original plan was to do a summer internship at the end of this year so if I were to graduate then I would be entering the world without any actual financial experience.

Do you think I should graduate later with a better, unrelated degree and (hopefully) some intern experience or should I graduate early with a worse, unrelated degree and no intern experience?

So extra stuff about me, don't know if it helps. I expect to graduate with a good grade (1st so far), I have a years work in catering (team leader) and some volunteer stuff to put on my CV.

So, I'm a male college junior and I can admit that I have never really had a serious relationship. Not for lack of trying though. I had the normal crushes in high school that amounted to little more than all of her girlfriends laughing at us in the end and the whole thing degrading into a pile of awkward silence and pent up feelings. My experiences in high school ruined me relationship-wise. By the time I started college, all I wanted to do was something that impacted the world, so I opted for setting my sights on neurosurgery, since my family's medical history made me familiar with the subject of neuroscience. I knew what I was getting myself into, 13+ years of schooling, long hours, little to no social life in the end. I accepted it. I didn't want anything to do with love, I had my blinders on and I was hitting the road. Well, Freshman year I met a great girl in my classes that was interested in medicine as I was. Naturally, I started to develop feelings for her, but after she acquired a boyfriend, I gave up and dealt with a mild depression for the next 6 months driving those feelings out of my soul. I succeeded. I went back into my blind sprint towards the medical profession. For awhile, I loved the fact that love meant nothing to me. It was sort of liberating. I had a few surgical internships that cemented my love for fixing people with my hands rather than meds alone. I was on top of the world and felt myself moving towards my goal.

Now, this is where the true meat of the story hits. The back half of my Sophomore year. I had just been accepted into an undergraduate research position in neuroscience. I was doing great. Then I met her.  She was beautiful, smart, eccentric like me, single, and actually gave me the time of day. We developed a somewhat close friendship (or so I thought) over many conversations and outings, with me listening to her, and providing her an open ear and a caring heart. She never reciprocated. She told me about her past, about her ex that she still cared for, despite his actions that led to the termination of their relationship. I tried so hard to get her to forget him, but she did not. For another 3 months, I cared for this girl and was there for her, but she refused to be there for me. I didn't start to see just how futile my actions were until about 3 months ago. I started to see just how little she cared about even having a friendship with me. She stopped talking to me altogether, even avoiding me when she could. After school kicked back in, we went out with a couple of our mutual friends for a night, and started to talk again as we had, so my hopes started to rise, but it was useless. She contacted me a couple days after the night out sounding worried and off-kilter. When I asked her what was wrong, she didn't answer. I naturally began to worry. After she didn't answer two phone calls from me, I went looking for her. After a 3 hour search of her usual hang-outs and apartment and numerous more texts, I got a text from her that simply said ""lol, gotcha."" That's when I saw it. She was what my friend had dubbed a ""tease."" She merely kept ""close"" friends to fulfill her need for attention. My friend had told me this from the beginning. It wasn't until the incident then that I realized that we were never really friends from the start. Every conversation had been initiated by me, and I had driven every conversation, with her always acting disinterested and distant. I had been used, and I felt terrible. I felt like the lowest human being on the face of the planet. I came to find out that she had been seeing her ex again, and was very close to rekindling the relationship.  It was high school all over again.
After I realized and accepted that another relationship had failed to get even off the ground despite my best efforts, it dawned on me again that I should just stop trying, that it was an uphill battle, and that a life alone but spent in the benefit others was all I needed. I accepted my fate once again and did my best manic-depressive-charlie-brown act of not letting it show, but letting it eat at me.

Fast forward to about a week and a half ago, at a meeting of an organization I'm in. This girl sat down to our meeting as a new member. The minute I saw her my heart leapt up into my throat so much that I nearly choked. I was giving a talk to the members and literally found myself lost after I saw her. She was beautiful beyond any girl I had ever seen. EVER. Now, though I found her beautiful, I knew from past experience that ""wolves in sheep clothing"" are far more common than anyone gives credit. I wrote her off as another beautiful face that would never really be interested in me. It turned out I was wrong. After seeing her activity on the Facebook page for the organization that I first saw her at, I became slightly intrigued. She didn't seem like any other girl I had met. She was interested in various nerdy things that I never thought a female would be interested in. I gave in to the curiosity and struck up a casual conversation with her. Talking to her was so fantastic. She took the conversation and drove it, wanting to actually know about me and my interests. I was damn near speechless. We talked for nearly 6 hours that night. It turned out we shared almost every interest we had. This had never happened to me. I had found someone to relate to, comfortably talk to, and to share things with. We have been talking regularly and went out as friends a couple of times for the last week or so. But...but...I can't be doing this. It's just going to end in heartache again, right? Wrong. I said I had feelings for all of those other girls. This is different. I actually feel chemistry with her. I feel a connection with her. I can say that, without a doubt, I **love** this girl. I cannot even describe half of the feelings I have when I'm with her. When I see her smile, I get chills. When we talk, I'm on cloud nine. This is what I have either been robbed or robbed myself of my entire life. I have found something that I wasn't even looking for, and had accepted as fantasy for the hopeless. I found the girl of my dreams, after I stopped searching so damn hard.

TL;DR: Numerous failed relationships. Gave up on love, then it fell into my lap."

Once again, this is not really put together other than the direct question and the direct answer, but don't let that discourage you from receiving great information. Thank you to the RWBY team and my animation teacher who set this up for the school. we really appreciate it. 




Why do they use Poser over the industry standards of Maya and 3DS Max other than for sponsorship reasons.
 Maya: they are catered to bigger studios.
it is more bare bone. Complicated things don’t come into play with the smaller application.
It has more of a Gorilla tactic towards animation. 

What's next for the animation team? Is it RWBY from now on or are there other projects in the pipeline?
A lot are on contract for season one. Some projects need a large team of animators. Do not know what is next. No promises. 
It is more of a project to project basis. 

What is the normal day in the office like?
Nerf darts. Very long, Extra hours. Everyone kinda doing their job. Rec\view days. Make sure everything is working since there are Different methods for anyone who is animating. 


How long does it take to make an episode. 	Depends on how long it is. 
	

 
Why bi-weekly. 
It is what they know. Shorter and more often. Some spit cause they 

Who did the original concept art for the characters and comes up with ideas for Visuals and weapons? Monty, somebody else, or is it a collaborative effort?
Shane and monty. Tilean *Spellling* Cad - monsters

Game industry vs animation
	Games a lot longer. Really invest it. Very dependent on other people. Just because you are good doesn’t mean it will. Games have technical restrictions. Only have 16 frames that have to work as attack jump DJ aoe. All that animation in that slot that works. It will cycle.  Takes a lot of work. If you animate the camera, you can really polish what you will see. 

What kind of artist do you guys look up to or inspire you? 
	Mark histler. Cameron building demo reel. Turomk stuff. Blue skyand stuff.
joe worked on the origanal ninja turtles. 
Monty. Animation

Second season of ruby?
	*Insert Grunt here* Fingers crossed

When first starting out the animation, was there much of a time constraint, having the first episode being shown at RTX
	Time is still strenuous to where we meet a week to week deadline. Cleaned up episode one since there is now time. 

When first asked to help out with this show, what was your initial reaction?
	Yes. Everyone wanted to jump on board. Some were working on a Demo reel. Some were not told about it. didn’t even know RWBY to start. A specific animator walked in late and she found out she was working on a show she didn’t know about. 


What are some lessons/tricks you have learned while working on the show?
	Don’t be afraid to try new things. Just throw art on to the screen. Just put poses on the screen. Just work it out. Monty keeps using the same animations over and over and no one has noticed yet because he always uses it from a different angle and tweaks it a little bit. 

As Monty has said before, Battle has a certain Rhythm that the mind will accept. How much of that goes into the thought process while animating any sort of confrontation?
Not as much. If combat has a rhythm that the mind accepts while it’s on screen. The impacts are important parts. Not much time for the sound. Petty important. 

What mistakes have you learned from. 
	Always plan for more. When he was making the first trailer, did not see it to be as popular. Did not really communicate it was a smaller project. Saving projects. INCREMENTAL SAVES! Keep building your portfolio. Try and know what you are going after. If your reel is directionless then it can confuse employers. 

Did you ever try and camio yourself in any of the episodes. 
	No, not really. 

What was it like when you were first starting out
	Never give up. You won’t get a lot of feed back in the beginning. People were very non-responding. Keep the recourses online. Update stuff all the time. No one is guiding anyone. Everyone in the room is your biggest asset. (Classroom or workplace)

Inspiration for weapons. 
JOHN Not cool

Were any scenes Mocaped?
Scenes are a combination of mocap and keyframe. Blend a lot of the stuff. 


Negitive criticism? 
Brush past it and keep doing what you are doing. 

When you were first learning to animate, what were some of the obstacles you faced, and how did you overcome them?
Monty: started now. Tech would be farther ahead. Just start now and live with a stamp of tech. 
A lot of doubt and fear to apply and show work just in case you suck. Just do it and do what you can and put it out there. The part where people fail is where they are told they arn’t good and don’t want to push forward. Finish things. Don’t just noodle. 



Are there any moments in your career you would have done differently, if you could revisit them?
	Monty is Perfect. (no)

What do you use for your audio. 
	Goals. Real life action feature. Learn how to take short cuts. Premier. Up to 100 tracks. Sometimes over. Multiple clips for just weapon transformation. 
Rubys scyth. 7 tracks? Exporting to mixhouse. Sends prtools project off to our mix house. 

How much in house recording for sound effects do you use. 
	Mostly stock. We do some custom recording.

What numbers are you generating from the series.
	They are pretty high. Does not keep track but everyone is happy with the numbers. 

	How many episodes are in the first season?
16 episodes. 

Creature design inspiration.
	Bear type creature. –type creatures. Written into script. There is a certain color 

Poly count for a character. 
		 The poly count was not kept track of. Tried to keep it low. Between 8 and 12K

Why do you black out the majority of people in the show? Is this to keep people focused on the story or time constraints? 
	Do not want to fill a bunch of characters that are not important and keeps people to a story. It is just the typical anime style. Sometimes we use a mixture of 2D and 3D.  tons of 2D stuff that they can’t do. It is what it is.

When season 2 comes around. Do you plan to keep the short format. 
	Would prefer to go longer, but It could be a format thing or it could be a promotional thing. How well can you sell it and who you are working along side.	

	Where would you suggest a student to apply for internships as far as animation and what position would you suggest. 
	The best experience is real experience. Being at obsidian showed an animator how much you need to complete in a day. You do not know how much is required until you actually get there. 

2D animation or keep 3d?
	2D is expensive. We have a short Time frame. People are talking to Monty wanting to learn from him. The turn around on 3d is a lot quicker, so you can then bounce ideas off each other. 

	
How/Why did you want to become an animator?
One animator answered tha she loved Disney movies and wanted to do that when she got to school. When it got hard, it hated her. 

Question for monty: Do you feel your work animating RvB for Three seasons help you in getting RWBY animation off the ground?
	Yes. Not just the library of animations. A matter  of a sense of story telling. A steady climb moving into his own animation style. 

RWBY Game?
As far as entertaining the idea of a fighting game, Monty said He knows the stats of the characters so It would translate very well, but there is no plan to make one right now. 

RWBY movie?
	An OBA movie would be great if you were to stitch all the episodes together.  

Characters first or the story first? 
	If you get the Right characters, the story will write itself. 


How much did the map and environment play on the characters? 
	A lot and a little. In season one, they are only touching on one city. Future seasons will want to explore more of the world. Seeing more Cultural diversity. Establishing the world map and saying these areas are in these places. Geography determines culture and people. A lot of fun can be had exploring the world. 





When you are just having a bad day and need to take a step away from it all, how do you blow off steam?

Venture Capital Internship Case Interview,[deleted],investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1n5tsf/help_venture_capital_internship_case_interview/,"I'm in the 2nd round interview competing for an internship position with a venture capital firm. Basically they gave me a choice of four companies, and I have to pick one and do an investment analysis on it and submit both a written document and a PowerPoint presentation. If I do well in the write up I get to present my investment analysis in person for the 3rd round. I really could use some help, as I have no experience with this. The biggest problem is that these are private companies. I cant divulge the companies, but I could use some resources. Like, how do I determine the value of a privately held company? I cannot contact the companies. Are there any useful resources for determining market sizes? What does a venture capital due diligence investment report look like? is there a template? what about a PowerPoint presentation? I know how to do consulting slides pretty well, is this different? Any other ideas of what I could do to really dominate this?"

It figures I jumped in right when 6 schools got 1-2 new laptop carts each, so I've been going to each school, unboxing laptops, taking inventory of their service tag numbers and assigning county equipment numbers, etc.. I'm the intern, of course I'm going to get that stuff!

We're getting towards the end though, I have two carts left to do at one school and I'm done with that part of it. Eventually we have to go around and add them to the domain and add the printers and all the other fun stuff. 

But what should I ASK to see and work with? Obviously they aren't going to give me the log in details to all their servers because of student records and such, but they can sure show me some of it and let me work with it (heavily supervised, of course). I have worked with one tech that likes me enough to give me the credentials to log into most Windows 7 PCs in the county, but my supervisor doesn't know that. He has expressed to me that if I work with him more often that he would show me some of the server and database stuff he's assigned to, but chances are I'm not going to work with him THAT often, as there is a lot of ""bitch work"" for me to do. 

I have discussed with him that I would like to see more, and he knows I want to and respects that. He said after these carts are done in a couple weeks I would be getting into more interesting stuff. But is there anything I should ask to specifically see? "

1n5qe2,0,2013-09-26,BREAKING NEWS: President Obama to relinquish control of the United States at 12:00 PM tomorrow,MungoBaobab,exjw,https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/1n5qe2/breaking_news_president_obama_to_relinquish/,"**WASHINGTON, DC --**  In a stunning move, President Obama announced he is relinquishing control of the Continental United States at 12:00 EST tomorrow and handing all executive powers to Ayman al-Zawahiri, leader of al-Qaeda, in order to end the War on Terror.

In the first phase of his plan, which was outlined in a series of 66 press releases dictated to various government functionaries ranging from unpaid interns to US senators, President Obama will travel with his cabinet and govern the United States in name only in absentia from his home state of Hawaii.  He will also retain the title and duties of the Commander-in-Chief, and will enforce a strict no-fly zone around the Continental US.  All day-to-day government functions within the remaining states will presumably be taken over by al-Zawahiri and al-Qaeda, who experts believe will likely institute a strict interpretation of Sharia law.  Despite handing over all executive functions and powers within the US to al-Qaeda, however, the White House has made it clear they will expect the population to abide by all current federal and local laws.

Phase Two of the President's plan involves sending Vice President Biden to the occupied US to serve as a rallying cry for the remaining population. Although it is extremely likely al-Qaeda will imprison and publicly execute Vice President Biden once they locate him, his sacrifice will prove to the world one can live according to the principles and ideals as laid out in the US Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, and the Bill of Rights.  Regarding President Obama's decision to send his vice president to certain death, Secretary of State John Kerry has stated in a press release dated March 16th that any American citizens supporting him will not be destroyed in Phase Three of the operation, and will have access to so-called Obamacare and other Obama Administration initiatives once the United States is retaken.  144,000 loyal American civilians will then be selected to join the Obama Administration in Hawaii to help govern the United States once the President's plan has been fully implemented.

Phase Three of Obama's plan will involve a series of drone strikes, carpet bombings, and tactical nuclear detonations against American civilian populations the administration determines gave undue support to al-Qaeda during the course of their occupation.  The leaders of al-Qaeda themselves, including al-Zawahiri, are to be captured alive and sent to the Guantanamo Bay prison facility for a period of ten years.

After securing control of the United States away from al-Qaeda, President Obama claims he will then implement all policies and initiatives he promised during the 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns.  After the terrorists have completed their ten-year detainment in Guantanamo, in Phase Four the President will free them within the United States, where he promises they will be free to recruit as many American civilians as they can.  However, once they have recruited new members, Obama warns, he will sign an executive order whereby any and all individuals in al-Qaeada will be put to death, immediately and without trial.

According to the Administration, this four phase initiative will unilaterally end the War on Terror and convince the international community that the American lifestyle is superior to al-Qaeda, and also end the need for any future conflict.

1n5pz9,11,2013-09-26,"Advice to new graduates seeking jobs, from someone who hires often.",whothecapfit,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1n5pz9/advice_to_new_graduates_seeking_jobs_from_someone/,"I've seen a number of posts from people struggling to find jobs, so I thought I'd give you a sense of what the person across the table from you in an interview is thinking.

I'm in charge of hiring for a highly competitive boutique management consulting/investments firm. I manage ~10 people but we get a lot of applications. 

**The basics have to be spotless.** Your resume, cover letter, any other documents, your LinkedIn profile, anything else you submit are the one thing in the entire world that should be proofread to shreds. Anything less than perfection is asking for a first round cut. It's amazing how little this happens. It's not that I get real value from these things, it's that I learn a lot from them being done poorly. 

**You must know the organization you're applying for.** If you're sending a generic request for a job, you're cut. I will almost certainly come across someone who is really eager to pour themselves into the job and knows my company as well as they can. You should be able to ask smart, insightful questions (that aren't just stroking my ego). You should know my industry and be able to refer to other players or important industry milestones. You might even volunteer with a meetup group/professional association/community group that does work in my industry, to show you're serious. 

**Have a vision of what you want from the job.** Impressive candidates often ask whether they'd be able to take on certain types of work, or have projects in mind that they want to do, and would add value to your company. 

**Know hiring cycles.** Few organizations are constantly hiring. Most have a few busy periods throughout the year. For some organizations, the 

**Persistence = success, period.** In most realms of life, persistence is the actual factor behind success or failure. Successful people may not have a higher batting average, they are often just willing to aim high and fire often. I have seen this several times. Every 'no' you get should teach you something that you can use to get closer to getting a 'yes'. 

**Demonstrate value, don't sell it.** Talk is cheap, and training new employees is expensive. People who hire have terrible problems discerning those who sound good from those who perform well. That's why I've started paying much closer attention not to what people say, but to what they do. Ask the employer if there's a small assignment they'd want you to do in the next few days to give them a sense of how you work. Present past projects you've worked on. Show them that you're a doer and they will love you. 



And lastly, a comment on being in a 'tough economy'. 

**This is the new norm.** The economy isn't 'tough', it's forever changed. Since the crash of 08, only 1 in 7 new jobs added have been full time. The rest are part time or contract work. I'm not saying this is good, I'm saying it's the way it will be from now on. The generation seeking jobs now will not be able to find them by using the same ladder of generations before. You have to become more entrepreneurial, which may mean cobbling together a couple of contract jobs at first, or yes, internships. Searching for a job isn't about sending out resumes. You have to demonstrate that you can add value long before the interview, hence all the advice about getting deeply involved in the field you're in before you start applying. Ideally, by the time you apply your interviewer may actually recognize you from an industry event or something. 

I know this isn't perfect advice for every industry, but much of it is generally applicable. Happy to field questions.


EDIT: Dammit, why did I post this right before bed? I promise to answer all questions people post on here, in the morning/afternoon.

My plan was to, as the title says, major in Ital. Studies and minor in German. I feel like that looks really useless on the surface. I'll be taking as many classes in Arabic and Mandarin as I possibly can throughout college (my college doesn't offer minors or majors in either of those).

Since Arabic and Mandarin won't be ""official,"" will translating companies take that seriously? I want to learn Korean and Russian but can't take them at school. If I teach myself, will they take *that* seriously?

For what it's worth, my German professor (native speaker) has told me I speak German without an accent and sound like someone who grew up in Germany, so I'm hoping I won't have too insanely big of an issue learning these other languages. 

I'm just worried that because Italian and German aren't critical languages, not many companies will be interested. Are they pretty common in the translating world?

**Also -- I have an informal internship going on with a man who started his own translating company here in San Diego, and I may have an internship with AML-Global in LA this summer if I play my cards right.

I think I want to be a defense-contracted translator/interpreter -- anyone have any experience/thoughts?

Thank you!!!

TL;DR - hoping to become translator, will have learned German, Italian, Mandarin, and Arabic by the time I graduate college. Internships possible. Want to be defense-contracted translator. Thoughts? Tips?"

Here are the two things that are scaring me-

1. There was an unpaid internship that I did in a foreign country for a company that didn't keep any records of unpaid and temporary interns at the time. I was relying on my manager to vouch for me, but she has moved on to a different company. She is still happy to be a reference and confirm that I worked there, though. I also have a signed and certified hard copy of a certificate that states that I worked there. However, if the employer calls HR and asks them about me, they will likely not even know who I am and this really scares me :( I am not lying, but I am worried that this situation might look very odd in the background check.

2. The other day when HR called to confirm the details on my CV, I might have goofed up on one or two questions. They asked me for months and dates for all the universities I had listed on my CV and I realise now that they probably meant months of attendance. However I got very confused and for one of my degrees, I gave the month of enrolment as the start date and the month of the results being declared as the end date. These dates obviously differ by a couple of months. In one of my programmes I had a re-sit which turned a one year programme into 18 months. The dates of attendance would vary by about 5 months from the dates that I have given- I gave the date of enrolment as the start date and the date of the last exam (my resit) as the end date. 
I am now afraid that they might think I have given them the wrong dates. I am not sure what dates my universities will confirm, and I am terrified that if the information doesn't match exactly with whatever I have said, they might withdraw the offer. 

Am I worrying over nothing? Should I call up HR and clarify the situation with the dates of education?

I have been dating her for a year with the last 4 months being long distance. We are both in college and went to our respective homes to intern for the summer. She met a guy and instantly became friends with him. I was unsure about it and didn't like how much time they spent alone, but there was nothing I could do besides tell her. She would drink with him all the time and tell me that he would go home and would talk to me before bed. I didn't like how much she hung out with him, but I accepted that at least she took him home at night.  While at the same job, there was an older guy (about 27) who would give her a lot of attention.

From what I was told, he wanted her but she wasn't interested. I found her facebook password a while ago and have been checking it. I don't know why I do since I trust her and she hasn't done anything that would tell me otherwise. We both love each other, but I'm feeling sick at the moment after what I read. She told me that she would stop talking to him after summer was over and I believed her. Well she has been talking to him again starting the conversation every time. Today, while she was waiting for me to come home, he confessed how much he liked her and she was saying thing that made me sick like how she was glad he didn't tell her when she worked there because she wasn't sure she would have the willpower to say no. She also said specifically how she had to lie to me a lot about how much he would sleep in the same room over the summer (it had 2 twin beds and I'm 99.9% sure nothing happened) because they both got drunk and she didn't want to tell me so she wouldn't have to deal with it.

I feel sick right now and she is 9 hours ahead so I can't talk to her for at least a few hours due to her sleeping. I know that I shouldn't have snooped, but I don't know what to do or how to confront her about this whole thing. Looking back, I'm not upset that she had him stay over, I'm upset that she lied to me about it. And I'm also upset that she didn't say that she wasn't interested in they guy confessing how he liked her and kept egging him on.

My only logic is that she hasn't been getting any male attention for the past month since we won't be able to see each other until the beginning of december. I don't know what to do and I need advice. Should I tell her that I know her password and I'm upset at what I found, or should I tell her that I feel like she is being distant and ask if it has to do with this guy and then bring up the situation that happened over the summer?

Please help! I love her so much and haven't ever met anyone like her. I still trust her, but I just wish she didn't feel like she needs to hide stuff like this from me. 

tl;dr: I snooped on my girlfriend's facebook account and found stuff about her lying to me and a guy confessing he liked her. What do I do?"

1n5hx0,3,2013-09-25,I don't know what I can do from here.,[deleted],PhysicsStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhysicsStudents/comments/1n5hx0/i_dont_know_what_i_can_do_from_here/,"I am currently an undergraduate physics student in my third year, and while I am not presently struggling with the subject, aside from the constant tear inducing stress that I can't seem to get away from, I feel like my options for my future in physics are exceedingly dim.

Let me explain.

When I started undergraduate school freshman year I had not yet decided whether or not I was really serious about physics, so I signed up for the entry level course and a calculus class, and filled the remainder of my schedule with required general education classes.  Now, I'm not entirely sure if it was the new environment, the stress, or something entirely different, but it would be an understatement to say that I didn't handle myself entirely too well.  Within the first three weeks of the semester I was depressed, suicidal, and developing a dependence on alcohol (typical college stuff right guys!?), and I was failing every one of my courses (except lab, because how can you fail lab).  My parents eventually found out, drove down to my university for the weekend and helped me get my priorities straight.  They also made me go to therapy, which helped a great deal.

So I ended up pulling out of the semester, and barely passing all of my classes, except for the physics course, which I failed miserably.  Funnily enough, my highest grade was in calculus, which I got a C in.  From there I decided maybe physics wasn't for me and picked up a communications major (thankfully I am not a communications major still, but at the time it seemed just about my speed).  I took nothing but general education the following semester and worked on fixing my abysmal GPA, but I still didn't perform to the best of my abilities and got straight B's in all of those classes.  However, things were looking up, and one night when I was feeling especially manic, I realized that if I didn't do this physics thing I would never be able to forgive myself.  So the next semester I retook the physics course with the same professor, along with a with even more general education (I swear to god I hate those fucking things, if I didn't have those on my transcript I would have a near perfect GPA right now, fuck).  I aced the physics course. I was going to be a physics major, and I was suddenly extremely passionate about the whole subject.

The semester after that I took every course I could pertaining to the major and I got on the dean's list, in addition to acing vector calculus and tutoring quite a few of my peers in my E&amp;M course.  I couldn't believe how much of a change I had made between then and just a year before.  Never in my life had I made such a huge transformation in such a short period of time.  

Now I'm in my first semester of Junior year, and while I feel really stressed at the workload I have ahead, I feel that I am capable of turning out an acceptable GPA, an amazing major GPA, and hopefully a pretty swell GRE score.  This isn't the problem though.

At this point, I do have time to finish the major, however I'll be taking classes senior year that I should have taken junior year to compensate for the classes I'm taking now that I should have taken last year.  I won't have time to take the electives I want, and I'm starting research and looking for fellowships a year after everyone else in my university.  I'm taking career/school advice from peers who are a year younger than me, and I feel like I barely know and don't have sufficient time to build strong relationships with any of my professors.  I keep reading that I need to get published, do REUs, do internships, and get a LOT of research in to be taken seriously by grad schools, but I can't even find enough hours in the day to study for all my classes and keep up in the research lab I'm currently working in.  Also, the prospect of getting published in the research I'm working in seem equally dim, as we're just testing PMTs and I wouldn't even consider it research.

Basically, I don't know what to do.  I come close to breaking down fromt the amount of stress on a weekly basis, and sometimes it's so unbearable that I just feel tired and sluggish.  I know I'm not alone, and I am not complaining, because I know this is all just part of the journey, but I seriously need some help from someone, anyone.

I just need some advice on where I can go from here.  I know my resume has some bumps in it already, but I still thing I can sell myself pretty solidly to grad schools.  I'm intelligent enough, and I have the drive now more than ever, but I can't help but feeling like I'm already screwed."

[Congratulations on your recent successes. My question is - at any point in time, did you not even feel a hint of suspicion for her age? While one can argue that some people mature early, I'm considering the limited perspective a 14 year old (grade 8-9\) would bring to a relationship with someone who is almost 6 years removed from high school. What was it about her that made you attracted to her? Was she simply attractive or was there more?  Sorry that's a lot of questions dude. Feel free to only answer the ones you feel are relevant. Edit: corrected original post because I assumed she was in grade 8, may have been grade 9?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n55a9/iama_level_3_sex_offender_ama/ccfgz15?context=5)|There were a few things that made me suspicious, but I was met with denials.  The initial attraction was physical.  As things progressed, the attention became nice.  At that point, I was living in an abusive household.  My stepfather was verbally and physically abusive to me, my sister, and mother.  He once spray my mother with lighter fluid and threatened...Anyway, it was nice to have some positive attention, and not be worried all the time.
[Oh, and a question... not sure if this has been answered yet, but I've read through most of the comments and haven't seen it. I imagine this young lady is an adult now. Have you had any contact with her? If so what did you talk about, and if not, what do you think you would say to her?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n55a9/iama_level_3_sex_offender_ama/ccfk943?context=5)|She sent me an apology a few times for a few years.  I have not heard from her in a long time.
 |I'm not really sure what I'd say.  I'd probably be, what we call in the shop, ""Jammed up"".  I feel like part of me would have angry things to say, and part would hope that this incident hasnt made her life anywhere near as hard as mine.
[Why didn't the involved girl come forward and admit to lying about her age?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n55a9/iama_level_3_sex_offender_ama/ccfgxof?context=5)|She did.  In NY, the state takes over and presses the charges in cases like this.  I stated in the other S.O. related topic today...In NY, and some other states, she could show me an ID, that would scan (our id's have 3d barcodes), and I'd still be held responsible.  If I had met her in a bar, and say we had sex in the bathroom, I'm still responsible.  Even though she's in an environment that needs ID to enter, it's all on me.  
[Whoa. When I turned 18 the family lawyer, at a social occasion, gave me a reminder that when I went off to college that a statement made in good faith was the key to being clear on this. Different state of course.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n55a9/iama_level_3_sex_offender_ama/ccficpv?context=5)|I could only wish it was like this here.  I find it interesting to see the variations in the laws from place to place.  Even the age of consent variations is interesting.  It just seems silly to think, ""ok, in this box you can have sex with X person in whatever style you wish.  But in that box, if you do it, you go to jail.""  Where's the cohesion.
[Isn't it like, if you're underage you can't legally give consent? Like, consent doesn't count because you're a minor?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n55a9/iama_level_3_sex_offender_ama/ccfk214?context=5)|You are correct.
[At what level do you evolve? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n55a9/iama_level_3_sex_offender_ama/ccfgu01?context=5)|It would have to be 3.  At 3 you evolve into a child-napping predator.  Unless of course you can beat the state into submission and get your conviction overturned.  Then you evolve back into a human again!
[What are your thoughts on the sex offender registry?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n55a9/iama_level_3_sex_offender_ama/ccfhbio?context=5)|I think it needs reform.  If you forcefully hurt a woman, you should be there.  Maybe not forever.  But just long enough.  I also think certain crimes should be nowhere near that list, and that certain crimes should have exceptions.
[What has the dating scene been like for you since your conviction? Are you legally obligated to tell prospective partners about your history? If you aren't, would you anyway?  Really respect you coming on here to talk about this, it's easy to stigmatize this kind of thing.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n55a9/iama_level_3_sex_offender_ama/ccfgxpm?context=5)|Dating is on and off.  More on than off.  In 8 years since it's happened, maybe only 3 woman have totally freaked out and said horrible stuff.  A few mysteriously vanish, never to be heard from again.  But mostly, woman understand.  They were young too, and know what they did to entice older guys.  I've dated many woman with kids who were totally fine with them around me.  The kids loved me, and they were great.  I'm not obligated to tell anyone...Except the PD when I move.  I do tell 97% of the woman I meet.  I have told every woman that I've met, that I felt there was something special.  The unknowing 3%, simply don't know because I didn't think they're worth telling.
[Do you have to tell all your neighbors that you are a sex offender? If so what where some of the reactions.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n55a9/iama_level_3_sex_offender_ama/ccfhucx?context=5)|I do not have to.  The school district I live in will handle that for me.  They send out a letter to my neighbors.  My landlord is very well known where I live.  He owns 2 very lucrative beer distributors, so he knows many many people.  At first everyone is nervous.  But just like a cold, it spreads.  First one finds out, Hey, he's not so bad a guy...And they tell a neighbor, and that neighbor tells a neighbor.  Sure there's a few with a good immune system and don't give 2 flying shits what anyone has to say.  They let the TV and newspaper do the thinking for them.  Here's a good story.
 |Where I am now...Very very big house.  Landlord got divorced, wife left him the house.  I was renting a small studio, which was the original garage before the 3 car was built.  There was a huge mother daughter built upstairs of the 3 car, with a mom and 15 year old daughter.  I initially did not tell the landlord my situation.  But when the mom found out, she flipped the F out and stopped paying her rent till he evicted me.  I was served notice to leave, but she still would not pay till I was gone.  Finally the landlord said fuck it.  Pay me the rent, and you stay, I'll serve her tomorrow.  I did, and he did.  After he evicted her, he gave me her huge apartment for the same price I was paying for the studio.  And here I sit, 2 years later in this house, 1 year later in this apartment. 
[Woah... glad that worked out for you, but that's kinda fucked on his part.  I mean, it's not like she had the benefit of the full explanation you've given us here, ya know?  I'd probably be uncomfortable with a surprise like that too.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n55a9/iama_level_3_sex_offender_ama/ccfig1b?context=5)|I don't blame him.  We were not close at that point in time, and to be honest.  If I was in his situation, there's a good chance I may have acted similarly.  He's a smart man though, and was able to figure it out.  
[Did you get treated differently in jail, being a kiddy diddler and all?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n55a9/iama_level_3_sex_offender_ama/ccfgyz2?context=5)|I initially signed into protective custody.  When I tell you the amount of little girl BS these men would do on the daily.  I couldn't take it.  I signed out of P.C., got a job in the kitchen, and told everyone I was there for street racing.
[Gotta say, street racing is an awesome cover. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n55a9/iama_level_3_sex_offender_ama/ccfhe17?context=5)|I had enough material and knowledge to cover the story.  At the time I had a built up Cavalier Z24.  I had lots of pictures of it with me.  It was my pride at the time.  Motor swap, trans swap, the works.  Everyone thought it was cool because they thought it was a granny car.
[I heard it's not uncommon for prisoners to reach out to people on the outside to pull public records to check on what other people are in for. Were you ever worried about that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n55a9/iama_level_3_sex_offender_ama/ccfjnum?context=5)|It is true.  The WebCrims website will give you all that info if the person is still going to court.  It's all in your attitude and how you present yourself.  If you give someone a funny feeling, they're going to do a little digging.  I was a skinny white boy with a shit ton of car magazines, and pictures of a car I built that nobody had ever seen built up before.
[Did you have problems with the other inmates when they found out what you were convicted for?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n55a9/iama_level_3_sex_offender_ama/ccfh4yq?context=5)|In the holding cell at court, you're stored like cattle 20 deep in a 20x7 cell waiting to be called by the judge.  My legal aid came right to the cell and just spilled the beans.  When he left, I turned around to a not so nice site.  This big...named Country introduced me to his fist.
 |While in the kitchen, there was another sex offender, under cover working too.  He was a piece of shit though.  He sold crack to an old woman in exchange for a few nights with her underage granddaughter.  An officer who did not like that, whispered to the crew, ""one of you is a rapist"" and walked off.  The crew found out it was him, but I signed back into p.c. anyway in fear he might say something again.  I soon got sick of the nancy bullshit and signed back out, and into the kitchen again.  That.
[Can you ever appeal the level? Or perhaps slowly bring it down?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n55a9/iama_level_3_sex_offender_ama/ccfi7aj?context=5)|New York is very hard on your level.  I can hire an attorney and appeal my conviction, or I could go right to the criminal justice services and demand a re-level hearing with a lawyer.  In the end, I'm just going to save my money and move someplace I don't have to register, like North Carolina.  NY can suck it.
[VT - I have a friend in a similar situation and he lives in VT now.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n55a9/iama_level_3_sex_offender_ama/ccfjzku?context=5)|Yes from what I hear, all the upper north east states are not easy on sex offenders, but FAIR.  Maine has a step-down clause where your level slowly lowers!
[Did you lose any friends afterwards? Did your good friends come to visit you in jail?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n55a9/iama_level_3_sex_offender_ama/ccfj9oe?context=5)|I did, and good riddens to them.  Some people like to say mean things when you do something that's not in accord with what they want.  I was staying at a friends once, and his landlord said I had to leave...that night, now, GTFO type shit.  But my ""friend"" Brandon needed a ride to court the next morning.  He insisted I stay so i could drive him to court.  I insisted I didnt feel comfortable because the landlord lived in the house with him.  Now all of a sudden I'm a rapist pedophile blah blah.  Fuck him and everyone like him.  I'd rather it come out just like that because I don't want anyone in my life that would even fathom acting like that.  2 days before I was arrested, I had found a friend on Facebook from school I grew up with and lost contact with.  In jail I had no way of contacting her...But sure as shit within 3 days of being arrested, she surprise visited me.  First time I saw her in over 10 years.  Love you Kristen ;-)

A major point here is that you can not judge a woman by looks anymore.  We will leave it at, she looked old enough to be dating, and gave no indication of being so young.
[If you both lived with your parents, where did you have sex / hang out at ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n55a9/iama_level_3_sex_offender_ama/ccfjybl?context=5)|Cars, neighborhood hangout spots, movie theater, the mall, friends houses.

[I am curious as to what the worst case scenario could have been if you had not cooperated as you did. The way you word this makes it seem that you were calm the whole time. Did you ever let out any anger?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n55a9/iama_level_3_sex_offender_ama/ccfipcq?context=5)|I was terrified through the entire ordeal.  I didn't have a lawyer or anyone on my side during questioning.  I was alone.  After I was released I was a very angry person.  To this day sometimes it gets out.  Maybe once every 2 months I'll have an outburst.  I was reckless upon release.  I didn't care who I screwed over for what.  As long as in the end, I came out on top.  I drove without a license and got arrested for that countless times.  I let out my anger on myself by letting my life go to shit, or at least take a downward spiral.  In NY, Rape 3 is an E Felony, which mandates 1-3 years upstate.  You only usually get the mandated sentences when you're a problem repeat offender.  Long Island jails are literally so overcrowded they have inmates sleeping in the jail gymnasium, and I shit you not, outside in a fucking circus tent on the jail property.  Suffolk County Jail, top right corner, the white pill looking thing is the tent.

I have great references from previous employers.  I work hard, and always look to better my skills.  My resume is actually very nice.  I have 3 FAA internships I did right before this whole fiasco along with a bunch of other nice stuff.  The field I'm in is usually employed by people that lived an unsavory lifestyle at one time anyway, so unless I'm shooting to work for the MTA, or maybe a dealership, I'm good.  I've actually done high end dealership work before, and it's not for me.  The same problems day in and day out on the same vehicles.  I'm the foreman at a diesel repair shop now.

I'm currently a sophomore in college and I was planning on continuing to volunteer at two hospitals. One of the programs is called a ""Clinical Care Extender Internship,"" but functions more as a volunteering position. The other is just plain volunteering at a medical center. (For those of you in the Orange County area, you may know these places as fairly common volunteering locales). 

Due to pressure from family and friends, I went ahead and emailed a professor asking for a research position. It's chemistry research. He was cautionary, but basically told me he'll give me a chance.  

I wanted to hold off on research until junior year, when my volunteering is done, but my parents want me to take the opportunity. This research is a HUGE commitment, though, and I *will* have to drop one of the volunteering positions (the CCE internship requires 4 hrs a week, and the medical center requires 3). I'm also on the board for one of the clubs on campus, so that's going to be taking up quite some time, as well. Taking ochem is not going to help either. 

My question is, what should I do? Should I take the research position and drop the volunteering? Or hold off until I can really commit to the research in junior year? The two hospitals I'm volunteering at are VERY popular- almost every pre-Med student at my school goes to these places to volunteer. I fear that it's not going to help me stand out in med school applications, but three years of research might. 

I haven't even started shadowing. Oh lord. "

**Issues I am aware of in resume**

* Typo of ""numerous""

* Typo of ""Expectional""
* Lack of GPA (Sitting at around 3.0 hope to get 3.15-3.20 by expected graduation date
* Graduation date is a semester or two off (May 2014 or Summer 2014)

**My Situation**
My main issue and hopefully I can address this effectively in an interview is the lack of work experience in the past year or so. I transferred to the state university in 2012 (Think top 15 public b school in the south). The main reason I was able to transfer to this cheap, but relatively pricey compared to alternatives down here, resulted in me being logistically unavailable to do an internship. Another issue is extreme lack of leadership experience and club involvement. I hope to join some clubs next semester and incorporate that experience in my resume.

My plan right now is to develop some of the skills I have listed in this very rough draft of a resume that I threw together in 30 minutes. In January and February, a Global Fortune 500 investment bank is seeking analyst interns for the summer as well as hiring various mid-level finance roles. The institutional director is an alumni of my school and was recently on campus. We have a strong alumni network so I plan to email the recruiter and possibly the director to ask him about his experience with graduating into the workforce as well as the finance industry. My school is the strongest in the state and possibly my region so I am hoping that there is a large majority of graduates that work there.

I understand that for most of us here the competition for the jobs in the finance industry is extreme. However, I feel that in this specific situation the level of competition is going to come from mainly my university. In this specific city the only universities that are competing are state colleges and a directional university ranked in the 300s. Further, I am under the assumption that relative to most cities that my peers will be moving to that this one is very undesirable. A majority of the students from my university live in South Florida so I don't think that many will be jumping on the chance to move to Jacksonville.

I have been somewhat following their strategy to move these roles away from NYC. They have been soliciting tax incentives from state and local governments and the city in my hometown won the bid. Their workforce at that particular office is going to increase by around 300% around the time I am graduating. I also believe they plan to move some of these jobs back to NYC to their headquarters there so this could potentially be a big break. On paper I personally would most likely not hire myself for the reasons I initially listed. I hope to convince the recruiter (Linkedin? Email?) and show that I am very eager to learn and join their team. Any advice and insight on a plan to achieve this goal would be great."

Hi everyone,

My school recently held a huge career fair that had around 200 companies at it.  I applied to many different companies, all ranging in different markets and specializations, and I just scheduled an interview with a large, well-known hardware and software company that I would really like to work for.  This company was only recruiting for software positions at my university, so I applied to the position that they were recruiting for, as well as many other hardware and software positions on their website.

My background/interests really kind of lie at the intersection of hardware and software.  If I could go back and do it again, I would probably have gone the computer engineering route that my school offers, but I thought electrical engineering would be more broad (thus more applicable).  So at this point, I am taking most of my core EE courses (electronics, power systems, electromagnetics, signals and systems) and I plan on filling my technical electives with mostly computer related classes (digital logic design, computer architecture, HDLs, mixed signal electronics).  I am also in the process of completing a computer science minor (I have finished 2 of 5 classes).  What I hope to do when I graduate is kind of computers/embedded systems.  I like both the hardware and software aspects of devices.  I like playing around with microcontrollers like the Arduino, and building circuits as well as writing software.  I want to connect devices to the world/internet.

The predicament that I am in is that I have extremely limited software experience.  The two computer science classes I have taken this far have taught me the fundamentals of C++ as well as introduced me to data structures and algorithms.  I have also taught myself and played around with Python on my own time, as well as know how to program microcontrollers in assembly and C.  Pretty much, I have a decent amount of software experience, but probably no where near the amount needed for this position.

I guess what I would like to ask is how should I approach this interview.  I was thinking that I should really accentuate the fact that I am very interested in what the company does and the fact that I am willing to learn whatever it is that they would need me to.  Its not like I do not want a software position, it is just that I do not have all of the knowledge needed.  Are there any online resources/ cheat sheets on how to get up to speed on some of the more relevant computer science concepts that are asked most at interviews?  I am starting at a pretty good point where I know C++ very well.

BTW, I am trying to figure out why I received this interview in the first place.  Pretty much, I talked to them at the career fair and then submitted my resume online.  My resume mostly says everything that I already said plus I have a very high GPA (I have only had one class that I haven't gotten an A in).  Would that give out interviews based solely on my high GPA, or do they (hopefully) think that my resume is relevant enough to have a good shot at this position?  I am a junior if that matters.

Thank you for your help!"

My question is regarding moving far away with your degree, preferably America, because the wages are ( &amp; yes, I know, so are living expenses ) much higher and some other things. I was there all summer on a working holiday, in San Francisco and it was the best time of my life.

My question is, do you think it would be difficult to get a job in possibly the pharmaceutical, oil or really any industry with good pay, with a European Chemical &amp; Biochemical Engineering Degree??

Some background on it &amp; myself: 

* The University is in Ireland and the course is accredited with IChemE, the European equivalent of AIChemE, and 

* I hope to graduate this time 2 years with a 1.1 degree,

Some background on it &amp; myself: 

* The University is in Ireland and the course is accredited with IChemE, the European equivalent of AIChemE, and 

* I hope to graduate this time 2 years with a 1.1 degree,

So, my question is, is it an issue to sign up for races closer to the date? I'm particularly afraid of the Pittsburgh half filling up and then, if I am able to run, not being able to get a spot.

Also, some other concerns.",Fatalfable,askseddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/askseddit/comments/1na3r0/how_do_i_ask_this_foreign_exchange_student_out_to/,"So here is what happened yesterday. I'm in an internship in the medical field where I work along side an exchange student. She basically invited me for lunch as we finished with our last patient in the morning segment. She can barely speak English so I have to speak in her language which I am pretty fluent in but I still have some issues. We spoke about our last session, analyzed it, spoke about studying in different countries etc. We joked and laughed a bit but she has to go to another section of the hospital in a different part of the city after lunch. As we were walking towards where we split I simply asked for her number, gave her a kiss on the cheek goodbye, then we had a little awkward moment cause in Europe they do the two cheek things and I only kissed one side. Jokes were said, we split up and that was that.

I think this was a little too friendly/professional and would like to end up showing her sexual interest. 

Shes from Barcelona and I'm going on a whim here that she likes electronic music and assume that its popular there considering Ibiza is right around the corner. I want to take her to a venue tomorrow to see a great DJ at Webster Hall. 

Now do I text her and ask her if she wants to go? (And if she likes electronic music) Or should I go along the lines of ""I'm going to Webster Hall tomorrow. Coming?"" Or some variation like that. This would also be my first text to her other than confirming it was me. 

Last concern. I go to A LOT of these concert/raves whatever you wanna call them. I go with friends but usually enjoy splitting up and getting lost into the crowd dancing, jumping, shuffling, offering cigs, whatever. I go mainly for the music and could care less about girls which is what my brother and friends are concerned about. Now, if she ends up coming with me I don't know how I would approach trying to give her attention when where we will be will be about giving the attention to the dj. any ideas? "

What do?",jobhunterthrowaway,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1n9tiz/i_have_not_been_legally_or_verifiably_employed/,"What I first started out, I was basically working for a small company on tiny projects. Eventually after about a year of reoccurring work, I demanded to get a 1099. This year I made the stand that I'd either finally get a W2 or quit. Why a W2? Well, you kind of need ""provable"" income to do things like live in an actual home or apartment with your name on the lease, get credit cards, qualify for loans and basically be a real human being.

Well, guess what? They called me on my dare. And I quit.


On paper— what I can prove— is an income of about $500 a month. But I've also been freelancing jobs—anything from graphic design to running errands for people.

Oh, I am also a gay escort where I essentially go on dates with strange men for free food and spending cash. I've never actually had sex with any of these men which actually makes me a pretty shitty escort. But most of my graphic design work ranges from quick design briefs to napkin logo mockups to other shitty little things I'm not proud of.

The only good work I've done I've either signed non-disclosure agreements on or I basically got hired to do someone else's professional work and they're refusing to let me use them as a reference.
 
Basically, how do I look like not an impoverished has-been graphic designer who is also occasionally a gay escort? Especially when I have no paper trail?

So far my options are:

1. Move and take an unpaid internship. Might require more black market work. Too emotionally destroyed to hustle again.

2. Try to take a local minimum wage job. That's been an unsuccessful avenue. List nothing on application and they know I'm lying. List what I can honestly list and they know I'm there til I find a real job.

3. Use resume as is and hope the recruiter fails to do any homework or look into my background. 

4. Leave all activities out for the last 6 years and hope someone will either take pity on me or think I'm not trying to hide anything.

5. Become institutionalized (mental health, jail, prison) and maybe get into a halfway house or court-ordered vocational rehab program.

6. Give up on life and accept failure.


I just really want to work. I like to think I have employable talents. I don't know why no one says I'm passionate enough when I'm essentially willing to throw all my possessions away, move thousands of miles to their city, stay in a hostel or YMCA til I can afford something and essentially bust ass?

I really don't want to wake up every day waiting for death anymore."

So far, Im thinking start him out with some simple terminology stuff, not necessarily how to do anything, but just so he's got a familiarization and concept of what does what. RAID levels, IP schemes, DHCP, DNS, AD, GP, various MS products, as we a 98% MS shop.

I feel like my biggest downfall is my lack of experience in the business environment. I've been in the customer service industry all my life, with my most recent positions being a server in the restaurant industry. 

I have great communications skills and have a good GPA, but I'm not quite sure how to play up any of my business skills, if I have any. I've gotten several interviews, but no offers. I feel like I would have made a better impression if I knew more technical financial things or threw more terms at the interviewers to make myself look impressive. 

In my interviews, I always stress the terms ""teamwork"", ""organizational"", and ""detail-oriented"" and show my enthusiasm and desire to learn. I nail the logical questions and usually get along with the interviewers on a personal level, but it seems like the interviewers want something beyond that, which in this economy I completely understand that they want to hire the most qualified candidate to create the most optimal team. 

But my biggest frustration is that if I’m failing at getting internships, how will I fare when the time comes to graduate and actually start looking for a real job?

I'm always applying for any open internships, but the rejections are getting me down and I'm at the point where I don't even want to try anymore. I just want to graduate, have my degree, and continue in the customer service industry until I pay off my debts and am free to live however I want.

Any advice on how to better sell myself? I’m smart, capable, have common sense, great grammar, and am a hard worker. But I’m not sure how to relay this message to the interviewers without having to directly say it.

Not sexually, but physically and emotionally.  He eventually moved out as I was graduating high school and going into college.  It's safe to say that I really, really don't like him.  

In fact, I've often contemplated moving away so that I would never have to see him again.

I graduated recently and have been trying desperately to find work.  I finally found a job that only pays about $12/hr, but I was just happy to find something in the field (marketing) that I would like to get into.  

On the side, I do an unpaid internship that is also in the marketing field.  The job itself is one that I actually have a pretty good time doing, too.

My father thinks my job is a piece of crap and doesn't pay well for my qualifications (he's not wrong).  He has been asking around at his work to see if there's any position available there and yesterday his boss told him I should apply for a newly available property management specialist position they have.

My dad is now insisting I apply for this job.  The job would pay a *minimum* of $22.60/hr and has great benefits.  But I would be working in the same building as my father and our interactions would go from once every few months to likely every day.

I've suffered from clinical depression for years and battled an eating disorder as a teen because of what he put me through growing up.  He is also the type who would use the fact that he got me this well-paying job as a way of extorting favors or guilt tripping me.  

He refuses to acknowledge that he was ever abusive, even when my mother, brother, and I have all confronted him about it.  Just the notion that I should owe him anything makes my skin crawl.

But I have bills and student loans to pay.  And it wouldn't just be a well-paying job, it would potentially be a career.  Granted, it's not the career I want.  It's not something I actually have any interest in doing at all.

I feel like accepting would be to sell my soul to the devil and resign myself to working a job I hate with a person I loathe.  But the money is/would be amazing.

Should I refuse?  Should I go for it, knowing I'd be miserable?  If I do refuse, how can I do so in such a way as to not provoke his wrath?  I feel so... lost.
---

**tl;dr**: My formerly abusive father wants me to come work with him and while the job would be a crazy step up in pay for me, I'm afraid I'd lose myself in the process. What should I do?"

Dress up or dress casual?,YourLovelyMan,malefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1n95xg/minor_emergency_going_to_see_my_old_employer/,"I'm meeting a former employer from an internship I had. It's basically a small law office, and only a few lawyers are in today.

Purpose is partly to catch up and socialize, partly to ask for recommendations and job leads, and partly to hint at the notion that I would like to work for them if anything opens up (we've talked about it, and nothing is open right now).

I have two outfits:

* Tweed blazer, ocbd, and trousers, maybe a tie, or
* Black work jacket with minimal detail, flannel, dark wash jeans, iron rangers

I'm actually away from home and didn't expect to go to the office, so I packed light.

I'm concerned that dressing up would look like I'm trying too hard to impress them, but casual might be inappropriate and out of place (or maybe not, this office was pretty laid back and I think it's casual Friday anyway). Which would you wear?"

My work experience includes a prestigious 11 month internship with one of the top banks and I have been working on my own projects to help build myself a portfolio to show employers that I am self motivated as well.

Career fairs are starting up at schools again and there are plenty of opportunities with banks and other companies, but game design is not one of them.  In fact, I don't even know where to begin looking for an internship in the industry.  

If anyone has experience with something like this I would appreciate any input. If you don't think an internship is likely, then what steps should I take from here as a college student."

[Have you ever turned away specimens that for whatever reason didn't make the cut?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n8w43/iama_anna_dhody_curator_of_the_mütter_museum_a/ccgeqlj?context=5)|I will turn away any human specimen with an unknown provenance (origin). Without knowing where they came from and documentation for proof, there’s no way to know they weren’t stolen or acquired on the black market, and i won’t accept them.
[What's your favorite bone?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n8w43/iama_anna_dhody_curator_of_the_mütter_museum_a/ccgep0o?context=5)|Heh heh heh.
[Does the Mütter risk legitimizing, trivializing, or glamorizing dermatillomania through the publicity it's granted to the young woman who sent you the jars? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n8w43/iama_anna_dhody_curator_of_the_mütter_museum_a/ccgeycj?context=5)|Good question! The reason I accepted the skin is it's a physical manifestation of a mental condition. It's very hard to get ""specimens"" that adequately illustrate mental disorders. I consider this a valuable teaching tool to educate the public about this condition. All I want to do is bring it to light, tell it like it is, and show what it can do, and it's all with her consent.  
[What item has affected you most profoundly on a personal level?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n8w43/iama_anna_dhody_curator_of_the_mütter_museum_a/ccgf3zx?context=5)|We have a 3mm kidney stone extracted from yours truly. That was pretty darn personal. 
[I love your museum.  I took my pre-teen and a friend and must tell you that the wax models of the effects of Syphilis, and the skulls with the caries from Syphilis are WAY more effective safe sex education than any abstinence program. They were horrified.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n8w43/iama_anna_dhody_curator_of_the_mütter_museum_a/ccgfnp2?context=5)|No, we are fairly confident she did not die of Yellow Fever.
[My question is what's the latest finding on the soap lady?  Did she die of yellow fever?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n8w43/iama_anna_dhody_curator_of_the_mütter_museum_a/ccgfnp2?context=5)|I also think the syphilis models are effective too, but that's one of the reasons I'm no longer allowed to give tours to schoolchildren. 
[So excited that you're here! Just visited for the first time a few months ago, and noticed that there isn't a lot of explanation of the medical conditions causing the deformities in some of the specimens on display. Is that by design (i.e., are you hoping visitors will research the info on their own time\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n8w43/iama_anna_dhody_curator_of_the_mütter_museum_a/ccgeixh?context=5)|Great question! Originally the labels were written for doctor or medical students who visited the museum. Now we get over 138,000 visitors through our doors, most of whom have no medical background. We are now in the process of rewriting these labels to provide more information. 
[What is your favorite item?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n8w43/iama_anna_dhody_curator_of_the_mütter_museum_a/ccgeaik?context=5)|Asking me my favorite item is like asking me my favorite child! Oh wait, I do have a favorite child. He's my only child.
[Is that jar of skin from this person, who posted on reddit a little while back that she peels her skin off and donates it to the museum?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n8w43/iama_anna_dhody_curator_of_the_mütter_museum_a/ccgf48z?context=5)|That's her! 
[What are the legalities and red tape you have to follow in order to run a museum like this?  I will actually be going to this Museum on Tuesday.  I am very excited.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n8w43/iama_anna_dhody_curator_of_the_mütter_museum_a/ccgepja?context=5)|You'll have to ask my lawyer. And he's really expensive, so be brief.
 |In terms of museum acquisition, we are very careful to make sure we have all the necessary provenance/paperwork/needed documentation. 
[Do you have any advice for a college grad trying to professionally enter the museum field in Philly or anywhere else?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n8w43/iama_anna_dhody_curator_of_the_mütter_museum_a/ccgejic?context=5)|It’s all about making connections. People don’t like working for free, but interning is really the best way to get a foot in the door. Work at a museum as an intern, make yourself indispensible, and just might find them making a position for you.
[I heard that you have the hips of your communications director.  Your CEO just had his knee replaced. Clearly, the Mütter exacts a terrible toll on its caretakers.  Ms. Dhody, if you had to put a part of yourself in a specimen jar in the Museum, what would it be and why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n8w43/iama_anna_dhody_curator_of_the_mütter_museum_a/ccgfc3y?context=5)|When you work here, all items removed from your body legally belong to me. Okay, not really. But I wish! 
[Hi, Anna. Love the museum, but why is it always so cold in there? Brr!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n8w43/iama_anna_dhody_curator_of_the_mütter_museum_a/ccgfdw4?context=5)|Life sucks. Get a sweater. :)
[What is the protocol for donating body parts? Where do you get them from? Has anyone willed you their own parts?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n8w43/iama_anna_dhody_curator_of_the_mütter_museum_a/ccgeu4t?context=5)|We have a significant amount of primary donations. These are living individuals who have donated parts of their own body. For example, we have femoral heads from hip transplants, kidney stones, pieces of skin cancer, the picked skin in jars, and the aforementioned gallbladder.
 |We can't accept full body donations at this time, though we often get inquiries. 
[As a member of the Vidocq Society have you helped to solve any mysteries? What are you currently working on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n8w43/iama_anna_dhody_curator_of_the_mütter_museum_a/ccgemcj?context=5)|I am a relatively new member to the Vidocq and I don’t think any of the cases I’ve consulted on have been solved. Since these cases are now active I’m not at liberty to share details.
[What do you feel is the most intriguing function of the human body?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n8w43/iama_anna_dhody_curator_of_the_mütter_museum_a/ccgeyys?context=5)|As a new mom I think creating new life from two little bits of genetic goo. Pretty cool! 
[Your museum is one of the nicest things in Philly, thanks for doing what you do. How plausible would it be to take parts of your exhibit on tour (ala the human bodies exhibit\)? It's really a one of a kind collection that more people should see.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n8w43/iama_anna_dhody_curator_of_the_mütter_museum_a/ccgexwq?context=5)|We've been asked. We've explored and continue to explore the options. Needless to say, our collection poses unique challenges in terms of transport. And they get homesick! 
[I've always been fascinated by the fact that the dwarf skeleton on display belonged to a prostitute. The stories behind the specimens are just as intriguing as the specimens themselves.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n8w43/iama_anna_dhody_curator_of_the_mütter_museum_a/ccgf19u?context=5)|We don't actually know she was a prostitute. We know only that she gave birth in a brothel.
[What is your favorite item that is on display in the museum, as well what what's your favorite that isn't on display and why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n8w43/iama_anna_dhody_curator_of_the_mütter_museum_a/ccgf19u?context=5)|My favorite item NOT on display is my husband's gallbladder. I'm working on preserving it. And you know what? That was the LAST time he insulted my cooking. 
[Why does the museum not allow photos? Why not just prohibit usage of flash?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n8w43/iama_anna_dhody_curator_of_the_mütter_museum_a/ccgfodx?context=5)|There have been too many complaints from the specimens. 
[How do you become to be a museum curator? What made you want to do it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n8w43/iama_anna_dhody_curator_of_the_mütter_museum_a/ccgffvd?context=5)|I started coming to the Mutter when I was seven years old. I grew up going to museums all over Philadelphia. I started out as an archeologist, moved to physical/forensic anthropology, did human rights work in Peru, and in 2004 I answered an ad for an assistant collections manager at the Mutter, and I've been here ever since.
 |What made me want to do it? Former director Gretchen Worden's joy and enthusiasm about the museum inspired me. You should look for clips of her on Letterman back in the day with items from the museum. 
[What's the ding-dong situation there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n8w43/iama_anna_dhody_curator_of_the_mütter_museum_a/ccgeyn0?context=5)|We are from Philly. We prefer Tastycakes. 
[What is your opinion of the Bodies exhibit which has toured the USA in the last few years?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n8w43/iama_anna_dhody_curator_of_the_mütter_museum_a/ccgfls8?context=5)|My personal response is ""meh""
[Is there anything that is ""too strange"" and is unlikely to ever be displayed? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n8w43/iama_anna_dhody_curator_of_the_mütter_museum_a/ccgf7g0?context=5)|If so, I haven't found it yet! 
[What other collections do you believe are up to the same high standards as the Mütter? Have you seen the bottled freaks at Kunstkamera in St Petersburg? If so what do you think will become of Peter the Great's specimens? After nearly 300 years the items in the jar tend to get really sinister looking. Is there any way to lessen these effects?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n8w43/iama_anna_dhody_curator_of_the_mütter_museum_a/ccgfcjj?context=5)|There are great medical museums around the world, and we hope you'll visit them. 
[Last time I was there the catalogue of things pulled out of offices was gone. Is it back/coming back? That's my favorite. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n8w43/iama_anna_dhody_curator_of_the_mütter_museum_a/ccgf61i?context=5)|Where's my stapler?  
[I remember visiting and hearing there is a way to commission getting access to the medical library upstairs for research in science and art. What are the steps of this process?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n8w43/iama_anna_dhody_curator_of_the_mütter_museum_a/ccgfpf3?context=5)|Absolutely! You can schedule an appointment. More info here: [Link to www.collegeofphysicians.org](http://www.collegeofphysicians.org/library/)
[Do you have any funny or interesting stories of how you may have acquired some of the items in your museum? What's your favorite story/ history about one?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n8w43/iama_anna_dhody_curator_of_the_mütter_museum_a/ccgfbr8?context=5)|There's no time! There's so many. Every one is amazing. The jar of skin is obviously an interesting story. 
[Had to make an account just to reply to this!! The Mütter Museum is something I really hope to visit one day after seeing it on TV as a kid (I get all bubbly and giggly whenever it re-airs\). I'm not sure if you were asked this before but what was it like when you first stepped into the Museum? What did you initially think and what drove you to work there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n8w43/iama_anna_dhody_curator_of_the_mütter_museum_a/ccgfokz?context=5)|Awww! Thanks for creating an account just for this.
 |I first came here when I was around seven. My first thought was {sound of angels singing} ""This is where I belong!"" I guess I am just fascinated by the human body and how it works, and especially how it doesn't always work. I'm very very lucky to work in such at such an amazing place. 
[Do you do any kind of outreach for local school kids?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n8w43/iama_anna_dhody_curator_of_the_mütter_museum_a/ccgfg6x?context=5)|Oh gosh yes. We have school groups and guided tours. We also have a department under The College of Physicians of Philadelphia, who is our parent organization, that is specifically geared toward education of youth. You can see it here: [Link to www.collegeofphysicians.org](http://www.collegeofphysicians.org/education/)
[Haha didn't marry her, but my current gf of 3 years and I have been to the museum multiple times!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n8w43/iama_anna_dhody_curator_of_the_mütter_museum_a/ccgf857?context=5)|You should have you wedding here! We do host them, you know. 
[Obligatory question: What's the one thing in your collection that's made you go ""ewww"".](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n8w43/iama_anna_dhody_curator_of_the_mütter_museum_a/ccgef8d?context=5)|An anal tattoo device. It’s a device used to literally tattoo or inject powdered mercury around the anal sphincter to relieve hemorrhoids. I have no idea if it worked, and my boss wasn’t willing to let me test it on him.
[Hello everyone and thank you for coming! We'll be getting started in just a moment. Feel free to ask me anything about things that are icky, gooey, sticky, tumor-y, boney, death-y...bring it! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n8w43/iama_anna_dhody_curator_of_the_mütter_museum_a/ccgehki?context=5)|Just so you all know, I just saw our exhibits manager walk by with a human head. Let's get started!
[That's a great question.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n8w43/iama_anna_dhody_curator_of_the_mütter_museum_a/ccgeex8?context=5)|Haven’t yet bottled a human soul in a specimen jar, but I keep trying!
 |One of the things I’m actively trying to collect are specimens that reflect 20th and 21st century health issues. For example, I don’t have a smoker’s lung. I just got some diabetic feet, which is great. I’d like to get more artificial joints. One thing I’d love, but they are very expensive, is one of those high tech bionic artificial limbs. 
[The jar of skin on your desk has ruined egg noodle casserole for me forever. Not even remotely joking.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1n8w43/iama_anna_dhody_curator_of_the_mütter_museum_a/ccgf4tj?context=5)|You are welcome. Too many carbs, anyway.

1n92g5,2,2013-09-27,I don't know if I can go on anymore.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1n92g5/i_dont_know_if_i_can_go_on_anymore/,"I'm 17 and I live in Wisconsin. I've been depressed for years but lately I've been almost constantly contemplating suicide. 

It all started with my my alcoholic mother stabbing me this summer, then calling the cops on me for ""beating her"" (which I didn't), then getting detained by those cops when they found me bleeding. She then lied to my extended family and told them that I was responsible for putting her in jail. Several of my family openly threatened my life if I didn't lie in court and get her out. My father was among them, and he, in an attempt to discredit me, told the court that I was a blatant liar and thief (neither of which is true by any means), and they dismissed her charges when she promised to go to rehab, because ""she isn't the bad guy here"". So now she's coming home. And I'm worried that she's coming for me, as she's indicated in the past.

Also, because of her lying to my family, I don't have anyone to talk to anymore. I don't trust any of my friends enough to tell them this stuff that's going on, and the one friend I trusted enough to talk to about this basically hates me now. I had feelings for her and I tried to act upon them, and it led to the end of our friendship. My sister, who is the only family member who doesn't blame me, has been blowing me off and is now on my mother's side following a ""heartfelt letter"" that also falsely accused me of hurting my mom and putting her in prison. 

I've also feel like no one really wants to be around me. My friends kind of blow me off, I can't ever get a date with a girl, and everyone I meet insults me for being fat.

On top of that, I had a prestigious internship this summer that I was super excited for, but it went south when the workload was far too difficult for me to understand and I couldn't complete the work. I screwed up the chance to set myself up with a summer job in the future, the chance to get a decent letter of recommendation, and ever since then I've felt like I was average, like I'm stupid and I'm not going anywhere in this world. I've been having a hard time motivating myself because of that, and I'm now failing several classes in high school. It's basically killing my chances of going to a decent school, especially my dream school, and that's making me even more depressed.

Football was helping for a while, but I stink at it, I never get playing time, and it's not really helping me feel better about myself or doing anything for me anymore. 

There's even more personal things putting me down on top of this that I don't really want to talk about. But overall, I'm feeling so overwhelmingly depressed that I feel like I'm at the point where I want to end it. "

This was just a question that ran through my mind today at my internship. I was pressing together rollers so I can install them in a conveyor belt, and missed a spring in one.

I'm currently job searching. A contact who is helping me find work said he could get me an internship. First, I graduated 4 years ago and have been working my way up since then. Second, I'm not in a place financially where I can accept unpaid work. I gave the second reason to explain why I couldn't do that, thinking it would be a little more diplomatic. My contact told me to be careful if I tell anyone that, as I might come across as entitled.

At this point I would take something entry-level and working my way up (again). That would, of course, not be my first choice, but I'd do it and put on a good face. But is it so wrong to be a little insulted to be told to start all over, unpaid, and that I'm ungrateful if I don't take it? I also think it's perfectly acceptable to say that I'm not in a place where I can work unpaid, but will an employer take it badly if I say that?"

I'm a double finance/accounting major with a respectable GPA, and though my past internship experience has been in corporate finance and accounting, a lot of my experience on campus has been in organizations dedicated to markets and investing.

I'm hoping for advice on what to prepare for in the Private Banking Analyst interview. I have a long and short stock pitch prepared and am ready to talk about my take on current macroeconomic trends as well. However, I have had NO experience working in this specific sector of finance, so I'd really appreciate it if I could get feedback or tips for the interview, and ideally things to prepare for, from those who know more than I do."

Upvote for visibility.,earthlover7,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/1n8yrq/intern_remote_location_frontend_web_developer/,"I've self-learned HTML5 and CSS3. I'm currently learning JavaScript using Lynda.com and TheNewBoston's video tutorials.

I have the ability to take quick decisions and can quickly learn new technologies and systems.

I know I don't have the required qualifications for a full-time tech job that's why I'm requesting you to hire me as an unpaid intern.

I believe **doing something** is much more valuable than just learning. So alongwith watching video tutorials, I want to work on a project so that I actually learn something.

I'm a graduate in electronics engineering from a reputed tier-2 institute in India. The company which recruited me while I was in college is yet to call me (5 months have passed, so I guess I won't hear from them in future). Wherever I go, everyone demands experience. I think internship is my only chance to gain some experience.

PM if you think I can make a mark."
1n8y1v,12,2013-09-27,"Recent graduate with scandalous pics online. Yep, I'm an idiot. Looking for advice on social media during the job search process.",jobthrowawayd,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1n8y1v/recent_graduate_with_scandalous_pics_online_yep/,"Three years ago, I moronically took ""sexy"" pictures of myself. They ended up online. I didn't post them myself, nor were they posted by some scorned lover. The pics themselves are tamer than what you see in most lad mags, but they have clear, unmistakable shots of my face and, of course, are not something that looks great in any sort of professional context. Yes, the internet is forever. I know this was a crippling, massive screw-up. I've been over that part of it for years now, but regretting it hasn't changed reality. Feel free to let me know how stupid it was, but at this point it's pretty redundant. I'm interested in learning how to move forward.  

When I realized my pictures were out there, I immediately deactivated/deleted Facebook, Twitter, all of it. I spent over a year scrubbing the net of all those whitepages entries and MyLife profiles. If you search for me on Google you might think I don't exist.  I've seen plenty of forum posts of the pics that ask for my name, address, more info, etc. I removed all profiles and online info not just because the situation was embarrassing, but because I felt unsafe. 

My main concern is what I see as a big focus on social networking platforms by employers and employees alike. Everyone says to make the most of LinkedIn, and I really wish I could. I just finished a master's degree in a fairly technical field. I have no plans to be the ""face"" of a company, public figure, teacher, or anything like that, but I know I'll miss out on opportunities and will be at a huge disadvantage. While I accept my responsibility in causing that disadvantage, I still need a job.

I'm at the very beginning of the job search. I have excellent grades and generally interview well, but my only field-related experience is an internship I secured through my school. At all the ""job search info"" seminars I've gone to, they mention social networking and online reputation a lot. 

Specifically, what should I say if interviewers ask me for some sort of profile? I just don't see myself participating in social media for a very long time, even if it means my only opportunities are scrubbing toilets. However, I'm going to at least try for something decent, so is there a good answer for this? Answering with something like, ""privacy concerns"" seems like it could come off defensive or sketchy."

Let's start from the top. And sorry for the text wall...
My parents have been divorced sense I was one. My dad became a whiteness shortly after my parents divorce and eventually became an elder. They where studying while they where married. My mom gave up studying when they wouldn't allow her to be baptized because she missed a lot of Tuesday meetings because she didn't want me as a small child out late. She soon after resented ""the truth"". I remember her saying ""they didn't want me in their little club"" ha. 
Well I lived with my Worldly mom up until I was 14 when I started visiting my dad a lot(I didn't see him much before that.) He started studying with me and I eventually decided I was going to move to Georgia with him and become a witness. My mom refused, and I wasn't giving up. This lead to gearing up for a court battle, and one of the worst years of my adolescence. My mom was devastated. She caved weeks before the court hearing and let me move. So then I became a Jw. 
When I was 18 I decided I really wanted to help people. I went to trade school to get my EMT License because I wanted to be a firefighter. I finished and started working for an ambulance service. The schedule for it is 24 hours of work and then 48 hours off. So I worked every 3rd day. This made me miss about 2 to 3 meetings a month. I received a lot of opposition and criticism for ""putting secular things first"" and even sometimes, though rare, ""they are just worldly people, going to meetings is more important""(then peoples lives?!?) this started making me have big conflicts in my heart and guilt for missing meetings to help people, Which is really fucked up...
For 3 years I just let it roll off my back. Eventually I decided to go to paramedic school. This consumed my time greatly due to going to class, doing intern clinicals, and working full time. As a result everyone started cutting me off and treating like I'm doing something wrong. I just quit going to meeting out of resentment. Eventually I got laid a few times and decided I would just go tell the brothers and say fuck it. Not because I wanted to repent but to just get it over with, have closure, and not be harassed about straightening my life up. So I was dissfellowshiped in May. It's been liberating. I'm able to save people's lives without criticism. I don't have to hold back and I can be myself. For the most part I'm pretty happy. I only have like 4 friends now. They are all dfed too. The only thing is I can't be honest and tell them I don't believe in it anymore. They are still drinking the koolaid and wish to go back. I lie and tell them I do too so they won't shun me too. Originally I thought I did want to go back.  Now I don't. I do get pretty lonely though and wish I had more friends and a relationship, but that's been hard.  Eventually I will loose those friends. I guess I'm sort of agnostic now, and I have a strong curiosity for secular Buddhism.       "

I have some experience in Business Consulting and Public Relations through internships, started my own small web-business during my second year e também falo um pouco de português, as well as german, french and english.

Do you know of any companies or startups - preferably with a rather international approach, as this would put my language skills to a use - that might accept applications from etrangeiros or do you know how to find them?

I had this friend, lets call her ""Jen"", i've known her since kindergarten and after her parents divorced didnt see her for quite a while

Now we reconnected again through mutual friends when i was 16 and she was 14, i was stunned at how pretty she looked and got a massive crush on her, when we were together with friends playing TimeSplitters and stuff, she would always make sure that she got to sit on my lap, which i didnt think anything about, i just figured she found comfort in me

fast forward a year, a mutual friend of Jen and i has kind of trouble in her relationship, she comes over to my place and we fuck, i regret it to this day that i did it, during a random conversation with Jen i tell her what happened, she is mad (rightly so) but forgives me, as our mutual friend has kind of a promecious life

in november of that same year, Jen and i are at her place watching some tvseries, we are pretty close together since it was kinda cold, she doesnt mind me holding her hand, as the night progresses she lays down and i jokingly lay on top of her, we kinda giggle about it and we sit back normally again

Now comes,a few months later, late february, i got off internship a bit early so i asked her if i could come over for a movie, she says yes. When i go there we are kind of fooling around, watching stuff on her laptop, and watching a movie, we are kinda toying around at the time, after a while she lays on top of me and directs my hand at her upper leg, after a while, i shift my hand from her leg, around her middle, on her shirt, under her shirt, and finally on her boob, touching it lightly with my fingers, im kinda sweating at this point ""should i continue, how does she think about this??!"", so i pulled away, didnt do anything for the remainder of the night, realizing now i fucked up a chance of getting her

fast forward to september last year, she gets a boyfriend, alright, that ship has sailed, dont care, will still be best friends,

untill march this year, she kinda became silent towards me not responding to calls or chat messages, about a week after we last had contact, (this is going to sound pretty wierd) my cat get run over by a car, my closest friend of almost 7 years, dead, it teared me up, but thanks to music,games and school, i got over it

Also, over the past few years, my parents periodically have these fights, horrible fight, not so much physically horrible (smashing the door shut is the worst thing), but rather emotionally, screaming awful stuff at one another, berating me for bieng ""just like your father/mother."" belittling me, saying i will never succeed in life, bieng irrationally mad about stuff, not listening to other peoples's opinions, The constant fighting, bitching and general cuntery during these fights in this seemingly perfect marriage makes me doubt my ability to find a girlfriend/soulmate, im not going to attach myself to someone with the possibility of something like that happening, i dont want to put someone through a shitmill like that, i'd rather just piss off and be alone then to inter/disrupt somebodys future, as that 

so with my 2 best friends gone and my parents fighting, im not going to get attached to someone/thing again, its seems like a waste of time effort and money to pour it all on something and it just falls apart, im NOT doing that again
---

**tl;dr**: Parents bitch against eachother, crush/best friend goes to another guy, ignores me from then on, cat dies, not going to attach myself to someone/thing ever again

EDIT: added a paragraph about my parents."

Am I screwed?,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1n8nod/didnt_get_an_offer_after_internship_at_big_4_am_i/,"So this summer I interned in the fed tax department at one of the Big 4. I enjoyed the work, not really the hours and learned a lot about the field. During my internship, I recieved 4 positive reviews whose only comment was that I need to improve the quality of my work. They all indicated that I was a person they would love to work with in the future. 

They were so happy with my work that they asked me to extend my internship an additional month to help out with busy season, which I thought was great news at the time. We agreed on 20 hours per week, and thats where it started to go downhill. 

My senior associates and managers never gave me any work, and if they did, it was something menial like printing returns or scanning them in. The person who I was working directly under did not like me for some reason and treated me like crap, and I was pressured into working almost 40 hours despite only being cleared to work 20. 

Skipping to after the internship, I get a call from the recruiter, presuming it is the offer call, and at this point I am not even sure I want to accept it from this company because of how poorly they treated me the final month there. But she says, ""I'm sorry, I have some bad news"" and informs me that I am NOT getting an offer. She can't really pinpoint why for me, and I am just so confused that I don't pressure her any more and hang up the phone still shocked. She hinted at the fact that ""I had turned my work in with too many errors, or it wasn't the highest quality"", but honestly that is pure speculation on my part. I reached out to the people I worked with to ask what happened, and I received no response. 

Am I screwed when I start looking for other jobs? How should I spin not getting an offer? I wanted to try out audit and I was thinking of just saying that they only had opportunities available in tax and I wanted to try audit. What do you guys think?"

They told me I was overqualified, but I might make a good intern. A few days later the CTO emailed me asking for a resume and code samples. He told me that they are primarily looking for PHP, JS, HTML/CSS, iOS, and Android.   
   
I am pretty good with jquery. Not fluent, but I can write some good code with the documentation. However I am self thought in JS.   
   
I have a lot of code, and a lot of bad code from my learly projects. Here's some of my good code:   
   
I was given a 5000 line HTML document (for mobile phones) The document was full of check boxes each associated with a particular LI, and each LI represented a seminar at a convention.  The LI's were divided by by ""list-dividers"", each representing a particular time slot on a schedule. If a check box is checked, it's corresponding Li should be visible, and vice-versa. if no check-boxes on a particular time slot are checked, that time slot divider should not be invisible. And the states of the hidden or visible, and checked or unchecked boxes should be persistent between sessions, and it all needed to happen on the client side. Here's what I came up with:
   
     

//this global is used to enable or disable the block that usually occurs when any checkbox is changed. Disabling the block called in the handler prevents an infinite recursion of the set_visibility function.
ENABLE_CHANGED_HANDLER = true;

//here I iterate through every checkbox in the document, compair it's to the cookies saved, and update the states of the checkboxes and visibility of the corresponding list elements	   
function set_visibility() 
{

	ENABLE_CHANGED_HANDLER = false;//very important, avoids infinite recursion, as this function is called in the checkbox changed handler when this is true. 

	//for each checkbox
	$(""input[type='checkbox']"").each( function() 
	{

	        //get the id of the checkbox
	        _checkbox_id = $(this).attr(""id"").replace(""checkbox-mini-c"", """");//I dont want the checkbox-mini-c substring. 
	    
	        //get the state of the cookie associated with the checkbox, is it ""true""?
	        _cookie_state = (($.cookie( _checkbox_id)) == ""true"");// this parses the ""true"" string to a true boolean, or _cookie_state is false.
	   
                //get the class of the checkbox, to modify the visibility of the list devider
		_checkbox_class= $(this).attr(""class"");
 
	        //this sets the state of the checkbox, according to the value parsed from the cookie
	        $(this).prop('checked', _cookie_state);
        
	        //show or hide the LI
	        if (_cookie_state)
	        {
	       		$(""#l"" + _checkbox_id).show();
	        }
		else 
	    	{
	        	$(""#l"" + _checkbox_id).hide();
	    	}
 
                //here we modify the visibility of the list devider associated with the class of the checkbox
                if  ($('input.' + _checkbox_class + ':checkbox:checked').length &gt; 0)
	        {
	       		$(""#l"" + _checkbox_class).show();
	        }
		else 
	    	{
	        	$(""#l"" + _checkbox_class).hide();
	    	}     
 
		ENABLE_CHANGED_HANDLER = true;//now we enable the changed handler again, so it will respond to events by the user.
	
	})
}

$(document).ready(function() 
{

	//first we check all existing cookies and update the states of the checkboxes and list elements
	set_visibility(); 

	//when any checkbox is changed:   
	$(""input[type='checkbox']"").change( function() 

	{ 
		 //this is set to false withing the set visibility function, to avoid an infinite recursion 
		 if(ENABLE_CHANGED_HANDLER) 
		 {

		 	//get the relevent data about the checkbox, the ID and the state
		 	checkbox_state = $(this).is(':checked');
		 	class_id = $(this).attr(""id"").replace(""checkbox-mini-c"", """");//I dont want the checkbox-mini-c substring. 

		 	//now we save the cookie, refrenenced by the class number, (I got those from the checkbox ID's)
		 	//the value of the cookie is ""true"" or ""false""
		 	$.cookie( class_id,  checkbox_state);

		 	//and finaly we call the function that itterate through all the cookies and sets the visibility of the li's accordingly
		 	set_visibility(); 
	 	 }
	});



});    
    
Here it is in action:   
http://home.ite.sfcollege.edu/~nicholas.topper/clints_mobile_site_working_cookies/   
   
Is that what the CTO would be looking for? Should I put it on Github or something? Or do I just send the file as an attachment?    
   
I also have this website I made for a basic HTML/CSS class. I was restricted to XHTML 1.0 Strict:   
http://home.ite.sfcollege.edu/~nicholas.topper/final_project/

Is that relevant? and should I just link to it? Or again should I be putting it on github or sending a file?   
   
I also have big projects that I have done from start to finish, but the code is not pretty. I made a big windows 8 app in HTML/CSS/JQUERY from start to finish. It's called ""Molar Mass"" and has had some success in the app store. But the code is really messy. It's basically file with a bunch of weird functions that manipulate text fields and and make letters into numbers. It works beautiful, but I think it looks like spaghetti. But the app works great, and I'm proud of the final project. I'm just told that ""bad code &lt; No Code"". So I have enough to send him between those two projects? Or should I clean up that project and send it as well? 

I also have some python/webapp2 stuff but I'm afraid to send it, because viewing the source of that one compromises security, and again it's not great, ans I was just learning. Should I express somehow that I do know how server side code works? I am going to mention one semester of training in C# for .net in my resume.
   
I/m going to be away from my computer until Saturday but I was thinking about making some of my bad code presentable on Saturday before sending it. Unless what I posted above is enough.   
   
**TLDR: How much code should I send? Is bad code worse than no code? Should I put it on github or just attach files?**   
   
I'm going to be away from my computer for a day or two but before the end of the weekend I am going to send some code over.    
   
Thanks for the advice!

I have had a job since I was 15 and been completely on my own financially since I left home at 18. I put myself through college at a state university with a job, help from grants, and two loans. I graduated in 2009 (with a Theatre degree) when there were no jobs for anyone and I took whatever jobs I could. There were journalism and casting internships that I was offered, but I couldn't afford to be unpaid or live on stipends. I'm sure I've made some mistakes, but no enormous ones that I can see. How the hell do I pull myself out of this?

I have no credit cards. I have one student loan of $4500 left to pay off. Currently I am working on a cruise ship. The money is not spectacular and its a hard job, but in five months I managed to pay off a loan of $2500 and save around $4000. Alas, then there is always some huge cost to be paid off every time I get a little money. Having no furniture and buying a bed instead of an air mattress, a new computer when mine crashed, and now my wisdom teeth out before they cause anymore pain. I feel like I can't get ahead. I'm unsure what to do. I know going to grad school would be a mistake with more loans and still no job guarantee. 

If you have any advice, I'd really appreciate it. "
1n81cq,2,2013-09-26,Relocating to a national lab,noitsthursday,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1n81cq/relocating_to_a_national_lab/,"Has anyone relocated during their PhD for research reasons, and how did it go? I know that internships are fairly common in engineering and computer science, while in other fields, like particle physics, students often do the majority of grad school away from their university, and I would like to hear about some of your experiences.

I am asking because my advisor offered me a chance to relocate to a national lab for two years while working on my PhD, and I am not sure if I want to take the offer. I realize that it is a great opportunity and could help propel my career forward, but I am not sure if I want to relocate in the middle of grad school. If I do take the offer, I would still be working for her because she has appointments at the national lab and my university, and I could incorporate all of my research so far, so it will not hamper my progress. Also, it would give me a chance to network, gain valuable experience and work with some highly talented individuals. But while I am excited about the research opportunities, I am hesitant about the more personal aspects of moving.

I can explain more if it helps, but the short of it is that I love the city that my university is in, and I have developed some surprisingly deep friendships (one in particular has the potential to become something more) that I do not want to run out on. In contrast, the national lab is in a suburb of a different city and mostly caters to families and people that commute into that city. As a result, the suburb is rather dull, and many of the advantages I currently have living near the heart of a city are absent.

If I turn down the offer, I will probably stay in the group doing similar experiments to the ones that I have been doing so far. I will still occasionally go to the national lab to do the experiments that we can only do there, but it would be only once every two months or so. I don’t want to pass up on an offer that could potentially help me out a lot in the long run, but at the same time, I don’t really want to move again.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? How did it go? Does anyone have any advice on how to approach deciding? I realize that ultimately I have to decide for myself, but I would like to hear about other peoples' experiences."

So recently this internship opportunity came up for the Australian summer holidays, and I really want to apply and get it. They're asking for first and second year students, and I am first year. I feel my GPA is pretty strong (for my Bachelor of CS degree anyway). 


The problem is that it came up quite quickly and I don't have any projects under my belt to really show off. I do have some uni projects I've done, including some Hadoop work on a cluster, but the dataset I used concerned my state so it was very small (didn't require Hadoop and could have been done with Excel without hassle). I haven't dealt with any big data (though I do still have access to the cluster and could do something interesting in the next week). The other issue is that I've learnt the bare necessities of java to make my algorithm, but I don't feel comfortable with it at all. I'm much more comfortable with C++.


I'm on holidays at the moment with one more week, and I've been learning SDL2 recently. I'd love to throw something together in the next week, whether it be SDL2 or something else. I'm just trying to gauge what kind of projects would be worth doing. Is something I've made in a week even worth putting on the resume? What kind of depth is looked for?


So this is all pretty vague I guess. And I'm sure you probably get these questions all the time, to the point of irritation. That being said, any advice would be appreciated."
1n7vqi,134,2013-09-26,Some actual social engineering tips (with sources),browsingpornignoreme,SocialEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialEngineering/comments/1n7vqi/some_actual_social_engineering_tips_with_sources/,"Since this subreddit is slowly turning into /r/socialskills, I'll step in and provide some content. This is my throwaway porn account, deal with it.

Oh, and *I provide sources*, because what I say is based on facts and scientific research, not PUA speculation.

**Intro**

So you want an internship. You are just like every other student in terms of experience, attractiveness and social skills. What do you do?

People will tell you to network, but you have no *leverage*. To employers, you are pretty much worthless. The goal here is one of those two:

* Make you seem like you are not worthless
* Make you worth more than other students

**Getting leverage**

Since you have very little experience, we'll cheat a bit. This starts with a few obvious things:

* Get a few pairs of eyes on your resume. Your university has people whose only job is to get you hired, and nobody ever pays them a visit. Get your resume reviewed by as many professionals as you can, and come back often. Once the content is good, get in touch with a graphic designer. You have no idea of what good spacing and a nice font selection can do. There are two reasons to do this: The [mere exposure effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mere-exposure_effect) makes these professionals favour you to unknown candidates, and [people prefer attractive things, regardless of their content](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1559-1816.2003.tb01909.x/abstract). That's on top of the tremendous advantage of having professional help.

* Network even without leverage. Even if you are not a special little snowflake, you can take advantage of the mere exposure effect by contacting people on LinkedIn to ask them questions. Connect with them saying that you had a lot of interest in the company and consider applying for internships. Ask them questions, converse with them and get them to refer you to someone in HR. This way, you can say ""John Doe from the accounting team sent me your way"" and appear to be an insider. This exploits multiple effects: The [Ben Franklin effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Franklin_effect), the good ol' mere exposure effect, and social proof (since you were referred by one of their own).

* Get [social proof](http://blog.kissmetrics.com/social-proof-factors-2/). Since you have no experience, it's harder for you to put stuff on your resume, but you have plenty of teachers, classmates, workmates and previous employers who can help you. From experience, people are quite happy to support you even if you have never done anything special, simply because saying no would be rude. Collect reviews and endorsements at any opportunity. In addition, people usually [stay consistent](http://www.social-engineer.org/framework/Influence_Tactics:_Commitment_and_Consistency) with what they have written, and reviewing you can harden their positive opinion of you.

* Build skills. Subway built your ability to work under pressure. Retail told you to simplify technical jargon, follow objectives and effectively find a client's needs. Take credit for everything that worked well, even if you were only part of the effort. If you were 3rd out of 4 salesmen, then you were in the top 3 salesmen for that region (be careful with that, though). If you dropped out of a club after two visits, then you were part of it, and no one will verify it as long as you have stories to tell.

So far my GPA is ~3.7 (havent transfered over some credits from UCLA here, so i cant tell you the exact number), definitely above 3.5.

Math Classes:

-Calc 1--Taken in HS-got a B

-Calc 2 (engineering sequence)-- B- (it was my first quarter in college).

-Multivariable Calc- A.

-Linear Algebra- A+

-Applied Discrete Mathematics- A

-Differential Equations- B- (Taken at UCLA)

Economics courses:

-Southeast asian economies (upper div)- A

-Intermed Micro- A

-Intermed Micro- B+ (had to take it again at UCLA) &amp; The associated Honors section (10 students out of 200+) in which i got an A+.

-Intermed Macro- B+ (taken at UCLA)

-Why economies succeed or fail (upper div)- B

-Econometrics (UD)- A+

-International Financial Mrkts (UD)- A+

This quarter im taking a graduate level course in Advanced Micro theory, UD math class on Proofs, and another UD econ elective (international finance).

I have to take 3 or 4 more upper div math classes (planning on Real Analysis, and some probability theory classes), all done with econ, but still will take a couple more courses.

No research :(

Summer internship at a Capital Management firm.

I'm going to have a letter of rec from a UCLA professor who had me in his Honors section, he'll write me a good one. I'll have another from my Econometrics prof (A+ in his course), and he supervised my internship. The third letter is going to be weak, probably from the CEO/Owner of the firm i interned for (he doesn't hold a PhD), but he'll rave about my work ethic and intelligence, he loved me. 

GRE is taken on Oct 8th--practice quant was 163, and i still am practicing. 

Statement of purpose--havent started, but said UCLA professor is going to go over my essays with me.

I'm applying across the board--Hoping for UCLA or UCSD (i'd really like to stay in Cali so i can be close to my family). My list includes: Stanford, UCLA, NYU, Cal, UCSB, UC Davis, UCSD, Univ of Washington, Boston U, Boston College, ASU and U of Ariz, and some others. 

Will i at least be able to get into some of the lower ranked programs (SB, Washington, ASU, Ariz, etc)?

My biggest concern is LORs and not having all my grades by the time apps are due. If i nailed this quarter and was able to show them i got great grades in an Upper Div math class, A graduate level course, and another UD econ class i think i'd be much stronger. Also the fact that they wont see the rest of my courses (mostly going to be math). I think i have a pretty strong academic background, and i will hopefully be scoring at least a 163 on the practice GRE quant.

So Dave, our boss, comes in and he’s like “Gavin, make these your primary action items immediately”, and Gavin’s like “Yes sir” but I know he’s thinking “What the fuck is this guy talking about?” so he asks me. Now, I don’t fucking know, I’ve been putting rum in my coffee for the past eight months and I’ve been wasted out of my mind at work every day, how am I supposed to know what an action item is? So I tell the kid, I say, “Gavin, that means you have locate a fellow female intern and shove the papers Dave just gave you into her anus”. So this kid eats it up, says he’ll get right on it. He runs around the office for a while until he finds a candidate; her name’s Hannah, now Hannah is a really sweet, quiet girl, super innocent and doesn’t seem like the type of person who gets paper cuts on their colon on a regular basis, but Gavin’s a charismatic motherfucker so he slicks his hair back and goes for it. He goes “Hey Hannah, I need your help with something.  Know what an action item is?” she shakes her head and he’s like “Here, I’ll show you”. So he just fucking lifts her up and bends her over, pulls her jeans off and just goes for it. He takes the papers, rolls them up like you would roll up a magazine to swat a fly and shoves it up there. Now, Hannah’s not making any noise, she doesn’t give a fuck, probably high off her ass or something.  So Gavin shoves it up about a quarter-inch but there’s some resistance, which is confusing. Turns out, Hannah already HAS a roll of papers up her anus, so Gavin takes those out, rolls it with the other, and tries to stick it in again. But now that there are the extra papers, it’s too thick to fit, so now the kid Gavin needs to widen the whole. So he comes to me, and I’m watching all of this, and he asks me for some lube, and obviously I have some because who doesn’t have lube? So he just dumps my whole fucking bottle of top-notch lube onto the roll of papers, goes back over to Hannah who hasn’t moved, and just shoves it back in. He uses his palm to bang it in a couple of times, like a hammer&amp;nail, until her ass is just a gaping white circle lined in paper. So Gavin looks to me for confirmation, and I give him the thumbs up, and that would’ve been it but Dave just walked in at that moment. And I thought “Shit, this kid Gavin is fucked”, but Dave just smiled and said “Good, you made it the action items. Now let me just confirm it” and apparently you confirm action items by shitting into Hannah’s anus because that’s what Dave did, he just dropped his pants and shit right into the hole that the paper made, right into her ass. So that was Gavin’s first day."

As the title says, I just graduated from TCC with my Associates in Networking and Cyber Security in August. I've been looking for IT jobs like crazy (most of them are up in Seattle) or anything similar, but I'm having trouble landing one. Before going to school for IT, I did a lot of warehouse work so I've been applying for those as well. I've noticed my degree gets me a lot more interviews than before I had one, but my lack of recent warehouse experience hasn't gotten me past the interviews that I get.

I've been applying for IT jobs but the only calls I've been getting in relations to that is from recruiters from job agencies. This isn't a bad thing, but here's the kicker: I have a felony from 2007. When I let employers/recruiters know this, they seem satisfied that it had nothing to do with robbery/theft or anything sexual in nature. Some of them have been gracious enough to let me explain that my wife at the time lied to the cops, to get me out of the house, and said that I beat her up. I was charged with a felony, served 2 months in jail and a year of probation. I realize it's hard for anyone with a felony to get a job, but that's one of the main reasons I went to college: to show people that I'm serious about my life and my passion to do well. 

I serve as the supervisor for my church's A/V department (volunteer/unpaid) and have done this since 2007. I also completed a 2-month internship at a local tech company earlier this year. I am now attending Western Governors University, which is a fully-online school that I will be obtaining my Bachelors in IT from. I'll also be obtaining my CCNA, several MTAs, an MCSA and an MCSE from the WGU program. 

Anyway, does anyone know of ANYTHING local that I can get my foot in the door in? Thanks for your help!



**TL;DR** Recent college graduate in IT with a felony from 2007 needs a job!

1nbucc,3,2013-09-28,Living in Frankfurt,sarcasmruinsmylife,frankfurt,https://www.reddit.com/r/frankfurt/comments/1nbucc/living_in_frankfurt/,"Hello! I'm a high school student from Eastern Europe and I want to study in Germany next year. I've chosen some universities (Mannheim, Frankfurt, Koeln) but I have some questions regarding the life here and I'd be very thankful if I get answers to the following questions:

1. I will most certainly be on a really tight budget(400-500 euros/month) and if my Stundenwerk/WG is 250-300 this will leave me with 150-200 bucks for food. In my country Kaufland and Lidl are the most popular supermarkets with the most reasonable prices and I wonder whether it is the same in Frankfurt. In other words, if I cook for myself, which is the best place to buy food from?

2. I know that FFM is a big city and there are definitely Unterhaltungsmoeglichkeiten (Bars/Pubs/etc), but in order to fit in my monthly budget I won't be able to frequent most of them due to the probable high prices. Anyway, are there some relatively inexpensive and cozy places where young people occasionally gather in order to alleviate the tedium of everyday life? 
 
3. My last question is about the Uni itself - I want to study WiWi in Goethe Uni and I wonder what the program is like. I've heard that the first 2 semesters are more general and you specialize during the 3rd one? How many exams are at the end of each semester? Also, what kind of student jobs can I work during my studying in order to support myself? Lastly ( this time I promise ), we all know about the Frankfurt Banks so I want to ask whether some internships are available and if there are, after which year?

I apologize if I have wasted your time and for any grammatical/lexical mistakes! Peace : )"

I'm looking for someone who'd be happy to do a series of ongoing little jobs around the site. The site is expanding and I can't handle it all by myself anymore.

The work will mostly involve things like:

- Taking documents (containing text, images, tables, etc.) and converting them in to web pages.
- Small code improvements and updates.
- Formatting/updating pages
- Fixing errors
- Small site-wide updates
- Intergrating scripts

Ideally, once you're familiar with how the website works, I'd like to assign you tasks and give you the freedom to find your own intuitive solutions. I'll try and give you as much creative freedom as I can.

This job would be perfect for anyone who has a working knowledge of HTML/CSS, and wants to earn some money on the side whilst they practice their skills. An interest in PHP would be a huge bonus, as well as a basic understanding of Photoshop. Javascript would be a minor bonus.

I'm meticulous when it comes to the structure and function of the website, so I'm looking for someone who's a bit of a perfectionist. I'm a pixel-perfect kind of guy. If that's not you, for your own sanity don't put yourself up for the job. I also want someone who is good at organising data - someone who can take information and display it in a usable way. But most of all, I want you to _enjoy_ front-end web development.

*Payment:* $500/month for two months, like an ""internship"". Then we'll see how things are going after that. I'm flexible.

*Hours:* I wouldn't expect you to spend longer than 1-2 hours a day on this stuff, so it would make an ideal part-time job from the comfort of your own home. You can spend longer on it if you enjoy the challenges though.

*Location:* Remote. We can just collaborate over Evernote.

Send me a message if you're interested. Tell me about yourself - how old you are, where you're from, what you like doing - all that kind of stuff. Write as if you're speaking to a friend. I'll get back to you if you sound like a good fit."
1nbr39,5,2013-09-28,[FI] Finances are in decent order but obsessed and unhappy with salary. Afraid I'll make rash decisions.,i_eat_cabbage,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1nbr39/fi_finances_are_in_decent_order_but_obsessed_and/,"Hi guys.

My overall financial situation is not a complete catastrophe, as explained in the [previous thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1m19xq/saving_aggressively_do_i_need_a_budget/), but the one thing I'm very unhappy about is my salary, which is 2000 euros monthly after taxes and mandatory social/pension payments.

The thing is, I'm a grad student in engineering, from the top engineering university in Finland. While I'm grinding away with 2000 eur, I see my friends and classmates have well-paying jobs in industry, finance and consulting. Some of the early adopters already got rich by working for Angry Birds and Clash of Clans very early, or by selling their tech startups to big U.S. players. At the same time I get a constant stream of ""recruiting evening"" invitations via various networks (I don't know if that is a common concept in the US, but basically it consists of inviting 100 or so students, drowning them in vodka and trying to get them to sign up for an internship), which makes it impossible to forget how close that world is.

I love my research project, I'm very good at what I do, and the project has a real chance of being useful to a very large amount of people in the future (but it's probably not going to be commercially viable during the next few decades, possibly not during my lifetime). However, I can't seem to have any control of fact that I'm very very jealous of most of my classmates, knowing that I could very likely do what they are doing and earning what they are earning. This is made even worse by Facebook et al., where people portray an untrue image of how good their life is.

It will take me at least 2, more likely 3 or 4 more years until I can graduate, if ever. There might not be a viable academic career path on my field, so I'm afraid I'll end up like [this dude](https://chronicle.com/blogs/phd/2013/09/19/the-ph-d-industry-gap/) almost did.

I'm having my end-of-year review in around 2 months. The way my mental state is fluctuating nowadays and how unhappy I feel, I'm seriously afraid that in the heat of the moment I will tell my professor that I quit. This would leave him, the project and some of my colleagues and friends in a serious trouble. However, I'm getting to the age where I feel I can't play around any more and need to start making (financially) smart choices about my career.

I am thinking about my salary and my future literally almost every day, and it causes me sleepless nights and a deep and constant feeling of desperation. I keep having fantasies of how much easier my life would be with a better salary, how it would somehow earn me some respect and how I wouldn't have to be ashamed of my job title.

I wrote this piece mainly to clarify my thoughts, but I welcome any comments."
1nbr2o,69,2013-09-28,"Four years out from law school, I finally have a full-time, long-term, career-suitable job!",Self_Improving_JD,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1nbr2o/four_years_out_from_law_school_i_finally_have_a/,"**TL;DR** - I came out of law school right at the middle of the industry crash. After three years of doc review interspersed with unsatisfactory small firm/solo practitioner work (including one place that outright fired me before I could resign), I finally landed a great job at a newly-formed law firm. I'd say it was based maybe 15% on my professional skills, 20% on networking and making contacts, and 65% on just being there in the right place at the right time.

**The long version:**

2009: Graduated law school, passed the bar exam. I knew I wanted to do something international, as I can speak three languages. But I didn't know what. Just to keep some money coming in, I signed up for the document review contract attorney positions. I decided that in addition to the day job as a contract attorney, I would continue to network and try to get where I wanted to be: an actual legal practitioner in a law firm.

2010: I went to networking events for international law issues, and I met numerous lawyers. One lawyer, **Alcibiades**, needed help with their solo practice, which did the usual small-time firm stuff (tenancy cases, wills and estates, contracts), but occasionally had int'l law cases.

**Alcibiades**: This position was unpaid, and I worked for them for about a year, on and off, while I also did doc review. The work was in Antidumping/Countervailing Duties investigations. I suppose their practice never really took off, as they steadfastly said they couldn't afford to pay me. I took that as a sign that they would be a useful resume builder (so that I could at least show some substantive practice of law for that year instead of simple doc review) but a non-starter as far as law career was concerned.

2011: I got put on a big contract attorney project at $35/hour which ended up lasting a year. However, I was aware that an entire year with no substantive practice to my name could count against me if I ever wanted to leave the doc review industry (I did). So I asked Alcibiades whether they knew any other solos who needed help.

2012: **Beershabba**: It turns out that Alcibiades knew Beershabba from their time in gov't together, and I took a break from doc review to help Beershabba. They had a small practice that did some family law, landlord-tenant, contract, business, and wills and estates law, but their main draw was the fact that they focused on a language that I could speak. They also did some AD-CVD law (international trade law) and they wanted to expand into immigration law, especially investor immigrant cases. It turned out that they never made this switch - it's a hard task to branch into a completely new field of law, and it's even harder when you already have a full caseload of traffic court cases, landlord-tenant cases, and domestic separation/divorce cases vying for your attention.

Beershabba could only employ me for afternoon work, but they knew another lawyer out of state, **Caernilin**, who needed clerking work done remotely. I started doing morning work for Caernilin and then going to Beershabba's solo practice in the afternoons. Both positions paid me $20/hr.

The Beershabba placement was not a very good fit for me. The attorney's personality and problem solving approach were confusing to me, and I often made mistakes or performed work in a way that was incompatible with them. I wish I could say that I concluded my employment with them on amicable terms, but I didn't. Beershabba essentially fired me before I had a chance to resign, and went as far as to say that I was not allowed to put them down as a reference.

This experience was traumatic for me and for a few days I was in a state of mental shock. Fortunately, I contacted Caernilin and they were sympathetic, allowing me to use them as a reference and to use my time clerking for them remotely as a fill-in for the time I couldn't refer to Beershabba. Otherwise, I would have had a big, inexplicable time gap on my resume. Caernilin continued to send occasional AD/CVD work my way. However, at $20/hr, it was clear I couldn't stay with this for long.

**Dorselan**: was another solo practitioner who had a specialization in immigration law, with a focus on my ethnicity and language. I called them up on the recommendation of a family friend, and they turned out to be very friendly and supportive. After a few phone calls, we met in person and they offered me an immigration internship.

The law firm practice was still not a very good fit for me - perhaps the attorney's foreign training was the explanation. I helped to refer one relative to this attorney practice, and the client management didn't sync at all with my expectation or my relative's expectations. At numerous times, I found myself thinking ""Even if this client were not a blood relative of mine, I would be doing things much differently from Dorselan. Dorselan did do investor immigrant cases - I handled one such case and it was a month-long process to assemble the application.

The internship period ended, and Dorselan made me a full-time offer. Their rate would have annualized to $18/hr. I declined and resigned.

2013: I continued my networking and job applications, and returned to document review. I lucked out halfway through the year and found myself on a foreign language review, making a much higher rate (high $50s/hr, with time and a half overtime). I looked around at the other foreign-trained lawyers and wondered if I could stay here indefinitely, making this high rate basically for reading and clicking documents. It was tempting, and the pay was high enough that I wouldn't have to worry about anything ever again. But I was aware that the English-language reviews had fallen to about $30/hour, down from two years before. Oversupply of attorneys was only one part of the problem - predictive coding and adaptive algorithms was the other part. Simply put, given enough computing advances, the document review industry was in slow decline.

I sent out numerous job applications and continued networking. Ultimately, it was an unlikely source that brought me to my current (and hopefully final) workplace: Craigslist.

In May I sent in one of dozens of anonymous Craigslist applications. In June, the solo practitioner **Ermintrude** emailed back. My ethnic background and language ability was of interest. They set up a phone interview time, and then promptly broke it. In July I called them back up, professionally, and asked them if I could continue with my application. They apologized for the lack of response (later I learned they had hired somebody for the position but the new hire never showed up in the end). We went back and forth a few times and I stopped by their office in August. They made me an offer and I thought it was good enough, especially for a starting attorney at a starting firm. I accepted.

In September, I signed the papers to start at the new firm. I'm the second fully licensed attorney they have, and I speak all of the languages they need to process investor immigrant applications. Things have been great - the firm's founder has a personality that's a great fit with mine, and I've picked up all the training they have to give me like a sponge taking to water. I finished two applications in my first week (compared with Dorselan's month-and-a-half pace per application) and they said they were comfortable knowing they'd made the right choice in me.

Takeaway points:

* Hang in there. You may have the skills and the drive - and the job is out there, but it's not going to come to you.

* Keep learning things. We all need money to live, but if your resume only shows that you've taken jobs that pay for rote skills, it's going to be much harder to leave the rote skill industry.

* Stay flexible. I started off focusing on AD/CVD cases because they were international. But Dorselan convinced me that I could be an effective advocate for immigration clients too (even though they couldn't afford to pay me a liveable wage). I went from AD/CVD to general small firm practice, to immigration generally, to investor immigration specialization. None of this was planned, but I knew I had to keep my skills developing broadly so that I had something to offer.

* It bears repeating: hang in there! Job hunting is like dating. You're going to get rejected. You're going to get promising prospects that fizzle. You're going to get really bad mismatches. But the one good fit you find, none of that will matter.

Stay strong - we're facing difficult times, it's true. But all that means is we're ready for far greater challenges than our cushier forerunners.

It's out there. It's just waiting for you to find it."

I'm attending one of the top business schools in the U.S., and is internationally as well. My degree program, information systems is almost number one in faculty productivity. 

I'm currently in the honors program. I transferred here from my previous institution where I got an associate in computer networking. I graduated there with high honors. I went on to obtain a Cisco certification (CCNA). 

Now I can't find part time work anywhere. I really want to start getting experience in the field so I can start working toward my future aspirations. My certification expires in three years before I have to renew it, so I need to get my foot in the door before college is over. I plan on working full time right when I finish my degree and then I want to pursue my masters. But If I can't find entry level work, it'll put my education on hold.

The other day, I got a call about an internship I applied. It was for students only, and ones that are pursuing a related bachelor program. I was asked about my expected graduation date and then the guy on the phone forwarded my resume to his boss. I get an email the next day saying the 'position has been filled'. 

Seriously? Not even an interview? I really doubt many were going to be more qualified than me for this internship. Computer networking doesn't have a bachelor of science degree. So many people my age have absolutely no experience in it, nor have a certification proving they can troubleshoot/manage/maintain medium-large sized networks. It's not easy to get either. I took 4 courses, 5 credit hours each (Cisco Networking Academy), and then studied for about 5 hours every night for a month and a half to pass my exam.

I really am sick of all of this. I have worked so hard the past two years yet nothing has come out of it.


TL;DR I'm a very hardworking individual with a good background who can't find experience, yet those who are much less qualified are finding work.

1nbmkw,1,2013-09-28,Less social + more anxious since starting nofap a year ago.. Self-esteem demolished after every relapse. Anyone else?,[deleted],NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1nbmkw/less_social_more_anxious_since_starting_nofap_a/,"So I started nofap a year ago, but if anything my life has gotten shittier.  I'm much harder on myself now then I was then, which is a good thing in some respect I suppose. Being hard on myself is becoming part of the problem though - it's destroying any self esteem I had for myself before starting this journey. Hopefully its just ""brining me down to earth"" and re-normalizing my expectations of who I am and what I can accomplish, chipping away at my ego until I cant just live life for the sake of living.

I've gotten pretty cut and put on a good 10 pounds of muscle. Realized my grades were shit (3rd year of college now) and that I needed to get my GPA up if I wanted to secure a good internship this summer. And I've become more diligent with my responsibilities and striving to be a better, less egotistical person.

But I feel like this quest has consumed me.  Relapses are becoming more and more depressing.  I've started crying every time I fail now, I learn a lot each time I do, but its always a ""wow I'm wasting my college experience, not living up to what I believe I'm capable of, I will always be suffering"" kind of experience afterwards.

It might be a coincidence, but I'm much more self conscious now then I was before starting this.  Social anxiety has been a struggle for me since I was teased for being gay in high school (I'm straight, but I always obsess about my outwards appearance/behavior and how masculine I'm coming off since then.) I feel like I've become much more ""square-ish,"" for lack of a better word, over the past few months.  I don't know if this is my ""ideal self"" but I feel much more pious and serious - almost inappropriately so when it comes to ""hanging out"" with friends.

Probably the most positive aspect is that this whole ""self control"" quest has made me much more introspective about who I am as a person and the darkness inside of me.  I've been reading into a lot of philosophy, Buddhism specifically, and trying to strive for a sort of subjective perfection of what I consider to be the ideal Self.

I guess that's why most of us are here.

If anything nofap is becoming an artificial crutch for facing my real problems.  I expect things to get better solely from abstaining from fapping. 

If anything the real challenge, ""ultimate hard mode,"" would be returning to fapping, and dealing with whatever slight increase in anxiety is associated with that + whatever demons you have in real life. In other words, having everything be on me - no bullshit counter to fall back on to reassure myself.  Plenty of other guys do it and pull the hottest girls every night - and they're killing life.  If anything the fact that I'm doing nofap is just reinforcing the idea that I'm inferior to other guys that do it and can still ""win at life"" so to speak.

Anyone with a similar experience? The only hope I have now is that I can't get much more depressed/anxious from here. I feel like soon I will hit a point where everything will start being signs of improvement - namely because ANYTHING positive would be an improvement at this point. Guess this is what is meant by ""dark night of the soul"" before becoming closer to God/enlightenment etc.


tl;dr: Been a year since I started this.  Average streak ~20 days, maxed at 55 this past summer. More anxious and depressed than ever - only two years of college left and I'm close to saying ""fuck it"" and adopting a more hedonistic outlook on life. If anything the fact that I'm doing **nofap is just reinforcing the idea that I'm inferior.**

I'm afraid of putting too much detail because I really don't want anybody I know to find this.

Since I was born my father has been incredibly absent in addition to being a gigantic asshole. He's always been INCREDIBLY selfish. He literally cannot think of anybody but himself. He put my mom into crazy amounts of debt by buying computer things and then left her when I was in elementary school. He got remarried to the trashy, classless bitch who is now his wife only a couple years later... she was already trying to steal him from my mom when they were still married. Despite all this, he surprised me occasionally growing up by showing that he still had some amount of good or kindness left inside of him. He helped support me and helped put me through school.

His wife has ALWAYS been jealous of me. He's told me this himself. Despite a history of depression and anorexia (my dad pinched my fat on my body constantly when I was like 11 and told me I was getting fat) I can admit now that I am incredibly intelligent, caring, and pretty. She is the opposite of all these things. She's also an alcoholic. Shit hit the fan when I was over at his house one day and she began insulting my mother (while drunk). It ended up with her trying to attack me and my (now) husband. My dad had to hold her back and tackle her to the ground. She ended up laying on the ground with her shirt around her neck, with my dad apologizing as we ran out of his house. That is the night when any remaining good in my father disappeared. The next day I try to talk to my father. I'm hoping maybe he FINALLY realizes how awful she is and is going to leave her (he doesn't love her, he's miserable in his life, everybody knows this). Nope. He tells me she passed out and he called an ambulance and it's not her fault she attacked us because she's ""sick."" He continually defends her and her behavior toward us. After this event I couldn't sleep for like 3 months. The event just kept replaying in my head over and over and over.

Despite this, I tried to continue to have a relationship with my father. He's always said he's wanted a relationship with me. I knew deep down that he loved me, he's just completely clueless and selfish. I graduated college and got an amazingly prestigious (unpaid) internship. Everybody I knew was congratulating me, excited for me, etc. I told him and he immediately just said ""No, you need to get a job now."" and that is the last thing he said to me. No congratulations, no happiness for me. He was originally going to help my mother support me until I found a paying job. He immediately emails my mother and tells her he's cutting me off. I tried to explain to him that this amazing internship would allow me to find a job more quickly than if I were just looking for something based off my current experience. He seems to think finding a job post-college is as easy as wanting one. I emailed him telling him how much it hurt that he wasn't proud of me, how I didn't care about the money but at least wanted him to be happy for me. No response. He continues to be an asshole to my mother, claiming he just ""can't afford"" to support me anymore. He has a very good, very well paying job. I finally sent him an email telling him he's a selfish dick head if his money is more important to him than a relationship with his daughter. The next day he posts pictures of his extravagant vacation on Facebook.. so he can't support his daughter through an internship but has money for crazy vacations, eating out every night, and going on shopping sprees every month? I decided to cut him off completely.

There's a lot more to it, but I don't want to give out more details. I can't stop thinking about the whole situation. I feel incredibly stupid because I constantly have bad dreams about him and his wife, the time she tried to attack me, him just being a dick to me, etc. I guess I don't really need advice... just to know this is all out somewhere. Thank you for listening."

A budding student wildlife photographer from Chennai in India is putting a technological spin to raise funds for his passion to become a professional photographer.

Arjun who dreams of one day becoming a professional wildlife photographer has turned to the harness the power of social media to raise money to turn his dreams into reality.

The budding photographer love of the wildlife began when he was five years old when his grandfather who visited the forest for his timber showed him the spectacular wildlife and his burning desire to one day share his passion for these amazing animals through the lens of his camera has never faded.

The student photographer dream is to become a qualified wildlife photographer where he wants to share with the world through his amazing pictures with each one telling a heart-warming story about how spectacular the wildlife on planet earth is, but there is a problem. Arjun needs to get an internship to fulfill his dream and at the moment his dream is being dashed by not having enough experience under his belt.

Arjun said: I loved taking pictures of animals! Eventually, I became addicted to it and bought a Digital SLR for $450 (Rs.25000 Indian Rupees) and a lens (70-200) for $850 (Rs.48800 Indian Rupees). I now have a portfolio and I have contacted wildlife photographers all over India for an internship. However, they have refused to give me a chance because I need to explore more places.”

As part of Arjun campaign to raise $3,500, he has turned to the powerful internet to reach out to people including business executives, politicians and celebrities to gain their support and help to  fulfill his dream of reaching his goal of gaining an internship.

Arjun needs to raise the funds to gain the experience that is required to succeed in gaining an internship. To achieve this goal he needs to raise $3,500 to buy the equipment needed and travel to more places and explore more wildlife.

The student wildlife photographer who has already had some of his work featured in newspapers, wants to share his talents with a wider audience and grow and develop as a photographer, where one day he could become one of the most successful wildlife photographers on the planet, and you could be part of that dream, you could by visiting his site, http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/help-me-make-a-good-wildlife-portfolio, help Arjun fulfill his dream.

I came here to study masters in Biomedical Engineering at an NJ school. In the first semester I faced a lot of difficulty handling the heavy engineering courses and I flunked two of them, managing to pass one biology based course.

I pleaded my case and the school was kind enough to let me transfer to a Microbiology course for which I was qualified since I have an undergrad degree in Biotechnology. My depression and anxiety from my dismal first semester performance got to me very badly to the point that I was barely functioning and had no one to speak with. Once again, to the school's credit, they did frequently advertise about counselling and psychological services but I shrugged it off thinking I was just being lazy. Seeing a psychiatrist is also a taboo in my family so I was more hesitant to seek help. 

Well, in the second semester, I passed another course but failed two more. Now my matriculation has been cancelled and I'm being told to go back home to avoid violating my F1 visa status. I don't blame the university at all, I'm only concerned about the future. 

I have a plan. I want to seek professional help back home. Plus, I'm thinking of using the year long break to find myself an internship (through some contacts, I'm optimistic) and try to publish one or two review papers with help from a professor back home.  I'm also considering taking the subject GRE (Biochem/Molecular Bio) which I know is tough but getting anything above the 80th percentile will boost my chances (that's what I feel anyways, am I wrong?)

I'm looking for some honest opinions about my chances at getting an admission into a US university again. When I apply next, will it be mandatory to make transcripts available from my US university? I'm really lost and any inputs and discussion would be highly appreciated."

A couple of cool Easter eggs I found:
http://i.imgur.com/Bqjd78e.jpg
This is a prescription bottle that can be found randomly in the world, usually in areas with medicine trainers. If you look closely you can see the name Chris Deavellar. I googled the name and turns out he was art director for Fallen Earth up until about a year ago. Here is his website: http://www.chrisdevo.com/ I emailed him about the prescription bottle and he told me it was one of the first projects he was given upon getting a job at Icarus as an intern! I though it was cool that his name has a permanent place in FE.
Also, you can't see it from this angle of the picture, but the prescription is for Hydrocodone/IBU 500mg: Take 2 pills every 4 hours. As a pharmacist, this was cool to see as that is a real medication (although not in that strength).

The second Easter egg I have found is this: If you look closely at the instrument gauges on the motorcycle they are almost identical to those of a 2007 Honda Civic. My wife drives this very car and I just so happened to look down one day on my motorcycle in Fallen Earth and noticed the similarity! Here is a pic comparing the 2: http://i.imgur.com/JMYrs1g.jpg
I asked Chris about this as well, but he said that another artist was responsible for the motorcycle gauges. He did say that it was very possible that the gauges from the Honda were used as a reference noting the similarity.

So...what neat or interesting things have you guys found in the game? I can't have been the only one!"

**91,511** Enthusiasts for **5 years!**

/r/cars is a subreddit about cars, unsurprisingly. 

When I first thought about /r/cars, I was expecting a subreddit full of [pictures of cool looking cars that I will never have](http://imgur.com/a/qbRkJ). I was pleasantly surprised (and a little intimidated, honestly) with the content I saw. While I definitely saw ""pictures of cool cars which I will never have""™, I also saw people asking for advice on what to fix up and what to buy, as well as people sharing experiences and moments with each other.

/r/cars has to have one of the coolest communities I've ever seen. Strangers bonding over 2 ton hunks of metal that have a machine that makes explosions inside them, *and look really good doing it*.

/r/cars is great for everyone. With a community ranging from your average Joe who likes to see souped up rides, to hardcore racing enthusiasts, it's no wonder the subreddit is a favorite of many. Personally, I sometimes can't go near /r/cars out of jealousy, and the knowledge that I will never own such magnificent feats of engineering.

I am the type of guy who just likes to look at cars. [This kind of stuff](http://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/1n9u6u/does_modifying_intake_or_exhaust_increase_power/) is not what I'm about.

    Title: Does modifying intake or exhaust increase power on modern cars that use a torque demand based engine management system?

    Words I understood: *cars*

So if any of you gearheads want to explain to me what the heck that all means, please please do.


**Now...all this talk of cars makes me wonder, what kind of car do you own, SRotD?**

^^Subaru ^^Master ^^Race

--------

Here is what the moderators of /r/cars had to say:

--------

&gt;##1. Tell me about yourself 

&gt;&gt; **/u/mikasaur**: Mikasaur, reddit user for 4 years, 10 months. Came here after I got a bit tired of digg.

&gt;&gt; **/u/verdegrrl**: I'm a gearhead from my first memories. Have worked in the auto industry for many years and have been part of internet mailing lists and forums since the early days.

&gt;##2. How did you find /r/cars?

&gt;&gt; **mikasaur:** I don't really remember. I've always been interested in cars so /r/cars was one of the first subreddits I probably subscribed to. It had ~12k subscribers or so back then. If even.

&gt;&gt; **verdegrrl:** Trolling for a client.

&gt;##3. What is your favorite post?

&gt;&gt; **mikasaur:** My favorite post? I probably don't have one. I have a favorite type of post. I like posts that are about industry news. I love finding out about a new model or new technology. It's even better when there's good discussion in the comments.

&gt;&gt; **verdegrrl:** There are so many great posts. It's impossible to mention a specific one. But I like posts that give insights into how and why certain engineering choices have been made.

&gt;##4. What car(s) do you own?

&gt;&gt; **mikasaur** I own a 1999 BMW M3 Convertible.

&gt;&gt; **verdegrrl**  Do I have to list them all? A gaggle of V6 Alfa Romeos - both rwd and fwd. Some Ferraris, a Maserati, an Audi S4, VW R32, and random other stuff. And yes, we work on most of them.

&gt;##5. What is your IRL connection to cars?

&gt;&gt; **mikasaur**  IRL I'm a member of the BMW Car Club of America. I try to participate in as many autocrosses as I can throughout the season, as well as track days and driving tours. I'm trying to get into LeMons racing as well and help out a local team on occasion.

&gt;&gt; **verdegrrl** We're long time members of the Alfa Club of Southern California. They hold track events and a very affordable driving school. Wonderful people. We also do private track days with various small groups (basically folks who keep their egos in check and are just there to have fun).

&gt;##6. Anything else you'd like to say?

&gt;&gt; **mikasaur** Come check out /r/cars. It's a community that has grown a TON in the past several years. That growth has come with some challenges but we've kept it an entertaining, informative, and civil place.

&gt;&gt; **verdegrrl** /r/cars has a great blend of experienced car experts and new drivers. The challenge is to not stifle input while encouraging a wide range of expression.

So come and check it out :)

1nabp4,0,2013-09-27,"[FR] + Question on how to move forward on an HB8 I met at a bar, who happens to work at the same advertising agency as me.",[deleted],seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1nabp4/fr_question_on_how_to_move_forward_on_an_hb8_i/,"I'm a creative intern at one of the best advertising agencies in my city. One day I had nothing to do and was directed to help create some concepts for an employee birthday post that would go on Facebook in the next few days.

I was given the employee's name. She was an HB8 with a nerdy side. Big Star Wars and Harry Potter fan which to me made her even hotter (I have a thing for unconventional women). Surprisingly youthful (everyone at this agency is 30+). I created an awesome concept and it was a hit with her and everyone who saw the post. The agency's big enough that I never see her in person, never had, and no one cares enough to tell someone ""yea the intern thought of that, go thank him."" But whatever, I just thought she was cute and was done with it. 

Until last night.

There was a networking event by my city's advertising organization for young professionals being held at a local bar. I attended. Surprisingly, so did she. I was working the room pretty damn well, mainly networking with important job prospects and what not. Even won a raffle for a free dinner at any restaurant in town, $100 max (possible date idea if my advances succeed).

Initially, I didn't think much of seeing her as I had bigger fish to fry (networking wise). Plus it looked like she was with some other dude. The bar had cleared out and I was still there, having drinks at the bar with one of the main speakers of the event, whom I had just met. I looked up, and there she was, also at the bar, with that same dude and one more. 

She was in the middle of them, ass sticking out as she leaned against the bar. The event speaker I was drinking with looked over and made that ""DAYUM"" face. Her body language suggested she wasn't romantically involved with either dude she was with. I kept chatting with the speaker for networking purposes (important guy in my field), another dude by the bar was drawn into our convo, and before I knew it I had a set of two men in front of me, with HB8 in my direct view. 

I look over and made direct, extremely intimate, eye contact with HB8. In fact, she was the one looking at me. As her friend was talking to her she was looking straight past him into my eyes. Having just got out of a long term relationship, I'm still just getting back out there. But I'm seasoned enough to know in these situations, being the one to break eye contact is out of the question. I stared firmly back until she broke eye contact, in the most coy and flirty way I've seen a girl do a long time.

I knew I had to go for it. My challenge was how to excuse myself from the speaker in front of me, without potentially burning that bridge. It wasn't as if she was alone. I knew I would have to open the entire set, and it would look kind of fucked up if I left the speaker for another group. Also, I knew I didn't want to bring the speaker with me to open the set. He's a good looking guy, also charismatic, and quite the talker. I didn't want him cockblocking me without even knowing he was doing so.

Next thing I know, ""I need a smoke break."" I said cool, I'm gonna hang around maybe try and talk to that girl. He walked off. And I went for it. I opened the set calmly, smile on my face, in more of a networking mode than anything else. One of the guys immediately walked off. The other, the guy she was with all night, remained. 

I looked her straight in her eyes and said, firmly:

Me: ""Is your name Jane?""


Her: Makes the creeped out face. Just as I wanted. ""Um, Yea."" Chuckles.


Me: ""I feel like I know you."" Waited for her reaction (I love fucking with people idk initially, especially women.)


Her: ""How do you know my name?"" Smiling.


Me: I laugh. ""I'm an intern at (advertising agency). Remember that awesome Star Wars themed birthday photo of you? My idea.""


Her: ""hahaha, are you serious? That was epic."" 


Me: ""Yea, I feel like I know you now since then. haha.  I saw you, wasn't sure if it was you. Had to come by and find out. And finally meet you in person.""

Small talk continued. Turns out, even though she's an employee and I'm an intern in his last semester of school, I'm a year older than her. The speaker left, and shook my hand in approval of my pursuit. Full-force into this set. It was going well, and yet not as well as I like. I'm a control freak, I wanted her all over me by now. Her guy friend was basically quiet for the next 10-15 minutes as we chatted. I was asking the questions, pausing to see if she'd ask any back (IOI me please). Not much luck. And I figured it was because of her friend. So I brought him into the mix. Shifted the convo from her to him. He was only happy to oblige. Turns out they went to middle school together back home. And decided to meet up. Not sure if there's some backstory there between them. But after bringing him into the convo, she became more engaged.

You're probably wondering why I remained in the set with such weak IOIS? Well, beyond eye contact, she would play with her necklace when engaging me, and remember she's unconventional, the type to be more self-aware, so I didn't expect her to be too flirty upfront. But still, there was one other huge indicator. Something she said. 

Me talking to her guy friend: ""Yea, I don't normally go up to people randomly like this. I'm more of an intimate relationships kind of guy. I like to have good positive people in my life and enjoy my time with them. (I said this because I haven't been out in the field in a while and needed a fucking excuse for myself, also, I've seen this thought work on a lot of weird-centric girls. So I was adjusting for her. Or so I tell myself.) 

Guy Friend: ""You did pretty well with us. So you're telling me if this wasn't a networking event and you saw her here alone, you wouldn't approach her?""

I was questioning his angle on this question. Was he trying to make me show my cards, as if to nudge her into thinking I was just there to hit on her?

Me: ""Honestly, probably not. But I'm working on that sort of thing.""


Guy Friend: ""She's really good at it, should've seen her working the room tonight."" 


Her: ""It's kind of in my job description, I have to go up to people. I went up to a ton of people I didn't know tonight.""


Me: ""You didn't come up to me!""


Her: ""I didn't seeeee you!""


Me: ""Oh so now I'm unnoticable?""


Her: Laughs hysterically, Sarcastically, rolling here eyes, says, ""Maybe I saw you and was waiting for you to come up to me."" (obviously referring to our prior staring contest)


Boom.

Before I could come back on that the other guy who had left originally interrupted with his return. Fuck. Adding more penis to the set. 

I chatted a bit longer, and felt I needed to exit the set before they decided to leave before me. So I asked for the guy friend's card. But I didn't want to ask for her number. I didn't know the right way to do that in this dynamic, with all the factors involved. So I asked for her card, as well. Got it. Left.

Her card has only her work info from the agency on it. Work phone number, extension and email. Failure? Maybe-- depends on your definition.

Now my question is, how do I move forward? I was thinking I'd email her Monday out of the blue and say something like ""You should have lunch with the intern today. Heard he's a solid guy."" And wait to see her reply? Should I just call her extension from mine and say that? Should I just call her extension and strike up random conversation, to add to the mystic of the situation? Should I actually go to her department and say hi?! I really want this one, bad. 

Help me out seddit. Give me a solid game plan. Help me become a true Mad Man.

I recently applied to a paid post-grad internship. It wasn't spectacularly paid but the experience would have been really beneficial and the contacts could have led to more steady employment afterwards. And it was an international opportunity so I was excited.

The criteria were quite narrow and I landed an interview. I thought it went well at the time. A few questions didn't spin quite the way I would have liked but overall I felt it was pretty confident.

I got the e-mail that I didn't get it (super sadness ): ) and shot off an e-mail immediately thanking them for taking the time to let me know and that it was a pleasure to meet them. I wished them success with the project. I wanted to send it before I got sad about it because writing those messages when you're weepy or bitter is the WORST.

In the morning I was feeling pretty miserable about it and called my mum. After reading the e-mail to her I realized I wanted to ask why. But not ... in a way that was, like, ""CRAZY CRAZY WHY DIDNT YOU PICK ME"" but in a way that was like ""what do I need to improve on for future hires"". I really wanna make sure I have the right skills for jobs. 

So I sent a second e-mail saying:

&gt;Hi [interviewer]

&gt;Reflecting this morning I realized that I had forgotten to ask if I might make a request when I responded to your kind email last night.

&gt;Being relatively a new grad breaking into the field, I would truly appreciate any additional feedback, if you have a moment to spare. Please do not feel obligated, but if you noticed areas for improvement it will help me immensely in my job search and I would be most grateful.

&gt;Again, all the best to you and your organization with this project.

They didn't respond which left me feeling like I might have done something really wrong. Is it just standard to not respond or was following up a truly stupid idea? I'm fretting. It wasn't my intention to see pushy or aggressive - I just want to ensure I have the right skills for the future and can improve on any weaknesses.

NEED ADVICE,ac519,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1na81k/making_a_siteblog_for_my_parody_twitter_account/,"I just started a Twitter Parody Account recently [Badass Wheelchair Guy](https://twitter.com/BadassChair) - it's basically my jokes, pictures, videos, opinions, links, and thoughts about the life of being a badass in a wheelchair; I have Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and I've been in a wheelchair since I was 12 (i'm 23 now). I've only been doing it for a few weeks, but it's an amazing way for me to express my creativity and passion for disability equality. I only have like 60 followers now, but most of them are other people with disabilities and some really big blogs about disability.

Recently, I've decided to make a website with a blog as well as a store and have been researching all the ways to accomplish that.
I've had an NFL blog for 3 years now (on Wordpress) and I'm a big tech nerd (although still a noob in coding) so the online and social media aspect isn't hard to understand.

I want to sell t-shirts, bumper stickers, phone cases, and posters to start so Zazzle immediately seemed like the best idea. 

I just started an internship that could eventually become a job at a universal design company and I have dozens of ideas for inventions/products that I want to create so some of those ideally might end up on the store.

I'm also planning on eventually selling lanyards and probably bobbleheads and toys and more.

I don't have a website and blog yet, but once that is figured out I'll make the online store. I wanted to do it all on Squarespace, but it turns out you can't do PHP through them which is needed for putting your Zazzle store on a custom domain so I have to look else where.

Okay so where do you all think I should go from here?

Should I look at Shopify and finding a printer or using vistaprint or a service like that?

 Should I just go with a Zazzle store for a few months or a year while I focus on blogging and getting dedicated followers/viewers?

I know the margins for t-shirts and bumper stickers and posters are pretty much nothing so sticking with Zazzle for those is probably the best approach. Don't know how to write this best, but can I mix in my own products to my Zazzle store in my coding? I have no clue if I can make one big store (with my own products) on Zazzle or if I have to make my own store through Shopify when I get my own products to sell (2 online stores- 1 zazzle and 1 shopify)? Keep in mind I have a physical disability so I'd have to have an employee or business partner or service handle inventory and shipping for me.

Thanks for all the help. Sorry for the long wall of text.

TL-DR: Don't know what approach to take with an online store/business I want to create on a website/blog for my Twitter parody account about disability equality that I want to build"

1nejvs,2,2013-09-29,New book on the FTC and the government's overreach in cybersecurity,jsuhr,cybersecurity,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1nejvs/new_book_on_the_ftc_and_the_governments_overreach/,"http://michaeljdaugherty.com/

During college, I took up an internship at an independent book publisher, and this is the book that I had a hand in during the developmental editing process.

The book basically outlines how the FTC will hire third parties to find breaches in a company's cybersecurity, and then proceed to fine them or place them under probationary surveillance, effectively tainting a company's entire reputation.

So all companies, big or small, are in a lose/lose situation with the FTC, with the government winning out every time, either with money or control.

I'm not too sure how the final product turned out, but if it's anything like its developmental drafts, it should be a good read with well-documented facts.

I gain no profit from the book, I just think everyone should know what the government is doing in the realm of cybersecurity."
1nejel,2,2013-09-29,"My experience with job hunting, unemployment, and finances",[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1nejel/my_experience_with_job_hunting_unemployment_and/,"I became unemployed a little over a year ago. I've actively looked for jobs and haven't been successful, yet. I don't have particularly great advice that hasn't been offered but just wanted to vent.

I got my undergraduate degree from a small state university in Business Administration and Non-Profit Management. My GPA started out a little rough, but I graduated with a 3.6 and a few internships under my belt. In hindsight, it seems totally obvious that I should have been job seeking throughout school, but it simply wasn't at the time. I planned on going to law school, anyways, so it wasn't terribly important at the time. My girlfriend (now wife) and I moved to a bigger city where I had a year off before graduate school. I looked everywhere for a job and didn't have any luck at all. It was embarrassing but at least I got into a top 20 law school so I could hang my hat on that.

In law school I lucked out and got a great gig my first summer which was right after the economic collapse. It was a 100 person firm job that paid $35/hr and I was so grateful. I worked my ass off and got a full-time job offer after my second summer. By the time I graduated, my wife was pregnant with our second daughter. After graduation I worked so hard to exceed expectations - and my direct supervisor was beyond happy with my work. I hated the area of law I practiced in but couldn't complain since I was so lucky to have a job, let alone one with benefits and that paid $75,000 a year. Well, my boss, god bless him, assigned me clients who weren't paying (likely because he wasn't getting paid if he did the work and since I was salaried he didn't care). I had absolutely no responsibility for collecting money and I was billing 7.5 hours a day at $200/hr but the firm simply wasn't making money off of me. They were very nice but told me they couldn't support my position anymore. So I was laid off on as good of terms as possible.

I applied to a number of different positions as soon as I was let go. I had one interview with a university and was a finalist for the job but didn't get it. I later found out the guy who got the job was promised it before he even applied. They still had to go through the charade though. I got a few non-lawyer call backs over the next few months and always became a finalist but didn't land anything. After about three months we simply couldn't afford daycare so I began staying home with the kids. My wife makes $40,000 a year (unemployment adds $10,000) and daycare for two kids under 2 years old is about $30,000 a year. We don't qualify for any assistance in my state so it is impossible to do anything other than stay home. For those who don't have young kids I don't expect you to understand, but I can't get ANY work done during the day. I look and apply for jobs in the evenings and weekends. Every interview I get can cost me upwards of $100 in gas, child care, and other expenses which has almost broken us.

Well, I've applied for 241 jobs since being laid off and had 15 interviews. Nothing has worked out. In the non-attorney positions, I've been told that I'm a flight risk, overqualified, and/or don't have enough experience. In EVERY interview, the interviewers have made comments that lawyers make a lot of money so why would I ever consider a position that paid $30,000 a year? For legal jobs, which are incredibly rare, there are often 150-200 applicants for one spot especially for state jobs. As a side note, entry level prosecutors get paid $21/hr where I live. Law firm hiring is almost entirely focused on current law students or associate attorneys currently working with 3-5 years of experience. I would go out on my own but I don't have the ability to pay for daycare. 

Networking is very difficult with kids. Simple things like getting lunch are ridiculously challenging to arrange aside from being expensive. I try to set something up in evenings when I can (when my wife is home), but professionals aren't real big on doing things outside of work hours. I have terrific references including two well known lawyers (a state Supreme Court justice and a high ranking government official) who have amazing things to say about me - along with my former bosses - but haven't been helpful beyond that despite a few requests for assistance. They do go above and beyond when I get an interview, however, and will reach out to the employer. I appreciate that.

I've tried applying to jobs across the board. I'm more than willing to take a job that covers the cost of child care but simply can't afford anything beyond that. 

I was actually recently a finalist for a position with the development branch of my alma mater (non-legal) and had great interviews except for the last one where I was lambasted for not making a donation to the university and told I'd have to make one if I wanted to be considered. I left, humiliated, but still made a donation with money I didn't have. Didn't get the job.

I've tried hard to be a good father, a good person, and not burden my wife with my stress but it's really hard. I've volunteered with a number of non-profits when I had the time and money to do it, I anonymously donated an organ, I've given $1,000's to various organizations, but I just can't seem to catch a break. I've tried all the obvious advice including countless resume reviews and revisions, follow-up calls and emails after applying, connecting with people in my network, etc. but nothing has worked. 

The worst is the embarrassment. You feel like a total loser, especially with an advanced degree. My brothers have subtly acted like I haven't been trying to find anything (living the high life off of my $10,000 a year in unemployment). I've heard over and over about all the different places where a law degree would be valuable with a strong implication that I've too narrowly limited myself. In most interviews there have been comments about my unemployment and ""What have you been doing with all your free time?"" I'm honest, but ""stay-at-home"" dad isn't very attractive to a lot of people. It's also really hard to see articles and associated comments about how lazy the unemployed are. The majority of the population has no sympathy for an unemployed lawyer and I respect that. A lot of people are much worse off than me. ""It's not my problem you decided to have kids you couldn't afford."" My wife making $40,000 a year does hurt at times since we don't qualify for any help at all but it doesn't even pay our bills ($1,200 mortgage, food, her student loans, $200 car payment, etc.). We can't afford health insurance which is rough. I have $135,000 in student loans which is a burden that hurts more than you can imagine. I'm hoping to take advantage of the public service loan forgiveness program if I can manage to get a non-profit job but it's been tough. I also feel like a terrible provider to my family. That's the worst. I know I need to have humility, but I wish I was a better husband and dad. The prospect of losing our house because I can't find a job is so rough.

I'm sorry. I've tried so hard to do everything right and I'm extremely energetic and personable on the the outside (especially in interviews), but on the inside it's horrendous. I've emailed employers after interviewing and losing out on a job and have received nothing but praise. They just had better applicants.

I don't really have a point. I just wish there was more understanding and empathy for job hunters. I don't want sympathy - I'm luckier than a lot of people - but it's hard being treating like I'm some lazy loser dependent on the government teat. If you're in a spot like I am, maybe it will help hearing that you're not alone."
1neicv,8,2013-09-29,"Will probably need to take out some student loans in the coming month, where do I start?",Foofnar,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1neicv/will_probably_need_to_take_out_some_student_loans/,"Wall of text below, just a fair warning. (Skip to 5th paragraph if you don't care about background info).

Background info: I'm 20 years old, in my third year of university (CS major), taking 18 credits this semester and on track to graduate in December 2014 (assuming I fail exactly 0 of my classes in the next 3 semesters). For the past two years of my education, all educational and living expenses were completely paid for through savings my mom gave me, savings from my summer job, and grants from the state and school. Last semester's expenses used up the last of my mom's college savings for me (only had about $10k to start with, but I'm grateful I had it!).

Cut to now. Like I said, taking 18 credits this semester. The remainder of tuition/student fees that was not paid through grants I paid off out of pocket. Currently, my financial situation is that I have enough money in my bank account to pay rent and utilities for next month (due on the first of the month) as well about $100 for groceries and such (I can stretch my grocery money pretty well). Rent and utilities are $740 total per month (it's pricey, I know, I opted to live in a studio alone this semester to avoid roommates after last semester's experiences). I have no debts whatsoever, one credit card which I pay off religiously, no car or insurance, and I don't pay for my health insurance or my cell phone plan.

Currently I'm looking for a CS internship that I can fit around my 18 credit schedule and that pays well enough and offers enough hours to cover my monthly expenses. This job search isn't going too spectacularly right now. I have an internship assessment lined up for tomorrow morning (where they'll gauge how good of a fit I am for the company to narrow down the amount of applicants) but I'm not too confident about it for a few reasons.

**So** seeing as a job likely won't come my way soon enough to pay for rent/utilities on November 1st, I was thinking of taking out a small student loan (somewhere between $1-2k) just to allow me some money for living for the next month(s) while I search for a job that will fit my needs. The problem is, I have never done this before. Where do I start? Do I go with a federal loan or do I use a private lender? Do I do subsidized or unsubsidized (I heard one of these was a big no-no when it comes to student loans, but I can't remember which!)? I don't know what my credit is so far (I have had a Discover card (Cashback bonus, not a student card I think?) since October 2012 which has had its credit limit bumped up twice, bringing it up from $900 to $1300 a month. Also lived for 10 months in another apartment complex last year, all rent payments on time and paid gas separately through Xcel always on time) so I don't know how that will affect things. There is NO chance for a co-sign on the loan, before anyone asks. I won't go into details but just know that I will be taking this loan out completely on my own.

I guess that's all the text I'll throw at ya for now. Hopefully I provided enough information for anyone that's willing to help. Thanks for reading and thanks in advance for any advice!

**TL;DR: What all do I need to know before going and taking out a student loan of about $1-2k?**

From the time I started on this journey up until this day, it appears that the wisdom of the ages is that success only comes to the CS folk who do lots of projects in their free time.

I am in my senior year of college for my BS in CS and I have only done a handful of projects at home for myself - things that are REALLY small/meaningless. I haven't tried to make any large or engaging project because I have never really had the inspiration. Likewise, I haven't hopped on any open source projects because nothing has really caught my eye.

However, I genuinely enjoy programming when I do do it for assignments and will often not stop working until a particular feature/project works. I also really enjoy the history and study of programming concepts that we have learned in the classes I have taken thus far.

I know that the industry is vastly different than that of the course work you see in school, and even though I feel like I made the right choice about this degree path, I still find myself trying to convince myself that I truly did make the right choice. Things I see on forums, things I hear from other developers etc...It makes it sound like the industry is cut throat, only the strong survive and green eared undergrads like myself have no chance of survival.

At the moment I am trying to grab myself an internship because I feel that having experience working somewhere will hopefully maybe make up for my lack of project portfolio outside of school. I know I am smart, I know I can learn fast, I often look at other students code (ones who spend their entire free time working on projects) and I am underwhelmed by the tricks and knowledge they use - stuff that anyone could look up on stack overflow.

I would really love to hear about anyone else who was maybe in a situation similar to mine and still managed to succeed - maybe you didn't have a huge portfolio but were just an amazing hard working individual.

1neg3o,3,2013-09-29,Oddly vivid dream,commonCentss,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1neg3o/oddly_vivid_dream/,"Last night I had the oddest nightmare.  It was so vivid that it has been burned into my mind since I awoke.  It started out as being a passenger on a small airplane possibly a Cessna.  There were only two people on this flight, the pilot and I.  While on this flight I took a nap, only to wake up to see that the pilot was gone.  When I realized the pilot was gone I began to freak.  In the last couple of seconds I remember seeing the plane flying into an overpass.  At the moment when the plane struck the concrete pylons and the plane continued on, the plane was virtually indestructible.

The month of September has been a real shitty one for me.  I’ve been stressed about school, particularly in my Accounting class.  I’ve been struggling to keep up with work, and just got let go yesterday night after the shift was over.  On the bright side, I have recently asked for an internship in IT working with the company that my father is currently with.  This internship should be a sure bet, but I have been nervous about it lately.  What do you think reddit?

1neea7,26,2013-09-29,I would like for someone who's pro-Obamacare to come in here and answer a few questions I have.,stiffy2005,Libertarian,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/1neea7/i_would_like_for_someone_whos_proobamacare_to/,"Hello, /r/libertarian. Thank you for being one of the few places that won’t downvote this post into oblivion. I am hoping that a proponent of Obamacare can honestly answer the questions I’ve come up with. Perhaps by doing so, libertarians can gain more insight into the rationale behind this law. 

My philosophy: My flair says pragmatist, which about sums it up. Unlike some people of libertarian or right-wing persuasion, I don’t consider myself to be down-the-line anti-government. I believe that policies should be analyzed one-by-one and the best course of action should be pursued. This does not put me at immediate odds with Democrats or even Obamacare. I do identify as a libertarian, though, since I believe that more often than not, one-by-one policy analyses lead to the conclusion that a more hands-off approach to whatever policy in question is the best way to go. 

With that said, can someone please answer the questions found below and explain how Obamacare will benefit myself or society as a whole? 

I’m a graduate student, 26 years old, married, no children. I quit my job (and by extension lost my group health insurance coverage) last year to go back to school, and upon doing so, purchased an individual insurance policy for $54 per month. The rates have since gone to $86 per month because I went into a higher age bracket. I am healthy and have no recurring need for medical care. I haven’t been to a doctor for at least three years. The only reason I have insurance at all is in the off chance that I get cancer or some other horrible disease, my assets will be protected. My plan has a $3,500 deductible with no up-front benefits, which means that I have to pay for everything until I reach $3,500 within a calendar year. I prefer it this way, since this makes the plan affordable and covers me for what I’m concerned about: A catastrophic illness. 

My insurance company just told me that I cannot keep this plan. I will have to switch to something that offers “more benefits.” The most affordable plan they offer will be $188 per month. 

I don’t want more benefits.  **Why am I being forced to purchase something with more benefits that will cost me more and make me worse off?** 

I can’t think of any other consumer product where this is in line with mainstream American thought, irrespective of political philosophy. We all agree that products at different price points and levels of quality make sense. A couple dining out can spend $10 on a meal, $500, or anywhere in between. As Americans, we like and want these choices. Right? 

I have read a lot of news stories that said many young people will be better off because they will get better coverage while paying less out of pocket because of the subsidies. What young people are we talking about here? I went to a subsidy calculator and put in $40,000 as an estimate of income for my wife and I. This was my guess as to how much we will earn this year working part-time jobs and internships. We are not eligible for subsidies. 

According to the calculator at the Henry J. Kaiser Foundation, the $40,000 we will make as students is 258% of the poverty line. We are not eligible for a subsidy on the health insurance I’m going to need to buy. **Are people who only earn $20,000 per year really so well off that they should be forced to pay for all of these “better benefits” under Obamacare? Benefits that they will never use?**

At this point, I have to decide if I want to buy a plan with “more benefits,” that I don’t want, or go without coverage. I’ve been told that if I go without insurance, it’s OK since insurance companies can no longer “discriminate” against me for having pre-existing conditions and that the tax penalty is only $95 or 1% of my income.

OK, but what if I get in a traumatic car wreck? The ambulance comes to pick me up, I’m barely conscious, and I incur $30,000 in hospital bills as I’m stitched back up and my broken bones are mended. This is the health event I’m most worried about. 

My knowledge of insurance is that you can’t enroll in coverage until the start of the next month. My $30,000 hospital bill happened when I didn’t have coverage. Insurance companies can’t turn me away for my pre-existing conditions, but I don’t think they have to pay for medical expenses that were incurred before you ever enrolled do they?

I guess if I got cancer or some other disease, I would have time to get a policy in place before I needed the medical treatment. But that’s not very likely at my age, is it? I’m more likely to get into a traumatic car accident.

So we’re back to square one. I have to take this risk, or have less money for other things, such as spending on consumer goods at a time when our economy desperately needs it.  

Supposedly Obamacare provides for exchanges, where I can shop for policies side-by-side, comparing benefits and premiums. I was doing this for years through a website called eHealthInsurance.com. **What’s wrong with the solution the free-market has already provided?**

People under 65 with pre-existing conditions had lots of options under the old system, although now they have one more. Their choices before were group coverage, Medicaid for the poor, or “High-risk Insurance” offered by many states. The problem with the old system was that high risk plans were really expensive. As with many things in life, people with individual incomes of $30,000 - $100,000 really had it the worst, since they weren’t eligible for Medicaid, but the expensive high-risk insurance really took up a lot of their income. Now these people can enroll in individual health insurance policies without being denied, but the plans are more expensive since they’re required to have more benefits. 

**Why has Obamacare left a hole in the only group that really needed help?** I’m talking about sick people under 65 in the individual income range of $30-100K who don’t have group coverage. 

Now that we’re thinking about it, were there really so many people in that income range that didn’t have access to an employer plan? Self-employed, business owners, and the like? It seems like when you really think about the holes in our old system, you find a group of people who can’t get coverage to be a really tiny minority. **Shouldn’t this have been solved with a small reform instead of a massive overhaul of our entire system? **

But there was a fundamental flaw with our entire system, wasn’t there? Was that really insurance companies turning away sick people who tried to buy individual policies? I don’t think it was, since people over 65 (the people who have the most health problems) already had access to a fully governmental health care system called Medicare, people under 65 who were sick and poor had Medicaid, and all of the other sick people had group coverage or high-risk coverage. So that’s not the problem, is it? 

**Isn’t the problem costs?** Providers of health care are charging a lot of money. **Why doesn’t Obamacare focus on reforming increasing costs instead of “increasing access”?**

Never mind, I think I know: Slowing the growth of health care costs isn’t as sensational and doesn’t feel as good, does it? 

To conclude, we’ve looked at whether or not there was really that big of a hole when it came to “access” to health insurance. A lot of critics of the access argument pointed out that a lot of the people who didn’t have coverage were either eligible and didn’t bother to enroll, or were just young idiots who didn’t care. I still haven’t seen anything compelling that leads me to believe otherwise. 

So who is Obamacare helping? It hasn’t helped me. I’m going to be much worse off next year. I’ll need to either take my chances and go without, or pay about $100 more per month for insurance. But I’m willing to make a sacrifice like this if more people benefit. But I’m not seeing it. It seems like I’m worse off and nobody I can think of is better off. **So who’s better off?** "

1ndx6i,0,2013-09-29,In need of dire advice. USMLE step 2 soon and feeling over stressed,[deleted],medicine,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1ndx6i/in_need_of_dire_advice_usmle_step_2_soon_and/,"This might be a bit long but I honestly have no where else to seek help. It's a bit of a rant.

A bit about myself. I'm a 27yo, graduated medical school 2 years ago, finished my intern year and worked at a diabetes and endocrine center for a while as a GP. Next year hopefully I'll enter a residency program AND apply for matching (I'm not done with my steps yet).

My problem is I was forced to enter medicine by my parents. I managed to pass medical school but....I don't really enjoy it. Right now I'm 10 days away from my step 2 exam and I don't feel competent at all. I think I'm going to postpone again..... I feel my core (knowledge) is weak and I'm trying to improve it but I feel worn out. I hate this feeling of being lost and weak. Where's my energy, my enthusiasm?

I've been studying for a while and really want to get a high score to improve my chances but I feel out of energy. This lack of energy is mostly due to stress and family problems along with other things.

Right now, after all these years I don't see myself changing profession. Some people suggested going academic but I enjoy the hospital setting way more. I'm all for the working and studying, I feel learning through practice is the best method for me plus I enjoy it more with all the interacting. I wanted to enter something computer related but it's too late.

Well this rant is as messed up as my head right now! What am I asking? Well similar stories and how people managed would be great. Also pre USMLE step 2 advice, I'm sure people are never 100% ready when they enter and there's always more to read in this ever expanding sea of knowledge. I think I'll postpone but this will be the last time, next time I'm entering ready or not.

Thank you.

1ndwln,2,2013-09-29,[22 M] dealing with my girlfriend's [21 F] time abroad.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ndwln/22_m_dealing_with_my_girlfriends_21_f_time_abroad/,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for four years. It has been filled with love, anger, frustration: anything and everything a normal relationship can see.

She has been good to me, for the most part. I have tried to be good to her. We are happy but now begins the problem.

She and I trekked through Europe for a month. Then she started an internship in Ireland that will last for six weeks. It has been three days and I am going crazy.

Doubts and fears fill my mind. Just last night, she messaged me and said she had gone dancing. Of course, being in Dublin, she is drinking everyday with people around her age. I can't help but think of the worst. It does not help that, a month or so before we left, she had begun to cry and told me that she did not ""trust herself"".

r/relationships, I need help. I need advice with my issue, a reality check, maybe a few stories from people who are/were in similar situations. 

**tl;dr**: Girlfriend is abroad, I'm not sure how to handle it."
1ndv4o,0,2013-09-29,Why did I bother being a STEM major if it is next to impossible to find a job?,I_eat_your_butt,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1ndv4o/why_did_i_bother_being_a_stem_major_if_it_is_next/,"I will graduate in spring of 2014 with a B.E. in Mechanical engineering (with a gpa somewhere between 3.0-3.2 likely... I have a 3.09 now). I have one prior internship at a manufacturing firm (that I do not want to return to) and research experience this past summer at my school. 

I go to what is a pretty good school in the North Eastern United States, but it seems that every job I apply to for full time entry level I get turned away from...

I went for an engineering degree with the promise of doing stuff I would like (I like mechanical design, medical devices, manufacturing, science, math, etc. etc.) with the promise of job opportunities and great salaries.

I've applied nonstop since January (for part time jobs, since August I have applied to full time for when I graduate) and I NEVER hear anything back.

I've been told a million times ""oh the economy was bad dontcha know? It's getting much better though! Soon things will be back to the way they were and it'll be easier to find jobs!""

No, I think the previous generation fucked everything up and is too greedy to let go of their jobs and retire already... they don't want to accept that they fucked the economy and are instead passing the poverty onto their children."
1nduo7,568,2013-09-29,What happened with Hamber you ask?,[deleted],fatpeoplestories,https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1nduo7/what_happened_with_hamber_you_ask/,"What’s up you little piggies? So, a few of you landwhales have been asking what happened with Hamber (link to the removed story in comments)…oh, you want to know, do ya? I guess I’ve got some time before I go off to brunch to cure this hangover. Lick your lips, cause shit’s about to get salty.


So when we left off, Hamber was running out of the office we shared and I was left there with a mouth full of carrots trying not to laugh.  The trying part didn’t really work out too well, and some orange bits came flying out.  Fuck it, people come in every night to clean these offices, so those little bits are just job security in my opinion.  So after I’m done chewing and shit, I get back to work. 15 minutes later, my phone rings.


“This is Paul_el.”


“Hey, Paul, this is HR Dude.  Can you come down to my office?”


“Yeah man, no doubt.  I’ll be there in a couple of minutes.”


As I’m walking down the hallway to go see HR Dude, my mind starts racing about how I’m going to defend myself.  I’ve known this office rhino for less than 24 hours, and I’m already assuming she’s going to say I accosted her with carrots or some stupid shit like that.  Fuck her. Then I have one of those eureka moments.  I got it!


“Have a seat, Paul.  So I guess you already know what this is about.”


“Not really.”


“When you left my office before, did you run to the fridge, get some carrots and hummus and shove them into your mouth while looking at Hamber?”


“No.”


“So you didn’t eat any carrots in front of Hamber?”


I’m in HR defending my healthy eating habits.  This is my life.


“No, that parts true, but there was no hummus on any of ‘em.”


HR Dude sighs.  “So how are we going to handle this?”


“I’m not sure what you mean.”


“Well you two obviously can’t work near each other.”


“I don’t think that’s true. I can work with anyone.  It’s just a matter of sticking to work related business when necessary.” 


“Well I appreciate hearing that, but Paul, you and I both know this won’t be our last meeting if you stay in that office.”


“I understand where you’re coming from HR Dude, but you realize the only reason I’m here in the first place is because I choose to eat healthy, right?”


HR Dude tries to hold back a smile.  “Listen Paul, I know this is funny to you, but it’s a pain in the ass to me.”


“I totally get that, HR Dude, but honestly, if I went out and bought McNuggets, we both know I wouldn’t be sitting here.”


“So what are we going to do?”


“Start eating unhealthy?”


HR Dude’s smile comes out. “Paul, seriously.”


“I’m being serious! What do you want me to say here, man?! Help me help you!”


The guy’s chuckling. “Jesus…”


I look over at the clock on his wall.  “Listen HR Dude, I don’t mean to cut this short, but I have a conference call in 15 minutes with (Client) regarding the project I was actually hired for.  This is some pretty important stuff and I’d like to review my notes before jumping in on the call.”


“Okay man. Get outta here.”


“Okay, let me know how you want to proceed with this and I’ll accommodate anyway I can.  But seriously, if I have to start eating fast food, I’m gonna break out.”


“GO!”  We’re both smiling as I leave the office and my awesome defense didn’t even need to be brought out. 
I get back to my office and Hamber’s sitting at her desk.  I walk ~~past~~ around her and get to mine and take out my notes.  

“Why’d yuh do that?”


I don’t even look up. “What?”


“Eat those carruts like that in frunt uh meh.”


“Listen, Hamber, I’ve got an important call with (Client) in like 10 minutes, I don’t have time for this right now.  When I’m done, I’d be than happy to discuss my healthy eating habits with you. Now please…”


The coming shit storm would be justified if I threw a piece of shit at her, spit on her, or even took away her candy bar.  If anyone would have walked past that minute, they wouldn’t know what the fuck just happened.  “HAY! WUR TALKIN ABUT IT NAW!”


I still don’t look up.  “I don’t know if you heard me or not, but I have a call I need to get ready for. I’m at work and I am working. Now please control yourself.”


Oh no. Ohhhh no.  I should’ve known better than tell a woman of this stature to calm  down.  “WHUT DID YA SAY!?!?!”


She proceeds to get up, waddle over to my desk, rip my notes off, and throw them to the floor. Not drop, throw. Oh bitch. You just don’t know when to stop.  “Pick those up right now.”


“NAW! YUH OWE ME A APOLUHGEE, ASSHOLE!!”


“No I don’t, but what you need to do is pick those up right now and I need to prepare.”


“SAY YUH SORRY!”


“You are embarrassing yourself, look at the way you’re behaving.  You’ve got a better chance of making a slam dunk in the NBA finals than getting an apology out of me.” I see where this is going, so I relent; I pick up my notes and try to get back to studying, even with this she-beast breathing her hot fumes down my back.  See, work is work and it’s one of the only things I take seriously.  I’m good at what I do, and this is an awesome project to be working on and it’s one of those assignments that could result in some ridiculous opportunities if I impress the right people.  This bitch just won’t let it go though.


“NUH APOLUHGIZE!”


I raise my voice for the first time with this urban manatee. “HAMBER! YOU NEED TO LET ME WORK! IF NOT FOR ME, THAN FOR THE GOOD OF THIS AGENCY.  I WAS BROUGHT IN SPECIALY BECAUSE I HAVE A HISTORY AND REPORE WITH THIS CLIENT AND THEY ARE USED TO GETTING GOOD WORK FROM ME. YOU WILL NOT COMPROMISE MY WORK OR MY REPUTATION.”  No one has spoken to her like that since the first time her mom said she couldn’t have candy with dinner, except unlike mommy, I don’t back down when it counts.  She goes back to her desk and I go back to studying, but I can’t concentrate now. It’s rare I raise my voice and get into heated confrontations.  If you’ve been reading my posts, you know I just don’t give a shit but I sure as hell don’t take shit either.  For the most part, I’m laid back.  I don’t argue, I just know how to put people in their place.  


It’s at the point where I’m so flustered I’m actually nervous getting in on this call.  Fuck you fatty. My mind is all over the place.  My alarm is going off, time to dial in on the conference line. Fuck. 


The call lasts about 45 minutes and the last words I heard were “Awesome ideas, Paul, we can’t wait to see what you and the graphic designers mock up.”  Phew. Your boy came through.  I remember actually letting out a sigh of relief when I hung up the phone. 


Not a second later. “Yuh ready tuh apoluhgize?”


“Oh, did you win us the championship with that dunk?”


She was staring at me the entire time while I was on that call.  Not taking notes. (Not that she would need to, she’s not working on the same account. Thank Christ.) Not working. Not even snacking.  Not. Even. Snacking.


“Yuh owe muh an apoluhgee.”


I finally look at her “No I don’t. I’ve been here for less than two full days and I’ve done nothing that warrants an apology. Listen, it’s obvious healthy eating habits offend you, and for that, I’m sorry, because I think that’s sad, but like I said Hamber, you will not get an apology out of me.  However, you definitely owe me one, but unlike you, I’m not naïve enough to think I’m actually going to get one, and I can get past that.  So I’m getting back to work.  You know, the reason why I’m here.”


“Yuhr an asshole.” 


“So I’ve heard.”


“Say yuhr sorry.”


Whoa. “Listen, Hamber, you don’t tell me what to do. Ever. You will not dictate what I say or what I do. You have no authority over me at this agency. You are not my boss or my supervisor, just another coworker.  Now, why don’t you get back to work, you know, what you’re here to do, too.”


At that, she gets up and walks out.  It’s not lunchtime.  Wonder where she’s going? A few minutes later my phone rings. “I’m on my way.”


This is my second day at this agency and I’ve been in the HR Office 3 times.  I’ve gotta be some fucking record breaker. I walk in, see Hamber sitting in a chair and look over at HR Dude.  He looks pissed.  I gotta take this seriously.  


Yeah fucking right.


“How are we going to resolve this?”


“He needs tuh apologize.” They both look at me.


“I told you already, Hamber, I’ve done nothing that warrants an apology.”


“Nuh, you said  uh’ve got a betta chance making a slam dunk in the NBA finals then getting an apology from you.”


“Well I said that too, but again, I also said I’ve done nothing that warrants an apology.”


She looks at HR Dude.  “SEE!!! FAT SHAMING! HE DOESN’T LIKE ME BECAUSE UHM FAT!!!”


God, to hear a fat person actually use the words “fat shaming”…it was magic.


“Fat shaming? I simply said that because she’s a woman and women don’t play in the NBA, if I said WNBA, that’d be a different story. You on the other hand definitely owe me an apology.”


HR Dude looks puzzled.  Hamber looks like she realized she didn’t think shit through.  


“What do you mean, Paul?”


“Well, you know that after I left here I went to study my notes for that (Client) call.  She wouldn’t let me.  She was demanding I apologize and when I wouldn’t she walked over to my desk, picked up my notes, and then threw them to the ground while still demanding I say sorry.”


HR Dude’s eyes widen. He looks at her. “Explain.”


“But..he..no, he owes me an apolugee!!”


“Oh, I forgot to mention she called me an asshole, too.”


“Is all this true?”


“NUH-UH!! He’s lying!!”


HR Dude’s attention focuses to me and looks like he wants an answer.  “Listen, HR Dude, as far as I’m concerned, she’s lost all credibility when she said I had hummus on my carrots this morning when there clearly wasn’t any.  She simply can’t get her facts straight.”


“STUHP IT!”


“Okay, you two can’t work in the same office anymore. I know what I’m going to do.” 


Now, the resulting outcome of this has cemented HR Dude a spot in my heart forever.  This dude could call me up at 5am on a Sunday morning looking for bail and I’d have him.  This dude is the shit. 


“Paul, we have a private office that we were saving for a position we’re looking to fill.  Based on your qualifications and your previous work, it’s obvious you can fill that role as well and we’ll just disperse that work among you and the other guys, it’s nothing crazy. The office is yours.”  I almost started jerking off when he said that. 


“WHUT?!?!? TIM’S OLD OFFICE!?!?!? I SHUD GET THAT!!!  HE’S THA JERK!”


“You see what I’ve been dealing with?”


“No, it’s Paul’s. And he’s right, you do owe him and apology. You compromised a very important phone call with a new client.  I’m shocked that you could be so petty. Plus this childish name calling, it’s all unnecessary.” Fuck yeah HR Dude.  I’m buying you a beer.  


I look over at her and smile.  My mouth starts watering. Let me here it bitch.  Tell daddy you’re sorry.


She looks down in defeat.  She knows she’s been beaten. I run this motherfucker.


“Uhm sorry.”  


Everything inside me was screaming “TELL HER TO SPEAK UP! TELL HER YOU COULDN’T HEAR HER!!! DO IT YOU FUCKING PUSSY!! OWN HER!!!!” but I’m sorry to say, I let the lying dog lie.   All I said was “Thank you.”  It makes me sick just thinking about it.  I’m fucking worthless.


“But what about that work you said you’ll be dispersing? The last thing I want to do is make more work for other people. That’s not what I’m about.”


“Don’t worry about it, Paul, you guys are actually already handling it.  That position has been vacant for a couple of months now. Bringing you on lightened the load for everyone and it’s been going well.”  Looks like my freelance gig just got upgraded to a fulltime spot while still on a freelancer’s pay scale. God damn right healthy eating habits pay off.


At that, HR Dude called over his intern and dismissed me.  He told him to show me my new office.  That’s right, my new office. We walk back to that hovel I had to share with Hamber and collect my things.  Then we go to my new office.  My. New. Office.  God damn that sounds hot.


Holy. Fuck.  This shit is insane. Surround sound. 27” computer screen. Projector. All the presentation planning tools an ad guy could ever want. Enough gadgets to make a tech guys pants tight.  Mine. All mine.  A couple of guys I had lunch with the day before are looking confused, so they come in.  I explain what happened.  Fist bumps were shared.  Lunch that day was on me.


The best part? Hamber has to walk past my new office every time she goes to the bathroom or kitchen.  I heard her request to bring in a mini fridge into her office was denied on Thursday.  


You’re god damn right I keep my door open.

1ndsjr,6,2013-09-29,Me [24F] with my long distance boyfriend [25 M] of almost 2 years (in November) finally discussing an end date to our Canada-US situation. Can't meet in the middle.,danslacorbeille,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ndsjr/me_24f_with_my_long_distance_boyfriend_25_m_of/,"The other day, my boyfriend and I re-entered the discussion about when we mgiht be able to see an end date to all this. He will be 26 in November, I will be 25 in January. We met while I was in his country for 3 months, became friends, and started dating before I moved home. We continued our relationship. Now here we are. I have graduated university (December 2012), and he is working a full-time paid internship (contract up in March 2014), and I am doing temporary work in my hometown.

Basically I feel like we are at a bit of an impasse. He is not ready to get married (or talk about it, apparently), though he does see himself getting married to me one day. The issue is, our options for me moving to him are slim without marriage. We have discussed 4 options vaguely. He is dead-set on me going to school there, thoguh. I already have a BA.

----------------

2. My boyfriend wants me to go to school there. The problem is, it is 10k for tuition a year (for a diploma), and you have to have 10k of disposable income on top of tuition to be considered for a Student Visa.

2. I move there and don't work while we live together for 1 year to get common-law status. Part of me says, ""Well, it's just a year. If it's meant to be, it will work out!"" 

3. Get married.

4. Go over as a skilled worker.

------------------------

Obviously #3 is the quickest option. I am not ready to get married right now, but I feel like it should be on the table for discussion. I could TRY to go over as a skilled worker, but I only know how to speak French, and I have office experience. That's it. You also have to have 11k to support yourself, **and it can't be borrowed.** My boyfriend is deadset on me going to school there, though. I am almost 25. I don't want to go to a 2 year program that might not even be something I want to do. 

**My boyfriend has about 15k in savings.** He wants to use this for school for me. I think this is a dumb idea. I think that 15k can be used elsewhere, and once I have permenant residence, we can discuss school for me. It is just so expensive as an international student.

**On the other hand,** boyfriend says, ""I don't know if I can do 2-3 more years of long distance."" But he also says, ""The option of it not working out is basically not a topic of conversation."" (Paraphrase. He probably said it nicer than that.) I feel like he is just kind of *hoping* the school thing will work out, but he doesn't really understand the Canadian Immigration process. He doesn't understand how much it costs, how much time it takes, etc. I am just ready to get the ball rolling on this discussion but I feel like my boyfriend is putting all his eggs in one basket with the school thing. I wonder if I am the only one who is looking at all the options available to us, and I feel like that's almost more of a gamble than us simply getting married, and a money suck, when that 15k could go toward anything else!

I am not the type to want a huge fancy wedding. We could go to the courthouse for all I care. What I (we?) want is to be together, we just have different ideas on how to achieve that. I guess my opinion is, if you don't want to consider it ever ending, why is marriage so scary right now or in the near-ish future? I definitely don't want to end it, **so if that's your advice, I'm sorry.** I just want some insight on how to approach this, and I guess I would like someone to tell me I am not insane.

My family is fully supportive of me in what I decide to do. They desperately want us to get married. (I want that too, but not until I'm 26 or so?) The only reason their opinion matters is because I want them to be on our side, no matter what we decide to do. And they are.

---

**tl;dr**: I feel like my boyfriend and I are not able to flesh out an idea for an end date. Boyfriend not ready to discuss marriage but is okay with me studying in his country or moving there to work. The problem is this costs money. My boyfriend has over 15k in savings, wants to use it to pay for 1 year of a diploma program for me in his country to ""solve"" the distance issue.

**EDIT**: And yes, I know about /r/longdistance and have used it in the past for advice. But I figured I would try the /r/relationships sub as well."

Does anyone have any experience with working at an agency in Brazil, or know what I should expect? Any tips for living out there on my own for seven weeks? Any social areas which you'd recommend visiting OR avoiding?

 I'm a little overwhelmed and feel a bit out of my comfort zone by doing this, but this is a once in a lifetime opportunity that I definitely can't pass up!

1ndk9f,5,2013-09-29,"Not happy with current job, got a job offer for a very similar situation. Cant decide.",beGren,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1ndk9f/not_happy_with_current_job_got_a_job_offer_for_a/,"**My current job** is for a small architecture firm working with my college classmate and her father. It is my first professional job. I've been with them for about 3 months. When I initially accepted the position I had other job offers but chose this one because it would be a small and intimate setting in which I could get a good variety of of tasks and experience; unlike the others in which pigeon holing is more common. Everything was great for the first few weeks and then the honeymoon ended. My boss started being highly critical of my work, nit-picking small mistakes I could not possibly have know to do correctly this early. I understand that imperfections cost him money so I stepped up my game and started focusing on taking my time to follow his given examples and get things right. That is about the time he became critical about how slowly I was getting work done. I threw it in to turbo and worked as quickly and correctly as I possibly could. It still has not been enough for him. About a month  of being chewed out for constantly making mistakes I realized he was taking out the stress of being the busiest his firm has been in 30 years out on me. So I let it slide for about another month until I woke up in the mornings dreading the day to come, hating mondays, and taking bathroom breaks so I wouldnt be seen holding back tears of frustration. Comments he would make range from, ""I am embarrassed  that we sent your drawings out.."" ""Lets go through this painful list of mistakes..."" ""Are you inventing things?"" ""You can't keep doing this, or it's just not going to work out"" The last one in particular made me feel like at any point in time I could be fired and I felt like more of a temp than someone who was making a career there. He does not treat his daughter this way, and she doesnt take his shit if he starts in on her. Then everything got really confusing. One day my coworker took the afternoon off and it was just my boss and I working. We had a nice afternoon and I actually stayed about 40 minutes extra just to chat with him. At this time he apologized to be for being short with me and said it was just because we were busy and how stressed he was from the client pressure. He even went so far as to tell me if I wanted to ""go work at one of those big corporate firms"" he would do what ever he could to help me out. (which I think was supposed to sound nice) From this point I thought, He knows he is doing it, It *is* because we are busy, it will end. The next two weeks Nothing changed. Although I am responsible for the work I do, I am not and architect (yet) and I dont know everything about buildings. I would come into his office to ask questions and he made comments like, ""what did you do in school the last five years, dont you know blah blah blah."" No one likes to feel like and idiot, so I stopped wanting to ask him questions and I wold cringe at the sound of his chair becoming empty to come check my progress. He would stand over my shoulder and watch me work and correct my process to be more like his.  

So this is the major reason I want to change jobs.  But in addition, I am not getting Health or Dental, no Retirement plan, I make about 16 and hour but I am on salary (just below average for this type of position). No overtime pay, but he supposedly does bonuses twice a year that are based on any overtime work.  We are using old software from 2004. And last but not least, I like to be in a social environment and it’s just the three of us.  

**The Job Offer** So I was just browsing some for hire ads and found an ad for an intern architect to which I replied. I was promptly offered and interview and went in this past Friday during my lunch to meet with them. They do a very similar project style to what I am doing now, but with newer software. This firm all around seemed to be more put together. But still small, including me the staff would be 4.  I was offered the position. I would receive a pay increase of about 80 cents per hour and a couple more days vacation after a year. Still no benefits or 401k.  I only met the president of the firm since the employees were out to lunch, but he seemed nice. 

The worst part about this whole thing is that after I secured the interview, everything at my current job got a little better. We finished a lot of the work that was stressing out my boss and he seemed to be more interested helping me learn.  Neither My boss nor his daughter knew I had the interview. Plus just knowing that I can get something else changed my psyche. 

**Dilemma** So the only real differences are a slight pay increase, newer software, and the possibility of a more understanding boss. I don’t want to quit right before things get better but I can’t tell if things are really going to change. When it gets down to it, I was really hoping for health insurance and other benefits and  I wont get that at either place.  I know I will be looking for a new job again sooner than later I suspect. Should I continue my job search and bide my time until I can find a job I truly want or Should I take this Job offer?

I have an accounting career fair at my school coming up Thursday, EY, PwC and a bunch of regional firms. 
I am a transfer student to my school, I am a junior, should be senior but due to transfering credits I am a junior. I have a good GPA but my problem is my skills suck. I am vastly underprepared for any accounting related job. Should I fake it til I make it? My plan is to bullshit and after securing an internship for the summer, spend my winter break and any other free time learning Excel, Access, and the like. Advice? I do have previous internship experience at a government contractor.

Do interviewers still ask the what is your greatest weakness question? what is the best answer to that, or at least the best angle to answer it from?

What are the best questions to ask recruiters. I have read up on it but have gotten varying answers. I do not want to be to specific as I am told. I am thinking of asking the following: What are the responsibilities of an intern, (after researching) What, if any, social/volunteer programs do they have, what a typical day is like, what they learned from their internships? 

How long should my conversations be? 


Any other tips would be fucking amazing. Thanks guys/girls. "

I'm studying to become a journalist, and lately I've been doing my internship, and been getting comments on articles.
 
As I'm reading the comments I get on my own writing, and also those comments I read on other people's articles, I realize this a lot: sarcasm is really lost on some people. There might be a sentence I put in as maybe a joke, or something that did not need to be taken seriously, and they did. I might have put in a picture that was really a bad attempt at propaganda (from the politician who made the picture), exactly for the reason to show how lame the propaganda is, and the commenter says I'm just part of the propaganda itself.

And I've been thinking: whose fault is it that sarcasm is lost? Is it the people who don't understand it? Should they become more aware of the facts and context, and realize that it should not have been taken seriously? Or is it me? Should I have utilized this tool more efficiently, so it was still subtle, but also noticeable?

I really see nowadays that people think, that they 'speak sarcasm as a second language', and how they have such linguistic prowess, when in reality a lot of the jokes go well over their heads, or they can't truly express themselves with sarcasm so that it is clear to everyone. Is there a measure for how subtle the sarcasm is? What can journalists, and what can readers do to improve themselves?"

Constructive criticism welcome.",andsometimesidostuff,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1nd758/i_tried_my_hand_at_networking_which_ive_never/,"**Step 1: General Inquiry** An acquaintance from my master's program in economics works at a large local company which I am interested in. I messaged her on Facebook to express my interest (I would have asked in person, but since I graduated I don't see her often) and she encouraged me to check online for positions.

**Step 2: Specific Questions** A couple weeks later, she informed me that there was an opening in her department and to apply for it online. I was happy that she followed up with my initial inquiry, and I asked for more info about the job. She advised me on what I should emphasize on my application, and I also looked over her LinkedIn profile to get a better sense of her work duties.

The job announcement itself said that candidates should have at least 3 years of experience. I have only 1 year of full-time experience, and about 2 years of relevant internship experience. Plus my master's degree, if that counts for anything.

My friend got this same job with less experience and less education than I currently have (she is still in the master's program). However, I understand that the requirements might have changed since she was hired a couple years ago.

**Step 3: Application** I took what I learned from Step 2 and incorporated it into my resume and cover letter. In the ""How did you hear about this job?"" section of the online app, I made sure to write my friend's name and title.

**Step 4: Career Fair** The same company happened to be at my school's career fair the very next week. I stopped by the booth, introduced myself, and stated that I had learned about one of the open positions (the one I applied for) from my friend. The representative immediately said, ""Oh, that job requires 3 years of experience."" I offered her my resume and asked if she thought my experience would be sufficient. After glancing at it for *less than 5 seconds,* she handed it right back and said ""Probably not."" (Kind of off-topic, but I got a resume critique at the same career fair and was told that my resume looked very professional.)

I followed up with my friend, thanked her for her initial help, and politely mentioned the career fair experience. She stated that if they were interested in me, they'd make an exception to the work experience requirement.

**Step 5: Waiting** The job is still online for another week, so I haven't heard back yet.

**Tl;dr:** I used a network connection to learn more about a job opening. She encouraged me to apply even though another company rep was quick to state that I ""probably"" did not have the requisite experience. I applied online through regular means.

I've never really used an acquaintance in a job search and the idea of networking is somewhat foreign to me. I have no idea how to go about networking...was I on the right track with this?

I think /r/BTFC is such a cool idea and I thought it was finely time to participate.

I've been trying to gain weight off an on for the past 3 years, and have consistently hovered around 145lbs. Usually during the summers I'm too active to concentrate on gaining weight. The highest I've gotten was 165lbs over a fall internship but quickly lost it once school started back up. I hope to reach at least that. I've done it before, let's see if I can do it again! I'm going to do this by (the best way there is)... eating a lot and drinking a lot of milk, that also means a lot of trips to the grocery store. I bike about 5 miles to the grocery store about 4-7 days a week and fill up however much I can in my backpack. But that won't last much longer due to weather. By the end of the year my goal is to look good and feel better and hopefully create a habit that will stay with me for the rest of my life.

Good luck to everyone else in /r/BTFC!

Current lift numbers:

* Bench 3x5s: 135lbs
* Squats 3x5s: 155lbs
* Deadlift 3x5s: 185lbs

 I met this girl back late may, thought she was really cool so we started hanging out,
Her parents liked me at first, invited me over just about everyday to do something, then we got closer, and I asked her out, the next day I'm ordered to talk to her dad and ask for permission to date her... a bit odd since its just dating I didn't ask her to marry me but whatever (she's 20 and I'm 21 btw) 

So we dated for a week, within that there was a party at their place I'm not a very social person so I'm chilling by some older people just on my phone, she's off being social and active, she sits next to me and asks if I wanna go inside with her for a few to cool off, we go inside and I guess her parents think its my idea and tell her the next day that ""im holding her back because I am a indoor person "" bullshit. 

So she sits me down we talk and decide to break it off till we get to know each other better, a few days go by and I'm at her house, her mom pulls her downstairs and yells at her because I'm here and she doesn't like me, so her mom banned me from her house I'm not allowed there anymore, she constantly threatens her about taking her phone away because she talks to me on it, sounds stupid right? 

So fast forward to the next thing, I jokingly call my friend a bitch because  of some school stuff (we went to different high schools she wouldn't recommend my school because they dont teach you right. Or something) so the outcome of that her mom banned me from ever being in her car again. Sooooo more bs. 

Now we are pretty close and I'm very proud to say that, so we hold each other sometimes its very comforting, she messed up and accidentally sent a text to her mom about holding me, mom of course is freaking out on her and thinks we dating again, says shes not allowed to park at my house anymore (the hell for real) also if I'm the only person she texts she'll have to get a job for her phone.. she can't handle that, she already interns and struggles with her school work getting done a job would make things 10x worse. She told her mom a secret of mine which is ok (I was molested by my friend when I was young, I don't like being touched and I only let people I trust touch me, my friend is also asexual meaning she doesn't like physical things to a point) so I thought that would calm her mom down but actually no it didn't. 

So now that you know the story I need some advice, I feel like should step in, my friend said not too for fear id get hurt. beat up/maybe shot idk. Thing is they can only get away with that if I'm on their property, they can do it someplace else but that would be assault, I wouldn't press charges either I don't wanna hurt my friend in any way I love her. Should I step in over the internet? Tell them what's up and that we're only friends? Or maybe ask to meet one of them in person and explain things, this has gone on far enough, next thing you know I'll start be followed when I leave my house (they have done that once btw) help guys!

I've been out of school for a year, (teaching English in South Korea - wanted to travel and put a dent in my student loans), and am ready to go back to school.

I'm going to apply for the MSc GEM program (MSc Course in Geo-information Science and Earth Observation for Environmental Modelling and Management) at Lund, beginning in 2014. I thought this program was a good fit for me because you can choose different options and they all combine aspects of earth science and gis. I think I want to focus on physical geography and gis/remote sensing. Hopefully, I can be accepted for the Erasmus Mundus scholarship and receive a free education.

I have 4 questions.

1. Has anyone taken completed this program or know anyone who has? Were you happy with the program? Job prospects after? Etc, etc.

2. Also, what are your opinions on getting gis jobs with more of an environmental aspect? I did an internship with the city where I'm from and I don't enjoy city planning, at all.

3. I've read that GIS can be a location independent field. What do you think the chances are that I can find an employer who allows me to work from home or another country? My first thought was of freelance work but I'm not sure how lucrative that is in the GIS industry.

4. Are there any Masters programs that you would recommend?

I am an MBA student from a top Canadian University and I was offered a market risk position at a major bank.  The job doesn't place you in a specific role so I could end up in model validation, enterprise risk, trading floor risk, etc.

The issue is I have no experience in risk management and I've heard it's uninteresting and career limiting.  I have full-time experience in an economics team and an internship in asset management under my belt and I enjoyed those jobs a lot.  Ultimately, I'd like to end up in a role which blends the two.  However, those jobs are really hard to find and I'm faced with taking a job I'm not super keen on, or holding out for the ideal.  

The key questions are these.  Does working a risk job for 1-2 years silo you in your career as a 'risk person' who will have a *very* difficult time breaking into another field, or does it make you more marketable having that much more experience?"

My life dream ( literally) is to be an organic farmer. I am currently enrolled in community college. I am going for sociology since I felt like I was forced into college. I do not mind school, I am a straight A student but I feel like it is useless for me. I could only see myself graduating college to get a job, and get a farm faster. I plan to have a 5-10 acre farming facility. I will need to raise roughly 150k but would not mind if 50k were in farm loans. ( This is about 3-4 years of work at a standard paying full time job near me, if I live at home. And of course keeping a nest egg for the first few rough years.)

I am really having second thoughts about school, but being in the ridiculous middle class situation I feel like I am obligated to a degree only to please my parents ( My dad moved off the farm in order to live here, yet he does not like it here at all and would support me if I could show him I know my stuff). I am already falling into student debt, and feel as if it is just a viscous cycle. I will be so far in debt I will be plagued for the entire ten years.

Upon looking on WWOOF I noticed a facility near me. This is what they offer- http://www.pushingtheenvelopefarm.com/beginning-farmer-incubator

It says it cost about 450 a month. 

I am really considering taking spring semester off. Is 450 a month worth it for an internship? I mean I feel much better paying that than school fees. This way I am not even behind when/if I go back to school ( I graduated high school at 17 and started college right away so I am very far ahead.) 

Would you do it if you were me? I am doing extensive research and would love an organic farm operation with CSA's and selling to market. I feel like if I really work my butt off for the next 5 years I can make my dream a reality.  I do already have gardening knowledge but I feel the program offers something I do not have knowledge about, which is strategy for market growing.

Background: graduated in 2011 from a top-50 university in the DC/MD/VA area with a BA in Lit (GPA: 3.47). Began my degree with the intention of pursuing a career in academia, and spent most of the four years beefing up my resume for an MA/PhD program in Cinema Studies (I worked for my department in a combination of paid and unpaid positions, and presented at conferences/panels when the opportunity arose). But by the time I started to write my senior thesis, I had concluded that the field was not for me. 

I ended up spending the following 2 years (in Manhattan, where I moved with my boyfriend for his career) trying to figure out how to start from scratch; I was an account manager for an educational consulting company for awhile, I managed a boutique invitation and stationery store, I temp'ed at a law office. Tried to talk to anyone and everyone about their career choices, read *What Color is your Parachute?*, and generally kept an open mind.

Towards the end of year two, I landed on healthcare administration, and I'm confident that this is the degree I want to pursue. Ideally, I'd like to be a hospital or smaller care center administrator, but I'm open to other career paths and imagine that I might change my mind once I actually begin an MHA program.

I'm planning to apply for the 2015-2016 year, so I have a little over a year to prepare. Here are the questions I have:

1) As of last week, I have moved from NYC back to DC, and thus, I'm job hunting. I am trying to find some kind of entry-level position that relates to healthcare so that I have *some* relevant job experience. Been applying to a lot of admin assistant roles at healthcare nonprofits and small practices. Is this a good idea? I plan to volunteer at a nearby hospital as well (4-8 hours a week, probably) but I need to pay my rent, so unpaid internships and full-time volunteering are out of the question.

2) Regarding LORs, I can certainly request them from my undergrad professors, but is it a matter of concern that they are all Lit professors and could not speak to my ability to excel in an MHA program in particular? 

3) The programs I'll be applying to have prereqs that, as a Lit major, I did not take (accounting, stats, and micro). The only means of taking these courses, as far as I can tell, is through my local community college. Will community college credit be frowned upon? 

Thank you for your help! If you don't have an answer to the above questions but have other comments or advice regarding anything I've written, please do share it."

Thanks for your time.

I would like to end up in power electronics or embedded system design.  If I accept a job offer in, for example, PLC programming on an assembly line (since those jobs are more abundant than entry-level electronics design), how will that affect me three years down the road when I want that second job in power electronics design?

On a side note, how likely am I to get a job offer ""requiring"" 3 to 5 years of experience with not even an internship?  Jobs listed as entry-level are very few and far between, and I have yet to find one for electronics design."

I went into university with good grades from high school, a decent SAT score, and a positive attitude, but my work ethic was as solid as Gumby. I had learned to work the system in high school, managing to complete (most) of my homework 2 seconds before it was due and learning how to remember information for the 60 minutes it was needed before I forgot it all. I looked like a genius on paper, and in my defense I was relatively intelligent, but I knew my work ethic would catch up to me.

I managed to hang on to my hope of succeeding long enough to achieve a 3.4 GPA my first semester of college, but I eventually let Call of Duty, online poker, alcohol, lots of recreational drugs (which eventually turned into an opioid addiction), and a bad relationship wreck havoc on my work ethic, leading to a second semester GPA of .7 (yes, the number before the .7 is 0). I lost all my scholarships, was put on academic watch (I'm lucky it wasn't worse), and lost the faith of my family and some friends. I had become a burnout with no hope and little support.

As easy as it would have been to give up, get a shitty job, and live the rest of my life getting by, I chose to fight. I'm not sure if it was because the thought of working 40 hours a week at a shitty job scared me more than fighting through school, but I knew what I had to do, and did it.

First, I had to figure out how the hell to pay for school since I had lost so many scholarships. I contacted every private loan agency possible, every person in my life that could potentially cosign for me, and eventually figured it out with some help. Every year of school from there on my GPA got better. I finished with a 2.72 GPA and 75k of debt and though I thought my GPA was too low to succeed, I put a lot of time looking into my options and found a good path.

I was able to enroll in the MBA program at at my undergrad university if I got a 620 or better on the GMAT and I could finish my MBA in a year and a half. I studied my ass off for the GMAT and got a 700. I then looked into internships and graduate assistantships (GAs) and found that there were 4 available GAs at my school that paid full tuition. I thought I had no chance at the GA with such a low GPA, but I researched every aspect of the job, scrutinized the application process and spent countless hours practicing for the interview. I got the GA. I spent a year and a half BUSTING my ass and finished my MBA, for free, with a 3.87 GPA, while simultaneously learning how to be a professional at my job. I had some rough times, as I was constantly overloaded with work, but those rough times were some of the best learning lessons I've ever received. Things were looking up.

I spent the last 3 months looking for a job. I worked with the Career Planning Center at my school to build my resume, interview skills, and overall demeanor. I sent out 74 applications. Within 2 months, I heard back from 11 companies, 8 of which said ""we don't need you at this time."" But of those 3 companies that responded with a positive, one worked out after 67 days, 7 interviews, 24 surveys, a business plan, assessment, and lots of pleading. I start my job as a Financial Analyst October 6th.

I'm still working on many things, including my opioid addiction (I'm off drugs but it's still a daily fight), temper control, occasional feelings of depression, and yes, even my work ethic, but my attitude is much more positive.

Either way, no matter how shitty things look, feel, or seem to be, don't ever give up, for they will get better with the right attitude. Life is a fickle thing, and it's easy for the scale to tip in the wrong direction, but it's up to you to give it everything you've got to push it back the right way. I know that I'm lucky to have everything work out the way it did, but I would have never got lucky if I didn't try. And most importantly, never be afraid to ask for help. I can't credit my successes to myself alone, as I received help from family, friends (the few that I had left), teachers, school staff, therapists, and comedy. Even if you're not lucky enough to have some of those resources, there is always someone who wants to help you. It is your duty to find them, and things will work themselves out from there.

I'm going to go back to studying financial options. Go do whatever you should be doing. Cheers.

I'm looking at my options here and can't really decide what the best value is. open minded on price, willing to buy brand new if need be, but want the best value...

i had a late '09 unibody MPB and honestly it ran everything i wanted (photoshop, illustrator, downloading media, etc) at the speeds i needed.. at least for the first few years. so i can't understand if it's worth a couple extra hundred to go from a refurbished '11 model to a brand new one.

not considering craigslist and etc because i'd like an extended warranty and such

what would you buy? options i've considered:

new [student pricing, if i'm lucky// as i actually just graduated]

refurbished from apple

refurbished from 3rd party

1ngoh1,1,2013-09-30,Constructing a Personal Life Mission Statement: Honesty versus Possible Judgment? (Feedback Appreciated),[deleted],AcademicPsychology,https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPsychology/comments/1ngoh1/constructing_a_personal_life_mission_statement/,"At my university for undergrad, I am part of a research lab, and in less than 48 hours, my personal life mission statement is due to my mentor, a paper spelling out what you intend to do and accomplish in your life, and your justification for doing so.
 
While I doubt I will be grilled for it being imperfect, I need feedback because I am unsure of whether to turn this in to her. While it is incredibly revealing of me and my thought processes and is written a lot like a monologue in a novel (feels the most natural for me), it is honest and spells out why I want to conduct psychological research and how I justify my existence. 
 
To try to offset any possible judgment, I originally intended to send both this, my Personal Life Mission Statement, and my specialized Fall 2013 Mission Statement, which specifically states my goals and intentions for this semester, figurative and philosophical writing kept to a minimum.
 
Still, I would appreciate some feedback. Should I be this honest in my research lab?
 
(To give you a better idea of what my intentions were, I will include my specialized Mission Statement at the end.)
 
Thanks for reading this.
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Personal Life Mission Statement
 
We are born into a world without our consent, must abide by social and natural laws we can never fully understand, and eventually meet an end we cannot see coming. We can question why things are this way for our entire lifetimes, but all we can generate are ideas, loose notions barely grounded in the truth, easily blown away by the breeze of any other idea, creating a whirlwind of disguised insecurity. All the individual can hope to do is cling onto their own ideas, give their life some meaning, any meaning, and hope that the end result is not as bad as they fear.
 
For a long time, and even still to an extent, I could not come to terms with this. When you are confronted with this ugly truth, this blindingly obvious void of reason or meaning, how can you be expected to?
 
Well, it is obvious that the answer to at least this question exists.
 
Look around you, the floor below you, the ceiling above you. You likely are reading this on the screen on a computer, or a piece of paper. You are surrounded by walls, with various devices around you. Electrical wires run throughout the building you are currently in. There are tables nearby, books of information and stories. Outside the window are cars driving by, people walking around on roads, sidewalks, wearing protective clothing, shoes, walking around large buildings, all with their own intricacies.
 
Isn’t it amazing that, despite this looming meaninglessness, the human species, as a collective, created this much? Over generations, minds have come together to build, improve, criticize and retaliate, leading to all of this. Bits of carbon, we humans, came together to manipulate the planet to suit our needs and wants, to generate and harness power to lead to the creation of mass communication means, of a universe of knowledge at our disposal, of beautiful homes to comfort and shield us, of ways to discover more! We are nowhere close to understanding our existence, and likely will be as close to understanding it in the last moments of life on Earth as we are now, but even this is something. Faced with existence, those before us, in unison, decided to live, live in a way that the Earth likely never anticipated, for better or for worse.
 
We aimed to make use and sense of what we were given. and my intention is to follow suit; to aid in the advancement of refined understanding.
 
More specifically, I intend to help in furthering the understanding of the Brain and Mind, the understanding of us as human beings and as individuals. The intricacies and potential of the human mind are infinitely fascinating, and the vastness of just how much we as a collective do not know only adds to that fascination and fuels research indefinitely.  However, while both the interpretative aspects of psychological theories and the systematic methods of biological research have their merits, attempting to fully comprehend anything about the mind and brain from any singular perspective leaves much to be desired and unaccounted for. I hope to effectively utilize both quantitative and qualitative techniques to study and strengthen the bridge between the psychological and biological.
 
I do not expect my work alone to bring about any significant leap in general knowledge. I hope to closely work with those of different perspectives and opinions, so that possibly some good frameworks could result from our clashes. I will continuously learn of new methods and ways of thinking to integrate into my professional and personal life, benefiting both myself and my colleagues. I will never be content with what I know and will continuously seek out new learning experiences, both good and bad.
 
Whether the summation of my research becomes published in textbooks or gathers dust on a desk, I will dedicate my life to understanding more of this amazing field of study, of how amazing we humans are.

Mission Statement for Fall 2013 Academic Semester
 
This semester marks my third year of college education, and my first year as an official member of the [name of research lab]. As a student in the College of Arts and Sciences Honors Program, I am required to complete an Honors Thesis by the end of my senior year. And in order to maintain my scholarship to this school, I must maintain a minimum of a 3.2 Grade Point Average. I am currently studying at [name of university] in London, England, where I am taking four classes.
 
As a member of [lab name], despite not being present at the lab itself, I will dedicate as much time and energy as possible to collaborate with my peers for our project and related tasks. In addition, I must develop the topic and framework of my Honors Thesis, working closely with my mentor to complete as much of it as possible during my time abroad. During this time, I hope to better strengthen my research skills for future applications.
 
While my scholarship requires only a minimum GPA of 3.2, I aim to achieve a 4.0 GPA this semester. I will study the required texts and insure that all of my work, whether it be exams or essays, meet my expectation of excellence. As the courses here have a focus on essay-writing, I hope to also improve my technical and argumentative writing skills.
 
As I am growing older, and the idea of graduate school and career looms ever closer, I will begin to plan out the specifics of my future career and living. I will develop a better understanding of the workings of graduate and professional research, determine which institutions I will apply at, look into and prepare for internship opportunities, begin studying for the GRE, and learn from my peers about how else I can prepare for life outside of undergraduate school.

I'm a 27 year old female. I'm finishing up my Master's degree this December. I partied too much and worked too little in my early twenties, and I'm paying for it now. 

I overloaded myself on my college work and my internship so that I could finish quickly and not have to keep hemorrhaging money by paying for more semesters - I'm nearing $70,000 in student loan debt and still owe my school some money. I haven't worked in four years so that I could buckle down and finish my degrees. When I had been working and going to school at the same time, I'd blow off school for more work. 

I used to have quite a few real life friends. When I stopped working, I weighed 139 pounds (I'm 5'5''). When I started buckling down in school, I went up to my current weight.. 187 pounds. It's disgusting. I stopped seeing my real life friends because I was so ashamed of how I looked, now I have no one. I can't afford new clothes to fit my fat ass so I wear the same few things over and over.

I exercise regularly, usually some walking (I can't run due to a bad knee) and weights. I sit on a balance ball when I'm in front of the computer - I don't even own a chair. I'm a vegetarian, I don't eat meat at all. Because of my poorness, I usually just eat beans and brown rice. No butter or salt, just a bit of seasoning to make it a little less boring. I don't drink soda or alcohol, my only vices are coffee and hot tea, but I use sugar very sparingly. 

I have noticed quite a few problems recently with my on-going weight gain (I gained 15 pounds just over the summer during my summer courses). As of the past few days, my vision has been getting blurry. I feel like my throat is closing constantly. I get dizzy each time I lean over. I'm scared. 

I want to visit a doctor. I can't afford to spent several hundred dollars on someone telling me what I already know: eat less, exercise more. I don't have insurance. 

I'm worried about being able to get a job when I'm done with my school work and internship, I'm afraid I'll be judged on my weight. But the reality is, I just can't will myself to do anything. Every time I have to leave for my internship, I dread it. Every time I go to school, I dread it. I hate leaving my house, I hate going anywhere. When I was young and thin, I loved going places and having fun. Now I don't like even leaving my room. 

I really hate what my life has become. I know I have no one to blame but myself but I'm not sure what I can do to make it better. I have tried so many different things, but I just don't see any light, any happiness. 

I try to tell people how I feel about myself, and they just shrug it off. ""Oh, you're not fat."" ""You're smart, you'll be fine."" But it doesn't help, it doesn't change how I feel.

He asked me to send a cover letter and my resume to him so it would get looked at for a tax internship position. The thing is, I haven't seen the posting for the position, so I don't know how to write the cover letter. Previous cover letters I've written have been based on the job posting. As well, I don't know who to make it out to. On the firm's profile in my school's database, it gives a name to contact, so should I make it out to that person?

However, there is one ""bridging"" problem.

Quite a few Industrial Hygiene graduate programs or entry level positions require a year's experience in public health or related programs. I've already applied to, for example, a health inspector position in NYC, but I was wondering if anyone in the subreddit knew of different types of entry level public health/occupational health/environmental science positions that I should be looking for--specifically, I'm looking for keywords with which to start a search.

I've also considered the possibility of and have the time and flexibility to volunteer, if such volunteering would qualify for said ""public health experience,"" but there's little clarity in what types of programs would and would not fill that qualification.

TL;DR Looking to get into IH/OHS, want to get Master's Degree for industrial positions, need ideas for entry level positions to get me there.

If any of you have tips, you would absolutely make my day. Thanks!"
1nghdr,3,2013-09-30,Thought: Why Not Eliminate All College Sports?,rchanou,sports,https://www.reddit.com/r/sports/comments/1nghdr/thought_why_not_eliminate_all_college_sports/,"With the recent developments of the Ed O'Bannon vs. NCAA case it had me thinking.  Both the video game and athletic entertainment industry have exploded in the past decade.  Both are multi-multi-billion dollar industries.  So it begs the question.

What is the actual benefit of having college athletics nowadays?  Why not eliminate college athletics from all accredited Universities and Colleges completely?  

Instead, allow those who want to play sports and go to school earn school credit, other kids in college have part-time jobs or internships.  Schools could no longer use Title IX as an excuse for not paying athletes.  Schools would no longer have the financial burden of athletic programs to support.  Plus, why are these student-athletes getting preferential treatment anyways?  Why are schools spending millions of dollars on new athletic facilities not available to the general student population?

Would this force the NFL to create an MLB-esque minor league system?  Yes.  Instead, imagine hundreds of minor league teams in conferences based on promotion and relegation.  Are there critics that will argue about tradition?  Yes, but tradition has already been broken.  Universities are constantly realigning themselves into these new super conferences.  And soon the Bowl Series will be eliminated and a playoff system will be in its place.  Tradition is nice but Colleges have moved beyond that.

Want to play and go to school but the team doesn't have any attractive schools to attend around its area?  There are many online programs students can take nowadays.  There are students now who don't even show up to class and just watch online.  If we are really concerned about the education of these young folk wouldn't this be a better alternative?  Or earn an AA degree from a JuCo.  Or take a MOOC (Massive Online Open Course).  Or don't earn a degree at all.  

Most importantly, this would eliminate the NCAA.  No more inconsistency in the punishment currently given to schools.  No more punishment to future athletes that had nothing to do with the school's violations.  No more shady dealings with boosters.  No longer would athletics have a stranglehold on the university.  The university can go back to focusing on the education of their students.

Is college sports (football and basketball mainly) so institutionalized that this would be a impossible?"

1ngdr9,7,2013-09-30,Slipping again.,JJtheThrowaway,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1ngdr9/slipping_again/,"Using a throwaway because the last time I posted here, a couple of my friends found out and one of them still doesn't treat me the same way because of it.

Sorry if this comes off as ranty. I'm at school, typing on my phone, and I've got a shitload of emotions going on right now, so I'm just gonna go ahead and unload it here.

16/M. Turning 17 next month. Last time I posted here was in April, after I almost killed myself and I needed guidance afterwards. You guys helped me a lot at the time. Since then, I've been diagnosed with inattentive ADHD, which I'm medicated for now, and episodic depression, which is inconsistent enough that I haven't gotten a prescription for it, and frankly, I don't want to. History of ADHD on my dad's side with bipolar also in my grandpa, and depression on my mom's side. Looks like I got the best of both worlds here.

I honestly thought I was done with depression. After all the shit I went through last year -- my cross country teammate killing himself, my mom slipping into alcoholism and depression (she's sober and happy now, by the way), and a lot of self loathing -- I thought I was okay now. Summer was boring, but I had an internship I really enjoyed, and while I didn't get out much (never have, really), I was happy.

Now I'm a junior in high school and I feel like shit is going down the toilet again (no pun intended). My dad is the president of an advertising agency so we've always been doing well, but they suddenly lost their two biggest clients and he had to lay a lot of employees off. His agency is where my internship was, actually. I was friends with some of those people. Now he's stressed 24/7 and I don't see him as much since he spends all of his time at the office now or working on his computer at home. He tries to hide it, but I can tell he's getting depressed, too, and I feel horrible that I can't find some way to make things easier for him.

On the plus side, I've been able to focus in school more this year than before, probably because of the meds. But I'm still not where I want to be. I wanted to get all A's and B's, which I haven't been able to get since 7th grade. But right now, I've got two C's and mostly low B's in everything else. I'm doing better than I was last year, but it's not good enough for me.

I dropped cross country this year. Getting up so early every morning and getting migraines from hard workouts just to remind myself that I'm a mediocre athlete who won't ever make varsity wasn't worth it. I'm really glad I did, actually; I'm still friends with a lot of my teammates, and in its place, I got into a cappella (varsity choir) with no experience -- more because they needed more guys than because I have any actual talent -- and a yell leading team.

Thing is, I'm more insecure than ever now. Everyone around me has a niche, some talent or a lot of talents that they excel at, and I have nothing. All I do is do my homework, browse Facebook or Reddit, jerk off, and go to bed, day in and day out. I've tried taking up guitar, or getting better at piano, or working on being a better singer, but none of those have clicked with me. The only thing I've got is writing, and I'm not even very good at that. I have no talents and no drive to develop any, and I hate myself for it.

Back to the yell leading team, since I have a bit to say about that. First of all, I love it. It's the first thing that's really resonated with me in a while, and I look forward to going to football games every Friday because of it. But the thing is, whenever I'm with the other guys (who are awesome, by the way), I feel worthless. Again, they're all talented, or funny, or just all around cool, and then there's me. It's gotten to the point where I'm afraid to say anything when I'm around them because I feel like I'll make a fool of myself. That's weird for me, since I've always been really talkative and outgoing. I've always been confident, but now I'm just... not.

Specifically, there's one guy who I'll call Shaun. Shaun is hilarious, energetic, is pretty much a virtuoso with any instrument I can think of... Really, he's everything I want to be. I hang out with him a lot, both on and off the team, but every time I do, I get jealous. I hate that about myself. I'm an extremely jealous person, even though I never express it. Every time I see someone do something I can't, I hate them for being better than me, and hate myself for feeling that way. No one notices; I just laugh along and roll with it. But the entire time, I have this ugly feeling inside, and I can't get it to go away.

So. Shaun. Little backstory, all of last year I had a massive crush on a friend of mine, we'll call her Kelly. Kelly is amazing. She's actually one of the two friends I came to when I was having suicidal thoughts last year (not referring to the other two who found out against my will), and she's been one of the best friends I've ever had. The feelings I have for her have turned into more of a brotherly love, since I think that's how she feels about me, but there's still a part of me that wants to be with her. This year, I said fuck it and ignored those feelings since I knew they'd never amount to anything. I decided it was time to move on.

Well, Shaun and I were driving one day and we were joking around about homecoming. He brought up Kelly, and I told him I didn't think I was going to ask her, but that I still kind of like her. He said he wouldn't say anything and we didn't really talk about it again.

Last Friday, we were driving again and I asked him if he was going to ask anyone to homecoming. He said that the girl he wanted to ask had already gotten a date, so he probably wasn't going to. We didn't talk about it after that.

Well, when I looked at Facebook during second period today, lo and behold, there was a fucking picture of Shaun and Kelly together. He asked her this morning. I saw him this weekend and this morning, and he said nothing to me.

Now I feel a mix of anger, betrayal, and burning, burning jealousy, and it fucking hurts. But what scares me is the emptiness I feel, too. Angry as I am, a part of me feels nothing. It's a familiar feeling, and it scares the shit out of me.

Enough about Shaun and Kelly and the goddamn yell leaders who make me feel like less of a person, though. I'm getting off topic here.

I've been thinking about a lot suicide lately. Not necessarily committing it, but I've just been going about my days, thinking constantly, ""How would things be different if I killed myself? Would anyone be sad? Would anyone even care? Would people even remember a few years from now?"" They were just a few scattered thoughts before, but now it's verging on obsession. I can't stop thinking about standing on the ledge of that warehouse like I planned out in April, and taking that step, and it scares me. But a part of me still just feels empty.

So that's that up to this point. I feel like in slipping again, but I'm doing nothing to stop it. I just put on the fucking lighthearted, cheerful mask like I always have and pretend nothing is wrong. I don't want to tell my parents again; last time they threw me in therapy and worried about it for weeks, and I really don't want to do that to them now, what with my dad with his work and my mom recovering from surgery until November. Hell, I almost got partial hospitalization just because I planned it out. I don't want to go through all of that shit again.

Sorry this is all over the place, I wrote this over the course of several hours and emotionally I'm all over the place. How can I deal with all of this without going to a therapist again?"

I have been applying online to any internships in the Seattle area that I have heard from, and have already used a slightly older version of this resume (with a large area devoted to my course work). There will be some large software companies at this career fair so I'm hoping to give them a better resume than what I have already been giving out. I have only heard back from one company so far, and they declined to continue the interview process. I'm assuming I shouldn't worry about this since it is still very early in the process.

From this article from a couple of months ago: http://www.npr.org/blogs/monkeysee/2013/06/14/191568762/at-the-movies-the-women-are-gone

&gt;Of those 617 showings, 561 of them — 90 percent — are stories about men or groups of men, where women play supporting roles or fill out ensembles primarily focused on men. The movies making up those 561 showings: Man Of Steel (143), This Is The End (77), The Internship (52), The Purge (49), After Earth (29), Now You See Me (56), Fast &amp; Furious 6 (44), The Hangover Part III (16), Star Trek Into Darkness (34), The Great Gatsby (16), Iron Man 3 (18), Mud (9), The Company You Keep (4), Kings Of Summer (9), and 42 (5).

&gt;Thirty-one are showings of movies about balanced pairings or ensembles of men and women: Before Midnight (26), Shadow Dancer (4), and Wish You Were Here (1).

&gt;Twenty-five are showings of movies about women or girls: The East (8), Fill The Void (4), Frances Ha (9), and What Maisie Knew (4).

&gt;There are nearly six times as many showings of Man Of Steel alone as there are of all the films about women put together.

&gt;I want to stress this again: In many, many parts of the country right now, if you want to go to see a movie in the theater and see a current movie about a woman — any story about any woman that isn't a documentary or a cartoon — you can't. You cannot. There are not any. You cannot take yourself to one, take your friend to one, take your daughter to one.

Why do you think men have such a greater representation in movies than women? If 50% of the population is women, why are 90% of the movies about men? Discuss."

When we first got together back in April/May, we would have oral sex together at least once a week, almost always more. I love eating her out and almost always pleasured her more than she pleasured me (which was my doing because I enjoy giving oral so much). At the end of May, I left the country for 3 months to do an internship abroad. We did the LDR thing and I came back to the US at the end of August. The first two weeks back were phenomenal; we fooled around frequently, she let me eat her out or finger her multiple times in a night; it was a completely ideal setup. She really enjoyed oral and fingering.

About two weeks after getting back, we tried to do PIV. Come to find out it was painful for her (despite generous foreplay and fingering). As she told me, her previous boyfriend, who she'd lost her virginity to, had been focused on getting himself off and as a result, she only knew PIV sex as painful. It was apparently a ""normal"" occurrence for her to bleed and it almost always hurt. When she tells me this, I immediately stop and tell her we'll try with toys before we try with my penis again.

Since that night, I started having ED issues, both with her and while masturbating (Currently getting tested for it). I think it was because the idea of hurting someone physically through sex really bothered me. Additionally, the frequency we have sex TANKED. I asked her this weekend about it and she tells me that she just doesn't really ""need"" sex (oral included) and while she'll sometimes be in the mood, it's infrequent. She also said she doesn't particularly enjoy giving blowjobs because of the ED issue.

My SO and I are complete opposites on the sexual spectrum. She's only had bad experiences with sex and doesn't need/want it frequently (PIV and/or oral). In my last relationship, we'd have sex 2-3 times a day, 3-4 times a week. I'm frustrated and not sure what to do: most of the advice I've seen tends to say ""talk about it"" but what if we've talked about it and she just isn't particularly sexual?

TL;DR: Mismatched libidos, mine is higher than my SOs. She's not really sexual and says she doesn't really need sex. What do I do?"

CS Major Graduating in 3 years now looking for a job.,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ng3zc/advice_needed_cs_major_graduating_in_3_years_now/,"I am a Senior (credit wise) in college, but am only a 3rd year student. I had a lot of AP credits coming into college which freed me up from taking a lot of my general education requirements. I originally planned on going to medical school, but decided to switch to CS my second semester because the prospects of being in school for another 4+ years after college did not appeal to me. 

In my first two semesters I only took two CS classes. However, my third and four semesters consisted of almost all CS/Math classes. This semester (my second to last) I am doing the same. 

I have had 3 career related jobs. One in managing websites for the university. The second working with a CS professor on an Android application research project. The third with a medical professor on programming a data pipeline for use on the local university cluster. I still am holding all three of those jobs. I never did an internship, which worries the hell out of me. I needed to make money (one of the reasons I am graduating in three years is because of my financial situation) and felt that working over the summer was going to be better for me financially in the long run. I am now questioning that decision. 

Anyway, I decided to start searching for jobs early September. I applied to a larger company got a phone interview, then an online assessment, and finally an in person/on campus interview. I felt that I nailed every part. I connected with the interviewer and was able to explain my development projects well and in depth. I just heard back from them that they are moving on with other candidates. (sad day) As for a reason they said that because I am graduating in three years, I am ""a little light on programming"" and that I should reapply when I have a ""few more courses under my belt"". This worries me because I feel like I am starting to run out of time. I have only 1 and half semesters left before hitting the real world and what is the point of graduating in three years if it makes me less of a viable job candidate?

**tl;dr : Graduating in three years. Prospective employer cites this as reason for moving on with other candidates.**

 So on to my questions:

1. Does graduating in 3 years scare employers off?
2. Am I applying too early? They did say that I should try again after this semester, or during my final semester after I ""have a few more courses under my belt"".
3. What is the best course of action for me to follow in the future with other prospective employers? Should I wait a bit before applying for more jobs?

It's my first sort of experience ever and I've just graduated so I'm really eager to complete this internship and have something to show for. 

I won't go into detail about the company but I'm not happy with the way things are run and I wondered if it's similar for other people. I'm given work to do which is important so I guess that's a positive, it does get very choring and boring though.

However since day 1 things have been off. I wasn't told to bring my laptop but thankfully I did, fortunately it's a MacBook which everyone in the office has and which is also required. They said I would need Photoshop which I already had installed however when I asked what if I didn't, they said they would have given me a cracked version. They were distributing cracked versions of Word, Photoshop and other software in the office which is being used for professional work.

The second issue I have is the office environment. There are only 5 traditional chairs (4 legs and a backrest). Only other option is these shit plastic stools which are uncomfortable after a few hours. There are also some sofas but not suitable for working.

Finally it's not completely unpaid. I get paid for travel and lunch expenses and it's a base rate per day, way below a minimum wage though.

Should I get out ASAP or stick at it for 2 more months now and have something I can put down for experience?"

Most people have heard of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, be it you have an interest in the fantasy genre and like me have read the books, or like my girlfriend, watched the movie with me because it starred [Viggo Mortensen](http://imgur.com/ilFObxR)... Either way, what we can all agree on is that it's a damn good story - which is why I want to feature /r/lotr.

The story of the Lord of the Rings takes place after Tolkien's original 1937 classic, The Hobbit, and centres around the nephew of Bilbo Baggins, the protagonist of the original book. It is a three part series, detailing the journey of Frodo Baggins and ever-faithful sidekick [Samwise Gamgee](http://i.imgur.com/Rg9EL1T.gif) from idyllic and fruitful lands of their homeland, [the Shire](http://i.imgur.com/VlTTBRK.gif), to the dark and treacherous lands of Mordor, where Frodo must take the Ring of Power to be destroyed.

Upon finding /r/lotr I delved into it, and found not only [high quality content](http://imgur.com/twTflTk), but also a friendly and welcoming community - full of kind and creative people who were eager to help, and luckily for people like me, don't bite when you ask them a question about the immensely detailed lore.

/r/lotr features a wide range of Tolkien related content, not limited to only Lord of the Rings, but to also the Hobbit and the lesser know Silmarillion - it boasts user made maps, stories and videos, which in my opinion, are pretty freaking cool.

/r/lotr is a good place for anyone looking to find  a discussion about Tolkien's work, or to alternatively post or discover amazing hobbit-related resources.

And now to an interview with the moderators:


&gt;##1.Firstly, tell us a little about yourselves.
&gt;&gt; **davidsmeaton** I'm a big LOTR fan, teacher, traveler, photographer and internet addict. I'm currently writing a Masters thesis about computer games (Minecraft) and education. I'm Australian. I have a wife and son. I just moved to Egypt to work and you can see the pyramids and the Nile from my front balcony.

&gt;&gt; **ebneter** I'm a software engineer with more than 20 years in Silicon Valley. American. Interests other than Tolkien including guitars and target shooting.

&gt;##2.Why did you get involved with /r/lotr?
&gt;&gt; **davidsmeaton** The creator of the subreddit (mshiltonj) had run things alone for nearly 3 years. One day I approached him and offered to use my mad CSS skillz to make the group look nicer. He brought me onboard as a 2nd mod and I redesigned the subreddit's style. Later he stepped down as moderator, for personal reasons, leaving me to run the group.

&gt;&gt; **ebneter** I've been a huge fan of J.R.R. Tolkien since I first read The Hobbit at age 9 or 10. I've been collecting his books for years — I pre-ordered The Silmarillion back in 1977 and bought the individual volumes of The History of Middle-earth as they were published. I currently own more than 500 books by or about Tolkien. So /r/lotr is a natural fit. I've been reading and commenting there for several years now. When /u/davidsmeaton took over as principal mod, he invited me on board as well.

&gt;##3. How do you find the community?
&gt;&gt; **davidsmeaton** When I joined reddit 3 years ago I immediately sought out the communities which I share an interest in. I've always loved Tokien's writing and I'm a member of the other related subreddits (/r/tolkienfans and /r/TheHobbit) as well. I was a member of LOTR for over 2 years before becoming a moderator. I'm one of those redditors who prefers to spend time in smaller subreddits than the big ones. The communities are closer and generally more friendly. There's also a lot less drama! The LOTR community is a fantastic group.

&gt;&gt; **ebneter** I'm involved in most of the Tolkien-related subreddits, including /r/tolkienfans, /r/tolkienbooks, /r/lordoftherings, and /r/thehobbit. /r/lotr is more of a generalist group, equally focused on the books and the Peter Jackson films, whereas /r/tolkienfans is becoming more of a strictly book-related group. I think that's a good thing; while I am not myself at all a fan of the films, I think it's good to have a place where the film fans are welcome.

&gt;##4. Which is favourite character and what is the reason for this?
&gt;&gt; **davidsmeaton** My favourite character???? Oh dear, that's hard. I like Glorfindel because he's not as well known as other characters, but he's one tough elf! He was a prince and one of the first born. Glorfindel defeated a balrog and fearlessly attacked Ringwraiths. My LOTRo character is called Glorfindel too.

&gt;&gt; **ebneter** My favorite character has always been Galadriel. She's so powerful and so wise, and her backstory is filled with sadness and tragedy that have given her wisdom.

For all of you who don't know (therefore all of you :P) I am Kikariska, one of the new interns of /r/subredditoftheday. It's a great privilege to be able to write for you like this, so thanks a lot for reading!

And finally, a big thanks to the moderators of /r/lotr, who have been extremely helpful - be sure to check their subreddit out!"

With the amount of classes I take I should be done at the end of next year. I have a very busy life, and it looks like I won’t be able to go for an internship.  This is because Germany sucks with internships and you don't get paid for them.  So hopefully with building up my portfolio, and all of the projects I do during school breaks I'll be able to land a job.  I'm just curios if there is anything else I can do that someone thinks will help?  I'm really interested in software development, and that is what I have been building my portfolio towards.

So far I have a small tank game, a calendar, and soon I'll have a little fitness tracking app that I developed for a friend who is a fitness trainer. 

Any advice or criticism would be greatly appreciated!

1nfrc9,0,2013-09-30,Chances of getting into anthropology PhD program??,[deleted],GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1nfrc9/chances_of_getting_into_anthropology_phd_program/,"I am a senior graduating in the spring with my BA.  I want to get into UCSD for biological anthropology. I know exactly who I want to work with and have a pretty clear idea of what I want to research. 

I am very doubtful that I will be accepted to UCSD, though it is my top choice (second choice is UCR). I do not have the greatest **GPA** - it's a 3.4, or a 3.6 if I include the time I spent at a community college before coming to a four year institution to complete my BA (have no idea if I am supposed to include that?) and have not participated in very many projects outside of my general schooling. I HAVE been approved to take a grad level class next semester though.  And my departmental GPA is a 3.9.

It's my understanding that **field experience and research** are highly regarded in prospective anthropology graduate students, and I just haven't done that much in comparison with other undergrads I've spoken to. I have participated in two field schools (one in my home state during a weekend and one study abroad for two weeks) that were in forensic archaeology and biological archaeology respectively. I am also currently involved in an internship at a local museum in the archaeology department, but archaeology is not my primary field of focus so I don't know how much this will help me with a biological anthropology emphasis. I am working on a research project as well that is a review of existing literature - I am attempting to do a regional analysis of trauma and pathology within European Pleistocene populations based on existing site data since I can't collect my own data as an undergrad (at least not in the two semesters I have left). I am going to attempt to present this at a conference in the spring, but I won't have much to show for it for grad apps except maybe an abstract.

I know I can secure at least one solid **letter of recommendation**, and am hoping to secure another from a top faculty member at my current institution (he has actually done work with this professor I want to work with at UCSD, so I am hoping a letter from him will improve my chances). I am still searching for a person to ask for my third letter.

I haven't taken the actual **GRE** yet, but I took a practice GRE last night and got a 305 (159 verbal, 147 quant). Not great. I have two weeks until the GRE so I'm going to work as hard as I can to improve that. I don't know how important GRE scores are.

I'm also working hard on my **statement of purpose**. I'm going to a SOP workshop this week and I have some faculty members helping me edit it.  Any additional tips on this or anyone wiling to edit it?

Their college admission site is also really focused on the importance of diversity within their student body and people who have experience with teaching and diversity. I teach citizenship and ESL classes to refugees (mostly from sub-Saharan Africa) and was planning on talking about that as well as my disadvantaged background. Will this help?

**What are my chances of getting accepted? Can I do anything at this stage to make myself more competitive? Applications are due in January.**

In the last four years I have worked a steady job the whole time, had my own apartment and never been late on bills, finished my undergraduate, and am now in Graduate school!  I work at a substance abuse treatment center, I intern at a juvenile detention center, and am happier and more responsible than I could ever imagine.  4 years ago I could never imagine having the life that I have today.  I am so grateful!
This was one of the hardest years of my life, I lost two friends to overdoses, lost my grandfather and sisters boyfriend died within two days of each other, and on Friday my car got stolen from the parking lot of my internship in the inner city.  It has been a rough year and difficult one to maintain sobriety in, it would have been easy this year to say ""fuck it I'm just gonna get drunk"", but I did it all sober and wouldn't have it any other way.  I was able to be there for my family and my sister in such a difficult time, and while I have no car and no clue how I will be getting from school, to work, to internship at the moment, I am still grateful that I am sober and know that I will get through this too.  I have friends in sobriety that are there for me unlike my friends when I was using ever were.  So while life still happens and bad things happen, I can still get through it all sober and am so grateful for that today.  And I know that somehow things will work out."

I wanted to see if there is anybody out there working as a professional ecologist that could maybe give me some guidance on finding a paying job in the field. I'm seriously at the point of being about to give up. I'm American and I finished my Master's degree last year in the UK. My undergrad ecology degree was done in the US and I have about two years of internship experience working in the UK, France, and to a smaller degree the US. I received good grades for my Master's degree and did make some good contacts which were mostly related to academic research laboratories. I have the right to work in the US and the EU because I'm married to a French woman and currently live here. The problem is that I have applied to tons of job ads and haven't had a single person show interest except for a couple of PhD interviews. It seems like all the jobs listed on USAjobs.com require 3 years of experience to start out and I'm not sure where else to look in the US or EU. I don't know if it's a gov. funding issue, but it seems like the BLM, Forest Service, National Parks, etc.  are all not hiring graduate positions. Any advice someone could give me would be extremely helpful, because at this point I'm starting to get really discouraged after over a year of searching. I'm where I can't continue to work for free to gain experience and I don't really care specifically what kind of job I find as long as it is somewhat ecology related. Does anybody have some advice they could give me? I'll be happy to provide more details if anyone is interested.

P.S.- I've searched this board and found previous posts similar to mine and tried to use this information already."
1nfj5t,9,2013-09-30,What do you guys do when your suicidal thoughts start to get out of hand?,[deleted],bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1nfj5t/what_do_you_guys_do_when_your_suicidal_thoughts/,"I've been diagnosed with Bipolar 2, hospitalized twice in the past year and a half for suicide attempts.

It's three in the morning and all I can think about is how much I don't want to be alive. I haven't felt this way since I was last hospitalized exactly a year ago. The thoughts have resurfaced in the past month, and I don't really know who to talk to. I dumped my boyfriend of almost three years last week because I feel like I've been looking to him too much for affirmation and that I need to learn to provide that for myself, on my own. I've also lost hope that being in a relationship will ever work out for me. We're still on speaking terms, but my mind keeps telling me that he won't care enough to help me after everything I put him through. I don't have very many friends and I'm too embarrassed to approach the few that I do have.

Everyone thinks that I've improved, but I don't feel any different, and I don't want to let them know that. I have building anxiety about how I'm going to handle my current internship and college, which I've dropped out of about three semesters already, I think. I've lost count.

I have a constant sinking feeling in my chest. I randomly break down and it lasts for hours or days on end. I feel really worn out, and the ideations are getting worse. I""m also off my meds, which I know, bad move.The only positive is that I've been going to group and individual therapy for the past year, so I think it's taught me to have a better hold on not being impulsive and binging on alcohol or drugs like I used to. Instead, I'm here on r/bipolar.

Although in the meantime, I've been smoking joints/spliffs to relieve myself. But of course, it doesn't always help or last.

1nffut,47,2013-09-30,7 advices I wish I knew when I joined a company,ewaitsme,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1nffut/7_advices_i_wish_i_knew_when_i_joined_a_company/,"After leaving university, I already had a full time job in one of the biggest FMCG Company. I also had before some internships in different companies, industries and countries. Yet, it took me some time to understand what are the key principles which will help me to succeed in the company ladder. Maybe you are lucky to have a boss to tell you this from the very beginning, I wasn’t. I needed to learn those hard lessons myself. I want to share my lessons with everyone who hasn’t started career yet or wants to improve it.

1. This is your life and your career, so you are the one responsible for it.

Once I joined the company I failed into the illusion that if I will do a good job people will appreciate it, especially my boss. Nothing more wrong. Once you are hired, you are like a product – you need to promote yourself, you need to take care of the endorsements from relevant parties, check opinions especially that negative ones and be sure that you have sufficient amount of all of the actions.

2. Be proactive

You don’t need to have your own business, to be an entrepreneur. In reality, entrepreneurship is a state of mindset which is highly wanted in the companies. Every time you will come to your boss or simple propose and EXECUTE some new idea, project which will help your department, organization, boss, etc. you will get enormous credit. You will get incremental recognition of amazingly motivated and committed employee. Of course,  you cannot forget about advertising – spend sufficient amount of time promoting your project even before you start.

3. Know yourself

Be aware what you are good at, what is driving you, what is your passion. Try to find as many projects as possible which you can do with passion, as those will be those truly successful ones. If you don’t think about what you bring to the table, then you don’t get a seat there. On the other hand don’t be embarrassed to say “NO”. It is better than not delivering on time or at all. People will rather understand “NO” then broken promise.

4. Develop your emotional intelligence and soft skills.

Soft skills include positive attitude, team work, ability to handle conflicts, interpersonal communication, negotiation. According to research for 61% of managers they are even more important than hard skills. Try to work on those skills, check available trainings, ask for feedback. The higher you will go on the corporate ladder the more you will need those skills.

5. Help your boss.

”You can get everything in life you want if you will just help enough other people get what they want.” – Zig Ziglar, Secrets of Closing the Sale. This is especially true with your manager. The more supportive, helpful and open for feedbacks and his/her needs you will be the better chance for reward in promotion, salary increase or other opportunities. Managers are the closest to us and have the biggest influence, therefore, instead of thinking only how you can succeed think how you can help your boss succeed.

6. Find out what is hot

Companies are like Fashion Shows – each year you have new trends and collections. One year it is important to focus on market share, other year ROI or digital media spending. There is always some topic which is hot and trending, and this is the one you should focus. Don’t go to any other direction before you know everything about the new trend and you use it regularly. Don’t go against the crowd – if everyone is wearing red and blue you will simply look like weird wearing any other color…

7. Be the expert. Be well known!

Be the expert 9-5 and then go more mile – attend conferences, events, meetups or any other events to learn more and to connect with co-workers. You will be able to learn, develop relationships and have more to talk about at the office. Remember – people are hiring and promoting people not tables and numbers.

The few activities that I do enjoy are often solitary (studying, video games, exercising), but I long to desensitize socially so as to have more options. Currently, my social anxiety limits me from joining clubs, playing sports, and just trying out new things in general.

I want to branch out of my mainly academic, solitary hobbies, but I'm too scared to make the jump into social situations. On the other hand, I'm tired of engaging in my usual activities. Thus, I end up doing nothing all day, and my social avoidance often ends up triggering panic attacks. (This explanation of my problem just dawned on me as I typed this; hooray for introspection!)

Now onto my main question:

People tell me that I should find work to consume my time and distract me from my anxiety. Now, I'm fully capable of working - I've held an internship before - but I can't help but feel that I should be able to spend my free time outside of work. So: Is it important to be able to fill my free time with non-work activities, or is work ""supposed to be"" our primary time sink?"
1nf8s9,14,2013-09-30,Starting in the CS field as a 28 year old,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nf8s9/starting_in_the_cs_field_as_a_28_year_old/,"I began in the city/environmental field and after finding out I didn't like the bureaucracy and the attitudes, but I liked the GIS (hence my lead-in to programming), I decided to pursue CS as my new career.  I enrolled in my local community college which has a joint program with a local 4 year university.  I love what I am doing, but I want to know where to go from where I am.  Their curriculum has programming, networking, and algorithms as the main requirements.  I am hoping to specialize in security as it captures my interests.  I am new to the programming world at 28 and a female (which I understand is viewed as a disadvantage in some places with affirmative action stereotypes) though I have no kids or anything so I can put lots of effort into the field now though again I may be viewed as ""older"" and not quite what some are used to.

I was told that I can't expect to get a technology job in my first year.  I am in school part time to accommodate work, though I lost my job a few weeks ago and am scrambling to find work and do okay in school.  I am really hoping to get something that can start me as a paid intern and progress to a full CS person.  Is this unrealistic?  I have posted my information a few places and decided I am indeed not ready for entry-level but I learn fast and will benefit from internship stuff.

So, here is what I am needing advice on:
1.  Where do I begin as a novice career-wise?
2.  Can I reasonably find a job in the field anytime soon, especially given the fact that I need to find a job ASAP?
3.  What can I do to appear as a better person to an employer?
4.  How can I avoid the ""older"" and ""affirmative action female"" stereotypes that may make things feel uncomfortable when looking for work?"

Thanks in advance.

I started taking Vicodin when I underwent surgery. The usual 500mg stuff, 2 would get me high and it was awesome. Soon I was taking them recreationally but when I prescription ran out, I kinda stopped. I was 18 at the time. 

My friend got his hands on his grandmothers perscription of narcos (5mgs of Vicodin) and the fun started all over again. But once again, we stopped when the pills ran out.

By age 20 I found my own hook who was supplying me 10mg Vicodin at $3 a pop. I had a 9-5 job with a more than decent income to pay for my habit. And at 5$ a pop normally, I felt like I was doing nothing wrong. What's wrong with having fun after a longs days work, right?

I was always a hard worker. Regardless of the narco abuse, I was pushing a 9-5 job to pay my bills while going to college as a full time student. Night times were my pay off. Hang out with the boys, party, poker, whatever.

Soon the voice came into my head, ""you've had a long ass day. You deserve a break. Take the Vicodin, wind down and relax."" 

I listened.

By age 21 I was associating every single free moment I had to getting high. Gotta finish my school projects? Do it high, it'll be fun. Gotta go to work on the weekends? Do it high, it'll make time pass. What's wrong? No days off? Going to school and working 7 days a week? Well get high, it's your way of relaxing.

And it was working for sometime. I didn't seem to have a problem with any of it. It all felt right. Why shouldn't I get high? I work my ass off all day long, I deserve this.

But then I met my girlfriend... Architect student, doing a 5 year school program, staying up till 4am in the morning going to school at 8am and working on her off days and never once had she touched drugs (aside from weed). 

I was stunned. She reminded me of a better me. I believe that honesty and trust are the primary ingredients in any relationship, so I was upfront with her. I never lied about my Vicodin use... In the beginning...

By the 6 month mark she sat me down for a talk. She was concerned. She believed that drugs have their time and place but too much of anything makes you an addict. She was right, I've never been the kind to have an ego and argue for the sake of covering my ass. I agreed with her. After all, she was right.

She told me that I had to stop. And either I chose Vicodin or her. She knew it would take some time so she offered to help and stick through it as long as I made efforts to get out of the habit. I agreed.

I realized that day that in order to stop any type of addiction, you must love something more than the addiction. And I loved her.

I began to ween myself off. Twice a day became once a day. Once a day became every other day. Every other day became weekends. Weekends became once in a while, until finally I was free. I had rid myself of that fucking devil in my head. Or so I thought.

I had been clean for about 3 weeks, and had been on the recovery process for about two months when it happened.

An old coworker called me. He had back surgery and the docs wouldn't fill up his prescription. The man was in pain. So I helped him. Called my old hook, did the exchange for em. Felt like a good person and went on my way. But it just couldn't end there. 

He called again. And again. And again. To the point where I thought, hey fuck it, if I'm going through the trouble, might as well get a reward from it.

A starving student in college, pushing a part time job, full time at school and interning on the side. I was working my ass off and had nothing to show for it. I was hardly making enough to cover my own ass in bills and I could never take my GF out. I felt justified in my decision. I was still getting $3.5 for the narcos (10mg) but I decided to sell to him for $5.5 each. 

For a time it was all good. I would get about $100 everytime he would ask to reup. I'd use that money throughout the week, a Starbucks here, a Jamba Juice there. Taking my girlfriend out to new restaurants and cities on the weekend. It was nice. I was seeing a return on all my fucking back breaking days and nights of working.

But then I slipped up. 

My grandma passed away, and it was rough. My brain is a hell of a rationalizer and listened to him. I used for the first time in a while to cope with my grandmas passing.

Fast forward a year and I was up to 8 narcos of 10mg hydro at one time to get high. I came so close to just upping to oxys cuz it would be easier than swallowing 8 f*cking pills, but I kept telling myself If I go to oxys, I'm never coming back.

I am, what some would call, a functioning addict. Knock on wood, but I'm in my senior year of collage, have had 3 internships, and am now in the process of transferring from the graphic design company im at, to a better one and even freelancing on the side. I'm by no means making a lot of money, but I'm doing what I love. I still have my beautiful girlfriend, my family and sadly I'm still lying to them.

Unfortunately I've become way too good at that. No one knows I use. I told my friends but they can't do much to help.

So, the current situation... I've been lurking this sub for 4 months now, and I've tried quitting a few times. Longest id gone was 1 month. But now I'm trying again.

I knew I had to stop when I started dropping hundreds of dollars every paycheck for it. I knew I had to stop when I started begging my dealer to ""just let me please get $50 worth. Just this one time.""  

I'm tired of being emotionless, tired of only thinking about the next fix. I'm tired of running. I'm tired of escaping. Tired of lying to everyone. Tired of associating everything I do with them. I'm tired of having forgotten what it's like to be ""normal"".

I knew I couldn't go cold turkey. So I set a plan. For the past month I've been lowering my usage. What started with almost 10mg hydros is now down to 4. This last week I was at 3 10mg hydros to keep the withdrawals at bay. 

Today was my first day completely sober. Yes, it hurts, yes my mind rationalizes. Yes my body feels fucking broken. Yes my nose is running like crazy. Yes I can't sit still for the life of me. But I'm sober, and I'm trying to stay that way.

I know this is nowhere as bad as heroin or oxycoton, but it's my hell. I just wanted to post today, and let u all know, I'm here with you all. I hope I can be the person everyone thinks I am. I sure as hell will try.

TlDr: started Vicodin at age 19, had been using off and on since, had been abusing Vicodin 10mg at 10 at a time for the past year, 1 day clean today, and a lot of bullshit Inbetween.

So, I (F/17) and my boyfriend (18) have been long distance for about 2 months now (together for 2 years), because we're going to school on opposite sides of the US.

Obviously it's really hard. But it's made harder by the fact that I'm going to a really difficult school and having a lot of trouble adjusting. I've never been genuinely afraid of failing classes before, but now I am. I don't know if I'll get used to the work load, but right now it's making me miserable. What breaks my heart is that he sees how sad I am and he doesn't want me to be somewhere that makes me so stressed.

How can I stay here when I'm so sad and he doesn't want me here either? And when literally any time I could pack up and move back to him?

The only reason I have is that this school is most likely the best opportunity I'll have for an education. It's a really good school with really great research / internship opportunities and yadda yadda yadda. But I'm starting to think that isn't enough reason to stay.

In most situations I feel like I know deep down the right thing to do. But I actually have no idea with this. I'd appreciate some help. :(

-----

EDIT: Thought I should add one more detail. Another troubling thing is that I have a full scholarship to this school, and would likely be taking out loans if I went back. (I or my family have pretty much no money, at all.) I left this out in the interest of word count, and because honestly, I'm used to my family being poor / in debt so although debt would suck, it doesn't scare me to death."

One year ago I met this guy one night and we immediately hit it off. It started as a hook up and we just couldn't stay away from each other after that. About a month later I went 8 hours away to college. We Skyped every night and became really close and were dating, even though it was never official because he had some issues caused by his last relationship that he couldn't get over. 

Anyway, things ended around Christmas in a huge fight and we went 6 months without talking. In the mean time, I dated one guy for a short time and am now dating another man. Me and my current bf, have been dating for 3 months and are very hopeful for a long future together. 

Here's the problem: My ex is now back in my life. He's been here for a few months but we are just now starting to really talk again and it's so nice. He's opening up more than he did and we joke about the past. He's told me that he misses me and regrets some of the choices that were made. And I'm caught because he was the first guy I've had a fire for, and it never really died. But I don't know if it's because I still love him or because he was the best sex I've ever had and I'm dying to have that again.

Not that my current love life isn't good but it's just... my ex does this thing to me. I don't want to lose him out of my life again and I really do enjoy having him around but he's making me double think my current relationship, especially if I even love him because there isn't the same flame. I know it's stupid but I so desperately want one more night with my ex, but i'm sure that would just turn into one more and one more. 

It's basically how I'm living my entire life. Unpaid internship vs. paying job, college vs. traveling... it's all about planning for the future. I want the instant gratification of having my ex back now, but I just know that it could never work out between us. We want different things and we are different people. And my bf is the future, I can see myself with him in a long time, we get along and have similar values and want the same things. 

I'm just sad and torn because on the one hand, I really want to try again with my ex even though I know it wont' work. I just want him back. But at the same time, I can't think about giving up my current bf. 

It's a really stupid conundrum but I just needed to get it out because I haven't had anyone to tell and it's been weighing heavy on me. "

Lets start with a little background... I am currently AD USAF, I have two years left and plan on majoring in Computer Science with the GI Bill when I get out. The reason I desire to get the certificate is for internship prospects while I am going to school. In your opinion, would an employer likely employ me part time or be more inclined to chose me for internship opportunities with a cert while pursuing the BSCS?

Also,
I would be getting the cert from UCSD extended campus. They have certs in Java, C#, C/C+=, Mobile Dev. ect. The reason I chose C/C++ is that in my understanding, it is the basis for most programming languages. I have heard that it will help you better understand how code works with the PC, thus I will become a better programmer in the long run. Should I possibly pick a different language?


THE CERT WILL BE FREE! It seems like a no-brainer, but the battle lies between getting more of the general education credits done or taking the time to complete the cert in order to be better prepared for internships. "

Haven't gotten the writing score yet, but I feel that I will get a 3.5-4.0 based on sample essays I've seen. I'd like to continue with Aerospace for a Ph.D., but I don't know how high or low to set my sights. Here are my ""stats"":

GRE: 154V/169Q

GPA: 3.915

Area of interest: Computational fluid-thermal-structure interaction. I'm including looking at programs of pure CFD or computational solid mechanics.

Internships: One this past summer for a gas turbine company, but I was applied to more of the manufacturing side of things.

Research: I've only just started this year, so by the application deadline I feel I won't have much to talk about. I'm dedicating 10 hours a week to it, so it's at least more than what some peers I have talked to do. Plus, the research is intended to give me a jump start on my Ph.D. if I continue on here.

Other relevant work experience: I was a math tutor in our math learning center for three years.  I'm using this as a major selling point in my personal statement to show that I'm not as bad at technical communication as my GRE Verbal indicates.

So where should I set my sights?  How much of a bottleneck is my GRE Verbal and very limited research going to be?"

Cyril walked around the conference room, putting each suitcase in front of each chair, making sure that the clipboard was chained to the handle, and that the sign verification tools were attached to the biometric locks. No point having a sign-on bonus if someone else took them. 

The first one to enter was Doctor McMahon, with a furious look on his face. Before he could open his mouth in protest, Cyril silenced him and directed him to one of the chairs. Next up was Doctor Hofstadter and Steven Penley, followed by Marcy, Vreta, Joseph and finally Faust, flanked by two large men in OIS field gear.

""If everyone would like to take a seat, we can get started, thankyou.""

Doctor Hofstadter looked around, disapprovingly assessing the people arrayed around the room.

""And why would I have been taken away from my important research to 'hang around' with sycophants, wretches and the mentally infirm?"" he inquired angrily.

""That's not what your budget allocation for the last quarter says, Arthur,"" retorted McMahon acidly. Startled, he turned to face McMahon, and with one finger pushed his glasses back up to the bridge of his nose.

""Hmm, well, I didn't see the esteemed Doctor Geoffrey McMahon enter the room, my apologies.""

Cyril waited as they talked amongst themselves to settle down. It only took thirty-five seconds, oddly enough.

""Good morning, everyone. My name is Cyril Taylor, and you've all been invited here for the purpose of hopefully engaging in gainful employment with-""

""But I already have gainful employment,"" Doctor McMahon chimed in effortlessly.

""-with a new initiative being headed by myself. Before I continue, I'll need signatures from everyone on the form on the briefcase there.""
The assembled group simultaneously flicked through the contract laid out in front of them. Marcy and Faust signed immediately, while the rest dallied.

""This looks like a bigger version of the standard nondisclosure agreement I took when I signed on - why the extra contract?"" Steven asked aloud of Cyril.

Cyril shrugged, wearing a weak smile. ""Sadly, mister penley, I can't even disclose the details of the job offer until you sign that. If you're looking for any extra information, you can simply rest assured that any breach of the NDA will end up with you being sued to an inch of your life. And then shot.""

Several members of the group looked up from signing for a moment. Once everyone had signed, he smiled.

""Alright, now we may as well do some introductions. Not for my sake, of course, but for everyone else's. For the sake of completeness, you may as well be honest with who you are and what you do.""

Doctor McMahon piped up immediately, chest puffed out like a game rooster. ""Hi, my name is Doctor Geoffrey McMahon, you might know me as one of the Engel designers, I designed the Hamshall aquatic assault Engel.""

Doctor Hofstadter cleared his throat with a loud 'harrumph', ""My name is Doctor Arthur Hofstadter and this is Steven Penley. We are scientists.""

""More like glorified fact-checkers,"" grunted Doctor McMahon.

""That's funny, coming from the coward who toes the line with the big boys,"" Faust spat in.

""Anyway, I'm Ivan Faust. Misunderstood genius,"" Faust commented, lying back in his chair.

""Joseph Wretton, and I have no idea what I'm doing here.""

Cyril sighed, ""What I'm offering to all of you is a position in a new taskforce known as the Ashcroft Lateral Solution Group. You'll be paid handsomely in addition to your regular employment compensation, and you'll be called upon to provide support to a number of organisations in a number of positions. For this, we need a varied team. I could have pulled out a goon squad from the NEG military, but I'm a firm believer in crowdsourcing a solution.""

""Anyway, since people seem to be content with letting me talk uninterrupted, how about I provide some introductions as well. To my left, we have one Vreta Smith. He's a parapsychic, as you may have guessed courtesy of that Star of David analogy on his arm there.""

Vreta looked down at the parapsychic identification tag on his arm and rubbed it sheepishly - as a parapsychic that could manifest Class Two powers, identification was required on him at all times by law. He smiled nervously and put his hands on his lap, rubbing them together.

""This young fellow here,"" pointing to McMahon, ""Is one Doctor Geoffrey McMahon, PhD in Xenogenetics. As he already mentioned, he recently finished work on a subset of the Engel Project, and his work can be most prominently seen on the Hamshall Engel shown on the news.""

McMahon bowed as much as was possible from the seating position, with a slight smile, as if being called to the podium for a keynote speech.

""This young man here is mister Joseph Wretton, and-""

""I'd rather not talk about what I can do, Cyril."" Joseph replied meekly.

""If it's a matter of secrecy, mister Wretton, then you can consider myself and anyone else here complicit in our affairs, and some of us here have far more to lose than you do.""

There was a tense moment of silence as the two locked eyes for a moment, and then Joseph relaxed.

""Fine, whatever. Speak your piece.""

Cyril smiled, somewhat smugly, ""Joseph is what we classify as a metaterrestrial - someone who exhibits superhuman abilities. Joseph is capable of storing things in extradimensional space, and also 'teleportation'"" as he made a quotation mark gesture with his fingers.

""Well that's quite impressive, have you subjected it to some experimentation?"" Steven piped up.

""Some."" Joseph replied tersely.

""Moving on, we have Doctor Arthur Hofstadter and Steven Penley, two researchers from our Combined Engineering department. Doctor Hofstadter specialises in Applied Arcanotechnology, and Steven is currently doing his doctoral internship with us. Next, we have Mister Ivan Faust, most recently of the Office of Internal Security's Alpha Four Detention Facility, released to us on group recognisance.""

""You mean the bioterrorist Ivan Faust?"" Joseph raised his voice.

""I'll have you know that none of the pathogens I created in the past were anything more than test subjects. If they had escaped - a situation that would not have come about in any situation where I was in control - the lifespan of those virii would not have and could not have spread with enough speed to threaten any major population centre. I could have loaded a canister of it into the air vents at Central and the virus would have completely died by the time it got to Maybourne, and the most you would have felt was a slight tickle in your throat.""

""At which point it would have killed everyone?"" Joseph bit back.
Faust chose to respond by sticking his middle finger up at Wretton.

""As it stands, I believe that the scientific and medical benefits gained by mister Faust far outweigh any potential dangers posed by his scientific or magical curiosity,"" Cyril calmly stated.

""Last, but not least, we have one Marcy Rocket. Now I'd like you all to remain aware of the NDA you signed, as Marcy comes to us through an old friend of mine. She has certain unique talents that combine to make her, shall we say, your heavy hitter, if the need arises. Marcy, could you please show everyone your talent?""

Marcy stood up, and pushed the chair back. Taking a step back, she focussed her mind, and began to change. Appearing from her pores, as if sweated out of some gland that humankind never had, her skin became darker, redder, like the blood oozing from a vein. She grew taller, much taller, from a six foot tall human, to an eight foot tall creature of alien origin. Her hair disappeared, subsumed into her dark, calloused hide. Her mouth and nose disappeared, shielded and covered by a thick, bony plating extending from where her nose was to her chin, and swept back and wide like some sort of strange mane. Two large leathery bat-like wings swept back, unfurling to their full length, before it all disappeared and in an instant was replaced by the young woman that everyone knew as Marcy.

Silence fell on the room, punctuated only by the message tone of Marcy's phone. She got it out of her pocket, took a look at it, and absentmindedly put it back in her pocket.

Everyone except Cyril, Hofstadter and Penley scrambled back as fast as they could, rapidly opening up a distance between themselves and Marcy.

""What the fuck was that!?"" Shouted several members of the assembled party.

""What she is,"" Cyril remarked, emphasising gender, ""is your defence in the off chance that something that's immune to bullets won't give you the pleasure of laying down and dying. But in any case, now that I've told you what you could be doing, should you say yes, I'd like you to open that case in front of you.""

There was the muted clacking sounds of a number of briefcases being opened.

""Well now,"" commented Doctor Hofstadter greedily. In each of the briefcases, there were rows of banknotes.

""Consider that a sign-on bonus, or at the very least a thankyou for coming, should you choose not to take the job offered to you. Know that that's only a six month advance on your paycheck, by the way.""

""How much is in here?"" Vreta asked.

""Two hundred and fifty thousand terranote,"" Cyril remarked off-handedly.
There was a moment of silence as everyone in the conference room took in just how much money that was sitting in front of them.

""How can you afford all this?"" Joseph asked incredulously.

Cyril smiled warmly as he leaned back in his chair.
""This is the Ashcroft Foundation. We own the world.""

1neu5d,24,2013-09-29,[CthulhuTech] ALSG 1-1: In which the group comes together,nerdyogre254,gametales,https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1neu5d/cthulhutech_alsg_11_in_which_the_group_comes/,"**Apologies in advance for breaking this up, the first hour of game time is 5000+ words. This is the story of my CthulhuTech group, and their complex-as-fuck adventures. The game takes inspiration from shows like X-files, Fringe and Warehouse 13.**

Fourteenth July, 2086. The analogue clock sitting on Cyril's desk ticked over to nine AM, and he made one final check on his peek as to the people he would be hiring today. Times were unusual, and so, unusual approaches were required. Hence, the Ashcroft Lateral Solution Group. In his younger years, he would have hoped for an assignment like this - but he would have preferred to be on the other side, not managing people. Only because everyone else was dead or mad did he take the job. 

""Beggars can't be choosers,"" he told himself as he skimmed through the names. He chuckled slightly at the silliness of that statement - he was hardly a beggar by any material definition of the word. But if only to keep his mind busy, he scanned through the names one more time.

A jail cell door slammed open, jolting one Ivan Faust to wakefulness. He turned over, removing the scratchy wool blanket and stood up as several prison guards in body armor and shock-sticks moved into the cell, along with someone else - another bureaucratic type, here to try and beg some kind of information out of him. He stood at ease, unwashed blond hair lying flat as his blue eyes narrowed. A sneer covered his face as the trumped-up little bitch in front of him handed him a piece of paper. That sneer disappeared instantly as he saw what the paper contained was.

The doorbell buzzed for the small brownstone apartment, totally unheeded by the Nazzadi boy upstairs apart from a surly groan. He dimly heard the door open, and an unfamiliar voice talking to his adoptive mother.

""Vreta, honey?"" His mother called out from downstairs.

""Yeah?"" the boy groaned drowsily.

""Some men from the Ashcroft Foundation would like to talk to you, can you come down?""

""Sure, give me a tick."" He replied, rolling out of bed. He fumbled around in his drawers for his papers - being a registered parapsychic meant carrying identification at all times, and he'd already been caught out once. Rapidly throwing on some clean clothes, he hustled down the stairs to find several law-enforcement types and one short lawyer-type standing in the hallway. 

""Before you say anything,"" Vreta mentioned aloud, ""The cops already asked me about the fire on 91st street last week and they know I wasn't even in the area, so don't bother.""

""I'm sorry, mister Smith, that's not what we're here for,"" said the lawyer-type, ""In fact, we were here about a job offer for you.""

Vreta, being a Nazzadi White, normally looked like the kind of person you could lose in a snowstorm, but the unusual nature of this event made him even whiter than before. ""A job, you say?""

""Indeed. If you'd like to come with us, we have a job offer that we'd like you to consider. We promise it won't take very long, and we'll drop you home when you're done.""

Vreta looked at the men, and to his somewhat pensive mother, and shrugged.
""Sure, let's go.""

The training room was silent save for the inhales and exhales of its single occupant. Marcy Rocket, more commonly known as 'Chiro', remained focussed on a tiny speck on the opposite wall as she did her pull-up bar exercises for the morning. Sweat ran down her forehead - part exertion, part nerves - as she passed into the thousands. Truth be told, she had lost count a while ago and was simply going until she could either stop worrying about it or wasn't capable of lifting herself anymore. As she pondered adding more weight to her legs, the door to the training room were pushed open, and her pack leader, a devilishly enticing Nazzadi woman by the name of Yan-Yu Shi, strolled in. Yan-Yu looked slightly concerned, and the folder in her hands had the marking of a reassignment.

Realising that the time had come, and in fact she would not be exercising to exhaustion, Marcy dropped from the raised bar and took the folder with a resigned sigh.
""Don't be worried, hanma,"" said Yan-Yu, using a term of endearment that could only mean rough times ahead, ""We all have to step outside our comfort zones once in a while.""

Marcy didn't respond, knowing that Yan-Yu believed in the old platitude as much as she did - which was to say very little.
""First sign of trouble and I'll be carving a path straight back here and taking Lorekeeper Praan's head for myself,"" promised Marcy.

""I wouldn't blame you - I've never known the man to owe or request favors, but apparently he did, once upon a time,"" Yan-Yu said consolingly.

Marcy grumbled irritably as she hit the showers. Just because she didn't have a comfort zone anymore didn't mean she didn't hate this plan.

Doctor Geoffrey McMahon strolled out of the psychiatrist's office with a smile on his face, until he rounded the corner at which point it left him faster than the cheerleader he had his eye on in senior year of highschool. He didn't see the point of doing these constant psychiatric evaluations. His mind was like the Hoover Dam, and even the pressure at the height of the Engel Project was barely enough to cause any kind of problems. Two hours with that effeminate fool Withers had left a bad taste in his mouth. Pausing by the oversized motivational picture on the wall, he turned his phone back on. Almost immediately, an email popped up on his screen, with an attachment. His PA had sent along a calendar change and some kind of form for him to peruse. Opening it up on his screen, he mumbled absentmindedly as he read the attachment.

""Dear sir, blah blah blah, formal writing, blah blah blah, project completed, blah blah blah, lateral solutions group, blah blah blah, urgent meeting, blah blah blah, REASSIGNMENT?""

Lightning quick, he phoned his secretary, oblivious to the fact that several nearby office workers were now staring at the somewhat agitated scientist as he put the phone to his ear.

""Where, what and why, Judy? What do you mean they didn't say? As in they didn't say or they used really long words you didn't understand? Well now I know. Thankyou.""

He hung up and put the phone in his pocket, and started off towards the administrative offices. Whatever this was, it had better be important, because science wasn't going to be revolutionised all by itself.

Gulping down his morning tea of brandy-laced coffee and a plain bagel, Doctor Arthur Hofstadter reviewed the calculations provided to him by other researchers. He grumbled and cleared his throat as he realised that yet again, he was correcting the stupid mistakes that people too big for their own boots missed because they thought they were thinking about the 'big picture' and instead were pretending that they lived in a fantasy universe where engineering and physics were merely second opinions on their glorious master plans.
He scrumpled up a leftover piece of paper and tried to throw it in the bin under his desk, however his damned sausage fingers caused the paper to slip out of his hands at the wrong time and instead rolled to a stop near the wastepaper basket. Grunting in frustration, he rose his corpulent weight out of his chair and knelt down to get under the desk to fix it.

""Doctor?"" a familiar voice called out from the entrance to his office.
Doctor Hofstadter yanked his head up in reflex, only to find that his desk was still in the way. Newton's Third Law rapidly resolved this situation, leaving Doctor Hofstadter with a sore head.

""Bloody bastard! Yes, m'boy, what is it?"" He said as he climbed back up to a standing position. At his door was Steven Penley, his intern.

""We've been rescheduled and reassigned, sir, and we have a meeting with the new project head in an hour.""

""Are you serious?"" Arthur asked incredulously.

""Completely, sir.""

""Well then,"" he said, sighing exasperatedly, ""Let's pack up our things and get moving.""

Joseph Wretton stood outside in the morning light, looking up at the building before him, emblazoned with the Ashcroft Foundation Logo. He wondered how these people had known about him and his unique - truly unique - skillset. Not that it particularly mattered after all. What really mattered, was how to find the damn room that he was supposed to be meeting this job offering person in. He mentally shrugged, and wandered on into the building.

1net6g,35,2013-09-29,How to prepare for a Google Intern interview?,PaperBagPancake,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1net6g/how_to_prepare_for_a_google_intern_interview/,"So my boyfriend has an interview (Two technical interviews) with Google for an internship. This is his first interview for any internships, and it's with Google, so he's a bit nervous. He's in his third year of university, double majoring in honors computer science (software engineering) and math. He hasn't done any internships yet. He doesn't have much extra curricular projects done, so he doesn't have that going for him. But he's one of the top students at the school, with a major GPA of 12.9 (~99%). He's very knowledgeable and intelligent, and I believe he will do very well in his interviews.

At this point, since he has an interview already, how will his lack of extracurricular projects affect his chances?

Out of curiosity, how many people get interviews? I'm aware that google had 1500 positions for interns, with 40,000 applications for the summer of 2013. But I couldn't find out how many of that 40,000 got interviews. Basically, just wondering if it's fairly common for any decent student to get an interview, or if he's already doing well so far. Either way, he's happy to get the interview at all.

How can he prepare?
I actually purchased ""Cracking the Coding Interview"" for him a couple weeks ago, which he is now using to study before he gets the interview. I know it's more for a full job, but it won't hurt at all.

How can I help him prepare? I'm not in computer science, so I'm not familiar enough to help him in depth, but I'm doing my best to support him.

Thank you."

After searching with no luck, I thought that Reddit would be a good place to look. The questions are as follows: What is a normal work day like? Do you like your job? What college did you go to? What is the hardest part of your job? What is the easiest part of your job? What is the beginning salary? What is the potential salary? Would an internship help? Do you get any benefits? (As in dental, medical, etc.) Do you travel? Does knowledge of a foreign language help? What was your favorite project to work on? Your name would also help me, you can PM it to me if you don't want it made known to the public. Thank you for the help."
1nerwl,7,2013-09-29,Relocating from Seattle to Bay Area. Should my compensation change?,RelocatingProgrammer,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nerwl/relocating_from_seattle_to_bay_area_should_my/,"I currently earn $105k at a large company in Seattle (actual Seattle, not Redmond).  I have a B.S. in Computer Engineering and 2 years of professional experience (if you include internships).

My company has a Bay Area office and I would like to move there.  I've asked my boss and he said it would be okay - he suggested I visit the Bay Area office for a few weeks before fully committing, to make sure I like it and if so to find a place to live, which sounds perfect.  I haven't asked about compensation.  I've only been with this company for 3 months so I'm shy about approaching the subject.

State income tax is around 10% in California, versus 0% in Washington, and of course rent is much higher there.  I've heard of other companies offering ""cost of living adjustments"" when employees switch offices but I'm not sure what to expect or how to approach it.  I've heard Microsoft offers a 20% adjustment from Redmond to Bay Area, and I've heard my company gives new hires the option to work in the bay area for 10% more (although my offer didn't include that clause).

I feel like a 20% adjustment would make up for both the difference in rent and taxation, but any less and I will be taking a financial hit.  If I don't get any adjustment at all I will still move, but probably begin considering other jobs very soon afterward.  Does anyone have any inside knowledge about similar situations?  I'd just like to know what I can expect and how to approach it."

Bit of background, I'm in my 3rd year of computer science engineering, looking to graduate in 4 years, and I have two internship experiences on my resume already. I'm really interested in seeing a new part of world (considering I've actually never traveled or even been on an airplane before) but also want to ensure I can still get a decent job after graduation (my GPA isn't too dandy).
