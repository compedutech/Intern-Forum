(A am also not directly requesting work via this thread!) I'm a Georgia Tech student, but I'm leaving to take a course in New York City at the end of the summer. I am desperately looking for a temporary job (since I'll be leaving before any legitimate internship or co-op would finish up). I've applied like crazy on campus to the Student Center, CRC, etc., but especially the office jobs (Housing, GTRI offices, etc) are all about who you know.

I tried to do some research on Temp agencies, but I couldn't find anything that looked legitimate. I want to work full time! I've got an awesome background in both office work and teaching (ESL and literacy in low-income preschools), and I can provide references galore. These aren't really skills in high demand for temp work. (Unless someone needs a crash course in how to speak English...) I'd love to have a Nanny position, but that's often who you know as well. Something tells me that most parents aren't about to post a request for someone to take care of their kid on craigslist. 

Repeat: I am not asking for a job in this thread! I am just looking for some tips on finding temp work for the summer. I am not above any job! I thought this could be helpful to some other college students who are only really free for the Summer as well. 

So. Anywhere you know of in desperate need of employees? What's a good temp agency? Any tips on how to secure something within the next month? "

I doubt anyone WILL read this or care, but I am using this as a medium through which I can stave off the mind-numbing boredom here at work. Also, I am actually the worst at April Fool's Day jokes; they range from so poorly disguised, childish, and cliche that I question my own intelligence to wildly inappropriate to even think about let alone mention. So this is the best I can do under the circumstances- TAKE THIS, WORKPLACE!
 
My ""job"" (actually a paid internship) mainly consists of staring out of a window in Sherman Oaks while waiting for the internet to load so that I can update the information in a large database of people. The majority of my time (not spent watching traffic on Ventura) I arbitrarily judge the people whose information I am updating so that I can at least feel something. I think up what I imagine to be witty/insightful comments/observations about them, pretending that they are trolling me from miles away with the inaccurate or outdated information I have to sift through for hours on end. My harsh and baseless criticisms serve as an outlet for my unyielding frustration. The internet on the computer at which I work is atrociously slow; it's inexcusable for a business whose operations rely almost exclusively on the internet to have a connection this slow. However, it's cheaper for them to pay me to do nothing for a few hours a day than to upgrade the connection. So here I sit, watching Internet Explorer (yup. it's THAT bad) struggle to load page after page of company profiles while I scour them for relevant information.

My boss came in halfway through the rewrite, which made this more difficult. *sigh* Why, reddit? Why do we submit ourselves to these things? Why do we toil away at these meaningless positions, debasing ourselves for the sake of someone else's gain? I have seen some of the most intelligent and dedicated people in the world on this site. I have witnessed the power that comes from banding together. Should we not utilize it for good? I suppose we do often... Apologies for the digression.

Complaining aside, all is not lost, reddit. With you, I have hope. You make me smile and laugh and cry and rage and AWWWWWW YEEEEAAAAAAHH, all of which which keeps me healthy and sane. And what's more, today is a special day- a troll's paradise. It's Friday. Yesterday was Thursday. Today is Friday. Tomorrow is Saturday, and Sunday comes after...wards. It's Friday- Fried Egg; gotta get down on Frai-eed Ey-eegg. Everybody's looking forward to the weekend. Partyin' Partyin'- funfunfunfun.

Need some life advice. I'm about to graduate from a top public liberal arts school with a good degree and high honors. Thanks to some ""found money,"" I'm finishing my B.A. with no debt and an obscene (for a broke college kid) amount of money in the bank/invested in mutual funds. I'd like to give a lot of that money to my folks, but they refuse to take anything from their son.

I've got two life plans.

A) Find an internship in political/non-profit organizing/advocacy and go that route immediately. Work for a few years, then go for an M.A. or J.D. once I'm more sure of my professional path.

B) Say ""fuck you, real world"" and try my hat at professional travel writing/blogging. This has been my dream for some time, and I now actually have the financial resources to go and do it. I could put away X dollars in a separate account and say ""If this money is gone and I'm not making decent progress on this career, I can go home and apply to graduate or law school.""

My reservations about plan B: First, I could lose a shit-ton of money that could've been spent on advanced education or put away for my parents' retirement. Second, I'd be giving up the ""normal life,"" my friendships and relationships could suffer, etc. Honestly, though, I've never felt that ""normal life"" would be satisfying for me, so that's not entirely a bad thing.

I'm sorry it was my picture &amp; my blog (which must be boring to 99.99% of the planet) that you guys had to look at trying to verify the info.

&gt;Looks 90% fake to me, heres some evidence in case anyone is curious
&gt;
&gt;1 The picture you posted shows a girl, but you made a few rage comics lately depicting yourself as a guy, and identifying yourself as ""john"". Proof is great, but a picture of a woman with John Stewart proves nothing. (http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu/comments/fzfoj/i_think_my_friends_might_be_fucking_retarded_true/)

&gt;
&gt;3 You posted a picture last month depicting your ""rival track team""; you went back to college to run track after finishing a daily show internship?


**The track team photo was posted one month ago. The OP claims to be a ""stay at home mom"" and has been for some time. Also, it rivals their *male* track team while OP claims to be female**

Food will be provided by the organization.

Unfortunately I don't have any of my own gear yet (freshman, college) and was hoping to get some advice on good deals/brands for the following items:

1) 5000 cubic inch (or greater) backpack. This is the one thing I'd be willing to splurge on, since I'll probably be using it long after this internship. I was thinking army surplus backpacks, just an idea.

2) A pair of leather/waterproof hiking boots.

3) Outer Layer Jacket, fleece or wool.

4) A pair of sturdy work pants (might just opt for jeans).

5) Water proof jacket &amp; pants for rainy days.

6) Sleeping bag (20 degrees or lower) &amp; sleeping pad.

7) A 1-2 person tent (a family friend has one that I can borrow, but just in case that one sucks I might buy my own).

Any and all help would be greatly appreciated!

As far as geography goes this will be in North Western Colorado (Steamboat Springs area) and South Western Wyoming."

I am a rising senior at JMU and am currently enrolled in the SMAD program (School of Media Arts and Design) with a converged/interactive media concentration. So far, I have been taught basic css and html, some experience with photoshop and dreamweaver, and that's it. Within my course studies I will touch lightly on Java and flash, but that seems to be all that is covered. It seems to me that every internship, much less job, has a LONG list of programming languages/softwares that I need to learn or be familiar with in order to be considered for a position. I am most interested in the coding side of web design (back end) because I am not a graphic designer. I can set up a nice layout and edit in photoshop but have no artistic talent for graphic design. I get the feeling I should have been a computer science major, but it's too late...or I may have to consider getting a bachelor in science for a cs degree, which would mean starting all over when I only have 1 year left to get my BA double majoring in SMAD and English. I just don't know what to do!

Please, tell me if you know what the best options I have are. The things I'd like to familiarize myself with are:

- CSS 
- PHP

- Adobe Dreamweaver 
- Adobe Illustrator

-JQuery
-C++

Some background- me and a couple other kids are all interns at a company. We've all been anxiously expecting full-time offers and today our boss pretty much confirmed we were all getting offers and that to let him know what our magic figure was.

So all fine and dandy except after the meetings, me and a few of the other interns (not all) start talking about the approximate figure we should try to give bc we don't want anyone to get really screwed over/lowballed.

What comes up in the convo is our current hourly rates as interns and my peers disclose the same amount as i which is about x amount of dollars. Then one of the interns says that me and another guy (who's not there with us) should be lucky bc we're making x + $10/hr right now. I'm completely baffled? I tell him, no I'm making the same as him. And he lets us know that the other intern is essentially taking $400-500 more than any of us after taxes. And ive been there the same amount of time as him and have generated more money for the company, if not the same, as him.

Now it's not jealousy that's at play here, more a feeling of imbalance. We've been making much less than the guy and and he's a fellow kid (we have no idea whether he had negotiated his intern salary or if our boss gave it to him like that). We've all done the same work, if not more, and as mentioned I have brought more money than him on more than 1 occasion (kind of a sales gig sorta)

So what do I and the interns do about our annual salary? Here we go thinking such a x number was too unreasonable to ask for full-time and this kids been making it as an INTERN.

We're just dumbfounded and dont know why, but obviously won't bring it up to the boss. We could understand if the guy was performing extraordinarily- but nope.

Dont have to upvote or downvote this- some of my fellow workers may be Redditors and this may be way too familiar a story. Just some honest advice or similar situations would be helpful.

Thanks.

Tldr: another intern makes much more money than the rest of us interns and without good reason. He makes more than what we thought was a reasonable full-time salary (before we found out) to ask for, NOW. Unsure what to ask for full-time now."

All of my friends have internships in other cities though, so I don't really know anyone here at all.

Would anyone want to hang out some time in the future? Like I said, I don't really know anyone so I'm just looking for anyone who would be a cool person to hang out with, male or female.

I'm a pretty big nerd, which you can probably tell because I'm on reddit. I usually like to just chill and do nothing(nothing includes literally nothing, relaxing at my computer browsing the web or something, watching movies or tv shows, or hanging out with friends), play games, or program stuff on my computer(I'm a CS major). I also like to just go out and drive around when I'm bored sometimes. I've been wanting to get a little active lately, and while I don't want to join a gym, if anyone would want to just go walk around some where and possibly explore places on foot, that'd be sweet. I'm also extremely humble.

Also, I've never lived in a big city like this before(I've lived in Ann Arbor a few times before but I never went out and did anything, so I don't count that) and I can't parallel park for shit, so that scares me when trying to go anywhere downtown since it seems like that's the only kind of parking there is.

So yeah, is there anyone who lives there who wouldn't mind hanging out with me? I'm not a partier, drinker, or smoker, so I wouldn't want to do anything like that. I also won't be there until the 3rd, and I might be busy a day or two after I first arrive. If you want we could talk online until I get there and am able to actually do stuff.

It's been fun; I'll miss you people.",[deleted],reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/gfy7i/reddit_times_are_hard_and_i_need_to_sell_my/,"I've got a nice Toshiba Portege R705 that I hope will get me the $300 I need to pay rent. It's not that I'd mind being homeless with a kickass computer, but I'm subletting and I have a responsibility to help with the rent for next month. I also need an address to go to school (I'm the poorest economics student ever).

How I found myself here is a long and intricate story, but since reddit loves a good story, I'll do my best to sum it up. I left home the day I turned 18 because I felt like my step-mother hated me. There was always tension because of conflicting personalities, but when I admitted I was an atheist she made it clear I was not welcome. 

I finished high school with good grades, but without financial aid or much support, I didn't go to college. I couch surfed at friend's houses while I worked odd jobs to buy a car I could live in, and in August 2009 I was sleeping in my new 91 Acura Integra. The tags were bad and I didn't have insurance, but it was better than sleeping outside. I only drove it when the streets were empty, and I got by. I ate hospitality and drank favors- I survived like that for awhile.

I took an internship working as a audio technician at a church, of all places. They offered me housing and food if I worked their soundboards and helped with their other multimedia projects. It was an interesting experience and it sustained me for a few months, but I couldn't work at a church in good conscience, so I sold my car, and hitched a few rides north, and by August 2010 I was spending time with the best vagabonds in the country at People's Park.

I enrolled in the city college and applied for financial aid. The aid never came, but I found cheap housing and went to class. I applied for jobs everywhere, but my competition was bona fide Berkeley grads. I found work canvassing for the American Red Cross. The pay was good but the work felt deceptive, so I took my check and left after a month.

My expenses were so low that those checks from canvassing and my savings were enough to get by, but I've been struggling all year. The state still hasn't given me financial aid, but I'm in my second semester studying classes to to transfer to the university.

But now I'm broke. This really isn't an eloquent piece, and I'm not sure why I'm writing it. Maybe to remind you of the nuanced nature of the human condition. I suppose there are a lot of holes in my alibi- I'm a bit scattered right now.

If there are any lessons to learn from me, here is your **tl;dr**

Be connected. Without my friends, I'd be dead somewhere, stiff with rigor mortis and stubborn optimism. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm out of my mind with stress.

How would this work? I have a normal, German driver's license, if that makes a difference. How much would I need to pay and what's the usual procedure?


Thanks!"

Im no expert when it comes to hygiene but ive received some training and im starting to question the methods they are using around here.

For example, when they taste the food, some of them use the same spoon over and over without cleaning it and one of them who tastes foods by dipping his finger in there. If im tasting anything i get a fresh spoon and use both sides of that, then get a new one.

What im worried about is if these idiots can possibly spread disease and what kinds? 
I remember a while back when i was in a lecture this police officer saying how he has to go into some sort of observation over a 6 month period if someone spits in his face to make sure he hasnt been infected with anything. 

So, what do you think, am i overreacting or is it bad? Unfortunately i have a feeling its common to do this :[

Talked to my boss about it, delta was used as the change in time between when a signal was being sent and when a signal was being received. Although the calculation was different than just timeend - timestart. It didn't occur to me that delta could have been the change in time, i thought it would have been a more abstract item.

I'm 21 and have just graduated (well, last December) with a Bachelor of Audio Production. I managed to finish at the top of the class. Got a bit of money for that - which I had to spend on fucking fixing my car. Anyway, I am having a bit of trouble on figuring out to approach writing a CV for getting a job in a studio. It's obviously a different environment and different kind of people than a office or blue collar job. From my experience, studio personel, while professional, are a lot more easy going and pretty open minded. Is it okay to be a little more colloquial than if I was going for an office job?

I guess I'd like advice on what to cover in a CV. What things shouldn't I say? Do I list the give a description on the papers I've done? What desks I've worked with? I'll be giving a Soundcloud link to my portfolio. Should I say what artists I listen to? Provide a picture of myself? 

I am in New Zealand and all the studios are generally at the other end of the country. At the moment I am working an arbitrary job and saving most of my money for gear and money to move. It's sort of a gap year from persuing my career as I am waitng for my GF to finish her nursing degree at the end of the year. I am willing to move to anywhere in the country (likely Wellington or Auckland - currently in Invercargill), but I need a job confirmed this year hopefully so that my GF can start applying to hospitals ASAP. 

Of course I realise that any offers I do get would probably be an unpaid internship. I'd be fucking overjoyed to get that. I just need to get my foot in the door and I think I have a lot of promise.

So, is there any tips or advice you guys can offer me? Thanks for reading!"

If anyone could provide any input, please do share.

** *1) LOR* **

Most of the universities I'm applying to require two letters of recommendation, from either previous professors or employers. First of all, **do you think it's preferable to provide one from each (uni and school), or both from uni profs?** My plan is to provide one from my previous adviser and one from an internship I did in summer 2010.

More background:

I graduated in Dec 2009; worked for a solar company spring-summer 2010 as an intern. I developed a good relationship with my boss, the CEO, and an even better one with the project manager, who was basically a year or two older than me and acted as my supervisor. **Is there a good reason to have the CEO write the recommendation as opposed to the project manager?** I would rather have the latter write it just because we're basically friends, and the CEO speaks English as a second language (his English is pretty much fine, but not perfect).

** *2) CV* **

After said internship, I've relocated, and only done jobs unrelated to renewable energy (my field of choice) since - valet, and a logistics job. I'm currently a valet at a nice hotel, but continuously looking for a real job. Anyway, on my resume, the last 'experience' I have listed is said internship which ended last summer. My current strategy is to leave valet and shit off the ol' resume, but when asked or interviewed, reveal I currently work as a valet (you know, to pay the bills while I look for a real job, which is true). I do have two other internship-like experiences under my belt. My next question is, **do you think this is a good strategy for job searching**, and **do you think I should do the same on my CV when applying to grad programs?**

Thanks reddit; love you.

**Bonus question:** I also have math tutoring experience, both privately and professionally for a legit company, and I have been given advice by HR folks to leave it off my resume. Even though it's not totally relevant, I was surprised - figured it couldn't hurt.... Any thoughts on this?"

I am going to be in the bay area over the summer from late May until late August for an internship in Mountain View working for Google. Basically, I don't really know what things to take into consideration when it comes to housing. My housing budget is somewhere around the range of $1000/month, and if I'm not actually in Mountain View, I need to be able to get to Mountain View by around 9 every day. 

Basically, taking into account travel time, general cost of living, things to do, etc., what might you recommend for a good place to live around Mountain View? I was looking at Palo Alto, Mountain View, and San Francisco, but I really don't know too much about the area.

Some information about me: 

I'm a college student - 20 years old. I prefer to be in a place that's more city-like, with an active nightlife, but I don't mind living somewhere else as long as I can get to a city relatively easily for fun. I really enjoy hiking and biking, and general outdoorsy stuff. I love jazz and play piano, so locations with jazz clubs/a general music scene are a plus. A younger population is a plus, since I'm in college.

Also, do you have any tips, advice, information, etc. for living in the Bay Area, and any suggestions for things to do, places to go, etc.? Good restaurants, local stops I might not find in tourist books, art museums, places to have fun, etc.? I'm open to any suggestions. What kinds of things should I know about food, people, transportation, etc. in the general area?

Thanks so much. "

The following is his report.

---

I've been looking some into Shortform. I haven't seen any mentions of contests in their most recent info, but I found this from December:

&gt;We have launched “The Things Kids Do” Contest and are calling for submissions! Create an account on ShortForm.com and upload a video of your kid in his or her best moment to our collaborative contest channel at http://www.shortform.com/tot.short/my#current_channel The submission period lasts for two weeks and the contestant whose video receives the most thumbs-up will win a $100 Amazon gift card. Take a look at our contest channel at http://www.shortform.com/tot.short/my for ideas of videos to submit. For more details visit http://www.shortform.com/contests/things-kids-do

Given what other people have said about wanting channel views, I have a reasonable suspicion that they have a similar incentive right now for other situations like this.

---

Anyway, I've also tracked down where random people get the idea of ""Reddit"" in their head. There are only a few blogs posts on Shortform, but this is one of them. ""Keys to Creating a Successful Channel"" pt. 1 of 2 (snippet). Some guy's success story:

&gt;And so that was my experience, when I stumbled onto a very popular video. It was a short video, about a minute long, of a few guys playing “Flight of the Bumblebee” on 101 beer bottles, strategically placed around their kitchen. Now, why was this so perfect? For one, it was short. For another, you could tell what was going on as soon as it started. And finally, it was pretty much the closest that you could get to being universally relevant. It was a video of music. No words, just a tune, and whether or not you knew the piece they were playing, you knew it was music, it was fun, and it was interesting.

&gt;Because of these qualities, the video exploded. Now, I found the video on Youtube, listed on their Trends Dashboard, but luckily I caught it and realized its potential before most people did. I added it to my channel, submitted a link on Reddit, and soon enough it jumped to the top of the lists. This was partly on its own merit, and partly because I already had a large amount of link karma accumulated from other links, so people automatically trusted what I submitted. At some point, someone submitted it to Stumbleupon, and the combination of these two sites brought it up to a staggering 68,000 views in a week, and more over time. The most interesting part of this for me was that once the process started, it really carried itself. Once I submitted the initial link, other viewers shared it, submitted it to Stumbleupon and other sites, with very little influence from me, and it became a sensation on its own.

&gt;The trick, then, I think, is to recognize these videos that are seeds to their own success, and plant them first, before they are too widely spread. A video has to be new to be successful, so you have to catch it quickly, allow it to bloom for you, and, well, not for anyone else. That’s what happened with this video for me, and it resulted in a wonderful success.

&gt;Next week we will bring you Part 2/2: Appealing to Specific Interest Groups

So, of the few things that people new to Shortform see, they see ""Submitting a link to Reddit is the way that this guy who is a success got his video popular.""

This is the post that started everything off, I tracked down (his link on Reddit):
http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/fny35/i_wish_i_was_this_creative_and_this_functional/

Personally, this is just my opinion, but, I wouldn't outright ban people who make Shortform links. They don't know any better and they don't know what they're doing wrong. Just remove the links. If they ask, maybe just ignore it.

But we don't need to be up in their face with ""You have been banned from posting,"" when they end up here because they think that's the thing to do. You know, blissful ignorance? They'll just think they weren't successful on Reddit so they'll go elsewhere. Rather than thinking the world has it out for them. Which it does. I guess.

But, yes, Shortform links are no good, least of which is the fact that you can't play the link from your Reddit window. Even beyond that, it's glorified blogspam, and even calling it 'glorified' is glorified.

&gt;NOTE: All the work for this internship could be done at home electronically over the Internet and there are no office hours.

&gt;Description: Love watching online videos? Want to get into the entertainment industry? Want to VJ your own video channel and make money from it? ShortForm (www.shortform.com) is a Silicon-Valley web entertainment company that lets users run their own entertainment business by curating their favorite online videos into channels, sharing them with their friends and the world, and making money based on the performance of their channels. We’re looking to hire marketing interns, with commission, from each major university across the country to expand and promote this business.

&gt;Roles:

&gt;Promoting your ShortForm channel with your friends and social circles on Facebook, Twitter, via email, etc. Note: The videos in your channel do not need to be created by you and can be any YouTube video that you like.

I'm a graduating college senior finishing with an engineering degree and pretty much starting last semester I started to despise my choice in getting an engineering degree.  The only reason I chose engineering was for the job security and I somewhat had an aptitude for math and science but now after some internships I realize that for the next 30-35 years I'm going to be behind a desk, doing shit that I don't enjoy, just so I can have a steady income and because my parents were proud that I chose the career path that I did.  Also, I know as a salaried position you put in more than just a straight 8 hour workday and it pisses me off to know that I won't be able to leave after my 8 hours is done.  Additionally, I've taken a strong interest in the arts whether it's cinema or theatre, since I've been in college, I wondered if it had something to do with an emotional output, but I really didn't know.

I can't help but thinking about Fight Club and Tyler Durden's saying, ""Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need.""  If I could say ""fuck it"" to having a full time job and find something I like I would, but the things I enjoy doing are not profit making activities.  I feel what I ultimately lack is a goal in life.  Every morning I wake up and get out of bed, it's not because I want to, it's because I have to.  

And then there's the problem with attracting the opposite sex.  I feel like when I engage in conversation with a girl,  I can't actively enjoy the conversation without passively thinking ""is there more to this"" or ""should I make a move"".  Whereas  if I talk to a girl with no ulterior motive I enjoy the conversation, but miss an opportunity to possibly make something more than just an acquaintance.  And sometimes I'll think back and remember how the girl I was talking to was really smiling and enjoying what I had to say, I should have gotten her number.  And when I do get a number, there's texts back and forth but when it comes to setting things up, there's always an excuse for why she can't make it out and it's usually multiple times, which I've internalized and stopped pursuing girls.  This inability to just simply connect with people has left me feeling really lonely.  I can have base conversations and idle chit chat with people, but to truly connect doesn't happen, I don't know if this is just due to inexperience or if I'm just being blind and not taking a leap of faith.

I don't want out of a relationship someone simply to answer my problems and take care of me; but for me getting to know someone on an intimate and personal level is what I desire.  I've never had a relationship at all on an intimate level with a girl and as I grow older it's the one thing I truly fear will never happen. "

Right now I am working as a paid SEO intern at a small family run website, www.stretcher.com, we focus on articles that deal with anything from how to cook to finding cheap car insurance, but the main idea behind most of our articles is how you can become more frugal and spend less money. I started working for them about the same time the semester started and I have been trying to help get their site to show up higher in the search results but lately (Partly due to the new “farmer” update) I have found it near impossible to fix the site. 

A little background, I am a college student with an AS who knows almost nothing about SEO, I have been learning what I can from online courses as well as articles/blogs/youtube but I am still very inexperienced when it comes to improving a sites search ranking. Why would I apply for an internship in SEO if I knew nothing about it you ask? Well they kind of asked specifically for someone like me, someone with little to no SEO experience who would, as they put it “Learn on the job”.

The farmer update hit us really hard (We went down 45%), while we have been working to get back to where we used to be, I’m wondering if it’s even possible. 

I think one of our major problems is our high bounce rate, at the moment the average bounce rate is around 85% for the entire site and I am honestly not sure how I could improve it. Right now we are trying to manually add “Related Content” sections to each article that is still doing well after the update, but with over 7500 articles it’s going rather slowly. 

I have also read about how Google (and people) generally don’t like waiting around for a web page to load, and that our long load times (an average of seven seconds per page) might be causing us to lose traffic/be ignored by Googlebot, is this true?

Currently we are working on just putting keywords and re-writing each individual page in an attempt to improve our ranking, but I honestly don’t think that’s our biggest problem. 

If someone could give me some suggestions as to how we could improve our ranking it would be appreciated, I know we could try getting some links into the site but they (the site owners) doubt how effective it would be and would rather have me sit here for hours rewriting articles.

I dated this girl my last year in college for about 9 months. She was like the exact opposite of me - I was liberal, atheist, shy/antisocial; she was conservative, religious, in a sorority. Despite the differences, we were really happy together. Eventually with our graduations looming and mostly my stubbornness, we split up and I took it pretty hard. But I made a promise to myself to become a better person. I started working out, focusing on trying to improve my social/fashion skills, working on being more tolerant/openminded, etc. and to an extremely large extent, I feel I succeeded. One night, I was drunk and facebook messaged her kind of just saying hey and hoping that she was doing better. She ended up coming over and staying the night. Slowly we started talking again via text, pretty much every day. Her texts were always the highlight of my day. I'm working in KS as a chemist, and she's moved to Atlanta, GA for an internship. We start to talk about life goals and how we've changed, etc. and it slowly evolves into a 'hey, you know, we seemed to be much more in line with each other now, maybe there's a possibility this could work this time'. And the sentiment is mutual. I plan a trip to fly down and visit her this past weekend, with the intent of laying the formation for a slow, but potentially great recovery and loving relationship.

Friday night, I get in and we go out drinking. We're being really flirty and having a great time then she just disappears. So now I'm alone in a bar in a foreign land and super confused. After 45 minutes of looking for her, I find her in the backseat of her car with some random guy. She doesn't even know his name, and they're clothed, but I flip out. She says it's not what it looks like, etc etc. We go back to her place, have angry sex, and pass out. In the morning we talk about it; she says she was scared/nervous about me being there, and this is her way of pushing people away when they get close. She says she loves me and wants to be with me, but doesn't think she can offer me what I want/deserve from her. I play the role of the nice guy and say ""alright, well, let's do some sight seeing and rent a movie and take it easy tonight, my flight leaves in the morning."" She thinks that's a great idea and she gets in the shower. While she's showering, I'm laying there and I kind of freak out. I sit up, think to myself ""No, I'm sick of being a good guy and letting girls walk all over me"". So I start to pack my stuff up to head to the airport and leave early. She gets out and asks me what's wrong, and I respectfully let her have it. I tell her that what she did is not okay, and that I came down here with what I felt like was a mutual interest in pursuing a meaningful relationship only to have her pull some insane stunt that hurt me more than I can put into words. She cries and apologizes, and I give her every chance to stop me from leaving, but she doesn't. I walk to the door, without turning to look at her say ""I hope you get everything you want in life"" and walk out. After walking for 45 min trying to figure out where the hell I am to call a cab, I find a McDonalds and start looking up cab numbers on my phone. She calls me. She asks me to come back and talk to her and stay. I comply. We kind of lounge around at her apt for the rest of the day, rent a movie and snuggle and watch it, then go to bed (no sex). We wake up, she takes me to the airport and I leave. She texts me after I leave telling me that she loves me and she's sorry, she just doesn't think she can give me what I want right now, and that she wants to be with me and that she needs me to be a part of her life. I tell her that I wish I could understand that. I tell her that I need some time away from talking to her for a while to try and figure out what I need to do.

I don't know what to do. I feel like my entire motivation to keep waking up and going to work is gone now. I think there's a part of her that wants what I want - the ""well, I'm an adult now and I want to settle down and share my life with someone"" stage but I also think she isn't completely out of that ""I'm young and want to party and meet people and be crazy"" stage either. I don't want to let her go, but I don't want to wait around to be the consolation prize because I might be waiting for nothing. She has always had psychological issues, she's been suicidal/a self mutilator in the past, and I think she's dealing with some of that stuff right now, so I don't want to leave her to deal with that alone, but I can't let myself be dangled along. I guess I just don't know what to do and don't know how to keep on keeping on. I know this was long, but thanks for reading."

My girlfriend is a temp doing entry-level data entry and works more than that. Is this magical 40 hours just a myth, or is it the remnant of a bygone era.

I've been busting my ass looking for internships and jobs, but it's clear to me that if I came in to do the 9-5 every day, that would make me look lazy compared to some fresh-faced jackoff whose willing to brown nose his way to the top.  It's not that I'm lazy, I would just appreciate if employers would be straightforward and say ahead of time that I'm to understand 40 hours a week will NOT be sufficient if I am to advance myself, or even look like I give a shit for that matter.

You’re doing so great, I am so happy for you. You are doing wonderfully. You’re questioning your asssumptions about the world, you are forcing yourself out of your comfort zone, you are making a sincere effort to better yourself. And now it’s time for phase two.
You hate your major. Let’s do something about that. What do you want? Chemical engineering at Standford or Berkeley or maybe evenCal Poly? How are you going to do that? Let’s figure that out. Soon.

You claim you don’t care about this gender BS and what other people think. Then stop caring about your weight. Either you care that you are almost 150lbs or you don’t. Stop lying to yourself about it. Even if you want to lose weight, you need to stop thinking about it so damn much. You are doing this like a grownup now. That means not obsessing. 

Let’s be honest with ourselves here: you’ve been taking narcotics for a year now. Let me spell that out. You’ve been GETTING HIGH every day for a YEAR. Sure, you WERE injured. Did you expect to take these for the rest of your life? No more. If you hurt, you can go crazy and take a damn Tylenol. If you’re too awake, too bad. No drugs to get to sleep. Also, you drink too much caffeine, you’re always dehydrated. Drink more water. 

I don’t give a fuck who you are dating, you are you are you are you and YOU are the ONLY ONE who is going to have to deal with yourself FOREVER. Make DAMN SURE you like who you are becoming.

Why have you started to fake orgasms again? Stop that. NOW. No fucking argument.

Internship. This summer. Get on in. By this weekend, I mean.

Taxes. Pay them. 

I don’t care if it’s depressing, fill out the fucking FAFSA. Look up scholarships. Poor kids with 3.88 GPA’s shouldn’t be freaking out about money. 

Be nice to people. They get scared too.

I love you, you are doing so well.

I'm not exactly intelligent, so university is a serious struggle and it's difficult to find time to build up a decent portfolio so I'll have something to present to employers when I'm out of there.

Also, the software engineering program I'm in forces us to find internships every once in a while and I'm starting to feel the heat of competition. Employers are going to give me a lot less leeway in terms of how lacking in knowledge I am as I progress through uni.

I want to be a game developer. Though, right now my internship has me managing some CRM apps, which I don't particularly mind either. 
Any developing's good, really, wouldn't mind freelancing and doing whatever oddball job I can find. Gaming's where I'd favour, but isn't really required.

Truth be told, I can honestly say my only real experience in programming languages is (sigh) Visual FoxPro because that's what I've been doing the last three months for my internship. I scraped basic SQL from a QA job I had before, but nothing too advanced. I'm attempting to manage a blog, but my HTML, CSS and PHP skills could use some work so I'm really just stealing off a default skin. University / high school led me through C, C++, Java and Scheme (hah), but for whatever reason, I don't feel like you can understand the ins and outs for each language by only doing incredibly tricky one-shot assignments as opposed to a program to be released for public use.

Enough backstory, into the actual questions.

1. What matters more, the number of projects or the size? In other words, would it be better to do a bunch of small little applications (like a bunch of mini-games) or chart out one big project (like a console-ish game)?

2. For those of you that schedule out your hobby projects, what do you do to help you stick to schedule? (University hogs so much time some days...)

3. Does it matter how many languages you know and what each project is based on? Or would I better my time using what I know instead of picking up new languages and their interesting IDEs?"

A considerable portion of our curriculum is interaction design, so one possible career prospect for me would be to go into interaction / usability / interface design. This would be the more science-y route (for lack of a better term).

However, I've also done a large amount of graphic design work. I've worked with a variety of mediums (print, packaging, web). I have a solid grasp on front-end development and a general understanding of backend. My graphic design portfolio is also fairly strong.

My question is, which career route would be better? I don't mind doing either. It seems like doing interaction design would probably pay better (correct me if I'm wrong), and there would be more opportunities for advancements. There's a lot more competition for graphic designers, it seems to be harder to earn respect and move up as a graphic designer since people start from the very bottom level of the hierarchy and stay there for quite a while.

What's everyone's opinion on this? As for people who work in these industries, what can I expect from these career routes?

And lastly. I have had roughly 3+ years of relavant professional experience with very positive references. I don't want to be looking at internship or even junior positions after I graduate. I realize this is a bit ambitious. How reasonable is it for me to apply for intermediate level positions fresh out of school?"

gitf9,98,2011-04-04,There's something in Hawaii.,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/gitf9/theres_something_in_hawaii/,"I know it's cheesy to say ""this story is 100% true"", but in this case it is. I'm a regular redditor and you can look at my comment history if you doubt me. 

Last year I did an internship in Hawaii in agroforestry. I lived on a farm on a lava flow on the Big Island; it was a small place, so it was only the farmer, his dog, and myself living there at the time. This part of Hawaii is mostly uninhabitable due to the lava rock, but the farmer had managed to keep a decent forest of fruit trees going with innovative techniques. He was a bit of a nut, living out there all alone, and was really big on sustainability. The place was powered by solar panels, which worked about 60% of the five months I spent there.

One night, I was walking from the main part of the farm back to my yurt, along the main path. It was a moonless night, and I didn't bother bringing my flashlight as I'm really not afraid of the dark. I was able to navigate by looking up to see the trees to either side of me obscure the stars in the sky. Also, the lighthouse to the south would flash a faint bit of light about every 15 seconds, and I could use it to reorient myself when if I got turned around. The total distance was no more than 1/2 a mile, and it usually took me about 15 minutes to walk.

Now, the place I was living has some history. [See here.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kapoho,_Hawai'i) The lava flow made a ring around a 10-acre patch of rainforest, which they called a ""kipuka"". The idea is that Pele, the goddess of fire, spared this patch of forest because it is spiritually sacred. I worked within the forest for several hours every day, and my yurt sat right on its perimeter.

After about 10 minutes, I reached the point where the little path to my place cut off from the main trail. To help me find the path in the dark, I had tied a piece of white cloth onto a tree branch (I had missed it way too many times) so I knew where to turn. The cloth barely registered in my vision on this night, but it was better than nothing.

The secondary path to my yurt was really narrow and overgrown, so I couldn't use the stars to navigate the rest of the way, but rather had to rely on memory and my outstretched arms as a last resort. It was kind of relaxing and exhilarating at the same time. I liked to pretend that I was an original Polynesian settler- before the introduction of electricity and flashlights.

I had just turned onto my path when I heard something crashing through the trees and brush, about 15 feet ahead and to the left. My first thought was pigs, which often came at night to tear up roots and plants, so I froze in place, listening. Before I knew what was happening, the thing came bolting down the path towards me at full speed. It was then I realized that whatever this thing was, it was clearly bipedal. I was paralyzed by fear and bewilderment, and it was still coming. To my amazement, it *sped up* as it passed by me, brushing my upper arm (I'm 6' 2""), and crashed back into the brush behind me and to the right. I was only able to make out a simple form, but it was definitely not any animal found in the entire islands of Hawaii.

As soon as it went crashing into the forest, my paralysis broke, and I broke into a full sprint back the entire 1/2 mile to the main farm. I started yelling the farmer's name, freaking out the dog, and he came running. (Nothing like this had ever happened before.) Between breaths, I told him what happened, and his eyes widened with every detail. Without saying a word, he fished out his .22, got the dog on the leash, and went searching for the intruder. I grabbed my flashlight and followed. The moment we reached the spot of the encounter, the dog flipped out, barking, and tore off into the forest in the same direction the thing went, following a scent trail. After a tense 20 minutes, she finally came back, no sign of anything.

We never figured out what it was. I used my flashlight every night after that."

So I have an internship with a large company this summer for engineering. Work dress will be business casual. I've been in the process of working over my wardrobe to reflect my young adulthood. I've got some button downs and need a nice set of dressy shoes to pair them with. As I said, dress will be business casual so I don't need crazy oxfords or anything just something that will look nice and fit the part. I would also really like it if these shoes could double as weekend shoes for those weekends when I'm dressed nice to go out. 


[I was thinking maybe something like this?](http://www.zappos.com/calvin-klein-hervey-black-dress-calf)

I really have no idea, Im open to pretty much anything but really don't want to go over 120ish (willing to buy used as well). Ill get a real nice pair of shoes when I actually graduate. 

Additionally I figure Ill end up getting some Vans slip-ons for more casual wear but my understanding is that these are generally well received in the community here?

Lastly, for business casual is it advisable to have a pocket on the button down or not? I may get some shirts from shirtsmyway and have the option of selecting.

gk8vf,19,2011-04-06,Has anyone on r/engineering done freelance CAD work?,jiganto,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/gk8vf/has_anyone_on_rengineering_done_freelance_cad_work/,"Have any of you guys ever done freelance CAD work? How did you get started, find clients, etc? 

I'm currently a second year PhD student in Mechanical Engineering, I do research and take classes which amounts to a full time day job. I get a stipend, but it's just enough to cover my living expenses. Between lab work and classes, it doesn't leave me much time for a second job, only nights and weekends. Classes further make my schedule erratic. 

I've done quite a bit of CAD work over the years, starting with classes in High-School and College; modeled the frame and various components for my school's Baja SAE team, did multimedia cabinet mock-ups for an IT group I worked for at my school. Modeled weldments, assemblies, and made lots of technical drawings for a gym equipment company during an internship. Also, I've done quite a bit of CAD work for my current research, mainly with support structures and various vacuum and high pressure chambers/equipment. I feel like I'm fairly proficient with Pro-E, Solidworks, Inventor and have some experience with AutoCAD/DraftSight.

I'd love to be doing something I'm good at and at least slightly relevant to my profession on the side. Therefore freelance CAD work sounds very appealing to me, but I'm not sure how to get started. Seems like there are a few websites for freelancers to bid on projects, but some seem shady or not very active.

Just wondering if anyone has some experience doing this type of work."
gk7ak,1,2011-04-06,Internship as a purely summer job,ShabamJenkins,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/gk7ak/internship_as_a_purely_summer_job/,"  I'm currently a student finishing up my accounting degree this December. Upon graduating, I am planning on moving a few states further south from where I currently live to get into a little warmer winters.

 I am having an interview for a internship coming in the next few weeks close to home. I would like to get this internship for a few reasons including being able to stay with my parents (last summer I worked out of town pretty much the entire summer). The problem is that because I don't want to stay local, I'm only looking at this internship as a summer job, not a full-time option. However, I feel I have a smaller chance of getting the position if I tell this firm that I am not planning on staying around locally after I graduate. Is it unethical if I tell them I haven't entirely decided where I plan on living (I've narrowed it down to further south but by no means figured out a city)? Or is it even entirely negative that I'm not expecting to turn this into a full-time position?  

I still have the option to take the summer job that I had last summer, but it's my last summer I'll have off and would like to spend it around home before I move away to start my career.

TL;DR: To be ethical, what should I disclose when interviewing for an internship that I have no plan on turning into a full-time position?

EDIT: This internship will only last during the summer months and will end as soon as the Fall semester starts back up."

gk1m2,2,2011-04-06,In need of some honest advice.  Please help me figure out the next 40+ years of my life.  [Long Post],michaelandrews,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/gk1m2/in_need_of_some_honest_advice_please_help_me/,"I tried posting this to /r/programming but they don't allow text submissions.  I really don't know who to turn to and this subreddit seems like the most appropriate place.  I'll try to keep this as short as possible without omitting pertinent information.

Backstory:

I'm your average white male, turning 30 in a couple months.  I got a Bachelors in Computer Science from a tech institute in Boston.  Since then I've been working in IT, first as general Help Desk and now in Telecommunications (about 8 years altogether, counting internships).  I'm good at what I do, according to other people.

I didn't do wonderful in school... it couldn't really hold my interest.  I was one of the better programmers in my classes and really understood all the material, theory, etc.  Fellow classmates typically came to me for assistance.  My main hang-up was syntactical and just getting the ball rolling on things.

When I was looking for an internship the economy was still crap after 9/11.  I took a Desktop Support job at a local software company (I was one of the few students to get an internship at all that year).  A week after I got my degree that same company called me up asking me to be their Telecom Engineer.  I had no other prospects and needed to get to work fast, so I took it.  I changed companies a few years ago, but am still doing the same kind of work (general telecom, ""programming"" phone systems, etc).

Here's where things are starting to get a little more serious:

I'm moving from Boston to Silicon Valley this year, sometime before September.  My reasons are extremely selfish and purely personal; I simply don't want to be in Boston anymore after 11 years and my best friend moved to the Valley about 3.5 years ago.  We have a great network of absolutely wonderful friends out there and I just feel like it's a better place for me as a person than Boston is anymore.  I'm trying to transfer within the same company but that likely won't happen (there's no real need for an additional IT person out there).

I know you're thinking ""Just get another phone job out there, idiot.""  That brings up another issue.  The systems that I've had the most experience with over the last 6 or so years are not installed out there like they are in the Northeast.  Basically, my resume is not worth the paper it's (going to eventually) be printed on.  If I can't transfer within my job that means I have to start my career over.

My main question is this: if I'm starting over anyways, should I try being a programmer (again)?  

I like programming but it's one of those ""use-it-or-lose-it"" skills.  I'm terribly out of practice not to mention that I don't actually have any real-world experience outside of some database applications I wrote during an internship 9 years ago.  I'm moving to what is basically the computer programmer capital of the world, do I even have a shred of the possibility of survival or am I setting myself up to fail faster and harder than ever seen before in the history of mankind?

Everyone I know that's a programmer for work is also a programmer in their personal life.  It's a definite lifestyle thing; eat, breathe, sleep programming.  I do have other serious hobbies that I need to pursue outside of work.  Is it realistic to think that I can just be a programmer ""at work"" and not have to also be a programmer for the 4 hours a day I have to myself?

Furthermore, is there any hope that, with my current resume, I'd even have a snowballs chance in hell of landing an entry-level position in programming?  I can't see anyone hiring somebody that hasn't seriously programmed since college for that type of position and has a mediocre college transcript as well.  They'd be better off hiring a fresh college grad who just got his Ph.D (which seems to be the trend out there).  I can't afford to go back to school right now, nor do I think I'd mentally be able to put up with it again.  It was really hard for me just because I've always hated school.  I'd rather work and learn through practical application.

Just interested in your honest opinions and advice if you have it.  Much appreciated.

i feel like I've been floating in a sort of blind, anxiety-ridden limbo since I was born, and i've really known nothing else. 

I grew up the youngest of 4, and they and my parents always did shit for me and helped me out, and became a huge crutch for me. well I'm 23 right now, and all my siblings (and my dad) have long since bounced and moved on with their lives, and I'm left here......sort of retarded about everything.

I realize now that during the most crucial years of my youth, I never learned any sense of responsibility, work ethic, desire to explore, compassion for others, whatever......I don't know how to do anything, and I'm overrun by anxious thoughts and obsessive, neurotic tendencies at the very thought of trying anything new. I'm kinda scared shitless about the prospect of doing my taxes and figuring out how to apply for jobs and buying cars or a house or how to do anything socially, or how to make connections in society to move up in life or with your career. it seems like for a man to get anywhere in life he needs to count on tools that he gained prior to move ahead with. but if you didnt start out with that shit, youre fucked.

currently, my daily activities for fun include occasional gaming, eating, and jerking off. this realization really gets to me after i'm full and i've blown 3 straight loads in one day, and i'm sorta just left there in an over-indulged stupor. 

i'm actually going to art university right now, as a result of telling my teachers that i had a vague interest in drawing, and i sorta just went with it since it seemed like the only other options were that, or become a firefighter or astronaut, since those were the only careers i heard my friends talking about at the time. currently I'm a junior at the aforementioned art school, thousands of dollars in debt and heading into a job field that in no way guarantees any sort of solid career or cashflow, on top of the fact that i don't have a fucking clue how to find internships or jobs or whatever to build to anything. my current plan is to....uhhh....travel for a few years or something, even though i have no money or any clue how to book a flight or buy a car. my mom doesn't know shit about what i'm doing right now, she thinks im getting straight A's and learning about the business. haha, yea i've got no clue how im going to explain any of this.

socially, uuhhh....well i have a small handful of dudes from school that i occasionally hang around and get high with. as far as girls are concerned, i never really made any attempts to put myself out there as a teenager, so i've been really left in the dust in that department, even at 23 it seems kinda hopeless.

so, my life is basically a huge, retarded mess, i really don't even know where to start, well, starting. all i know is that this life sucks and i'm kind of an asshole, and tired of all of it. i want to start over.

i've never really conveyed these sentiments to anyone, it's just that lately i've been feeling the walls of my little mental fort starting to break apart, and i think everyone's finally seeing through my facade of normalcy.

1) Long hikes at high altitudes.
2) Repetitive motions (shovels, hammers, etc).
3) Heavy lifting (both carrying and back (backpacking backpack, about 40-50 lbs.))

I've started working out a bit in preparation for June when it starts. I've started running to get the legs back in gear and to get cardio in a decent spot. My goal is to get up to 5 miles before May 15th. I've been doing push-ups and assisted pull-ups to take care of arms and back. I'm also doing low-weight high-rep arm workouts to build some good working muscle.

Is there anything I'm missing? I feel like I could use some more endurance exercises since I'll be working 8 hours+ per day but none come to mind. Also, exercises that target specifically the back. I'm also wondering if ab workouts would be very necessary to focus on, not sure how important a strong core is for backpacking.

As a side note: I do have easy access to a rec center (college campus) with a full weight room &amp; machines.

I'm forever trying to get my friends to get on reddit so they can experience the awesomeness first hand.  One buddy of mine finally got into a couple months back, and we've shared jokes and posts from reddit with each other on facebook.  A mutual friend of ours sent me a message today saying ""Okay, So I see you guys loving reddit. I'm kinda a newb in this... So what is it? (obviously its a news site) but I mean is it peer edited? Is it just a news site? I am addicted to gizmodo lifehacker and the like. just looking around it feels a lot different. I could probably figure this out on my own but i'm interested to see your own explanation.""  I decided to finally write out what makes reddit awesome, and this is what I came up with

Well, explaining reddit is quite a task, because it's a very complex machine made of very simple parts, but I shall do my best. We'll start with the homepage, how links are submitted, and why what you see on the homepage is there as opposed to any other of the thousands of links submitted every day. When a link is submitted it is placed next to two arrows, one for an upvote if the reader likes the submission, one for a downvote if the reader doesn't like the submission. The reasons for downvotes can range anywhere from the content already being submitted earlier by a previous redditor, the content not being factually correct if it is say a news story, not funny if it's meant to be, etc. The upvotes are referred to as link karma, and are as coveted by redditors as the cure for AIDS. The more upvotes a story has, the faster it will rise to the front page. A link that is downvoted (or, what usually happens, is simply ignored) will toil away in obscurity and will not be seen by the majority of redditors. 

The beauty of reddit comes in that the homepage can bring you a huge selection of interesting news stories, opinion pieces, infographics, comics, blogs, reviews, and posts from a huge range of topics from politics, worldnews, video games, pictures, videos, atheism, technology, science, etc etc etc ad infinitum. These are all divided into categories, referred to as subreddits that divide content into specific categories. That is to say, the homepage might contain (out of 25 links on the front page) 5 posts from politics, 5 from world news, 5 from videos, 5 from music, maybe 4 from lets say atheism, one from gaming and one from funny. These subreddits can be accessed directly by adding /r/ and the name of the subreddit in the url bar, or by clicking the links on the top or side of the page. So say you're in the mood to hear new music. You can either go to reddit.com/r/music, or one of my favorites, reddit/r/listentothis (a community devoted to finding and sharing new, or older and perhaps more obscure music. more on the different communities in a moment.) and see all that the particular subreddit has to offer, which is ranked in the same way as the front page, or you can stick to just the main page. 

Reddit is a huge, huuuuuuge source of memes, and the great thing about reddit is they all start organically and just build and build and build upon themselves based solely on the momentum of the community. These usually start in the comment section, and when a meme starts to gain traction they can take off like an avalanche. Most (or I should say a lot of) memes revolve around a simple picture, and then a caption that follows relatively the same format. Reading these at first can be confusing, but after you stick around for a while you start to learn what certain memes are all about and what people are referring to, and they make a lot more sense. Picture an inside joke with a group of friends, it's the exact same thing. They aren't funny to anyone else, because no one else has the context of why there. For a quick background of what memes are I just searched that term on the front page, and provided a link to it. http://www.reddit.com/search?q=meme

The comments section is a whole animal unto itself, but in my opinion it is the sole reason why reddit is so addictive. Some of the funniest, most clever, most insightful things you will ever read will be in the comments section of reddit. The comments work much the same as links, in that once they are submitted they can be upvoted or downvoted. The highest rated comments will be put at the top of the forum, and the subsequent following ones will be less and less popular. For example, lets say there is a link to a funny picture, so funny that it has 800 upvotes and 600 comments. You can all but guarantee that the top comment is going to be something hilarious. In the same vein, let's say that there is a link to an outrageous political story with the same number of comments. It's a fairly safe bet that the top comments will be some sort of salient, relevant or insightful point regarding the article. The theme of the comments is loosely based on the subreddit they come from but they all roughly follow this formula. The comments section segue-ways us nicely into what I spoke about earlier, the communities.

Another thing that makes reddit so addictive is that there is such continuity between different subreddits. What I mean by that is, once you're on reddit long enough, you start to know what to expect in the comments section based on what's been popular in the past. This is often referred to as the 'hive mind' of reddit, and while at times it can turn a topic into a circle jerk, usually the reader can expect something clever, funny or insightful. Reddit really does begin to feel like a community, and as strange or nerdy as it sounds, fellow redditors start to feel like friends. What is strange, or perhaps a better way to phrase it is unique is that it isnt the same few people that start to feel like friends, but everyone acting in the same predictable way that gives this sense of community. To someone not familiar with the hive it would sound like the content would just seem stale and redundant but it just works. The magic of the internet I suppose. This should give you a good introduction as to how reddit works and why it's so god damn awesome, but I feel like now that I'm approaching 1000 words I should probably wrap this up. Let me know what questions you have though, I love sharing reddit! Have fun!!!!!!!


(PS. IAMA means I am A, it is used for people who have interesting jobs, have done interesting things, (ex. I am A....fighter pilot, intern at the daily show, person who climbed mt everest, etc etc etc) and they are used to do what are called AMA- Ask me anything. thats one that should clear up confusion. Also, TIL means Today I Learned and is reserved for interesting little factoids people come across)

(PPS visit these subreddits and I can all ubt guarantee you'll be hopelessly addicted:

/r/funny
/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu/
/r/politics
/r/pics

ENJOY!!!!!

**TL:DR**  This is why reddit is awesome.  *explains why*

gl4tl,9,2011-04-07,Struggling college student asking anyone who has been to college for their input. Please.,FavoriteFlatPillow,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/gl4tl/struggling_college_student_asking_anyone_who_has/,"I'm currently a junior in college majoring in mechanical engineering. I finally mustered up the courage to write this post in hopes that there would be some people here that can provide some helpful information. I think today was my ""breaking point"" as I just bombed my second introduction to materials engineering exam. 

I am sorry if I am being overdramatic about trivial issues, but this has been a large concern for me for my entire college career. I'm not sure how to piece the ""problems"" together, but I will try to make this as clear as possible. It might be kinda long, but if you're bored, I'd greatly appreciate any feedback. **I bolded the questions that I wanted to ask you guys, so you don't have to waste your time reading this entire thing.**

When I was growing up, I always had an interest in taking things apart, figuring out what made things work, repairing things, etc. My parents noticed this as I grew up and instilled in my mind that I would make a great engineer. Momma always knows best right? I can't say for sure, but maybe this was a wrong move. People have always said to choose your major based on your interests. But at the time, I really did think that engineering would be a great thing. I was involved in an electrical engineering internship my senior year in high school. I made test fixtures that monitored mail sorting devices. I knew that being a high schooler, my tasks would be limited to smaller, easier things. But just sitting in that firm building, with it's dull concrete floor and musty air, I couldn't imagine doing this every day for the rest of my life. Maybe that should've been sign number one. . .

Anyways, I got into college afterwards majoring in electrical engineering as well. Short story short, I switched out after my first semester because I truly believed it was not something I wanted to do. I was never interested in electrical circuits and programming (no offense, I was just extremely terrible at it). After that I have and still continue to pursue an undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering. I am expected to graduate Spring 2012, which is in about a year. 

I have never performed extremely well in my engineering classes. They are a majority C's, with some B's, and one or two A's. Okay, just to put everything into perspective, I have a cumulative GPA of 2.7. Before you sigh and tell me that it's not bad, it's definitely not good either. The reason it is a big deal is because: 1) Scholarships are given here at 3.25 and above, which isn't(for many others) a hard GPA to achieve, 2) I have always been interested in studying abroad, but it requires a 3.0, 3) At resume clinics and workshops, I'm the kid that is told to leave my GPA out, or include ""Financing 100% of education"", and 4) Most employers won't even give you a chance at an interview without a 3.0. This makes me feel like shit. I'm embarrassed and I hate feeling like my best only amounts to mediocrity. Like I'm mentally incapable of handling this material. 

Everyone keeps telling me GPA doesn't matter as much as on-job experience, but I have been getting denied at every single internship I have currently applied to. Many internship postings also require a 3.0 GPA or higher, so my options are constantly limited. In addition, I don't have the money for out of state internships unless they offer relocation and housing assistance, further limiting my options.

Somewhere transitioning from high school to college, I guess I lost my motivation to learn. As much as the topics I'm learning right now are unique and interesting, my only motivation to learn the material is due to the deadlines for homeworks and exams. I don't enjoy learning this material, I only learn it so that I can graduate and get the fuck out of undergraduate school. 

I know that I haven't been working as hard as I could or should be. I know what I am supposed to do, but I just have no motivation to act upon them. It seems like my only motivation at this point is just my fear of failing and letting my parents down. I know my parents will get over it, blahblah, but they gave me the opportunity to pursue my education. I feel like this is something I have to do at this point. It's just stressful when considering the amount of money I might waste just because I did not try hard enough in school. **How am I supposed to study and focus on material that I don't enjoy?** My mentality at this point is, ""I just want to pass these classes."" Of course I always try my best, but the ultimate goal is just to get through the semester without having to retake any courses. So far, I have. . . luckily.

My studying habits are a mess too. My sleeping habits are terrible. I basically live a graveyard shift. I sleep right after class for about 3-4 hours, then I get up around 10-11pm and do the work that is due the next day. I admit, I procrastinate heavily. I don't want to deal with the work until it is necessary. On Mondays and Wednesdays, I have an 8am, and so I usually just stay awake until then. This cycle keeps repeating day after day. I have tried to break it, but even when I do stay awake during the day, I have no motivation to start my work. I guess I'm just terribly lazy when it comes to school.

In terms of examination preparation, I cram study 1-2 nights prior to the exam. I always tell myself that I would start early, work little by little, but it never goes as planned. I've just been so used to pulling 1 or 2 allnighters prior to an exam that it's just been the routine system of studying for me. Also, although I am a sociable person, when it comes to classes and studying, I try to do everything on my own. I know this is a terrible mindset and that my peers would help me out, but I feel the need to be capable and responsible of handling all of this on my own. Obviously at this point it seems like I can't, but I could never study with other students. 

 In the past, my study schedule worked enough. . . I guess. But this semester is by far the hardest one for me. I'm terrified that I'm about to fail 3/5 classes, my engineering courses. It's funny that my other classes, like technical writing, come so easily compared to my major courses. I honestly feel like the idiot of the class. My first exam in my circuits(Ugh) class went terribly. The week following the exam my teacher displayed a grade distribution for the entire course. 88 students. Far left of graph, 30/100, # of students: 1. The next student was at least in the 50s and there were many kids in the upper 80s-100s. I was the worst student in that class after the first exam. I mean, I didn't understand all the material, but I did feel like I could've at least performed at the average grade.

With that said, I'm wondering if you all have **any tips for me when it comes to studying, particularly engineering or computational materials.** The classes I'm taking right now are circuits, materials intro, and fluid mechanics. **If anyone has any good resources available that could assist me, please let me know.** I just recently discovered /r/engineering and found a really good website I wish I found a long time ago. 

Also, **when you study (this is directed more towards computational classes, not memorization and facts) how do you study? Do you even bother reading the book and taking notes? Do you just take notes off the lecture slides? Or do you mostly just solve practice problems? What is the best approach to preparing for an engineering class examination?** Of course I know this all depends on the type of teacher, the quality of the book, and all, but do you think there's one thing that's most important to focus on? Such as either understanding concepts vs. understanding how to actually solve problems.

Goodness, this is very lengthy. I apologize. I'm just looking for some feedback. . . maybe some reassurance if applicable? Haha. . . I'll just list off some of the questions I have for you guys.

**Anyone with a similar experience, how did you deal with it? Did you switch majors? Or did you persevere?**

**Is it best to stay in my major at this point (considering money, happiness, security, etc.) with one year left to go?**

I do have a backup plan to pursue a masters in business/management if my experiences with mechanical engineering remain the same after some actual work.

**Any test-taking skills or tips?**

I am terrible at taking tests. I actually feel decently prepared coming into exams, but once I see the test, I sorta get a test anxiety. My mind races and I can't concentrate because I'm afraid I'm gonna run out of time. So I start one thing, get stuck and freak out, and just skip to another one.

**Anyone with other experiences/insight/realizations, I would enjoy hearing them**

**What would be your first step in my position?**

Again, I apologize for the length. If you read the entire thing, I greatly appreciate it. I'm pretty sure I'm leaving out many questions, but I'll ask them as I remember them. I haven't slept since Tuesday night. . . so please excuse any errors in my writing. I just wanted to submit this before I backed out again. I think I'll take a nap now. 

Thanks again. 

**tl;dr I'm unmotivated, disinterested and failing my major required courses. I'm terrible at taking tests and I have bad studying habits. I'm scared that my future will either be unhappy or unstable. Just want any feedback.**

(I'm a wuss!) /r Loseit, however, seems like a friendly place to come share my thoughts about my weight loss.

I was heavy my whole life, I ended up going to independent study my last 2 years of high school because of it. I started staying home all the time, on WoW or reddit, living off mass amounts of poptarts. At 20 years old I was 215-220 pounds, I used to just stare in the mirror and glare at my body, like it was its own fault for being so fat.

My boyfriend went away for an internship for 3 months, and I decided that I would take the time and throw myself into my weight loss. After 3 months I had lost about 30 pounds, and I just kept going. I'll be 21 in less the 2 weeks, and I weigh in at 135.

I just want to thank you internet. I have almost no friends(still working on that.. weight loss doesn't cure awkwardness unfortunately), so /fit (on 4chan) and reddit have been my main support sources. So, thank you all for inspiring me on days I didn't want to ride my stupid stationary bike to exercise. Thank you for motivating me to keep going after I binged and ate that whole large pizza. Thank you for sharing all of your inspiring stories that helped me see that you can change yourself for the better, even if it seems impossible.

gku8r,7,2011-04-07,Question,Tbton,Anarchism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/gku8r/question/,"Hello Reddit, and R / anarchism. First I would like to say that I am not expert in English. This post was made by Karelian-&gt;Russian and then using Google program to make English, but I can read some English with no translator. I identify with the Social Democrats and I have very little knowledge about anarchism, but I would like to know very much.

I read up on anarchist theory, but I was able to find answers to these questions. Excuse my action if this is wrong sub reddit to post.

1) How should organizations dealing with complex ideas run if every employee has equal input and leaders (non-hierarchical), have no right to request  accordance with certain actions?

For example, I work as a chemist in the laboratory and part of our mission is ""train others and to promote knowledge"". As art of this mission, we have a lot of internships, students and others to help grow and thrive. All people put some efforts in the chemical laboratory.

Under my idea of  what anarchist theory implies, every employee concerns and direction would be equal to mine, although I am one of the few people in the lab which has extensive knowledge and expertise in chemistry and other general process of science. There were some times where I would require a person to change their action from which they were provided is correct (it certainly is not true as their math is wrong), and if I do not have the ability to force them to change, it could have created a very dangerous situation. If my co-people think they are correct and their vote outweigh mine, how should I prevent dangerous situation and help them grow?


2) This references the thought in #1 a bit.

How would complex scientific creators such as particle accelerators come to exist? financing, organization, knowledge, etc. all seem to depend on the hierarchy to provide support for such endeavors.

Maybe it's my ignorance, but it seems that anarchism was born in a much easier time in 1800 and early 1900's. I can not do a phantom world now where the airplanes, space stations, computer processors, etc., without hierarchy. I know this is very vague question, but this is my concern. Is there the answer to how the miracles of human knowledge will be made? It just seems too complex without coercive force to push it. 

3)

This is a question about culture and not anarchist theory. 

Is anarchism infected with idealism? This, I think anarchists live in a world where almost all systems of government have a fundamental ideological antithesis to their vision.

I spoke with some anarchists in person, about my political stance and tried to get them to act in support of the left wing politics where I live vs. strict right-wing nationalists. However, their ideology is so strong that statist social democrats are just as bad as nationalist conservatives, but it just does not make sense to me. Would not you rather anarchists living in social democracy, not a right-wing nationalism country? 

How do anarchists expect to create an anarchist society without supporting ideas which are relatively more friendly and closer to theirs? While the social democrats aren't anarchists, they are much more open to anarchism than the nationalists.

The Sayre High School in West Philadelphia is an example of Penn's commitment to engaging locally through the Penn Compact. At Sayre, located about 20 city blocks from Penn's campus, more than 85 percent of the students come from families the School District of Philadelphia considers economically disadvantaged.

In 1996, Penn established a partnership with Sayre, creating one of the first university-assisted community schools in the United States. As part of this initiative, Penn's Netter Center for Community Partnerships joined with school and community partners to open the Sayre Health Center in 2003. The Sayre Health Center is a federally qualified health center that treats patients regardless of their income or medical insurance status.

The School brings together high school, college, and graduate students in one setting. Other Penn programs at Sayre include nutrition and gardening, career and college preparation, science education, and internships at professional worksites.

Penn's model of university-assisted schools has not only developed and grown in Philadelphia, but has also been replicated across the United States. In 2009, Penn was named number-one among colleges and universities for its model partnership programs advancing teaching, research and learning at Penn while simultaneously improving the quality of learning and the quality of life in the community.

By working alongside others to benefit society, the Penn Compact reaffirms what Penn's founder Benjamin Franklin called ""an inclination...to serve mankind, one's Country, Friends and Family."""

Throwaway because boyfriend knows my reddit account. The reason I want him to move in with me is much different from usual relationships. I'm worried about his money situation. We both have intermittent internships, which is always nice, but they're internships and they don't exactly pay well. His parents just moved away last year and they're not helping him with payments and he's living in an apartment (with the shittiest roommates ever) that costs $500/month plus $6500 in yearly tuition. He's very, very frugal with his money. 


Neither us want to ever take out a loan which is why I moved back in with my parents last year to save money on rent. I drive 20 minutes to school and back every day and it costs me about $20-$30 a week in gas. I've tried talking to him about moving into our spare bedroom at my parent's house to save money, but he brings up his mother every time. She is hard-core religious and would probably disown him if we moved in together without getting engaged. Maybe you guys might know another reason why he would decide not to take up my offer?


I won't be torn apart if he decides not to move in with me, but I could use some advice on how to bring up the subject again. I do think it would save him a lot of money, but it's his life and I don't want to pressure him. Also, if he does agree, how could we deal with his mother in this kind of situation? 

Edit: No, I cannot move into a house or apartment with him yet. That's the one ""moral line"" I will not cross lest I suffer wrath from his mom. The only way it could possibly work is if he brought it up first, manned up, and had a long conversation with his parents. "

EDIT: Please keep the comments coming, I'm interested in the opinions of everyone. I have mixed feelings because I've been given different responses from people I know IRL. My manager at my last internship told me to only go into a field/place that I'm interested in when I'm getting a job and not settle for anywhere else. My professor told me to only go into something I'm interested in and just keep trying. My mom said she didn't think it was worth the money to move especially since the first year of the job I've heard back from is a training program with tests and classes.

gkdm6,7,2011-04-06,This is my first post ever (really) and I have come to you Redditers for some life advice for a history major.,moses_man,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/gkdm6/this_is_my_first_post_ever_really_and_i_have_come/,"Hello Reddit! Pleasure to meet you all and here we go. 

I've been out of college for about a year and a half and I'm having no luck with the real world. I have applied for many jobs but I haven't even been able to get an interview. 

The core of my issues revolve around my lack experience. I graduated with a good GPA and even completed my undergrad in 3.5 years. Unfortunately, I didn't plan too well for post college life.  
 I took up as a temporary job when I graduated, but  I've been there for so long that I'm now managing the place. While the pay is good enough to support me, the job ultimately drives me crazy. 

I've volunteered at a non-profit historical site to gain some relevant history focused professional experience. Yet, after 4 months at the internship, I realized that any future in this job would require grad school and the market for related jobs were slim to none. 

At this juncture, I tink I have to re-evaluate my career choices, yet I am lacking in experience or direction!

I've been considering teaching abroad just for a change of pace.

If there are any post grad history or liberal arts majors who have shared a smilar experience please tell me about it! I want to move my life forward and I need some sort of outlet!

Thank you Reddit

I just spent a couple of days working to perfect my resume for an internship, only to notice after I submitted it that the version I submitted has some incorrect dates listed for one of my jobs. Basically it looks like this:

&gt;**Research Assistant                  June 2007 – May 2008**
&gt;University of Derp, Derp Department. Derp City, Derpington
&gt;part time: Aug 2001 - Mar 2004. full time: Mar 2004 - Aug 2004
&gt;Worked without supervision in a clean isotope lab
&gt; (etc)

With the issue being the part time/full time dates being completely unrelated and from an earlier iteration of the resume. (I had to update the resume for this position's interest in only jobs with a more recent time window.)

Now my question is, do I send the correct revised version to my contact or do I just sit and wait to hear from them? I don't know my contact very well, and I'm afraid that I'll just point out an error before they've had a chance to even notice it. However the internship is really competitive, and so I'm concerned that even the slightest error might have HR tossing the resume out of consideration before it gets that far.

What do you all think? I'm waffling between the two options and getting pretty nervous about it."

The current problem I have/or would like to tackle is that whenever I have nothing to do which is acads-related, I'm extremely unsure what to do with my time. Doing a gruelling program gives you things to do for some hours a day, but I actually spend hours obsessing/stressed up over if I should meet my friends or listen to music or watch movies etc. This is because I'm trying to find the best quality way to spend my time, anytime (I think).
This is now getting worse that my exams have gotten over and I have no course to study for, and am waiting for my internship to begin, so while my friends are at work, I'm sitting at home obsessing/being stressed over what to do.

I guess being a little goalless doesnt help. Oh and also am socially awkward.

**tl-to-read**: I overthink a lot, and am pretty muddled about how to spend my time anytime of the day if I don't have anything to study."

My ex and i are both 19, we broke up three weeks ago.
We were together for 9 months, and it was amazing. We have the same sense of humor, interests, and we were crazy about eachother. 


Things ended when I realized we both wanted different things out of life, I know that doesn't seem like something to break up over if we are both only 19, but like I said, we were both crazy about eachother and knew we would be together for a very long time. We have different spiritual beliefs, so we worked out every issue we might have because of that before we even started dating, all of our bases were covered. Because of this, we had 0 fights. 


I know that the breakup was for the best. he doesn't want to get married to anyone until he's 35 (the end of his education and internship), and I want to have kids before I'm 30. Like I said, we wanted different things. 


This is my first real heartbreak, I've dated guys and gone through breakups before, but nothing like this. I'm in agony, I even tried to get him to go out with me again the next day, which I understand was very cruel of me.


I've done a lot to help me through this heartbreak. I've started working out more, focused harder in school, taken up hobbies, and even do things like write down how I feel whenever I'm upset to get though this as healthily as possible. I deleted his number off of my phone, but I still have his facebook. Even so, there are days where I can't pick myself off the floor, can't focus, and can't stop bawling my eyes out, hanging onto the hope that maybe he'll call me, and change his mind. 

The problem is, I have all the tools that I seemingly need to get over him, but Im not. Its been three weeks. 
The breakup makes sense, I get that, but I just don't want to be with anyone else, I cant even think of another guy. 
I could really use some advice on how to get through this, I must be missing something. "

I am graduating (BS in Environmental Technology) in may, and i've applied for something like 24 Jobs, mostly in the GIS field.  I'm pretty well qualified, as i scored a very lucky internship at the beginning of my senior year which turned into a part-time job doing GIS work.  Up until a few weeks ago, i had received very few responses from companies i had contacted (electronically) so i just started calling people.  My #1 pursuit right now is really jerking me around.  It's a fantastic company (large-ish GIS firm) from what i can tell, and is exactly what i would like to be involved in.  Last thursday (mar 31) i called a number listed on their contact page, which turned out to be the cell # of their HR guy.  He answered, was very cordial and was interested in speaking with me.  

-Told me he would call back in 20 minutes.  This was about 2pm, never heard from him. 
 
-Called him the next day (friday) at about 11am.  No answer, left a voicemail.  

-He called me back at 6pm, my phone didn't ring through and he left a VM, very nice, gave me his email address to send another resume and told me to call him over the weekend so we could speak. 

-Called him back immediately, no answer

-called him saturday at 12pm, no answer, left a VM

-called him Sunday at 2PM, no answer.

-called him monday at 9:30am, no answer

-called him again at 12pm, no answer.

-sent him an email, no answer

-called him at 5:30, he answered and said he would love to speak and would call me back at 7:30.

-never called me back

-I called him tuesday at 5:30pm.  He actually answered, and we had a great discussion for about 10 minutes.  He actually said ""We need help, and you sound like just the kind of person we need.""  We scheduled a second phone interview for 5:30pm Thursday (yesterday).

-He never called.  No email, nothing.

-I sent him an email last night at 7:30, reminding him of our arrangement and telling him my availability for today, which was completely open.  No email, no call, nothing.   

for the 15 total minutes we HAVE actually spoken, conversation has been great and he has seemed very interested in me.  But he refuses to keep his appointments and will not answer his phone.  I've now sacrificed countless hours waiting on this guy.  Of course if something comes of it it will all be worth it, but i'm getting very frustrated.  I'm going to keep persuring this....but to what end?  Do i just keep hounding him as politely as possible?  What say you r/jobs?
Thanks!"

My boss really liked me and kept me on over this past school year (I graduate with a degree in Mech Eng in a few weeks). Over that time there was an employee, lets say Tom, who I got along with really well, and liked a a lot. But my boss was always on him about various job performance issues. Some might have been legit, but some seemed ticky tacky, and it almost seemed like my boss was trying to drive him out. Anyways, things finally came to a head, and Tom ended up leaving the company, and filing for unemployment. My boss apparently has decided to fight. This morning I was copied on an email from Tom saying ""You WILL be contacted by OSHA and DOL on claims against the company."" and ""I'm positive after talking with OSHA today about my claim that [Company] will be shut down and [Other company in the same building owned by the landlord] will also be effected.""  Tom had indicated he liked me, and wouldn't do anything to screw me over, but then he goes and does this. 
  
Now I know there were some things we do/did that aren't ""OSHA standards"" but then who does follow all of OSHA's rules. I may be wrong, but I can't think of anything that we've done that would warrant any more than a slap on the wrist, and certainly not ""shut down."" I was really hoping to stay this company after I graduate (I'm in the middle of negotiating with my bosses), and the last thing I want to see is this company shut down."

Bachelor of Science?,justin_144,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/gldgx/need_some_inputadvice_from_cs_majors_cs_bachelor/,"First off, I know a lot of you guys have degrees in Computer Science and could really help a fellow redditor out with choosing his career path is CS. 

I'm majoring in Computer Science and am at the point where I need to choose between a BA or BS in Computer Science. I'm comparing and contrasting the two and I am in a quandary. For one, the BS will require a considerable amount more math than the BA degree. I am not very good at math. I struggle through it, and I feel like I may fail some of the math classes that are required in the BS degree plan. (I have a very high GPA and don't want to wreck it with these math classes). But will I have more chances of landing a higher paying job with a BS degree? 

I am going to do an internship at a company called Raytheon this summer, where I will be working on programs for  infra-red systems. If the internship goes well, do you think later on, if I go for the BA degree, that they would still be interested i me? 

My main concern is that I don't want to ""settle"" for a BA degree, if a BS is better, and will get me further. But I also don't want to waste time, and effort on the BS degree if I can do just as much with a BA degree. 

With a BA degree, I will be done with school in ~2 semesters, compared to ~5 semesters with the BS degree. Should this be a factor to consider?

TL;DR: Which CS Degree is better? Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science?"

(telephone convo),longdistanceman,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/glb2f/did_i_do_something_wrong_here_telephone_convo/,"Background: Long-distance relationship of 1+ year. I'm 22yo and in college, and so is she. I love her very much and we only get to visit each other twice a year, but when we do we make the days count. This is our first relationship (by that I mean she's my first g/f and I'm her first b/f and all that)

This semester has been really stressful to the both of us and it has taken a bit of a toll on how often we converse online or on the phone. Lately our conversations have been...well...more indicative of the amount of stress each of us are going through.

Tonight, we were talking on the phone when she stated that she said that she was basically sick and tired of ""mothering"" me and telling me what to do (this was spawned by me asking her advice on what to say to an employer who offered me a summer internship, but unsure whether or not I can accept it due to military commitment issues). Now, I am absolutely certain that I am not someone who is incompetent at life to the point in which other people have to tell me what to do. I do think however, that she has been a bit more...""bossy"" lately.

Anyway, my phone rings, and I tell her to holdon as I see who it is. It happens to be one of my best friends who recently got (unfairly) disenrolled from ROTC (military officer candidate training for university students, for those of you who are not from USA). I pick up and he's asking me about some questions regarding a military fraternity we are both involved in. We talk for about 2 minutes when my g/f hangs up on me. I finish the conversation and called her back. She said that she was going to sleep. I asked if she was upset at me, and she said that she was pissed off that I was wasting her time.

I honestly don't know what I'm doing wrong here because, in the past, she has answered the phone and had conversations when we were video-chatting, and I had no issues with it. I think it's the school and work stress getting the both of us, but I certainly hope this isn't a persistent ugly side of her.

Was I doing something wrong here?"

I'm 21M her 23F, We broke up almost 2 months now. She was the one who ended it, after 2 years of what I felt as a too good to be true relationship. She loved me beyond anything and I can say the same. She loved me for who I am, absolutely no judgements, she took interests in my gaming (Ex WoW player of 5 years), in my friends even attempted to smoke Shisha and weed with me. And I love her for everything she is, smart, daring, as if nothing can slow her down. She's older and knows what she wants in life and sadly this is where it ends. I'm still unsure of what I want out of life yet, I'm still attending University working towards some kind of a degree and trying to get my life established. She's even moving away for an internship opportunity at the end of April. Then inevitably she felt that it would be for the best to end it, it was hurting her too much to keep waiting for me. I felt that 2 years is much too early for this but I did not want to be that guy who kept her stringing along with promises and just to see it all fall apart 3 years from now. I could never give back the time she spends waiting. 

**AFTER**:I took it extremely hard but after a couple weeks in the dark I decided a whole life style change. Going back to gym to better myself, I quit video games period. Spend more time making music, outdoors, started my new job and to top it off I made sure that we end this on better terms. I went and saw her we talked, had sex, told each other we're a phone call away and she said she understands that I need space, with much loved that was the last we talked. To this day I have avoided any form of communication, mostly because if we were to hang out, we'll have sex, feelings will resurface and nothing good will come of it. Just simply prove being just friends is not possible. 

**NOW**:This is where I start feeling guilty. I've taken an interest in a girl from work (Same way I met my ex) and gone on one date and I'm already planning on setting up more. After 1.5 months without my ex in my life I almost forget sometimes that there was once someone that special to me (it sounds bad I know) but last night I spent a restless night feeling a sense of accomplishment (successful date), excitement (being in the dating game) and ultimately major guilt (my ex hasn't even moved away yet and she told me that she couldn't see herself being with anyone for long time). Should I feel guilty? Am I a bad guy? Should I tell my ex that I've been going out on dates well one date so far.
She was my first true and real relationship and I was hers (I can say she was my first relationship). She had horrible Exs. I've never done her wrong and loved her the best I can. She still loves me a lot, and to be honest I'm sure she'll love me if not forever for a very very long time. (Some where deep down I hope I will marry her one day, run into her again or something in the future). =( Even more guilt.

**TL;DR**: Mutual break up from a wonderful relationship, I stole my Ex's heart going to take her while to recover. I'm already taken interest in someone new, feeling guilty. Am I a bad person? Should I feel guilty? Should I tell my ex?"

Anyway, I'm going to be graduating with a Master's degree in a forensics field (biological side of things) in May.  Unfortunately, the state and local police departments and medical examiner's offices that my university has connections with aren't hiring or looking to take any students on right now.  I'm not going for PhD just yet, so I'm desperate for anything that I can support myself with for at least the next year.  I'm looking into teaching at community colleges, lab tech jobs, and anything remotely related to biology or forensics.

There's a medical examiner's office in another state that I am interested in working with (good luck, I know) where I haven't heard anything about they're status when it comes to positions.  I want to write them (most likely in e-mail) and ask if they have any part-time positions or internships available.  I'd even be willing to take an unpaid internship at this point, as long as it keeps me in the field.  It's pretty much my last hope to be in something related to my degree.

I've heard many tips from career guidance counselors at my school, read a ridiculous amount online, hear it from friends. Its all usually the same thing: prepare yourself in such a way that you seem to be the perfect candidate.

I've only had one interview so far. It was for an internship for a fortune 500 company. At first I felt the need to be competitive, and as my resume was already lacking, I prepped up. It was at a career fair for the school, so basically you vs. everyone and their mother, plus people living in the area also looking for work. I hardly felt prepared going in, talked to a few people, and left.

Somehow I got a call back. I was extremely nervous about fucking it up the second time around, so I started studying. Halfway through, I realized dressing up in a suit and carrying around those leather binder things to hold all the resumes, take notes in, and hold cards was already way beyond my true self. I understand looking professional, but if wearing a full suit in Florida in the middle of the summer and walking at least one mile (parking sucks) to an interview is something you *want* me to do for the *chance* at a job, I don't want to see what you want me to do if you're paying me.

I attended the interview in slip-on dress shoes (those things are amazing), jeans, and a button-up shirt. Everyone else there came back in full attire. When I was called into the office, I could clearly see the expression on the interviewers face: ""this ought to be interesting"". When time came, he asked me my favorite ridiculous interview question.


Him: What would you say is your greatest weakness?

Me: I find it hard to be professional. Putting up the front takes quite a bit of effort for me, and I feel people can see through the ruse, so whats the point?

Basically, he seemed impressed that I didn't do what most websites suggest and create some sort of ""positive fault,"" like ""I work too hard"". Things from then on went a lot smoother than the first half. I answered questions honestly, and the tenseness disappeared. There was an interjection where we went way off track and started talking about our personal lives. At that point I was pretty happy with my decision to just wing it.

Ended up getting the internship.

Halp?,celeritas-rt,chemistry,https://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/gmbbn/current_materials_science_and_engineering/,"So I thought you guys would be the lot most likely to have materials scientists around (unless you're at the pub, and you should be, because it's Saturday).

So I'm in the UK. I'm at a University of London uni currently and I have one internship under my belt from last year in an undergraduate research position. I've got another one in Singapore coming up this summer. I've been having a bit of an existential crisis in regards to what I do after my bachelors. It's all part of hitting 21, I think. I'm pretty sure I want a masters and I want to go into some form of R&amp;D. I also have a general idea of what area I'd like to look into. I really really enjoy what I do. 

The problem exactly however is going about that. So many of the positions I see are for PhDs and although I won't be kicking about for more than the years like the USA tends to do with things, it worries me that I would be spending three additional years of my twenties without 'experience'. Additionally I'm not really interested in moving over to the USA as so many of my cohorts are interested in doing because your government is nutty and thinks you don't need a national health care system. I don't want to become a professor but if it's likely I'll hit a glass ceiling of PhD when I want to work I want to do one straight out of undergrad.  

Has anyone got any stories or experience of going from a PhD to an R&amp;D job in materials science? I'm mostly looking at plastic electronics/thin films/deposition of layers/materials electronics.

Cheers. :)


Edit: Also, the absolute doom and gloom that everyone has been saying about grad stuff scares me. I'm a social person and I'm aware that we're a rare breed in science. I'm happy to do the 9-5 slog that phds entail but how have your social experiences been while you did it? Did you join any clubs/network/have a close group of friends/was it hugely affected by your institution?

However, I had some difficulty with some of the higher level math classes and recently I've taken a few finance classes. I think that I am much more interested in pursuing a career more related to accounting or finance than applied math. The stuff I found most interesting were things like financial planning, stocks, bonds, annuities, etc... But I'm not sure I have enough relevant course work to just jump right into something like a financial analyst position. I feel confident I would be able to learn, but probably need more initial training than someone with a business degree.
Aside from continuing on to grad school for a masters in finance or accounting, does anyone have any other ideas for what I can do in this situation? Any entry-level jobs or internships that might help me get more toward a finance position? I think I'm looking for something like a financial planner or financial analyst job, but I'm not entirely sure what other options are out there and what they would entail.

glz82,2,2011-04-09,"All I want is a sincere ""congratulations."" Am I not allowed to feel proud of my accomplishments?",[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/glz82/all_i_want_is_a_sincere_congratulations_am_i_not/,"Hi Reddit. I suppose this is more of a rant than anything, so bear with me.

Some backstory- I'm a college student and I've been working for a few months on supplementing my upcoming summer routine (usually a part-time job + research) with some real work experience. Recently, I've been attending interviews in the surrounding area in an attempt to secure a real internship or permanent position for the summer, and possibly beyond graduation. Additionally, I applied for a fellowship and several additional part-time positions. I also, somewhat on a whim, applied for a teaching position overseas.

This has involved a great deal of work on my part, including obtaining my driver's license (which I have been putting off), creating Resume/References, writing essays, and collecting letters of recommendation. I am very cognizant of the impending 'doom' of my graduation and the stress that comes with starting an independent, adult life.

During this period I have experienced some tentative success - e.g. first interviews, and I always call my parents immediately to keep them informed. However, they YET to wish me ""congratulations,"" or express any emotion close to happiness about my meager accomplishments.

Instead, they have said:

* What will THAT do for you?
* Why did you apply to that?
* ...Interesting.
* The commute is too long, you can't do that.
* That's too expensive.
* You can't afford a car and you KNOW we're not helping you.
* You just got your license, you can't be driving.
* You're starting your real life soon, you need to be doing xyz instead.
* What is the benefit of that? Obviously, you can't put it on an application.
* You can't live there.

The real catalyst in all of this was today, when I heard back from the summer teaching position I applied for - and received. The conversation went something like this:

Me: ""I got the position abroad!""

Dad: ""What will THAT do for you?""

Me: ""Well, relevant teaching experience, exposure to foreign culture, an opportunity to go to Asia! The best part is, the room/board and food is free, you get a stipend, and they pick you up straight from the airport!""

Dad: ""So...not the plane ticket?""

Me: ""Well, no - but that's the only expen...""

Dad: ""You know we can't afford that.""

Me: ""I didn't ask...?""

Dad: ""Your mother and I already didn't get to go to Alaska for our 25th anniversary like we planned because of your tuition.""

Me: ""I didn't ask. I can pay for it myself.""

Dad: ""And I mean, I don't want to bring this up, but you have over $20,000 in outstanding student loans.""

Me: ""Then why...?""

Dad: ""And you want to move to CA after graduation, how are you going to buy a car if you do this?""

Me: ""I have some money saved up, I don't know, I just found out I haven't thought about any of this yet.""

Dad: ""Well if you want to be able to afford a car, you obviously can't go.""

Me: ""I never expected to get the position, I haven't accepted yet or anything.""

Dad: ""Well, I hope you seriously consider the position you've put your mother and I in. You need to be making money.""

Me: ""...""

Their attitude is making me depressed. Really, all I wanted from them was a ""congratulations,"" *some* sort of verification that I was doing things correctly. I don't want anything from them. 

I just want them to be proud of me."

Fast forward to today, two days before my internship starts, and I realized my mistake and found a whole bunch more listings.

Now, the problem I have is that I figure it wouldn't be worth it to drive 4 hours there and 4 hours back to go look at places tomorrow. I am planning on just going down on Sunday and looking at places and hoping that I find a good one. I was wondering how likely it is that I'll get a place by looking at it. Is it the sort of thing where its like, ""I'll take it!"" or is it more like you look at a place and then the people say ""thanks for looking, I'll let you know what we think in a couple of days"". Basically, who has the power when subletting a room? Do I, as the renter make the choice or is it more like an interview? Also, would it be weird to bring all of my stuff and pretty much move in as soon as I find a place? I've never rented before, and my mistake means that I just don't have the time that I normally would so I'm getting kind of worried. Any help with this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Ran completely out of loans and money just paying bills and buying groceries, I tried to borrow as little as I could.  I literally never have time to hang out with friends nor the money to go out.  Alienated almost everyone I've made acquaintances with trying to finish my thesis project which probably won't get done (it's a technical problem that no professor at my crappy art school can help me with because they don't even know the programs well enough to help; I've googled, looked up digital tutors and lynda.com and asked former classmates and former teachers, no one has the time to sit down with me to teach what I need to know to complete my project).  Applied to a bunch of jobs and internships. Haven't heard back from a single one b/c I have no experience and honestly my work isn't that great (I've got 2 years training while undergrads get 4).  Worked my ass off trying to play catchup with the undergrads, been staying awake 48 hours, sleeping 4 on a regular basis just teaching myself the software and working on the project.  I probably bleed caffeine. Can't even get hired at Starbucks because I'm ""too over qualified"".  I have asian parents, I've completely disappointed them since I moved across the country. Should've taken their advice and gone to optometry or orthidontistry school, or gotten an MBA.  I've got almost $2k in credit card debt and about 60k in stafford and plus loans.  My plus loans kick in immediately after graduation.  No idea how I'm going to be able to start paying those back.  I know there's people dealing with tsunamis and incurable diseases - I fortunately still have a roof over my head for at least another month.  This stress is just killing me.  I almost had a nervous breakdown on the commute home tonight in a crowded bus.  I know I need to man up and get over it, shit happens every day.  Where do I start? It's been a rough day / week.  This is longer than I thought I'd write.

It is usually San Fran, Mountain View, or NYC. However, I don't quite understand how unpaid interns can afford to relocate to these high priced cities. 

Some startups outsource their work to foreign workers if only for one project or task. Why not hire unpaid interns to do the telecommute work with a chance to become a more important role in the company while learning about the startup environment? This would also help us build our resume. 

Living in a state that does not thrive on technology as a major industry, it is frustrating that there are virtually no startups nor any that offer internships. Will telecommute internships ever take hold?

I want to move from Belgium to Norway, I don't have a job offer or anything else in Norway.  
Just a Belgian guy wanting to go to Norway.  
What do I have to do to be allowed to live in Norway and work there immediately (or asap) after arriving?
And what will be the time between arriving and being allowed to work?

I already looked up some stuff myself and created a step-by-step guide of moving to Norway for myself and would like to get it checked out.

**Preparation before leaving**  

1. Get HS+College diplomas translated + accredited. (Or does just college diploma suffice?)  
*In my case this is doing what they say [here][erkenningDiploma] and [here][apostilleDiploma]*.  

2. Lære noen Norsk!

**After arriving**  

1. Go to the nearest NAV bureau and get signed up as ""looking for work"".  
*This will probabely give me a D-number and after a few months a work permit (Do I as a EU citizen need one actually?). This will also allow me to stay [up to 6 months][EUWorkVisa] instead of 3.*  
Also request a tax card (Skattekort) here.

2. Open a bank account in a Norwegian bank so the employer has a place to send the money to.  
*Requires D-number.*

3. Look for a job myself.  
*Don't wait for the NAV or any other interim to find a job for me*

4. Look for an appartment.  
*Or do this before looking for a job? See other questions below*

**After finding a job**  

1. Request a [residence permit][EUWorkVisa] (last few paragraphs) in order to be allowed to stay longer than 6 months.

**After 5 years of working and if I want to stay permanently**

1. Request a [permanent residence permit][permanentResidencePermit]

   
   
**Other questions**

+ Do I need to have a permanent address before I can start looking for a job, or is it okay to stay with someone (eg. couchsurfing)?  
+ What is the time between requesting a D-number and being able to use it (look for a job, open a bank account), and can I start this process from Belgium in order to minimize wasting time?  
+ Requesting a work permit can take a [long time][workPermitWaitTime] I've read, but there also exists a temporary work permit. What would be the waiting time for that?
+ Does an interim job qualify as a job offer when requesting a [residence permit][EUWorkVisa]?
Related to this: is it possible to hop from interim job to interim job and keep your residence permit?
+ Anything else that you think that might be useful - let me know :)  
Also, if you know some web/software development businesses in/around Stavanger, that would be very helpful.


**Extra info**  

+ I have a College bachelors diploma in Applied Computer Science but not much working experience in software development (2 months internship, 1 month vacation job and after this summer another month of vacation work.)

I'm relatively new to smoking (on and off use for a few years) and am currently a pharmacy student. There is an obvious conflict with being in a the health care professional dealing exclusively with drugs and being a THC enthusiast. I work at a community pharmacy and start internships this summer. I have a general fear of being tested and have started thinking about getting to know my body and how it eliminates THC. I want to buy test strips, but I want reliable ones. Cost is of little concern considering the stakes of me getting busted (possible academic expulsion, not to mention losing my job). Any recommendations or tips on self testing?

TL;DR: I need suggestions for reliable THC testing strips. Help!

I've been a smoker since high school, but had to stay clean for almost 2 years (random drug tests at school and on rotation).  I seem to be the only person among my class or coworkers who doesn't buy into all the myths about weed.  Are there any other health care professionals who are desperately waiting for the day we can smoke without risking a 100k/year job?

gns3f,7,2011-04-11,Health Professional Smoking: Really reckless or OK?,[deleted],saplings,https://www.reddit.com/r/saplings/comments/gns3f/health_professional_smoking_really_reckless_or_ok/,"Please direct me to a different subreddit if this isn't an appropriate place for such a question. I ask this question here because I want to hear the opinions of people who smoke or at least know a thing or two about it, not those who are ignorant to the idea of smoking and place green into the same category as heroine. I will try to be brief.

I'm a pharmacy student over half-done with my education. I grew up in a smoking family. One of my parents grew and used his own and it was always very accepted and natural in my household. My parents were amazing and I have no regrets. I started smoking in high school and have done so on and off for over 5 years. Recently, I have been very on and regularly smoke. To get to the point, I asked for recommendation for reliable THC testing strips on r/sapling  to track my cleanliness and instead of recommendations I got one comment, basically telling me I shouldn't be smoking being as I could lose my job/future career, etc. I was sort of annoyed at the time thinking ""I asked for testing advice, not your opinion on my smoking situation"". 

Now however, I wonder about my situation. I have always been worried about getting tested at work (I work in a small, hometown pharmacy where it would probably never happen) or at an internship and so I HAVE wondered in the past if I should just walk away from the tree culture. I have a LOT to lose. 

I know the science, the physiology, the laws. I know that green is a great thing and that politics keep it illegal, a schedule II medication when it should only be a schedule V. So, I find it difficult to walk away from. I almost have this arrogance like, because *I* agree with its use that I should get away with using it. I am a competent user, I do great at my job, I get on the honor-roll at school (one of the top 10 in the nation). 

Am I an asshole for thinking I can get away with continued use? Should I really be risking so much on this? The person who called me out said I needed to get a different ""hobby"". I resent that comment, as I don't think it is necessarily a ""hobby"", not only do I use it for recreation, but also for sleep issues and menstrual cramps. But, the guy has a point. What do you think? Thanks everyone and I apologize for the length. 

TL;DR: As a health professional, is it worth it to smoke at the cost of losing your job/future in your field if you get caught?

EDIT: Thank you for the input everyone. I have no one to talk to about this sort of thing and so r/sapling and r/trees have really been my only support. "

I just feel so reserved I hate putting my self out there. In high school I was always a C or D student I would always just put in just enough effort to get by. I probably wouldn't even be in college if I didn't have a wife that I felt I need to make something of my self for. I feel like I'm so worthless compared to her she works 60 hours a week and is going to school for her masters in biology. She was second in her class in high school. Just really someone who works very hard. Now I'm in college going for Computer Science because I feel like I need to get through a difficult degree to make my self feel like I'm worth something. I'm getting a 2.9 GPA which feels like a huge accomplishment to me. Yet I'm still not doing well enough I should really be above 3.0 GPA to get into any internships and I really feel like this semester of school is not going to help my GPA which is just really bothering me because I want to do well for my wife. I've really been struggling with trying to feel like I'm worth anything. 

My dad died in a car accident in 2004. I struggled with that for a year really not being productive at all. Just trying to get out the depressed rut I was in. After that year my family ends up getting a settlement out of the trucking company of the truck that hit my dad. So I end up getting $300,000. I at 20 years old have $300,000 in my bank account. I really should have handed it over to someone else to take care of for me but no I end up just keeping it cause I am an idiot. Well I end up blowing all the money and loaned my mother (who has less money management skills then I do) $30,000 which was supposed to be paid back to me last year. Nope she filled bankruptcy and I won't be seeing any of it. I know I should not really being looking at money as all my problems but I just keep thinking that way. I am not making any money for my family right now I'm just concentrating on school. While My wife works 2 jobs and is going to school for her masters in biology. I really should get my self at least a part time job but I just can't motivate my self to. 

I know I'm rambling and this article really is to long and probably doesn't make any sense on what my problem really is to sum it up is that I feel like I'm worthless."

I am an international student at a school in North Carolina, and I am currently in Los Angeles because I am doing an exchange semester here, I am also doing an internship.

Today at work my boss came in a little late and he was looking extremely sick. He asked me if I could get him Zyrtec form CVS, and I walked over there to get it. I was looking at the aisle of nonprescription cold / allergy medicine-- when I didn't see it there I asked a pharmacist at the counter if I could get a pack of Zyrtec. It was actually being sold at the pharmacy desk even though it was a nonprescription drug, probably because of some chemical component. I was pretty sure I should have been able to get it regardless. 

However, the person at the counter asked for my ID, and I presented him my passport, the page with my American Visa. They told me that this is not a form of ID that is accepted, and the only ID that they would accept is either a drivers license or a California ID. I did not have my USC ID with me. I asked if I could talk to the manager, who confirmed what the person at the counter told me, that I can't get it.

Honestly, I felt pretty bad about not being able to get the thing just with my passport. I could have asked the manager several questions regarding medical ethics but I knew that there was no point of arguing once they have made it clear that they would not sell it to me. I just put my poker-face on, asked for the best alternative product that I could buy, and thanked them once they directed me back to the nonprescription medicine aisle. 

Is this OK? I am finding it difficult to comprehend what the difference is between me and the other intern who sits right by me, who was born in Cali. Why can I not get Zyrtec with my completely legitimate student visa on my passport, a great form of identification? Please let me know what you think."

I’m a student in an internship. My assignment is to design some extra implementations for an infrared-cabin control panel. One of these implementations is to be able to dim [Dr. Fisher Vitae halogen lamps]( http://www.dr-fischer-gmbh.de/index.php?lang=en&amp;Bereich=8&amp;DBereich=8). The lamps will have a total power of 1200W. This has to be done by pushing on a button on a control panel, so I was thinking of writing a piece of code (which has to be in assembler) to change the duty cycle of a signal and using that signal at the gate of a TRIAC. I was thinking of using [this TRIAC]( http://www.st.com/stonline/products/literature/ds/2936.pdf).
My questions to you now are:

*Is what I’m trying to do possible?

*Can I directly connect this signal to the gate?

*Have I chosen the right TRIAC for the job?

*I’ve read about buzzing of the wire and how it will disrupt radio receivers. How can I avoid this?

I will try and keep an eye on this topic but I’m from Europe and the time difference could be bothersome when trying to give quick responses.

It's kind of long, so feel free to skip if it you just want to answer the question yourself. :D

I'm much less shy now than I used to be. My shyness was at a peak from 6th to 10th grade. In 5th grade I was actually popular, a lot of girls had crushes on me in my class and asked me out. I was shy but I had enough friends that everything was fine. I remember the prettiest girl in the class, the girl all the jocks had crushes on, decided to make out with my yearbook picture. In 6th grade suddenly I found myself in a classroom full of people I had never met before and none of my friends had the same lunch *or* recess periods as me. I felt like the entire school had conspired to design for me the most hellish social trap I could conceive as a shy person. All my friends--I mainly saw them during school, not out of school--moved on in their social lives with each other, and I was left out of that. And to make it worse all the people in my class all seemed to be friends with one another but not with me. 6th grade is one of the most depressing years of my life because of this. I was made fun of a lot that year just for being shy, which completely eliminated my ability to befriend people in the class. I felt like I was surrounded by enemies every day because of the way they treated me. It was the first time in my life I experienced the desire to truly inflict physical pain on somebody else. At the peak of my anger, I almost acted out on that desire during a water break half way through a class. But in the midst of my physical outlash rationality overwhelmed me, physical strength left me, and I ended up just pinching my offender. Needless to say I was subsequently severely made fun of for that.

But my reaction to that year has defined the rest of my life. I reacted by obsessively teaching myself algebra to the point that I was being privately tutored in calculus by a third-year engineering student at a nearby university. I taught myself C++ at 12 years old. I was offered a programming internship my very first semester of college by skipping the introductory programming courses and getting perfect scores on everything in an algorithms course I took; as it happens a marketing director for a local company was taking the course so he could be more in touch with the programmers at his company, and he offered me a job on the spot. And now as a junior in college I am studying advanced algebraic topology with fourth year graduate students. As much as I hated 6th grade, I would not be where I am had I not been socially ostracized that year. I honestly cannot say that it was definitely worth it. But life. Life is funny. My entire life is my attempt to compensate for that year."

He's such a great guy and I find myself constantly thinking about him! Would it be weird/creepy if I found his number through his work and called him? What would you guys think?

I asked my 23yr old friend and he said it would seem a bit creepy since I would have had to go a lot out of my way to search for his number.. Your guys input?

EDIT: I think ultimately I will try to contact him (he works for a company with more than 100k employees.. I know which office he's at so hopefully it won't require too much work). As you all were saying, I really have nothing to lose! It's a bit nerve racking and if he does end up having a girlfriend, as Stalked_Like_Corn said, I should just play it cool... try hard not to come off as creepy. And if he IS creeped out, I don't have to see him again. 

Thank you RA! If anything ends up happening this summer I'll be sure to update you guys."
gojrt,11,2011-04-12,Your thoughts on dropping out of law school,ToDropOutOrNot,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/gojrt/your_thoughts_on_dropping_out_of_law_school/,"Hey guys,

Forgive me for not giving all of the facts here, but I go to a school ranked between 20-30 in the northeast. I have since been attending on my parents' dime, but finances have been tough and I'm now on student loans. Specifically, if things don't settle back, I will be graduating with around 60k of debt. I am even considering living with my mom next year (about 40 minutes away from school) in order to keep this debt as small as possible.

My GPA is pretty miserable at 2.8. I believe this puts me in the bottom 20% of the class, though I can't find any actual ranking in my transcript. That's beside the point, because I know the 50% range is above 3.0, so I imagine my standing is pretty damn low.

The thing is, while I may not be an attractive candidate as a law student, I am a white guy who can speak Chinese, and I have a pretty impressive resume in the financial sector (have interned at two large international banks, and worked at a fortune 500 company). Father has connections in said sector, but almost nothing in the legal field besides friends of friends.

I like the law, and specifically some of my classes which focus on commercial finance and securities law. But I have found myself on a slippery slope of moral resignation that my GPA is doomed to be &lt;50%ile, no matter how hard I work. I can't imagine getting a job after graduation based on grades, anyway. If I do get a job, it will be a combination of the school I go to, my Chinese/work history, and/or my father.

Am I shooting myself in the foot by not dropping out here? Can anyone here chime in? I had a great interview yesterday for a good law firm, but the position amounted to due diligence for private Chinese companies seeking to do reverse mergers in the US. It will be unpaid, not 5 days a week, and without any promise/suggestion that they would intend to give me an offer for graduation. It would hardly be a ""legal internship.""

My thoughts are that I've already covered half the ""investment."" Whatever value a JD has for me, the cost of getting it is half of what it will be for someone starting school. I'm also concerned that dropping out would look even worse to future employers (not that I would put this on my resume, but I wonder if a simple background check can reveal that I dropped out of law school). Finally, if it seems likely that I probably won't even pursue law after law school, is a JD worth anything at all? I was under the impression that a JD was ""versatile,"" which I imagine many of you were as well. Is that even the case now?

TL;DR
------
**Top 30 school, bottom 20% of class, second year. Seems likely that I won't practice law after school, though I would like to. Anyone in a similar position? Thoughts on dropping out? Best of all, any one here a law school drop out themself? How has that turned out?**"

I've taken classes I've loved and classes I've fallen asleep in, I've found mentors who have led me to the right track in life, I've switched majors, I've been a champion in extracurricular competition, I've pulled countless all nighters, I've studied abroad, I've had a summer internship that have changed my life, I've made friends who have saved my life.

I've also scaled the buildings on campus, stolen an eight-foot school insignia, gotten kicked out of the bars for several reasons, I've woken up in a tree, I've woken up next to someone I didn't know, I've gone to classes with beer instead of books in my backpack (accidentally and intentionally), I've run from campus security (backwards).

Anyway, I was supposed to be subleasing an apartment over the summer with a friend who ended up getting an internship.  I still want the apartment, but don't want to pay for a 2 bedroom by myself.  

It's a 2 bedroom, 1 bathroom apartment on the corner of San Jacinto and Dean Keaton (across the street from the CPE/ETC and across the intersection from the RLM).  We'll be playing $900 + utilities for the whole unit (split down the middle - 450 + half of utilities for each of us), so it's a ridiculously good deal IMO.  I believe we're each getting a parking space, too, if you have a car.

About me:  I'm 4th year CS major (graduating May 2012) originally from Houston.  I have a job and am planning on taking 8 hours of classes over the summer, so I'll probably be gone a lot of the time, but otherwise, I play a lot of videogames (xbox and pc: I don't mind setting everything up in my room if that's a problem)...  Actually, I'm terrible with about me's, but I think I'm a pretty easy-to-live-with / easygoing person... if there's anything specific you'd like to know feel free to ask.

I'm planning on buying most of the common-area things (dishes, silverware, couch, tables, etc), so you shouldn't need to worry about anything but possibly a bed (I may be able to get you a twin to use over the summer if you don't want to invest money in one right now) and anything else you think you'll need. 

If you're interested (or just want more details), post or PM me.  I should be able to arrange a tour or something before you need to agree to anything, so there's no pressure to make a decision before then.  

Thanks, and sorry again for advertising on this subreddit :D

So I'm just going for it now. Good omen: r/Cheatmode announced today. 

I'm doing MWF Stronglifts 5x5. I'm not new to weightlifting but I got caught up in the bodybuilding aspect and neglected legs for about 2 years, I only did Leg Press machines here and there, so squats feel great right now. Then I went through a round of P90x but now I am ready to hit it again! I'm starting with pretty low weights but am increasing slightly faster for a bit.



Current schedule with internship: (workout day)

7am: Wake up  
8am: Work  
12:30pm: Lunch break, going to eat first meal at 1pm to get it as close to my 5pm workout as possible. I can't really eat at work around 2pm or else I would.  
4pm: Some cashews, possibly some other protein to get ready for the workout.  
5:15pm: Workout.  
7pm: Post workout feast.  
9pm: Casein protein shake.

4pm: Boxing or Ultimate Frisbee depending on the day.

8:30pm: Casein protein shake/leftovers from feast.  


Schedule in Auburn at college: (control day)

I've never wrote anything like this before, and this hasn't been edited at all, I just wanna know what people think of it. :D

It was spring, 1937
Dr. Manhattan was working on his prototype for the nuclear bomb.
He was given a massive government research grant, his own facility, and the top minds in the field, including a young intern he only knew at the time as ""Hank"".
The tests and procedures were strict and designed to protect the people involved, however despite their best efforts, there is no such thing as a completely safe nuclear research facility.
and so, when a low-yield nuclear test went awry, they were faced with a difficult decision... amongst those present was Dr. Manhattan, 3 of his colleagues, and young Hank.
The mechanism usually used to dispose of any unsafe material was damaged during test, and so the small, albeit still potentially catastrophic amount of nuclear material was rapidly approaching fission with no way to properly contain it.
With time not being one of their plentiful resources, young Hank took bold and incredibly dangerous action, going into the test chamber to dispose of the material via manual force. He had to physically throw the material into the waste management system.
All 5 of them knew it was suicide, but before the others could act, Hank had closed the test chamber door and locked it. Some of the strict safety measures made it so that the door, once locked from the inside, could not be opened from the outside. Hank had made his decision, and with a firm set gaze, strode over to his doom.
Never had any of the 4 men had such torn feelings, a split between horror at having to watch one of their most promising young proteges walk willingly to his death, and admiration, at the courage and steady-handedness with which he accepted his task.
However they were all mistaken. Nuclear fission is a curious thing, and reactions of such power can be, at times, very unpredictable. For the very moment Hank's hands pressed onto the sample, it erupted. But not into fission, as it had countless times before. This time, Fusion was created.
The sudden burst of energy and radiation pulsed through Hank, and through the test chamber. The men watching were blinded by the intense light of the reaction, and could only assume the worst.
The material boiled and exploded, travelling up hanks arms and across his body in an instant, but for him it was an eternity
An eternity of fire, and then it was over.
The 4 men regained their vision and looked upon what they were sure would be carnage in the test chamber. Vaporized, Hank would be.
And yet, as the light dissipated, the silhouette of a man appeared. It was hank, but he had changed. His skin was a char black, with cracks of bright white throughout, every hair on his body burnt off, and his eyes were a bright smoldering white. As bright as a star. And yet he held himself as though he was in perfect health. On this day, Fusion had been born."

However, she can't get her family to cosign for a lease or even give her permission to leave home.

She's recently turned 21 but her dad basically takes her paychecks and controls all her finances. Her family had to this point been charging her rent to live at home, however, when she started coming to the city (staying with me overnight looking at apartments and job-hunting) her parents stopped charging her and basically said if she moves out she's totally on her own. The big problem is that we live in a city with a lot of universities and there are no apartments that I know of (and we've looked) that will rent to someone younger than 25 without a cosigner.

As much as I would like to help this is totally infeasible for me, and I know it would be a bad decision in the long run, not that she would EVER ask it of anyone anyway.

What I was really wondering is: can anyone think of a way to help her out this situation? Or has someone had a similar experience that can help? I never experienced anything remotely like this kind of problem and want to help but I don't know how."

The program I've chosen is the two-month summer language study program in [Beppu, Oita](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Beppu,+Oita&amp;aq=&amp;sll=34.813803,137.48291&amp;sspn=8.870993,13.293457&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Beppu,+Oita+Prefecture,+Japan&amp;ll=33.289786,131.491241&amp;spn=0.282393,0.415421&amp;z=11), approximately 600 miles from Fukushima by air. Initially everyone in my family was for it, but since after the tsunami and nuclear accident, everyone is asking me to reconsider. 

I'm against the idea of rescheduling my travel abroad since if this drags on into my junior year in college, then it would probably interfere with my internship search efforts, and I would much rather have it out of the way than have either (a)a potentially shortened program or (b)the program overlapping any internship positions I might secure. Businesses usually give more preference to juniors and seniors than sophomores so I think it's better to have the study abroad program now.

Realistically, if I absolutely refused to abandon my plans, the trip will probably still take place. But what I would like is a list of source material and/or actual experiences from people living near Oita prefecture that supports my argument that traveling to Beppu now carries the same amount of risk as traveling to Beppu before the disaster.

What I have so far:

* [Updated major Japanese city background radiation measurements](http://atmc.jp/): Beppu is not there, but 大分県（大分市） is, which for all intents and purposes satisfy my argument that background radiation levels are normal.
* Several newspaper articles including Kyuushuu as one of the unaffected areas of the quake.

What my parents are saying/citing:

* Reports of increased radiation found in food and drinking water, primary concern being iodine-131. I haven't had the time to find a lot of sources on how much was detected.
* Increased risk of strong earthquakes in the area.
* Rising food prices, I think this is more of an afterthought than anything.

If any Japanese redittors can help give me some insight into living risks in Kyuushuu, or help me find statistics that supports the argument that traveling to Beppu is (relatively?)safe, I'd appreciate it very much. 

(P.S. We are Chinese, so my parents might give reports and material written in Chinese more preference than if they were written in English. They can read English though, or I can translate them into Chinese.)"

It has been nothing but crap. Let me explain as fast as i can:
I work for the client services (fix computers for the company, answer help questions, basicly IT help desk), the head of the team (no IT experience at all) decided she wants to hire her good buddy (again, no IT experience), but had to let go of someone to open a spot, so she let go of the only knowledgeable person. I learned more from him then anyone at the company.
I have been stuck sorting documentation for 4 months, and have had to restart 9 times, because my boss cant get the instructions right (IE, tells me to do one thing, but doesn't realize it is wrong). I have basicly been in a loop of depression doing the same pointless things over and over.

Is there a way I can get back at the company for being lame sauce, but not doing anything in a wrong sort of way?"

* We won a group which featured Inter Milan (not progressed, WON)
* We narrowed the goal difference in the group stage when we lost against Inter
* We beat AC Milan, who are the current leaders of Serie A
* We got further than Arsenal

I know we had no part in that last one, but it makes me feel better.

We knew before the first leg that this wasn't going to be an easy match. And with a bankroll like Real Madrid has, it would expected they would top us. But we put in a tremendous effort tonight, and I am so proud of you Spurs!

gpbrx,129,2011-04-13,[FR] A girl at work gave IOIs... I capitalized like a boss (+ deep details &amp; lessons!),acartoontiger,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/gpbrx/fr_a_girl_at_work_gave_iois_i_capitalized_like_a/,"Hey everyone, so this happened in the summer before I found Seddit but I just remembered and thought that it would make a good at-work FR.

**Background**
I'm 21, recent college grad.  One of my jobs is an intern post at a small animal park.  I am a physiologist/pre-vet.  I go in once a week to feed animals, do maintenance, pat tigers (yeah, pat tigers.  We have a liger too, she is nice).

**HB7 19years Brunette**
A few days in I notice that HB7 who also interns is giving me *the look*.  You know that look.  Its the *I want you to look back and smile* look.  I do look back and smile.  I see a look in her eyes that is **very** revealing about what she is thinking.  At this moment I have an epiphany... **Girls that are younger than me eat up my minute gaming points like candy**.  At this point we have not yet spoken, so I decide to remedy that and I walk up to her and her friend HB6.  

* Me:  ""So do you give that sexy look to all the new guys or can you just tell that I am one of the good ones?""
* Her: *Obviously surprised that I would say something like that, giggles and smiles*
* Me: ""I'm Felix, whats your name?""
* Her: ""I'm HB7 and this is HB6, do you work here too?""
* Me: ""Yes I come in to play with the animals and charm the employees when I'm not away at school...  Oh wait, I shouldn't be flirting with you, you could be the boss' daughter or something.  I'm so embarrassed"" (smiling)

This exchange results in us chatting for a while and her asking me about myself which I knock out of the park.  She wants to be a vet too but she is a few years behind me in the process and is very impressed by where I go to school.  I am polite to HB6 but eventually I want her gone so I suggest that we go get fruit from the kitchen and hand feed the monkeys.  HB7 says yes enthusiastically and HB6 evaporates (victory).  

**Isolation Lesson:** Acknowledge the fact that you and HB*target* are flirting verbally in front of the obstacle and then find a reason to change locations.  If HB*obstacle* is a good friend she will see that her friend is having fun and make herself scarce.  It worked.

Anyway we feed monkeys and flirt for a while, her buying temperature is extreme.  It sounds cocky, but at this point I could just tell that I had it in the bag and she was hooked (60minutes).  Since we are at work I find it difficult to take her into a closet and fuck her, so I settle for giving her my number and telling her that we will meet up in a day or two outside work.  She runs her hands up my shirt before I leave to go back to my part of Tahoe.  I feel like I left her wanting more (I was right).

She texts me that night like, 6 hours after I left work.  We send a few sex heavy texts back and forth, you get the idea. 

**Insert Tactical Maneuver**  
She eventually says that she wants to see me the next day and I say NO.  I could have just said yes and worked from there but I wanted to make her wait because I was enjoying having her on the hook.  I was also working the next day at my other job (vet practice).  We set a day to go swimming in the lake together.  We teased each other a bit about swimming skills so this was a natural activity.  I grew up in Tahoe, so I know several secluded spots to swim and lie on the rocks.  Perfect

We swim and flirt for a while and the day is beautiful so we lie on a towel on some comfortable rocks.  *She had a towel too but she laid on mine with me*.  This is the last straw, we are alone.  She is laying on her back with eyes closed (totally awake though).  I lean over, place a hand on her waist/stomach and use the other one to gently lift up her chin and kiss her.  **Guys, Do This!**  Its golden and it always gives them an extra boost of being turned on right before you kiss them.  I do it almost all the time, even in my LTR, she loves it.  Anyway, there is rarely any speaking after I make my first kiss and this was no exception.  F close, by the lake.  Very picturesque and she had no inhibitions, totally hot sex.

We swim again and have sex again about an hour later, it was awesome.  I liked this girl, and before we parted at the end of the day she said one of the nicest things to me I've ever been told.

*""You touch me like I'm so beautiful, I love it""*

It stuck with me, and it was a huge confidence boost for my future endeavors.  We have had several ""booty calls"" I guess I would call them since that day.

I know this FR is long and sounds kinda cocky but I don't care.  Shit happened just like this, blew my fucking mind.

**Lessons Learned/Reinforced**

* Flirt with your coworkers, good things happen
* Assume initial attraction, in this case it was totally true
* Friends of HB*target* will get out of your way if you make your intentions clear and they can see that their friend wants it
* Learn to read facial expressions and eye movements.  I can't stress this enough.  Just as it is important to be able to recognize the *save me!* eyes from across a bar, it is important to be able to recognize the *look at me and smile!* eyes everywhere.
* Take bitches swimming and lying in the sun, bitches love swimming and lying in the sun.
* Always go for the kiss if the situation is conducive to passionate sex, its worked out for me many times and its worked out for others many more times.
* Don't be afraid, sometimes they want you more than you want them.  They are just waiting for you to charm their pants off.  Do it!

I wish the best of luck to everyone here, and I really enjoy giving back to the community so I am happy to answer questions and talk game.

*Getting out in the field gets easier and more rewarding every time,*

gp9w3,3,2011-04-13,Financial planning... Where to go?,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/gp9w3/financial_planning_where_to_go/,"So I created this as a throwaway, since I don't want this info tied back to me somehow (not sure why, really, but oh well).

Anyways, I'm a 20 year old college student. I will be graduating with a BS in ME next year, and with a masters shortly after that. I held up my part of a bargain with my parents and have been lucky enough that my college has been entirely paid for.

So upon graduation I will have no debt, about $20,000 in a money market savings (earned from internships and co-ops, +/- whatever I make this summer), and $7500 + growth in a roth IRA (Schwab 2040 target, currently at $8000) I started a couple of years ago. I contributed the full $5000 last year, and will likely continue to do so until I begin needing the money more.

I guess my question is, assuming I get a job (not worried about that [90+% placement rate for my grad school]), how much is prudent to keep around in an immediately accessible savings account? How much should I continue to contribute to the IRA? Where else would it be wise to invest? Since I won't be retiring for another 40+ years, it seems that risk isn't a huge issue. 

Thanks in advance

gp64n,1,2011-04-13,Feel like things are getting worse again...,modestmoose5,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/gp64n/feel_like_things_are_getting_worse_again/,"I've had a fairly long history with depression (never diagnosed, never talked to any sort of professional to be honest). Growing up, my mother was pretty insane. She would flip a shit over really insignificant stuff, basically every memory of christmas or family vacation from my childhood is dominated by her having a crazy episode, many times in public. She was also extremely emotionally abusive and manipulative to my father, who was a complete doormat. I never really realized how bad it was until my early teens. Until I was 14, all I wanted to do was get good grades and make my parents proud. When my parents had a horribly messy divorce right before my freshman year of high school, I stopped caring about, well, just about anything. 

I stopped caring about my grades and started hanging out with a pretty bad crowd. This continued throughout most of high school. I was horribly awkward, never so much as kissed a girl throughout all of hs and kept the same few weird friends the whole time. I only managed to get into a decent college based on an athletic scholarship and good SAT scores.

My first year and a half of college was probably my lowest point. I didn't make any friends at all in school and found myself eventually driving home just about every weekend just to get away from it. I started getting heavily into drinking, weed, psychedelics, pain pills and thought about suicide a lot, as well as other ""existential crisis"" type shit. However, things did get a little better. I eventually started making friends and becoming more social. My senior year I even started dating a few girls and felt like I was really starting to leave my depression behind, but every time I would get dumped due to inexperience/latent depression and attachment issues I had that would eventually arise by me being clingy and dependent. I also had this impending sense that once college ended, I didn't know what I wanted to do with myself.

After college, I lived at home for about 6 months trying to get my shit together while doing some part time work. At this point I have a few really close friends that are actually not losers and that I really enjoy spending time with. However, they're all moving on with their lives and I know that I'm going to have to do the same.  I find an internship in a field I'm interested in in NYC and I just so happen to have a place I can stay for about a month to see if I can start a life for myself.

The first month is great, honestly one of the best times of my life. I immediately start hanging out with a couple people I knew back in high school and I'm doing really well at my internship. I meet a girl that I come to like a lot and we spend the first 4-5 weeks I'm up there sleeping with each other ~4 days a week. My boss at my internship is dropping really obvious hints that I'm going to get a job once my internship is over, and I start planning a life in NYC.

This is when shit starts going sour. Things between me and the girl get really intense for a couple weeks, I think we got too emotionally invested in each other too fast.  I can tell she's having second thoughts, and the more she pulls away, the more my insecurities start to show. This also happens to be at the same point my boss informs me I would not be getting the job. My best friend from home also abruptly stopped contacting me or responding to my calls.  Basically, the stars aligned and a lot of the shit I valued and took for granted in my life went to shit.

This all happened roughly a month ago.  In the ensuing 4 weeks or so, I decided to sublet a place for a couple months and try to find a new job.  I actually have a couple promising leads, but now I'm wondering if I even want to stay up here. I still hang out with those two other people a couple times a week, but the rest of the time I'm basically jobhunting for a few hours every day, then wallowing by myself. I've lost 15 pounds because I can't even make myself eat anymore. The girl I was seeing before hasn't explicitly ended things between us but we've hung out less and less in the last 4 weeks, and I haven't even seen her since two weeks ago saturday. We talked on the phone yesterday for about 5 minutes, and I was almost hoping she would just tell me it was over so I could stop thinking it was even a possibility anymore, but all she said was she's extremely busy with school and work for the next month, and that she'll let me know if we can ever hang out in the mean time.

Sorry for this extremely rambling post, I just don't know what I should even do at this point. I am so moody lately, sometimes I'll think everything's ok but that usually only lasts until I fall asleep.  Every morning I wake up I feel depressed.  I've started sleeping upwards of 10+ hours a night and my sleep is interrupted constantly by weird/scary dreams. I've started thinking about suicide again but honestly I don't think I'd ever have the balls to do it, death scares the shit out of me.  If anything I'll die stupidly getting wasted/taking drugs, which I've been more cavalier with lately as well. I just want to run away and start somewhere new where I don't know anyone, but that's basically what I just did 2 months ago and that didn't work out well at all, so now I have no idea what I should do. 

I really do want to get over my issues but I don't know where to begin. I've never been able to turn to my family for any kind of support other than financial (which I am very appreciative of, if it wasn't for that I don't know where I'd be). Every time I try to talk about my personal life they just change the subject, and that's the way it's always been. I don't think I can afford getting professional help, but honestly I've never even looked into it, I really regret not talking to my school counselors when I had the chance. I don't even know what motivated me to post this, I guess I just hope someone can tell me where to begin getting over this shit for good, because obviously the bootstraps method has done nothing but hide my issues until something shitty happens, then it seems to all come out at once.

I have no relevant finance job experience. I wasn't able to get an internship during college, because I always worked full time (or almost full time) trying to pay for classes. I've been avoiding student loans like the plague. Luckily my combination of scholarships and work has made it possible. Unfortunately, it's working against me right now since every job posting I find wants someone with experience.

Any help is greatly appreciated. I've been feeling really down about this lately.

What is considered a good starting salary for an entry level position in web development (I live in Cincinnati)?

For anyone who has been in the field for a while, what do you consider to be some of the pitfalls that you can run into? Is there anything specific that you get burnout on doing?

What languages/technologies should I continue to learn in the future? I think html5 is going to huge, but it's going to be a while before it has enough browser support to see wide spread use.

I will graduate in June and several years back then, I thought that I would try to apply for Phd programme in Europe. Now the time has come so I'm looking at my options and I would ask for your thoughts on it. About my chances the bad thing is that I have a horrible gpa(3.7 out of 5, in a not top500 university), not really good at math (I can understand proofs like Hopfield Net convergence, although never was top in class), and I'm quite old (turned into 26 yesterday). The good news are that I had several side projects, maybe I'm not braindead(iq ~131, standard mensa, although I assume it's normal within phd), and I have a quite good thesis from which I could extract a paper if would want to(at least I think). So my questions:

1. What do you think, what are my odds getting into a funded phd programme in Europe(ger, gb, ireland, nl, ..)? I've searched for phd-sites but I haven't managed to find, so is there a unified ""phd-search-in-europe"" site? :O

2. A friend interested in doing it in the USA and have done GRE and all the stuff. What are the chances having a phd there(not into ivy league, ""just"" top50 us university - or it's not worth it?) Also odds in other parts of the world?

3. Am I too old, so I should get a life instead? :) I don't have problems with the industry, I just try to avoid ending up with a boring ""business logic"" job. Also I'm not in love with science or anything, I just like to think long on problems(walking in circles at midnights) and I would be dissatisfied if I should do this with problems I don't think worth it. Yeah it sounds lame and mediocre, and I'm aware that I'm not a top shot, but anyway I do this stuff. 

I've made my cv for an internship position, so I would humbly ask you guys, what do you think about my prospects/what should I do? Thank you for any answer or sharing an experience related!

 I have a very bright friend from Nepal who will graduate next year with a Mechanical Engineering degree. He applied to 300 companies and was turned down by every one. He is a very inspiring individual and it saddens me that he cant find an internship for the summer. Please reddit, help me find him one.



I am a Mechanical Engineering major at LSU. I have a friend who is also in my major. We share one major difference; He is from Nepal and I am American. My friend is not a US citizen nor does he own a green card. This makes it very hard for him to apply for internships. 

In todays day in age, you really MUST have an interniship if you want a realistic shot in landing a job right out of school. My friend (Jay) applied to over 300 internships all throughout the US and only 20 responded. Of the 20 that responded, all of them said one thing; We cannot consider you because you do not have a greencard. 

LSU has a very convenient way of landing interviews. It's called ""carrers2geaux"". It's an online way of submitting resume's to companies and applying for jobs and internships. this is very helpful for US citizens but if you do not have a green card most companies wont even let you apply. 

Jay is one of the greatest guys I know. He holds a 3.91 GPA (which is absolutely brilliant in any major but especially for Mechanical Engineering). He is very involved in organizations. Goes well out of his way to make people happy and always carries more load that he needs to as far as group projects are concerned. Any time anyone doesnt understand something while were studying he spends as much time as needed until they understand it. 

We have a large study group but 5 of us are very close. (Me, Jay, and 3 others) 4/5 of us landed internships this summer. Jay did not. 

The point im trying to get across is that the most qualified, brightest, most caring guy out of our group couldnt even score an interview. It makes me very very sad. The worst part is, he himself is showing signs of sadness. He is starting to think he wont be able to find a job and is second guessing his decision to come to the states to get an education. 

Jay has been away from his large family in Nepal for 6 years. He tought physics in his country before coming to the states. He has devoted his entire life to Engineering, he has made more sacrifices than anyone I know. He is 23 years old, graduating next year, and I'm not even sure if he'll get a job.

Current situation: Junior computer science major at Rice, aiming for a BSCS. So far, I have no student debt thanks to living off campus and being a minority in an engineering field.

However, I'm pretty sure this isn't what I want to do for the rest of my life. I got into it because I was good at writing nifty little Java  programs in high school, I was *excellent* at Calculus, and, of course, the technology industry is booming right now and my parents wanted me to get into something with earning potential. 

But the farther into the curriculum I go, the more I realize that I hate analyzing systems, especially the guts of things like logic circuits or large-scale applications. I can't get interested in the work, and more and more often the assignments are just confusing me. I've failed enough classes that I'd definitely need a fifth year just to satisfy my degree requirements, which would likely mean I'd get financial aid cut off. My GPA is sitting below 2.0, I've made no connections in the department (or to anyone on campus, for that matter), and because of this, I couldn't get an internship if I tried.

So my question, Reddit, is, I've already registered for my Fall semester of senior year, and instead of excitement, all I feel is dread. I don't know what field I'd like to get into yet, but I know it isn't this, and chances are, it won't make as much money as a programming job. I don't want to let down my parents, and I definitely don't want to force them to pay for two or three extra years at such an expensive place. Should I suck it up and slog through the rest of my CS degree, or should I take the hit and try to head in a different direction?

I'm just lost as to what my next step is. In my short time I've gone from Helpdesk I to Helpdesk II to Desktop Support II and I've gone through a raise each time. My prior experience also has internships at my college doing network support, deployment, etc. I feel like I'm ready for a Junior Admin role, but I'm lost as to how to go about it.

Also, should I go for the cheaper option at state school or go to the private school? All of my advisors had said to do them so I can get the 30 credits for the CPA.

Mentor(s): James P. Evans, main project researcher Jerry Fairley, Hydrogeologist Rebekah Wood, Graduate student Nate Onderdonk (CSULB), co-mentor
Hydrochemistry and hydrothermal alteration along active faults

The Aqua Caliente hot springs, and several other small springs, lie along the trace of the Elsinore fault. In conjunction with a graduate student working on the hydrothermal alteration and deformation in the rocks adjancent to the fault, the undergraduate intern will collect time series data on water conditions, as well as systematically sample and analize the water chemistry from the springs. The objectives of the project are to determine the baseline water chemistry of the springs, and to determine if there are any changes associated with small swarms of earthquakes that occur 3-5 km away. 

Research Location: Utah, southern California, Idaho

Institution: Utah State University

Number of Interns Needed: 1

Required Skills/Coursework: Sophomore or higher level of geology course work [Earth History, Physical Geology at a minimum] and some basic class in geochemistry or environmental geochemistry. Must be able to travel to southern California to collect samples and install instruments. Field work is not strenous, but the site will be &gt; 100°F. 

Desirable Skills/Coursework: Upper division coursework or experience in geosciences a plus. Any experience in research, and coursework in cognate classes [Math, Statistics] will be helpful. Must be concientious with respect to handling water samples, and field analytical tools, including data loggers. 

General Time Span: Core of project can be approximately 8 -10 weeks.

I know that Reddit is a dynamic community with a lot of different talents so from your perspective what should I know where should I begin as far as approaching some knowledge beforehand besides the stated parameters of the internship, everything from what to pack to what to look out for, be aware of? I'm really excited to go I'm just a little overwhelmed, I will be consulting my professor but I wanted a more dynamic sounding board, hopefully this works

In the building I work, the elevator doors are reflective. A month or so ago I got on the elevator and there was a cute intern in the back. As the doors close, I see a reflection of her looking me up and down.

""It's easier to ask for my name"" I said before I could stop myself. She turns bright red and stares at the floor the rest of the elevator ride. ""Too bad"" I say as I get off at my stop.

A week or so later I see her across the hall and she doesn't break eye contact with me, even though she's engaged in a conversation right next to her. I casually walk over, hand her my business card, smile, and keep going.

At this point, I feel like a BOSS, but acknowledge that from her perspective I'm either A-) Suave, or B-) Creepy as fuck. 

I see elevator girl yesterday and she smiles, waves, and yells ""hi {Verbicide}"". This is not the conclusion of the story....I will nail that intern. But for now, I think I'm clear of the ""creepy"" side.

The problem is that the most recent office job was about 3 years ago (the internship). The question though is that, I became a barista for a Coffee Bean &amp; Tea Leaf (just like Starbucks) for a year on campus just because it was on campus and I had free food at any campus restaurant. I really didn't need the money at that time, but just did it for the free $10 meal. My question is, should I list the barista job on my resume as the most recent job? I mean, I'm a marketing major and all my jobs have resembled that, except the first (youth ambassador for city council, salesperson, marketing assistant). Would it throw people off to see a ""barista"" as the first job.

I found an internship that became a full-time job at a small software company, but they had to let me go a few months ago. 

While I was with them, I interviewed for another position. I didn't write down my GPA on the resume. The position didn't work out, but this company called me again for a new position, and after a few interviews offered me the job. 

I never mentioned and they never brought up my GPA, but the thing is I can't remember if they asked me about it in the first interview way back when. If they did, I might have lied about it (stupid, I know).

So the person that hired me asked me to call HR. I did and she said when the orientation was, asked me to bring proof of eligibility and told me to take a Tuberculosis test as soon as possible (this is at a hospital). I kind of asked ""is there anything else, like a background check or drug test"" and she said ""Nope""., but I'm still worried about it.

So the question is:

1) Would the HR tell me if there was a background check, especially if they told me all the other stuff?
2) If they do a background check, would they check GPA, and would this be shown to anyone if there is no inconsistency with my resume (since it doesn't have my GPA on it)

gr9b6,19,2011-04-16,Busted - Epilogue,cuffd,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/gr9b6/busted_epilogue/,"Ents, I give you now the follow up to my post from some quarter-year ago, [Busted - Moving Forward](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/eot6w/busted_moving_forward/)

**Previously on ""Busted""**

Mid-December of 2010, Cuffd was cuffed in his own home, being triumphantly eyed by two officers of the law.  Their modest triumph amounted to just under 1/4 oz., two grinders, a pipe, and a MFLB.  The charge was possession, with another three counts of paraphernalia.  Up to $2,500 in fines and/or a year in jail.

I didn't know if I'd go with the public defender or go in alone.  /r/trees tells me to explore a NORML-affiliated attorney, I do.  My future seems to be slipping away.  My job and life are at risk.

**Desperation**

I settled on the counsel of a criminal defense attorney.  Somewhat high-profile, well connected, and well established.  I had to do the best I could.  His retainer was $2,000.  I figured I'd still end this cheap.

He knows about my prior incident, some two years back.  He's ready to fight in court, that the search was illegal.  But he talks to the state's attorney and he gets me a deal.

**Humility**

My court date is postponed, pending my enrollment in a government-chartered voluntary program.  I'm assigned a caseworker who comments on my maturity, I'm a little bashful.  I have work to deal with, as well as school and a new internship.  I made sure he knew I didn't intend to be slowed down.

The program entails two months of weekly drug testing, a class (originally four classes, but bumped down thanks to my caseworker,) and twenty-four hours of community service with a DOC work crew.  I take my enrollment certificate to the judge at my next court date.  One year from then, so long as I complete the program, I can get the charge expunged.  My future aspirations are secure.

**Hitherto**

The community service is in eight-hour shifts, picking up trash on the side of the road.  The drug testing is straightforward, pissing in a cup.  The class is the usual ""drugs are bad"" routine.

I mold my job, school and internship around it, as much as it pains me to do so.  I have to keep up with all my obligations, no exceptions.

**Now**

Oh, now is the good part.  Sunday is my last day of community service.  Monday is my last drug test.  Monday I get my program certificate and I'm officially done.  I've kept clean and on the straight and narrow.

Ents, you shouldn't be the least bit surprised that anyone can remain capable, efficient, and effective across long periods of smoking and sobriety.  To the untrained eye, nothing has transpired, and that's just the way I'd have it.  My future is secure.

**The World of Tomorrow**

Monday is the 18th, and the end of drug testing.  It's the end of the scrutiny which would be any higher than on the average, law-abiding citizen.

Wednesday is the 20th.  It's 4/20.  I guess it all worked out alright.

I'm no stoner, as much as I love trees and as quickly as I'll once again enjoy them.  I'm a writer.  I can finally relax just a little and believe that I can pursue a career in writing and film.

We all have our dreams, and I'm fortunate enough to be able to chase after mine just a little longer.

I'll smoke one for all of you.  For everyone who has never had to get caught, and can smoke in peace.  For everyone who's been in my place.  For everyone who's seen their life needlessly ruined by these draconian drug laws.  So far as I'm concerned, we're all in it together.

**TL;DR - ** Everything went better than expected."
gr7wq,0,2011-04-15,Help needed to pursuit my childhood dream of playing cricket for my country(India),[deleted],Assistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/gr7wq/help_needed_to_pursuit_my_childhood_dream_of/,"Hi everyone, I am not sure if this would be of any importance to people here as I see so many more deep concerns posted here. But I would still like to state the current assistance that I would be needing as it could pave way to my childhood dream of playing cricket (sport) for my country India. 
I am an international student(from India) currently studying computer engineering in a Canadian University. Since the age of 4(when I was introduced to the sport) I wanted to play for India, but my parents wanted me to get an engineering degree first from a reputed university and hence sent me to Waterloo to earn an engineering degree. As I am an international student, the tuition for me is very high (around 13k for 1 term) and therefore most of the money that i had earned in my internship went towards paying my tuition and the rent for next term. Since summer is the only season in Canada to play cricket, I was picked up to play in the southern ontario cricket league by a club, but they require me to pay then $150 as the season player fee. I am not being able to accumulate that much money out of my account for the next term as, if I do that, then I will not have sufficient funds to keep me alive (food) for the next term.
Earlier I decided to not play the league and just train but doing the drills on my own, but then I have not been able to be at peace with this decision and always feel a kind of restlessness that asks me to go for this opportunity as it will keep me alive with the sport and when I return after my graduation to India, I will have good experience from the league.
I am not sure if this is a cause to ask for monetary help, but I think I should at least try and ask for help.I am trying my best to keep alive in the sport and hence would like some assistance in this regard.
Thanks :)"

I will need a car next year, but I will be living on mostly loans all next year for graduate school. I want to know the smartest way to handle my financial situation.

I will make approximately $6k this summer from the internship, and I have about zero money currently. I want to buy a car, probably not new though. I expect to get a job fairly easily after my my schooling is complete next year, making around $50k/yr

Should I buy an interim car for the time being? Or move right into the car I would like ultimately?

Also, I should mention. I am about $14k into student loans as of this year, and will likely add $10-$12k next year. So is it alright that I will end up making car payments with student loans?

Any wisdom?"

I'd be lying right now if I said I didn't love her, and I know she loves me too.  The problem is, the longer we are together the more I feel like we aren't a great fit for each other.

A few reasons why:
- I'm super laid back and easy to please, she is fairly high maintenance and stresses out a lot, this puts me in a bad mood
- We haven't had sex, this is not my choice at all. She has had sex before and I (kinda) have, but she doesn't want to and isn't very clear to me on why.

Truth be told, part of the problem is that I am in college, I have an internship this summer where I'll be making really good money for a student (~$35/hour) and I turn 21 at the start of summer.  I really want to go out and have a lot of fun before I can't anymore.  And its really bad, but lack of sexual interaction (she doesn't like to get physical except maybe once a month) has made me start being physically attracted to other girls.

Like I said earlier though I really love this girl and the last thing in the world I want is to hurt her.  I keep hoping that maybe she will randomly break up with me because she depends on me so much that I would never be able to bring myself to leave her.  So this is where I want your help, what should I do?

TL;DR Not happy in my relationship, want it to end, but can't stand the thought of hurting her in any way. Help?"

1) Old company, new city/boss. Have interview. Goes well. Guy tells me he'll let me know in by the end of the week. I don't bother him, next Monday he emails and says they went with someone else. Someone I worked with last year (went between two offices) emails me on the side and says I wasn't picked by that guy since he interpreted me not emailing him on Friday as a lack of interest.

2, 3) Employers took resume, asked for what worked with me interview wise. No interviews. One concluded interviews, one hasn't gotten back to me.

4) Had an in-person interview two weeks ago after phone interview &amp; practical exercise. Was told I would hear back within 2 weeks. Nothing as of Friday (2 week mark). Most interested

5) Had an interview with on this Friday. Was told I'd hear back within two weeks. Good interview, awesome working environment. Highly interested as well.

6) Old boss, old city. Applied a while back, interviews closed. Was explicitly told last summer that they would take me back if they could this summer, and boss said a couple months ago that it was great that I put an app in and they needed an intern again. Heard nothing. If I get an offer, I have 72 hours.

What should I do? Should I just follow up with #6 (last year's job) and try to get it back?

I never drink, never have had a SIP of alcohol (besides in maybe cold medicine if some of it has any I don't know).  Anyway, my life is pretty good right now.  I have the perfect woman, I'm in my third year of college with a 4.0, have a sweet internship lined up for the summer, etc.  Anyway, so I figure, what the fuck, everybody acts like alcohol is the best shit in the world.  So my stupid ass decides to drink whatever they order for me.  A bottle of 9point beer or something, three shots of tequila, and then another glass of some other nasty shit.  It all tasted like ASS, but I did it anyway, cause I was a dumbass.

Anyway, next morning I can't even stand up.  Feel like I'm about to die.  By later on that Saturday I finally start eating.  My buddy finally takes me home.  I get back, throw my clothes off to get in the shower, and I'm horrified at what I see.  My entire body is red, like I have hives or something.  It itches like no other too.

Do you guys think I'm allergic to alcohol?  I know I should go ask a doctor, but I seriously cannot afford a doctor visit.  I have no insurance.  Last time I went was in senior year of high school, and they charged me $300 for only a meeting with the doc that was LESS THAN 5 whole minutes.

Right now, my whole body is red, except my face.  My legs especially.  I also feel extremely weak.  I'm normally very strong as I lift weights alot to stay in shape (last Thursday night I went and deadlifted 275 and right now I probably couldn't even deadlift my own body weight).

Sure, every boy does, but I thought about it all the goddamn time. Every second of every day, for years and years.

Then middle school happened. I was surrounded on all sides by absolutely hateful individuals for four of the most formative years of my life. I retreated into my shell and just shut down completely. Life wasn't about grand future plans anymore, but about surviving till the end of the day, then the next, then the next. One at a time. I never thought about the future anymore. I just couldn't spare the energy.

Then came high school. I got the hell out of the horrid waste pit that was my old school and transferred into the local public high school. Slowly, cautiously, I began to unfold again. Dreams that reached out past the next week once again began to take shape. Visions of exploring space. Now, though, they were tempered by reality--I was only just barely anyone's definition of fit, I had no intention of joining the military, and I had no reason to think this or anything else that disqualified me from astronautdom would ever change. So, I got extremely comfortable with the idea of being an astronomer--that's what I'm in college for right now, and I love it. Of course, every once in a while I still heard that little voice in the back of my head saying, you know, there's still a chance you could do this thing. But since the cancellation of Constellation, the announcement of the retirement of the Shuttle, and even Obama's plan to effectively gut NASA's manned missions all failed to make the voice see reason, I never really agreed with it.

So this morning I was working in the science library when I got an email from my dad asking if I wanted to go see the last Shuttle launch this summer. I thought, hell yes but it's in the middle of my astronomical research internship. So I'm in the middle of writing an email to my PI asking if I can take a couple days to go see it, when all of a sudden, shuffle serves up [this song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy-1xI1nbao) with absolutely no warning, and before I know what's happening my head is on the desk and I'm crying like a baby.

I am a junior electrical engineering student at U. of M. and I applied to over 100 summer internships this semester. But alas, I do not have a job for this summer.

A short list of what I did:
I attended both career fairs that Michigan Engineering hosts, applied to every applicable internship application on the Michigan career website, applied to both local and non-local internships, went to resume builder and interview workshops, attended every company event on campus related to engineering, applied for research with professors that I like, and gave my resume to friends and family.

After at all that, I was only contacted for an interview by a handful of companies. I made it to the final round of interviews with only one company, but at the end of the process was not given an offer. Now that internship season is closing to an end, I am pretty much at a loss for finding an engineering related job this summer. Previous summers I held local jobs in my hometown, but I was really disappointed in the work (it was not mentally stimulating to say the least). I am really dreading the upcoming summer because I don't think I will have the opportunity to apply what I've learned in electrical engineering for the 3rd summer in a row. =( 

I am really curious as to what I am doing incorrectly. I feel like a hard working EE student from U. of M. that's 1 year away from graduating would have an easier time of finding an internship. I am not complaining, just curious. Here's a link to my [resume](http://imgur.com/hBhhr) for verification. You might say, oh well derp your GPA sucks!! However, that is solely due to health issues I had during my freshman year. In a nut shell, I had vitamin absorption and transportation issues with my red blood cells. The deficiencies really took a toll on my body and I was barely able to function as a normal human. I obviously explained that to recruiters.

I've contacted faculty at two or three universities inquiring about positions for something along the lines of an unpaid internship. The emails describing a lack of positions for high school students were awfully polite, but it's all the same when summer comes 'round -- no dice.

Am I being unreasonable? Should I keep asking around at this point?

Any advice, collective consciousness of the internet? What's a (qualified, I might add) high school student interested in biotech with an empty summer that admissions officers are going to give the look of disapproval at to do?"

Specifically I am looking for a summer position with any amount of hours. A part time position under 20 hours a week for next year would be a bonus. If I have to drive from Akron the position will need to be paid. If I can walk from campus I will consider an unpaid internship if it is a quality entry on my resume.

I started my career in desktop support and have had one position as a IT Administrator for a small 100 employee company. I have experience with all sorts of desktop support, both hands on and phone support. I did this for approximately 5 years before choosing to go back to school to learn Cisco equipment and get my Bachelors degree.

I have excellent customer service skills. I am in my 2nd year of school at the University of Akron. My graduation date is approximately 2013. I am finishing up all the classes required to take the ICND 1 exam this year which is the first of two exams for the CCNA certification. I plan to take the ICND 1 exam this summer. I already posses the Comptia A+ certification.

I'm looking for work, preferably in the Northwest although I am okay pretty much anywhere, that would give me the opportunity to get acquainted with a new field.  Ideally this field would be in the energy sector, but I am willing to do anything if the work is interesting enough.  

For the last few years my college job has been in finance; this included keeping track of financial data using Excel, updating records and databases, and other miscellaneous duties.  I have a strong background in analysis and quantitative problem solving.  I know Python, IDL, JAVA (although it's been a while), Mathematica, and LabView.  I'm comfortable with data acquisition and reduction, building circuits and lab equipment, presenting results, and have made special studies of acoustics, optics, circuits, and energy.  

In a nutshell, I'm analytically trained, hard-working, and a fast learner.  I have a broad knowledge of a number of subjects, and I'm looking for a job which will allow me to further explore one of these subjects.  So if you know of a job (or internship), and you're willing to take a chance on a physics grad, please send me a private message.

gsxph,0,2011-04-18,Father was murdered,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/gsxph/father_was_murdered/,"Hey Reddit, I'm going to Shanghai this summer for a two month internship at Fudan University. I'm a competitive swimmer and I picked up boxing about two years ago. 

I've always been interested in Asian martial arts, and the recent murder of my father has sparked my interest in learning a new combat style (also revenge). I had a brief encounter with assassin upon seeing him standing over the corpse of my father, but his lightning quick movements easily slipped past my western boxing stance. My jabs were no match for his expert trapping and 4'5"" stature. Before I knew it, I was floored and out cold. I awoke in a haze, unclear as to what had just happened. All that remained from the assassin was a strip of cloth with a strange insignia. Not knowing what to do, I decided to visit my grandfather's humble cottage in the Nanjing province. He instantly recognized the insignia. It turns out my father was the former head of a prestigious martial arts school in Nanchang. His academy was renowned across all of China, until one day a band of Northerners came and challenged him to a duel for control of the academy. My father, being the prideful man he was, could not relinquish this opportunity to protect the honor of Southern style Gong Fu. 

It was a trap! The evening before, the bastards poisoned his tea, in order to weaken him for the coming match. The fight ended quickly and mercilessly, my father beaten to a bloody pulp, saved only by the quick intervention of my Grandfather. With the aid of his students, some of who were in the employ of the Chinese government, my father fled to America, and changed his name, hoping to put his violent history behind him. It seems his past had finally caught him.

I was told by my grandfather to seek out further training in Shanghai if I wanted to exact vengeance upon the killer and the clan behind this hired hit. Western style martial arts are formidable he told me, but I am a Chinaman at heart--I must venture out and embrace my warrior heritage.

So does anyone have any suggestions on what style would be most compatible with boxing and where to learn?

Rent is 500/mo, with utilities/internet/cable/garage parking **included** Let me cut to the chase and give you the specs:

* [Tower at Third](http://tower3rd.com/) is the building, on 302 E. John. It used to be a [HILTON](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/aceandvis/paris-hilton-001.jpg), so you know you'll be living in style. If you go to U of I, I know you don't need to be sold on the amenities of this building, because they are notoriously good.

I live in Athens currently, but got an internship this summer with the Ohio EPA in downtown Columbus. I am now in search of a place to live this summer. I am looking for basically whatever is cheapest. 

3 girls I'm good friends with offered to let me sleep in their basement on Maynard for $250 a month including utilities, but 1) I don't really want to live with them, and 2) they already have 3 people in their tiny little 2 bedroom duplex, and I don't want to add to the claustrophobia. So basically, this describes what I don't want.

So I'm good to pay anything under $400 a month probably, but am really trying to get as close to $300 a month including utilities as I can. I will only be there June 13th through about 2 weeks before OSU starts classes again.

I am fine living with people I don't know. I get along with everyone I meet and am fine with most people's lifestyles. So ya. 

Anyone got a place in mind for me?"

I stopped smoking on 4/6 after smoking 2 to 3 times a day for 2 years. I also somewhat relapsed on the 16th but only smoked a small amount, so I'm hoping it won't have much of an effect. Odds are the Test will be mid-May, so I'm hoping I'll be clean by then.

I bought Nexxus Aloe Rid shampoo and have been washing my hair twice a day.  Not sure if this will help at all.  The internet seems painfully lacking on solid information for this kind of thing. I've also heard of the Maccujo method, but I'd rather not put detergent in my hair unless absolutely necessary.

Thanks, any and all advice is appreciated.

Edit: Forgot to add some details about my hair length. At the moment it's about 2 inches long, but I plan to get it cut on the 3rd down to 1/2 - 1 inch.  I'm hoping this will clear out most of the toxic hair; mine generally grows pretty fast. However, I've also heard that cutting your hair too short can be equally dangerous because then they go for body hair (which grows more slowly and is therefore way more toxic)."

I had to leave my job because my school requires a 6 month internship. Mine was across the country and with 50+ work weeks I couldn't transfer to a location there. So I'm trying to get back in the business (any of the three positions I've held are fine with me) but GM seem to be hesitant. I understand  some concerns (because I'm graduating in June they fear they'll train me only to be gone a few months but I plant to stay here in the city and stay with whatever job I have for awhile) but the biggest thing is that I haven't had an industry job in over a year. They question why I would come back (a love of food, great atmosphere/experience, and service) and think it kind of suspicious. They all seem to like me and think I'm very personable but that seems to stop them.

How do I get it across that I actually want to work in this industry still and that even thought I have ""little experience"" I'm very enthusiastic and hard worker without having to repeat it the millions of times I have in interviews?"

I end up dreading summer every year because it represents an emotional rollercoaster for me. There may finally be a light at the end of the tunnel, though, something to do this summer. My mom knows someone who knows a New York state assemblyman. I had emailed this assemblyman prior asking for an internship, to no avail. From this connection, though, I managed to get a mailing address, a person to direct the letter to, etc. I sent off a letter about two weeks ago. No response as of yet.

gtvao,2,2011-04-19,Need some advice,DepressedDontKnowWhy,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/gtvao/need_some_advice/,"I'm a 24 years old french guy that just got his first job in Paris (I will begin in may) and so will move here soon. This job is relatively well paid and is in the field I studied to work in (computing). So I think I'm supposed to be happy, right ? Problem is I'm not, and in fact I'm completely depressed since a few days, and unable to get over it. I lost a good part of my appetite, I want to cry many times a day or feel like I would like to broke everything near me and then for a few hours it gets better and then it gets worse again (I'm not even able to successfully fap...). I lost interest in everything and without my parents pressuring me to take this job I think maybe I would abandon it.

I'm confused about what exactly makes me sad as there is a lot of thoughts in my head. I think that's mostly fear of future and feelings about missed things I would not be able to do anymore and my generally uninteresting life.

I got treatment for depression a few years back, while I was in the process of choosing which studies I wanted to do. At the moment, the problem was pressure about the urging need to choose what to do with my life. I was anxious as I didn't really know and needed to choose quickly because school year was about to begin. I got something called Venlafaxine as treatment, which I kept for ~3 years, as hopefully It was supposed to also help overcome my shyness, until a few months ago when I decided to stop and decreased the dose from 2*75mg pills per day to currently only one 37.5mg pill every three days. Maybe this treatment was keeping me from depressing and I should not have stopped taking it, but I was never convinced of it's usefullness and anyway I don't think spending my entire life drugged is a solution.

I've always been shy and never really got a *real* friend, nor a girlfriend. Thereis a few people with whom I share interests which I shared some activities with in recent years, but I'm generally not the guy who is considered interesting. I'm not invited at parties or anything, and if I don't make efforts to talk to others, nobody will come talk to me. I I'm not here, it goes unnoticed.

I spent the last three years in some middle-sized french town (Caen) where I was going mostly fine, even if was alone almost every moment spent outside school, I still managed to make some friends or maybe they are just half-friends. Anyway, it improved slowly. I then did an internship for my last school year where I met some people with whom I was able to socialize and even began doing some sport whith them (something I avoided nearly my entire life).

I then graduated and spent a few months searching for work, going back to live with my parents (where I'm still currently until I move to Paris) as with studies ended I get no more aid to pay rent. As my parents really live in the middle of nowhere, I spent the last few months really alone, feeling generally bored, with no contacts with any people of my age outside a few Internet conversations. I thought being independent, finding a job and moving to a new place will improve that.

And now I know I'm going to Paris in two weeks with a job and... I've never felt that bad. I'm going to a place where I don't know anybody, I will not have free time anymore, I feel trapped as I'm almost obliged to take that job now.

I'm not sure anymore I want to work in IT. Well, I was never sure what to do with my life, but stopped thinking about it during my studies. The field now seems boring to me, and I'm thinking I should do something else, maybe artistic or whatever (if only I knew...). But it's too late.

I never really enjoyed my youth, I was just beginning to make friends at the end, and now it seems behind me, while I'm stuck with a boring job that will take all my time.

The few friends I had began to make during the last years, whith great difficulty, are lost and I will now be in this huge frightening town, with not even school to help me meet people of my age.

I know I'm probably exagerating, that things won't go that bad, but I feel lost and anxious and I'm unable to get over it. I feel like an asshole bragging about my life when some others have much more problems than me.

Anyway I feel trapped in my life, I don't control it and it seems it going in some direction which isn't what i wanted and I don't know hat to do.

I've probably forgot many things about my feelings and anyway I'm not sure how I feel myself, but this post is already too long.

(please forgive this long and somewhat unstructured post, my feelings on the subject are not very clear nor organised. please also forgive eventual english errors, I'm not a native english speaker)

gtpyj,1,2011-04-19,How easy is it to lie on a resume?,blockhead123,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/gtpyj/how_easy_is_it_to_lie_on_a_resume/,"Imagine you already have a degree in something, but you fake something related to it; maybe a Masters instead of a Bachelors, or an extra degree that is similar to your real one. Maybe some research experience or internships at the school you really went to. Maybe you fake another degree unrelated to the job just to make it look like you earned 2 degrees.

The goal is to secure an internship or an entry level job for a couple of years. After that, you quit, and apply to a new company with a legitimate resume, along with the 2 years (or more) of experience you received.

Has anyone ever done something similar? Have you ever thought about it? Have you ever applied somewhere with a completely bogus resume just for shits and giggles?"

My name is Jay
I'm relatively new to editing
I work as a career intern for the Department of Veterans affairs as A/V production specialist / editor.

Now to my question...  The internship I've recently acquired requires that I be a student and must be working towards a degree or professional certification.  I am lucky enough that my office will pay for it, but that puts some restriction into it, as you all know the government is in a budget crisis so anything eye popping with get denied.  Through some paperwork fudge up I am now going through this internship for the second time and need to find a new certification to pursue.  Last time I went through this I became Final Cut Pro Master Certified because we work with a Final Cut system.  I am looking for advice on other certifications I should look into... Also I'm just saying what's up!"
gtkt9,14,2011-04-19,Internship dilemma...,tranzue,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/gtkt9/internship_dilemma/,"First time poster here.  

Anyway, I was hoping the more experienced could help out.  I recently got offered an internship at a pretty small company, about 35 employees.  I accepted when they called, as I need an internship this summer.  I was also offered to have a second interview with a place much bigger, with probably better pay.

Here is where the dilemma comes in at.  If I get offered the job with the bigger company, should I accept and just call the smaller company to tell them I can't do it?

EDIT: Thank you all for the responses, it seems that most people say keep the smaller one since I've accepted, and the rest saying take the bigger company.  My interview for the position at the bigger company is coming up, I will still go to it, as I feel like canceling the interview may burn a bridge in itself.  But, if they do offer me the internship, I believe I am going to just stick with the smaller company.

Again, thanks for all the replies! It is a tough situation, and I've seen more than one person be in the same exact position.

I don't know if an 'ad' is allowed, but I have seen people not get in trouble before, so it must be okay! or something....

I am going to DC for an internship, and I need somebody to take over for June and July, and then take the lease when the new one starts(August-August).  You can move in as soon as May 15th if you want, I won't charge for any part of May.

You get a private room, bathroom is shared with one person, There are two roommates total, plus an awesome cat.

Its in Stadium Village at 26th and University(UFlats).  Its a pretty nice condo building.  The room is pretty small, but everything else is awesome.  There is even a cupcake/korean sandwich place in the building!
One roommate is a Redditor/TCSer, the other keeps meaning to be but forgets(we don't know whats wrong with him).  The cat isn't very good with computers, so we haven't pushed him on the issue."

gtgx8,15,2011-04-19,Can we have a calm discussion about the psychological and physical effects of cannabis without resorting to exaggeration/hyperbole?,kwood09,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/gtgx8/can_we_have_a_calm_discussion_about_the/,"After the post warning about daily cannabis use yesterday, and now the parody post about television viewing today, I'm compelled to say this:

Cannabis is a wonderful drug. It can be used safely and responsibly. I don't do it very often these days because I'm very busy, but there was a time when I was a multiple-times-daily smoker, and I definitely think it's a do-able thing. But there are a couple of things to remember:

* As has already been pointed out multiple times, smoking anything will have deleterious effects on your respiratory and cardiovascular systems. Vaping, however, virtually eliminates this risk.

* Let's face it though: the physical side effects of cannabis use are not usually that serious. The real danger is the manner in which you consume it and the effect that has on your mental/social/emotional health.

Let's talk about that second part. In this sense, cannabis is like food. There is nothing physically or inherently dangerous about it. But, used in the wrong way and for the wrong reasons, it can be dangerous. It is certainly not physically addictive. But people can still develop a dependence on it.

I can say that I have been able to jump right in and out of multiple-times-daily smoking on at least three occasions in my life. For me personally, it has never been a problem. When it's been appropriate and desirable in my life, I've smoked like you wouldn't imagine. And when I lost my desire, or when other obligations got in the way, I was able simply to stop. No problems whatsoever.

But this is not the case for everyone. I know people who simply don't do shit because they smoke weed all day. Two guys I know at college got a combined GPA of 0.2 last semester at a $38,000/year college because they just get high and skip class. Now, these guys are also lazy by nature. I'm not *blaming* cannabis for their failure to go to class. I'm simply saying that it's a contributing factor. One of the guys was applying for an internship this summer that was going to be really lucrative. He had all his shit filled out and needed only to take the drug test. Two weeks into his weed break, though, he just said, ""Fuck it,"" and decided to get high. Called up the place the next day and said he found something else. Now he's going back to work at his job at a snow cone stand over the summer.

I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that, but I am saying that he would have had a nice internship if he didn't have the desire to smoke weed so bad. The point is, he couldn't control it. Again, I'm not *blaming* weed or anything like that. I'm simply saying that it's really naive of you guys to treat cannabis as if it's some sort of magical rainbow miracle drug of happiness. You know how when you get really high, you get fucked up? That should tell you that it's pretty serious business. 

I imagine that most of you guys who act like cannabis could not possibly have any ill effects are in one of two categories. (1) you might just be naive. OR (2) you might be like me: very lucky that smoking cannabis has never led to any problems for you.

A lot of us are lucky that we can smoke all the time, float in and out of the lifestyle, and manage all of our affairs without a problem. That's great, and I encourage people to do that if they can do it. But you can't forget that there *are* people taking cannabis inappropriately by using it to escape their emotions, using it as a sort of mental crutch to rationalize not doing anything with their life, or using it in some other way that is detrimental to their mental, emotional, or psychological health.

Listen guys, I fucking love to smoke weed. I encourage ya'll to smoke weed too, if that's what you're down with. But please, you could be sending really wrong signals to people who might not understand that cannabis, while mostly harmless, still is a drug. "

guuom,1,2011-04-20,"Dear Reddit, we need your wise advice about post-college job hunting:",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/guuom/dear_reddit_we_need_your_wise_advice_about/,"Here's the dilemma.

My boyfriend is 4 months out of Engineering School (graduated Dec. 2010 with his Masters). He has been job hunting since mid-August/September of last year and has landed a handful of interviews. His primary interest is in working with a major defense contractor or government contracted position. He has had a formal interview with one major defense company, which we initially assumed would land him a job and were very surprised when he was not selected. Also (this will be somewhat relevant for my later questions), he is around $7k in debt with school loans presently.

Here's a little of his background before I continue:

He went to a public state University (city university, technically) that used to be one of the more well recognized engineering schools in the country but now ranks significantly lower on the list. He majored in Electrical and Computer Engineering and has specific interest in RF work. He maintained a 3.3 GPA in Graduate School, worked as the project manager of his Capstone design project (which is planned for distribution and was a major project originally started at Vanderbilt). He worked at a city Internet and Cable provider as customer support and interning/shadowing under the Senior Engineer of the office for nearly two years during his college career. He has been a strong support for many peers and individuals at his school program, providing tutoring and mentoring. Many of the positions he has interviewed for have been what he was explicitly trained for and specifically concentrated in college for, however he has not been selected for any of these positions in spite several promising interviews. 

With all of this being said, I have a few questions and would appreciate feedback from the general community on this issue.

First of all, how important would you say that having an education at a recognized school is when trying to be placed with a top defense contractor or specialized government job like he is trying to do? If it is incredibly important, I would like to know what your opinion is on this idea. Many have suggested to him that he should return to complete another degree at a University that has a more recognized name for the sake of having it on his resume. The suggestions have been anywhere from him going and trying to finish another degree and reapplying, to trying to land an internship (which requires you be in school to achieve) while he is pursuing another degree, or to work part time at school and try to continue to apply for positions while doing so. Any suggestions or thoughts on this? I know he is explicitly expressed his concern about becoming more in debt, but I am beginning to wonder if he needs to take the gamble in order to make a more formidable impression on employers that he really wants to work for. My thought is too, that a lot of these employers will pay him to go to school, so if he could land a job while still attending part time, they could pay the remainder of his tuition possibly. I understand this is still a risk, which is why I would like opinions.

What do you think is a suitable alternative? Another thought many have suggested is to get a smaller, more available position and then apply to one of these bigger companies at a later time. The thing that he has expressed as a concern with this however is that he does not want to get caught in a situation where he is stuck in a certain field he did not want to get into, and then find he can't get a job where he really wants to have one later on.

It has been made perfectly clear to everyone who has expressed concern about this that he really wants to work for a bigger defense company as I mentioned above. We are really trying to figure out how to make this possible. It's quickly coming up on 6 months without any sort of luck and no college to fall back on, and I am starting to worry for him and his future. I want him to be happy and successful and I would love any advice you have on this.

Thanks in advance."

I hope to go from here to a grad program and eventually earn a Ph.D., concentrating on philosophical aesthetics. I've looked at interships with art museums or national archives/the smithsonian, but those all seem geared towards art history or curation or history or political science majors. Do I even need an internship? Is that something grad schools in philosophy look at?

gus9b,2,2011-04-20,I want to start a project as a substitute for a summer internship (undergrad CS student),dr_kludge,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/gus9b/i_want_to_start_a_project_as_a_substitute_for_a/,"I'm just wrapping up my first year as a community college CS student who will eventually transfer to a 4-year state university.  I've learned a lot!  I got a late start on school (I'm 22 now) and I had never written any code beyond TI-83 BASIC or HTML until about 10 months ago. 

At this moment I am comfortable starting projects in C, C++, C#, x86 assembly, arduino, and possibly objective-C.  I have not found an internship and due to summer school probably will not continue trying.  Instead I am thinking that I should come up with some sort of 3-month project which can fill the internship void in my resume and experience.  

The idea I came up with so far was to build a rudimentary game engine.  Something that could do sidescrolling platform type games, with some 2.5-D (parallax with background objects for example) elements.  I'd stick with image based sprites to keep most of the work code-related.  I feel like this would be enough work to take 3 months, would be advanced enough to look good later on, but isn't so far above my skill levels as to be unrealistic.  The end result would be both the engine, and a game that uses it. 

From both a programming perspective, and a future employer's perspective how does this all sound?  

I have an engineer friend who I discussed this with as well - he suggested coming up with a game for either iOS or android that utilizes openGL ES.  I'm not against this, but it seems more daunting to me than the idea outlined above.

I'm open to ideas about how to make my project idea better, or maybe a completely different kind of project.  Or maybe I've got this all wrong and should be doing something completely different?"

I'm a Junior in Computer Science at a fairly high ranked university, and to be perfectly honest, I've had absolutely no luck finding an internship in my past three years here.  This semester alone I've had 10 interviews, and many of them came down to ""it's either you or this other guy, and he's already got a security clearance,"" or ""we want to hire you, but without the defense budget being passed we can't afford an intern.""  Needless to say, I'm kind of depressed - employers always stress that experience is HUGE for them, and I am probably gonna be, at this point, a guy who went through 4 years of Computer Science and never secured an internship.

Now, I do have a saving grace in that all my professors are in the field I'm interested in, Media Computation and HCI, and do multimillion dollar research in it.  I can do research with them instead this summer if an internship doesn't come through, but I'm worried how potential employers would see this on a resume, and if they'd consider me doing research in virtual reality with one of my professors being inferior to an internship.

This came back to another thing though - I really am interested in game development, and I know it's a field that it's difficult to get internships in because of the nature of their development cycle (they bring you in, teach you stuff for 3 months about the project, then you gotta go before you can do anything.)  This is also kind of reflected in that all the companies that come to our school are, for the most part, government contractors (outside of Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Intel and a few others).  

This led me to wonder then, what exactly do companies look for in fresh graduate computer scientists who want to be game developers?  Would they want me to have an actual internship with a company like Booze Allen or something, or prefer to see that I pursued research in something related to HCI?  On one hand, I would have actual professional experience, on the other my research had more applicable results than ""I made email services.""  I'm honestly at a loss as to who to ask about this, because the types of employers who come to our school are so focused on a particular type of software development.

I'd also like to add that by the time I'm applying for full time positions, I will have taken our senior level game design course and computer graphics course, just can't get access to them till senior year due to the complexity.  

Thanks if anyone can help me or took the time required to read this.  "
gumbl,4,2011-04-20,Fucking your friend's sister.,fingapapits,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/gumbl/fucking_your_friends_sister/,"So I've had a lovely bromance going for the past couple years. We met at an internship, and quickly became really good friends. He is 26, I am 23, she is 23.

After a horrible breakup I found myself flirting with his sister, who is my age, and ended up fucking her. I never told my friend, as he has always been very protective of her. The stupid decision had been made however, and in my regret, I hid the truth. I talked about the situation with his sister, and we forged a mutual understanding to not get serious(i think.)

And then my roommate fucked her. A bunch. And then rejected her when she asked for a relationship- which stirred the pot up, and all the truth came out.

He finally confronted me about the situation in a parking lot, saying ""you've betrayed me in a way I would have thought unimaginable. I have nothing left to say to you."" He then flicked his cigarette, and drove off.

Not knowing what to do, and being nonconfrontational, I wrote him a letter admitting guilt and apologizing. 

We haven't talked since. I'm thinking I should just call him, and that the letter may have been seen as a weak response- but it's always been the best way for me to say something.

tl;dr: fucked my friends sister, didn't tell him. he found out. not talking to me.



*Update:* I drove to his house, thinking that I should confront him face to face about this issue. After about 45 minutes of talking he said he still couldn't trust me. His reason was that he thought of me like a brother, and my actions show that I couldn't be trusted with his most important thing - his family. So I drove home. "

I'm taking 18 credit hours, 15 of them third-level ME credits, work 22 hours a week (when I don't cover any shifts), and some days I don't eat because I either forget or just don't have time, being out at classes/labs/work all day.  

My current schedule is waking up at 5 am, studying/doing homework for that day (for example, I have 1 exam today and one Friday), going to classes, then work, then home for some studying/internetting, then to bed by midnight (hopefully) and repeat. The only time I've had for relaxing recently has been the weekend, but even this week I have to meet with a lab group Saturday morning to finish our reports and final proposal. Adding to all this, I'm trying to start a relationship with someone, but she's worried that I don't really have the time for another commitment, and I can't find any indication she's wrong.   

I've also been looking for internships or research positions, but I only have experience in customer service and most of the companies want soon-to-be-seniors for summer positions so they can hire them full-time after graduating. Essentially, I don't look great on paper, which doesn't change too much when I don't get any job experience in my field.  

I hear lots of people stressing/complaining about this or that paper, this one class they have to take thats so hard, etc., and it really bugs me. I know I chose my degree, and don't regret it at all, but I'm juggling 3 final projects, 2 tests this week, 1 next week, then 4 finals, and none of those classes are bullshit College Algebra or Astronomy, they're Materials Research and Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics and soul-sucking classes.  

So in case you wondered, being an engineering student *really sucks*, especially when compared to some other majors (sorry pre-meds, your classes suck too but it doesn't get too bad until after undergrad...then, you're really fucked). If you think I'm completely wrong about that, go ahead and post your experience with your major, maybe I'm just stressed and tired so my viewpoint is skewed. Any other engineering students/graduated engineers (especially professional engineers: is it hard keeping up with the requirements to be licensed?), please post your experiences as well.   

This sort of turned into more of a rant than anything, but it's nice to take a break from deriving Bernoulli's equation from the Navier-Stokes theorem. Also, in lieu of sounding like a complete cynic/asshole, I generally have a positive outlook on life, know I have it really well in terms of money/food/living conditions, and I try not to bring this stuff up in other people's lives. I like playing/writing music, drawing/painting, and writing, and find all of them to be great for relieving stress. That's sort of my reason for posting here, just getting everything off my chest.

I graduate in 4 weeks (debt free) and this was the only program I applied to, thinking it was a long shot anyway. I already had plans to travel for a year and then apply to US universities for an MA in Latin American Studies.

The MPhil will cost around $36,000 for the year. Cambridge is Cambridge and its a really amazing opportunity, but some online forums have shaken my excitement. Apparently, the MPhil is seen as more of a money maker for Cambridge than anything else, and many have said that it's good only for those planning on pursuing a PhD. MA in LA studies in the US are usually 2 year, course based programs, with more instruction and additional programing: including internships, study abroad opportunities, etc.

What it comes down to is mostly the money. Should I wait a year and try my chances at a good US institution, like Georgetown, (my dream program) and where I most likely will receive some sort of scholarship or funding? Or should I go with the MPhil (for more cost and less classroom instruction). What if I pass on Cambridge and don't get into my top choices in the US?

I graduate in 4 weeks (debt free) and this was the only program I applied to, thinking it was a long shot anyway. I already had plans to travel for a year and then apply to US universities for an MA in Latin American Studies. 

The MPhil will cost around $36,000 for the year. Cambridge is Cambridge and its a really amazing opportunity, but some online forums have shaken my excitement. Apparently, the MPhil is seen as more of a money maker for Cambridge than anything else, and many have said that it's good only for those planning on pursuing a PhD.  MA in LA studies in the US are usually 2 year, course based programs, with more instruction and additional programing: including internships, study abroad opportunities, etc.

What it comes down to is mostly the money. Should I wait a year and try my chances at a good US institution, like Georgetown, (my dream program) and where I most likely will receive some sort of scholarship or funding? Or should I go with the MPhil (for more cost and less classroom instruction). What if I pass on Cambridge and don't get into my top choices in the US?

Some people say having Cambridge on your resume is an automatic leg up, while others say its just a vanity degree. 

What should i do?"

In the past 3 weeks I've run into 5 or 6 of them. Being a young man, they seem to gravitate towards me. I try to assume the best of people and when they say ""I need money for the bus"" they mean it. However, each time I see them abusing handouts and simply unethical in their persuasiveness and speech. 

On Monday I was walking to my car downtown and for two blocks a man was following me screaming after me. I got to my car, turned around and realized he was trying to get my attention, and told him I had no cash. He insisted he didn't want cash, but instead a dart pass. I said ""Ok, I can help with that"" spent 10 minutes walking with him to the dart station nearby. During this time I thought ""If I get stabbed walking with this man, or he is about to jump me, I will have been injured doing a noble and stupid thing""

We walk up to the dart box and he says ""I really need a month one"" - I look at the screen and it was I *think* $65. I'm a broke college student working an internship and barely making ends meet. I proceeded with just buying a day pass for him for $4 and tell him I only work 20 hours a week and depend on my parents for my survival. He proceeds with looking at the ticket and saying he needed a month one.

I spent a few minutes talking with him hearing about him, where he's from, etc, then say goodbye. He then asks if I could bring him money on Wednesday. I asked him if he's looked up homeless shelters, food kitchens, etc. You know - places that us Dallas citizens pay for and that churches and non-profits pay for. His response was that they taste gross. I tell him that he needs to go to them and they're healthier than any fast food he'll eat.


So, Reddit, please restore my faith in people down on their luck.

I've been looking for a job since October. Within the last 6 months I've sent out at least 70 resumes, got 30 call backs, and had 15 interviews within the last 3 weeks. I never hear back from companies, and if I do its either ""No thank you,"" or ""You're a good candidate...."" and nothing more. 

What's harder is that ALL of my friends have jobs lined up after college. I'm the last one in our group to get a job, and a lot of my friends are questioning why I can't get one. Yesterday a friend of mine went as far as to jokingly end a sentence with ""...that's probably why you can't get a job"". It hurt really bad, and I called him out on it, but I was still pretty upset. 

Right now I'm thinking about moving to Canada or somewhere very far away and never coming back. At least then I can start over, maybe get a new degree. I don't know anymore. 

So my question to you reddit is, is this type of freaking out normal? I feel like I haven't accomplished anything, which isn't true. I'm graduating with honors, I've had an internship with a big company, I have a lot of development experience, and I'm very involved with school. And I understand that it just hasn't been my luck lately, but I still feel like I'm stuck right now. Do you guys have any advice? "

I see the biggest luxury in life is being able to live and travel where ever makes you happiest.

**TL;DR: Summer Job on lock &amp; I already registered for Fall Classes. But given the opportunity, I would drop classes and head overseas. I would enjoy regaining focus and perspective before returning to school to finish my degree after 6months-1yr.**

Settings by Appeal:

*Netherlands

*Finland

*New Zealand

*Singapore

*Thailand

*Germany

*Hopes:*
 I've thought plenty about finding a homestead in New Zealand, or Monastery(monkforamonth) in Thailand, or maybe even a farm in Norway, Findland, Netherlands or any of the Pacific/Indian islands. My biggest concern is finding a community that speaks English. Currently looking deeper into HelpX. I admit I didn't know where to begin when I found WWOOF. I am extremely open to experience and enjoy everything from scuba diving to philosophical debate.

Dreams:
Finding somewhere with uncensored internet so I can keep in touch with my family and friends. I would enjoy living in a university town. I see living with people my own age as great advantage. Not only does it make communication that much easier, but also provides the same adventurous mindset. I would go out of my way to teach my roommates English while learning the native language myself. Low income housing/cheap food would be a necessity until I found full time work. 

**Experiences:**

-visited: Canada, Mexico, Singapore, Maldives, England, Italy, France twice, Spain twice 

-No Loans

*Work Experiences:*

Food
-Currently I enjoy working off my food budget. I wash dishes/upkeep a private dining hall(sorority)
 
Hard work
*-Operator: Front-end Loader, Backhoe, Bobcat, Forklift, Hydro-hammer, Water Truck
*-Construction: Buffers, Grinders, Drills, Jackhammer

**Education:**

*Began at University as a Computer Science major, then later switched to Information Systems. I did this after realizing my dream job was only a code monkey.

*Last summer landed an internship creating web applications for a local business.
 
*XML/ C++/ C#/ Silverlight/ Blend

*Returning to the internship this summer (May-Aug) for more experience.  

Interests:

*Homestead
*-working off my room/board

*Other expats
*-find a full time work

*Nightlife
*-Enjoy DJing for dance parties. 

*Weather
*-allows bike/longboard to work

*Cheap Public Transportation
*-travel from town to town to better acquaint myself with the culture

*Volunteer
*-Emergency/Earthquake Stricken Areas

*Develop spirituality
*-perhaps experience Buddhist lifestyle for a few months

I plan to attend graduate school in the future and realize that this is the last summer that graduate admissions will see in my application. I'm really stressed and scared that if nothing pans out for the summer, I'll look like a flop since my grades are not as good as they used to be.

Pretty good pay, pretty good benefits. There are a few requirements.

* Number 1: You must have completed a four-year technical degree from a **real** university, i.e., a Bachelor of Science or Bachelor of Engineering. Chaos Mathematics, Quantum Physics, Computer Science, Software Engineering, Nuclear Engineering, they don't really care, as long as you have a **technical** degree, no Business, Management, Finance, etc., sorry. This is not my requirement, this is an HR requirement so don't hate on me.
* Number 2: You must have an interest in security systems engineering. This is not an anti-virus management role or a firewall management role or a network security role. You will need to be able to analyze security requirements, **develop plans** for meeting those requirements, and build documentation and use cases for implementing and testing those security requirements.
* Number 3: Ideally, you should have at least a couple of years of experience. I think they would be willing to entertain entry level, but you still have to meet 1 and 2. They'd be willing to invest time in mentoring and training, but you will have to be pretty outstanding in all other regards, and have at least a few internships under your belt.
* Number 4: You have to be legally authorized to work in the United States. We can't do any sponsorship for this role, sorry.

If you're interested, message me and I'll give you more details and point you to the formal application process."
gu2yc,26,2011-04-19,"Doctors/Nurses/Paramedics/Other medical providers, let's hear your favorite stories of remarkable patient outcomes.",iwatchyousleep,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/gu2yc/doctorsnursesparamedicsother_medical_providers/,"As an MD(anesthesia and pain management) I realize all of us in healthcare have NSFL stories, but I realize we all have cases where the patient made a miraculous recovery from serious illnesses or injuries. Now, by miraculous, I don't mean ""Jesus took the wheel"", I mean, the patient and treatment team really pulled together, or maybe their recovery can't be readily explained. I'd just prefer to hear about how you have used your intellect, skills, and talents to really make a difference in someones life.

For me, the patient didn't survive, but I still view it as a case where I used my training and compassion to help another human. I had a patient(this was years ago) come into my clinic, he had abdominal pain that had not been diagnosed. Well, as I would soon find out, he had advanced pancreatic cancer. This man had no family, and not much money, so I arranged for his care to be covered largely by the institution I work with, and what they didn't cover, I paid for(i.e. home care). It wasn't that he didn't go into debt that lets me sleep at night, its that I was there for him, from his diagnosis until his death(his condition was too advanced for treatment to increase the quality of his life). 

In the end, he passed in his sleep, still, before he died, I remember him looking me in the eyes, tearing up, and simply saying ""Thank you for listening to me..."" I teared up as well, and gave him a hug. It was one of the most emotional moments of my career, knowing I helped him go with as little pain as possible. Really, I think what he was most thankful for was the fact that I was there for him when nobody else was.

I'm no Kevorkian, he died due to liver failure. 


Another story, this one involving more than me or palliative care nurses, was a gun shot wound to the back, really near the spine. The guy spent a few weeks in the neurocritical care unit, and wasn't expected to live, but not only did he pull through, he was even able to walk. Turns out he was an innocent bystander in a gang shooting. The entire team, from the nurses/doctors in the ICU, to the neurosurgical team, to the anesthesia team, and the rest of the support staff really were the reason he walked away. I was still a resident when this case presented. 

I just want reddit to know, that while you may view doctors as over paid, stupid, lazy, whatever, nearly every physician I know isn't in this job for the BMW or the Mercedes, we're in it to help you, the hardest part is when we can't, and when we're fresh into our internship and realize ""wow, we can't save the world"". Sorry for anyone who hasn't received the care they needed/desired, sorry it can cost so much, if it was up to me, you wouldn't have to go into debt just to improve the quality of your life, but I'm just one doctor.

I'm majoring in Civil Engineering at a well known school in the midwest. Academics haven't gone too well for me and my GPA is around a 2.6. My chances of getting any legitimate internships for this summer are pretty slim.

I was given the opportunity to travel to Seoul, South Korea this summer for an internship. I am supposed to be working at an architecture firm, but my job would be to teach the employees basic English. The problem that I'm having is that tickets to Seoul are $1400 plus I would have to pay a $600 matching fee (I got the offer through AIESEC). To get this money, I would need to get a bank loan and I'm already pretty poor. The internship includes housing and food. Also, I know nothing about the Korean language or culture. 

My other option would be to stay home during the summer and work as a counselor for an Engineering program. The pay is OK, but it's nothing special. However, I would not have to spend any money upfront.

So what should I do...should I dig myself into a deeper student loan hole or should I play it safe and work at home.

I later get an email from the CEO apologizing and they took all their ads down.

People may think I am stupid for being so eager to take an unpaid internship but when you are fresh out of school with no experience and there is a company that seems legit promising to help you learn and give you experience it was hard to pass it up.

gvt36,2,2011-04-23,Does canceling Comcast for the summer = new customer in fall?,WSUkiwi,Frugal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/gvt36/does_canceling_comcast_for_the_summer_new/,"I moved into my apartment in July of last year and - being the Redditor that I am - one of my first moves was to set up the interwebz. After talking to people in my area they said Comcast &gt; Qwest. So I joined Comcast at $25 per month. Six months in the rates rocket. I called and complained telling them I had never been told that the $25 was a promotional price. They agreed to knock the price down to $35 (had jumped to $59). Four month later same shit happens, however this time I call and talk to multiple people and they all say they can't knock it down and that their basic price for internet is $59.


I'm not going to be living in my apartment this summer (have a internship in another city and going to live with my girlfriend) so I was already planning on putting my account on hold. My question is, if I cancel my account all together and then in 2.5-3 months come back and call them back to set up a new account will I be able to get that $25 new customer price?


**TL;DR** - Comcast sucks and is charging me a ton. I'm canceling my account for the summer and was wondering if when I come back if I'll be considered a ""new customer."""

gvndk,1,2011-04-23,Am I completely deluded or insane?,Sacoud,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/gvndk/am_i_completely_deluded_or_insane/,"Apologies for the amount of text but I can't explain this without going into detail.

I feel like I'm losing my mind, I have many things going for me, money, a good family, a girlfriend, a summer internship. However I am incredibly lonely and wherever I go I feel completely unwanted. I used to have loads of friends when I was 16 but as we grew older many drifted away however I always thought I was being treated badly people would often call me an idiot (incuding teachers) and not in a joking way ( I am now though doing very well for myself), now I was obese as a young child and was bullied horrifically I'm talking getting punched , spat on , random people coming up to me and making fun of me. I lost the weight now but it still hurts.

So anyway I moved from my town and went to university about 20 miles away, most of my ""friends"" didn't go and stayed in my town. During my first year of university I made quite a few friends I played in a football team and was enjoying myself, I would go back to my town as much as possible to see everyone although I was working so it was hard to get back so I would invite my friends into where I lived to catch up.

During my 2nd year almost every friend I had made dropped out. At this point I was in uni 4 days a week, work experience on the 5th day and a part time job on weekends so getting back was very difficult and so I didn't see many people over this year. I tried to organise events as I wasn't getting invited anywhere but people just weren't interested.

Now.. I hear that my old best friend is moving to Australia and he says that we and everyone should go for a few drinks before he goes. Of course I'm more than happy to do this. So the day comes I tell everyone ""he's going we have to see him off"" I drag everyone out I get him a going away present... 9pm comes and he still isn't here, I ring his house and his Mum answers ""oh he's gone out with X"" 15 years of friendship.. he's moving away and he doesn't see his ""best mate"" before he goes.(we were best friends for about 10 years but sort of drifted apart recently) I was absolutely devastated. I sent him a message telling him how humiliated and sad I felt but I just cut him loose. 

 Another old friend I tried to organise a get together hadn't seen him in 8 months I get people out.. I get a text ""not coming hanging with my work friends"" , this wasn't the first time he had done this and I couldn't take being friends with him as it was making me miserable. I cut him off aswell.

I was getting incrediby lonely at this point and my other friends woudn't come to see me when I tried to organise events. I did however manage to start a 5 a side football team with them, I thought that maybe if we get that team spirit there would be team bonding and we'd all do things together but I couldn't be more wrong.

I organised an event, soccer saturday drinking game one week it was the day before and they all told me they cancelled to go paint balling with another friend so I thought I'd do it another week. So it's Saturday I'm excited, I get the girlfriend to go out for the day, I tidy the apartment, I go out and buy enough beer for everyone... no one shows up... I ask what's going on and well no one really has a reason as to why they've didn't come. At this point I said and I quote ""for fucks sake I turned down football tickets yesterday from my Dad because you guys said you were coming"". I didn't get a single apology and that night they all went out without me. To make it even worse one of them actually replied ""for fucks sake"" as a dig at me when the football centre made a mistake and our game was rearranged for a different time

With the 5 a side football there was no conversation with me and them, for 3 weeks in a row I would walk in and say hi and no one would say a thing.. not even a goodbye when I went. The only thing I would get out of them is ""how much is it then"". After the 3rd time I think I spent the whole of the next day crying and I told them over the internet that I was leaving the team to concentrate on my uni work.. but the truth was I was leaving because I was so depressed I couldn't take it any more.

I spent so much time alone.. a friend in uni asked if I wanted to play 5 a side football with them for a game.. so I did.. it was on the same night as my other ""friends"" they saw me.. first time I'd seen them in 3 months and one of them just gave a dig ""I thought you were too busy"".

I do wonder if I'm the problem or if it's them. But I really do think I'm fun to be around, I know I make people laugh.

A few weeks ago I went to a pub to see another old friendship group ( Like I said I had a huge amount of friends when I was 16) and it was one of the best nights of my life, when I got back home 3 people had their Facebook status with something like "" If you want to have fun when you get drunk *insert my name* is the man to go to"".

Another friend came back from the navy for the weekend, I organised a night out with the above friendship group.. most of them didn't turn up after saying they would... it sucked hard.. my navy friend did organise another night the next night but it was the people in my 5 a side team and other people who were less than nice to me in high school. I was going to come until I found out who was going I then text him saying ""nothing against you but after last nights no show I'm sorry but I can't be arsed"". I'm pretty sure he's pissed off at me. 

I don't think I'd ever do it but suicide comes into my head pretty much every other day.. I am so alone and I talk to almost no one apart from my girlfriend. I don't know if I'm deluded or not as I feel the bullying from my childhood may have affected my judgement.

My marks aren't that wonderful (I've had 3 failed courses so far, the first one was in my first semester due to totally underestimating the work load, and the other 2 were during the one semester where I suffered two family deaths during the semester which messed with me bigtime, as well as some passes/credits) so I'm starting to feel a bit dejected because I figure that 95% of people wanting my position will have better marks than me

I understand making demos would help boost my chances, but I'm not sure if (in the real world) a good demo outweighs marks (or, at least, balances them out), which is why I've been a bit hesitant. Along with this, I've been reading that internships would also help me greatly, but I'm feeling that, with my marks being not that great, it's pointless because I wouldn't get hired. I understand once I get in there (internship or a full time position) I will work like crazy because it is what I want to do; but I'm just worried that come 1-2 years when I'm done, I won't get anywhere because of a few slip-ups during uni.

I'm sorry if this sounds like a ""woe is me/fml/someone from reddit do something amazing"" post, I don't mean anything like it, I just figure that you guys/girls would have the best idea of what I am to expect in the next few years and would be able to give me some tips."

1.  When should be the ideal time for me to find an internship?  I've applied to a few with no success... I have a 3.9 GPA and my resume is pretty decent but so far I've only had one interview and didn't get the offer.  So it looks like this summer i won't have an internship... should i shoot for one during Fall or next Spring while taking courses?

2.  I want to work at the Big 4 (for the first couple of years at least to see how it goes).  Would they want someone eligible for the CPA exam or someone that's already a CPA for an entry level position?  I'll be about 10 credits shy of the 150 mark and i was wondering what would be the best option for me?  Just taking random courses next summer or getting a masters degree?  Thanks!"

Even though I corrected them (and had proof), they dismissed their accusation to only bring it up again when they gave each intern an ""evaluation"" at the end of the internship.

IMO I was a really good intern, did all the work, followed all the rules, so how do I prove this to my future employer if I have to give a reference from my previous internship?

gwcui,0,2011-04-24,"I’m a college student who enjoys lots of luxuries, am I being irresponsible with my money?",robotic_overlord,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/gwcui/im_a_college_student_who_enjoys_lots_of_luxuries/,"I’m a college student who’s entire income comes from internships and I feel like I’m being irresponsible with my money by spending it things like on coffee, computers, and skydiving.  I’d like to know if I should cut back.  Let’s back up for a second and explain the history of my financials.

I was raised to be very stingy.  My mother is Jewish and my father is the cheapest person I’ve ever met.  Thus for much of my life I have been extremely frugal.  Spending money makes me feel very guilty. 

For the first year of college my parents paid for everything - tuition, food, videogames etc, however my parents aren’t very wealthy so I had to take student loans.  After first year I made decent money from internships. In 2009 I made $11k, so I still needed parental assistance. In 2010 I pulled in approximately $50k before tax, and my parents stopped supporting me.

With this new income source I started to spend lavishly.  I paid off a $2000 student loan that was accruing interest.  I bought a 15” Macbook Pro, netbook, and Kindle.  I began using a smart-phone with expensive data plan.  I buy apps for my iPad and Nexus S like there is no tomorrow.  I bought a suit and tons of new clothes.I went skydiving twice.  I stopped buying food and ate out every meal.  I began to drink coffee, and often splurged for expensive lattes and mochas.  I went out to bars way more than ever before.

The point is, I’m spending way more money than I used to. I only managed break even this year (although I made a $5000 contribution to an IRA).  Before I made the $50k I thought I’d end up saving way more.  Granted, I did pay $12,000 in tuition fees and $11,500 in rent which really cut into my income.

The thing is, I’m starting to feel entitled to these luxuries.  I know logically this is arrogant and wrong, but I feel like my time is too valuable to spend preparing food, and I expect to always have the latest gadgets because of my line of work.  I’m about to start another internship this summer as always there will be a lot of pressure to spend heavily.

So, what I’m asking is - is this OK?  Should I cut back or should I enjoy the money while I’m still young?

It’s worth noting that presumably I’ll make even more money when I graduate (and no longer pay $12,000 a year on tuition).  But that’s not carved in stone.  I can’t rely on the hope of future income.  Or can I? What’s reasonable?

TL,DR: College student who spends virtually all his money on luxuries, should I change my ways? I guess this comes down to me struggling with the responsibility of financial independence, and I’d like some insight from wise redditors.

EDIT: I have no debt except for $8k in interest free student loans."

(Resume inside),DesperateJobSeeker17,Austin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/gw6dg/dear_reddit_austin_im_a_17_year_old_teenager_who/,"Reddit, I love you. I know you make wonderful things happen and I know that anything is possible with your help. 

Let me explain.

I am about as nerdy as you get without being “nerdy”. I spend my time using Linux, attempting to learn code, migrating to the cloud with my CR-48, editing band videos with Adobe Premiere, and Googling whatever I can't figure out on my own. I'm an Eagle Scout and an executive officer in my high school band. I don't play video games, I don't even own a major console. I lied. I do have a Wii – to which I spent more time installing homebrew on then actually using. I can install a motherboard blindfolded. I have a Power Mac G5 dissembled next to me. I have drawers and shelves full of random pieces of hardware. I am good at putting on a face and interacting with people. I understand hard work. And I need a job.

Ideally I need a job that has something to do with technology. But, alas, who wants to hire a dumb 17 year old? It's easy to look at me on paper and throw me away. I'm sorry that I don't have enough time to get A+ certified. AP classes take up most of my time and whatever money I have left is spent on phone bills, insurance, and gas.

I have applied to Best Buy, a local computer repair shop, and tech support positions. I have called them all back. And all of them have denied me. What did I do to deserve such treatment?

So, Reddit, I come to you in a last ditch attempt before I end up working for McDonalds. Does anyone know a way for me to get a job with technology or have good connections? I could even work as an intern. School is still going on and I wont be able to work full time until the summer, but that's not too far away. I live in Round Rock and would be willing to drive about 20 minutes for a decent paying position.

gw2sj,38,2011-04-23,The Little Girl,lunaris,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/gw2sj/the_little_girl/,"One of my coworkers is full of supernatural stories and I thought I might share one that creeped me out. Let's call her Olivia.

Olivia was doing an internship one summer and living in an old apartment she had never been in before. The apartment was set up such that the living room was connected to the bedroom; while lying down in the bed, you could see into the doorway of the next room. Nothing really seemed out of the ordinary, except for when Olivia would constantly and uncharacteristically wake up in the middle of the night. 

One night when she awoke, she could make out the shape of a little girl standing in the threshold between the living room and the bedroom. Olivia told herself over and over again that it was just her imagination. Her glasses weren't on. She had vacuumed earlier. Where had she left it? It was the vaccuum's shadow, not a little girl. It just looked like a humanoid shape. Right? She pulled the covers over her head and turned over so as to not face that direction any more.

Except that it kept happening. Olivia continued to wake up in the middle of the night for seemingly no reason to find little girl standing there, staring directly at her. When Olivia turned the light on, she disappeared. To avoid her, Olivia would go into the living room and watch television until she fell asleep. It was all she could do to keep from being terrified in her own home.

Over the summer, her cousins came to visit her in the apartment. There was a night when she had to be out of town, but the cousins stayed. As she expected, they took her bed. 

When she returned, one of the cousins took her aside. ""Olivia, I need to tell you something. When we were sleeping, I kept waking up. At one point, I could have sworn there was a little girl standing in the doorway."" Olivia was quite taken aback. She hadn't said anything about the little girl to her cousins so they wouldn't be frightened. ""Maybe it was the vaccuum cleaner.""

""We vaccuumed earlier in the day. I left it on the other side of the room. There's no way.""

To extrapolate further: Olivia also told me once she had finished the story that, when she first moved into the apartment, the owner mentioned that a little girl had died there years ago. Another tenant overheard and dismissed the notion immediately. Interesting stuff."

I had a hard time adjusting in freshman year, moved 2 times in the middle of the semester, bed bug infestation in one of the places, bad roommates, psychosis (exaggerating) induced from bad acid trip, not making any friends, which are all just excuses I’ve made for myself, but the bad grades I got were in my lower division requirement courses (C-, C, C+, B- range).

Now, almost 4 semesters in, I have realized that the only thing I REALLY want to do is go into academia, but I feel like I’ve already lost my chance due to my earlier mess-ups.

I know that applications are cumulative - GRE, letters of recommendation, work experience, etc. also count - but my anxiety problems have deterred me from even speaking to people sitting around me, let alone a professor or graduate school instructor (it’s stupid, I know). I’m afraid with continued failure I’m going to lose it, especially as I start getting into upper division courses where more is expected of me (althought I’m really excited to learn more!). I am a sophomore at a large, top 10 public university, and I really need to start getting into research (this is about the time most people start), but my credentials fall short and I don’t have any confidence whatsoever. Basically, adjusting to college life will probably result in brain hemorraging 20 years from now, or heart disease, not sure which yet.

TLDR; not sure how most of you deal with being human

So, I’m not willing to withdraw for a semester because I like being here - believe it or not it's more of a sane inducing environment than my parents' house - and I was wondering if any of you guys are in a similar situation/have any experience on how to improve self image and sell yourself to get internships."

In t-minus one month I will graduate from college with an engineering degree. In September I will begin a top-ranked 2-year graduate program (summers included). The program is in a very niche field, so there is a 100% placement rate, and there aren’t really any relevant internships. 

My summer employment outlook is a retail job that I’ve done in the past and would probably kill me inside.
I’ve worked ever since I was 16, including during college when many of the other students in the program did not work since they “didn’t have enough time.” Now I’m having a bit of an “end-of-life-crisis.”

 I’m realizing that this summer will be the last opportunity I ever have to live free of many of life’s responsibilities, and I’m also realizing that I will be graduating college without having gained any of the memories that you typically hear people recount about the “greatest time of their lives” The way I see it, nobody ever laid on their deathbed and wished that they had worked a little more in their youth.

 Unfortunately, I am getting a whole lot of opposition from folks, mainly because they see my desire not to work as a slap in the face since they are helping pay for school, but I feel like they have been adults for a little too long and no longer appreciate the idea of just living for once.
Has anyone done this and felt that it was the best decision I have ever made/was a huge waste of time and money?


Other things:

In addition, I do not have any siblings so college has not been as much of a financial burden was it would have been if the parent/child ratio were 2:3.

I do not plan on sitting around playing video games; I have a bucket list of sorts that I’d like to complete.

I will have several friends in the area that I would be able to do stuff with, but scheduling stuff is exponentially more difficult when you have a sporadic work schedule 5-6 days a week.

This is a throwaway account.
I am 28, she is 25.
She has two children. A boy who is 3 and a girl who just turned 7.
  We have officially been together for 10 months but have ""talked"" and had an inappropriate relationship for about 4 years (she was married, husband was verbally, emotionally, and mentally abusive).  

The quandary:

So, we became close while she was still with her husband.  At first we were just friendly and became close enough that I became aware of the situation.  Husband had hit her before and constantly put her down. She was the bread winner while he sat at home and got high and ""watched the kids"".  Nothing was ever done when she got home so she worked 12 hour nursing shifts only to come home and have to do everything around the house.  Obviously she may have been best served to have left sooner, but I can't begin to understand how difficult that decision is.  Eventually we became much closer and an odd sort of ""relationship"" developed.  We convinced ourselves it wasn't a big deal because her relationship with her husband was dead and he was basically a shitty roommate.  Thinking error, I know.  So over that four years there were plenty of good times and bad times.  She was living a hellish life and I was the one she was most comfortable with so I got a lot of flack that wasn't really meant for me.  

August 1, 2010.  She left him. Great on so many levels.  Mostly just for her to begin her adult life again without that burden.  She absolutely adores her kids and bends over backwards to give them what she can afford.  So that's a positive for sure.  

Over the last 5 or so years I have been in regular bi-weekly treatment for extreme depression, some substance abuse (no longer happening), and other issues.  I've also participated in a weekly therapy group for about 4 of those years.  I am in a place now I never thought I would reach.  I am happy, proud, have a 3.94 GPA in college and have an amazing internship this summer.  I am living evidence that no matter how hopeless you feel and it all seems... you can get out of it and become happier and more successful.  I am driven.  I hit the ground running.  I am all about solutions, solutions, solutions.  Now, I was not like this even 2 years ago, but I finally go on the ball and now see how worth it it is to really push yourself to be productive and continue moving forward.  It's GREAT!!  There is a reason I say all this.

She is having a very hard time.  Since she left her husband she has still been extremely depressed.  She's even talked about cutting herself before.  She works the 7pm - 7am hospital shift and then comes home to sleep.  She never gets 8 hours.  6 hours is generally the best she will get.  The husband was part of the equation at first when it came to the kids. He would keep them nights when she worked but she still had to pick them up every day from school, losing sleep in the process.  Now she is working on the divorce and the attorney recommended that we cut off contact until after the divorce.  She said the judge needs to see, if even for 4 months, that she can handle the kids all on her own.  I hate not seeing/talking to her but am more than willing if it means that the kids will not have to be apart of the father's life.  I won't go into how terrible of a father he is, but he is.  She is having an even harder time with this.  She is still calling/texting me and I begin getting upset because I don't want there to be issues when it comes to the judge.  She has been very, very needy of me in general since she left her husband and I get annoyed easily.  I forget that it took me 5 years to get where I am and not am annoyed that she is not just instantly here with me.  Should I be concerned about how much she leans on me and needs me?  Calling me sometimes 8 or 9 times a day, even after I set a boundary of needing to focus on homework?  Being manipulative at times to just find ways to talk to or see me?  Not evil manipulative.. but asking if I can bring her a soda at her house or something at like 10pm when I'm studying for a test.  Or... should I realize that she left a horrible relationship not a year ago, after a crappy childhood, and is probably just in a bad place still?  She is going to therapy biweekly as well.  I just feel like I put up a boundary ""We cannot talk because your lawyer said so"" and she won't respect it. I tell her this and she says she understands and will stop but then calls me a couple days later.  Should I be patient? Annoyed? Concerned? What? I love her to death. I want to be with her and realize somethings take a long time to heal and work on... I just need to know which things I should be concerned about in the present, if any.  So sorry this was so long. Thanks for any help. Any questions are welcome if you need clarification or more info.

TL;DR: Woman was in abusive relationship, we saw each other before she left.  She has been very clingy, needy, depressed since Aug. 1, 2010, when she left. Now can't talk, based on lawyer recommendation, until divorce is final in August. I can handle it, in much better place mentally due to 5 years heavy therapy and she just started therapy. She is having very hard time with it.  What do I do? Be concerned? Patient? Worry?"

I had to use a throwaway account for this--for obvious reasons to protect both me and the other parties involved. This ended roughly 2 years ago.

I met him through a friend who had an internship with this team in college. My friend invited me to go with him to a club, that a lot of the players were going to that night. There was a player- who I'll call Player Z.  came up to me. I am a huge sports fan, and though he is not a super famous  athlete, I knew who he was. I hate dancing so I was not into  We made small talk, and we were laughing and giggling a lot before I knew it. It turns out he was a pretty chill guy, and I figured we'd just talk and then go our separate ways. But  mch to my shock, he  asked for my number. The next morning I got a text from him, asking to go out the following night.  One thing lead to another, and at 3am--I ended up in bed with him. I figured I'd never hear from him again, the sex was pretty lackluster for me anyways, and though he was nice, I figured pro-athletes are a one time deal, and that I wouldn't hear from him agian. 

I did. And we ended up seeing each other 3 to 4 times a week. He even paid for me to fly out for an away game he had. At some point early on, I googled him and found out that he had a wife, who was many, many miles away. I asked him about it, and he said they were separted (they  weren't) and in the process of getting a divorce (they weren't). Anyways---I figured that was acceptable, and since some athletes are VERY private....i couldn't verify for myself.

Our relationship ended at the end of his season, when he was preparing to go back home. I knew it was going to be a short term thing. I know that he never divorced his wife, because they are still married.

TL;DR: I had a 6 month relationship with a pro-athlete, in a Major US city, who turned out to be married.

I don't know if it's possible to verify this--I would be willing too, but I do not want his indenity found out and people on the internet are pretty crafty. The only hint I'll give is that he is still an active player, he's not from the US, and his season is over. and he plays in one of the big four sports (NHL, NBA, MLB and NFL)"

I've been doing a metric ton of research on the area, but I still have a few questions:

1. I've been doing job searching up in Morningside starting for the fall (August, specifically). Mostly I've been applying for jobs at Columbia itself. I'm going to be finishing my degree online in IT and HR minor in a year; what larger companies in that Morningside/Manhattan Heights/UWS area should be looking at? I highly doubt there'd be any paid internships left for the fall around there.

2. Top street food in Morningside? That said, best cheaper restaurant in Morningside?

3. Sadly, I need a new pub. Again, did some digging and nothing really caught my eye in that area. Here's my current pub for reference: http://www.yelp.com/biz/zenos-state-college

4. I've read about the ""babby's first cycling"" classes the one volunteer group has down in Brooklyn every month or so. Are they worth it? In the same vein, I already know biking about town as it is - Is it worth it to take one of those group ride/riding in traffic 101 classes for myself?

5. Best blogs for the Morningside area other than Bwog?"

AMA",sherlocktheholmes,IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/gxvhs/by_request_iama_grad_student_studying_library/,"This AMA was prompted by [these](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/gwz0l/do_the_chinese_get_random_english_quotes_as/c1r0z0l?context=3) posts. People don't seems to realize that to be a librarian (in the US) one must get their Master's from an accredited Master of Library Science Program, so I thought it would be nice to do this AMA to tell people what I'm studying, what I will be doing in my career, and generally talk about what libraries are and what librarians do.

So, to give a bit of an overview: I am in my second semester in my program, which generally runs for two years. I am trying to graduate a semester early (in Dec 2011) by taking what is scientifically known as a 'crap ton' of summer classes.

My first semester I was enrolled in Reference, Collection Development and Management, and Computer-Based Information Tools. Reference was an intro to being a Reference Librarian (shocker). Basically, we learned about various credible resources for finding out information and how best to conduct an interview with a person needing information. (That is, how to find out what a person needs to know in spite of how badly they phrase their request.)

Collection Development and Management was really interesting. As the name implies, we learned what a librarian must do to acquire and maintain a good collection. This involves: 1) Knowing the community and their wants and needs, 2) Assessing how the current collection meets those wants and needs, 3) Determining which materials should be purchased to improve the collection's quality, and 4) Removing them materials which are not an asset. This task is on-going; no collection is ever 'complete'. It is a constant job that requires a vast knowledge of popular and technical literature. For example, when Pluto was recategorized as not a planet, I would have to know that that happened, find all the science books which call it a planet, remove them because they now contain outdated information, and replace the weeded books with new ones which are accurate.

Computer-Based Information Tools was a giant headache to me. We went over simple enough topics like databases, search engines, Excel, etc, but we also did UNIX and HTML which were a challenge.

This semester I'm enrolled in Public Library Management, Cataloging, and International Information Issues. Public Library Management is pretty self-explanatory, we discuss what all must be done by a Library Manager in order to keep the library relevant and well funded. We talk about budgets and funding, issues with patrons (ie what to do when a homeless man bothers other people), privacy issues (fuck the Patriot Act), pornography, etc etc...

Catalogers are the ones who decide how a new material is sorted and labeled so that it can easily be found by anyone who wants to access it. It's a nightmare. My stress level goes through the roof when I do assignments for that class (as I ought to be doing now, final project due Thursday). There has to be a standard, of course, but how do you standardize and sort an author's imagination? or a book about the history of feminism as told by modern-day psychiatrists? It's a tedious process, let me tell you.

International Information Issues is a freakin blast. There are just 13 of us and the prof, so we just sit and chat for 2:45 each week about a variety of topics: international copyright laws, the popularity of smart phones in Sub-Saharan Africa, Wikileaks, the roll of the internet in Egypt's revolution, poverty and illiteracy... I could go on and on. It's always fascinating.

This summer, I'll be doing my internship at my hometown public library, as well as taking two workshops: learning to conserve books and to write grants.

So that's a basic overview of what I've learned and how it will be used in my career. AMA!

TL;DR: Librarians have a huge variety of skills to master in order to be good at their job.

I have actually lived in your fair city once before, but I find myself needing temporary housing for the summer (I have an internship, yawn).

But unfortunately for me, my girlfriend of 2 years who had gone in on apartment with me has just broken up with me :(. This means, my housing situation has totally collapsed as I cannot possibly afford the full rent by myself! Booo!

So, yeah, I don't have any particular thought on that. Anyone here got any ideas besides ""find other housing"" (which I am trying to do, but given the short timespan and the sudden absence of a rent-splitter could be a problem). I know in my city there are places that locals know which are more or less cool with people crashing on floors and such. Granted, a full summer of that might be a problem, but anything could help. Hell, maybe I could patch together a whole network of floors to sleep on for a few days or weeks at a time, thus allowing me to still come and do my internship and impose on a bunch of people, but only slightly each time!

Anyways, just thought I would throw it out there, and see what the community is like here. If you have suggestions to manage this predicament or would be willing to offer your floor or something else for some period of time between may 15 and aug 15, hit me up!

Edit: I may or may not bring a car depending on whether or not I have somewhere to park it. I do need to at least be near a metro bus so that I can get to a metro station (I mean, let's be honest, my level of pickiness is super-low. Internship is near Dupont circle."

Once i a while i get a real challenge, like bad computer crash, nasty virus etc... But thats like once every X months. Takes me a couple of hours max to fix, then i am bored again for the coming months.


I really dont know what to do. Should i leave this job? Should i leave IT? Should i stay and be bored for ever?

I've recently found that I enjoy the hell out of Env Eng problems. I'm a problem solver, environmental issues are near and dear to me.
I've done an internship for two summers at a Public Works facility, and found that I do *NOT* enjoy any sort of road construction/structures jobs. The programming/GIS from the experience was well worth it.
This last semester I've been working in an environmental lab helping a masters student out with their research, under a really good professor of Env Eng. I will be working on a research project this summer with him as well.

On top of my load (21.5 credits this semester, one class is a graduate level Contaminant Hydrology course) I am a TA for an introductory programming class composed of C++ and Matlab along with the lab work.

For various reasons, it has taken me six years to finally graduate. My engineering specific GPA is around 3.7-3.8.

I'm *Very* interested in getting a PhD in the field, but I'm not sure what I specifically want to study.

I have made very good connections with two/three professors at my university.

Regarding my future well-being, I have a lot of debt (50k).

Now that the backgrounds out of the way:

I am *waiting* for funding right now to determine if I can get my M.S. working on a local contaminant spill that has affected people. I'm not 100% sure that the funding will come through. I would be more than happy to spend my next two years doing my graduate research here as the project has pretty much been laid out and I feel good about doing it as the people here are awesome.

If the funding doesn't come through, I will be stuck in a strange place not knowing where I'm going. With the economy as it is, I am looking for sage advice as to what I should be doing *RIGHT NOW* in case my funding doesn't come through. I really want to attend grad school and get the best leg up on research that I can while laying out a solid path for getting a PhD if I so choose to at the end of my masters. I've thought about this heavily but I am looking for people who may have been in a similar situation. Would it be bad to take a year off and somehow better prepare myself if this falls through?

**TL:DR** I think I have a leg up on funding for a M.S. I want to be prepared in case it falls through. What should I be doing now?

I only really have one friend and we are drifting apart for unrelated reasons.  I just don't know who else to turn to.

Any kind of job. Flipping burgers, I don't care. I'm a student, but I don't really require that flexible of a schedule. I have 5 day weekends, every weekend. I'm not the smartest person in the world, but I'm not stupid either. I can use a computer like a boss, I'm articulate, well groomed and work well with others. I'm outgoing and make new friends with ease.

I've tried applying online at many different businesses, none of them have yielded a response except for a Toyota dealership which is too far away to get to (I don't have a car and it would be over an hour on BART). I have tried walking into businesses, but most of them tell me they aren't hiring or I'll fill out an application and get nowhere. I had an interview at a Starbucks in a nearby city, but when I called back, the manager had no idea who I was and I definitely didn't get the job.

I have some skills and have a small portfolio of graphic design stuff that I've done, but I don't feel ready to apply for an internship or a design related job yet. I'm only half way through school. I'm pretty good in Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, etc. and I have a couple of freelance web design jobs lined up, but the pay isn't consistent and isn't enough to be able to sustain myself. I'm still mostly relying on money from my parents, but it isn't enough. I'm 23 and have $5,000 in credit card debt, plus I've been late with my phone bill for the past three months. I need a source of income that doesn't make me feel guilty.

Am I going about this the wrong way? I've only had two other jobs in my past. I did some drafting work for my civil engineer father, and I worked at his friend's gun store on and off for about 5 years. I've never found my own job before except for the freelance design stuff I've been doing which has only made me $350 this semester.

Can you guys give me some pointers? I have no idea what to do."

...every time some little thing doesn't go perfectly, I sink down into this crazy depression where I feel like I'm completely useless, can't do anything right, and am a horrible human being. It's like all of my self-worth is tied into achieving perfection and every time I make a mistake, I feel like the scum of the earth. Then, as is usually the case, I spiral down and the accessability of failure makes it even more and more difficult to come out of. Eventually I lose motivation for even trying, simply because I have convinced myself that I will fail no matter what. 

The same thing happens interpersonally. I go out of my way to do nice things for people, to help people when they need it or even appear to want it, and then when I receive a single piece of criticism, all of the good things that I have done or people have said to/about me disappears and all I can do is focus on the negative. 

At other times, I feel like I can accomplish anything and sign up for too many things at a time and end up overloading myself to the point that I crash once again. 

I understand what the problem is, yet I am helpless in actually doing anything about it. It's almost like I watch myself in a movie during my day-to-day life and instead of making my own decisions or actually *doing* things, I just notice myself having done things and watch the experience unfold before me. 

I guess I'm just wondering if anyone else experiences this, and if so, how do you cope? If I focus too much on the positive, I overextend myself and end up failing. When I fail, I lose motivation and give up trying. Vicious cycle."

The problem is I'm really not sure how much I'll be traveling while I'm working. I'd like to visit a number of German cities (Hamburg, Berlin, Dresden, Frankfurt, Köln, maybe München...) as well as Amsterdam, all during the weekends/holidays.  

Should I expect to need the train any more than on these occasions? I really have no idea how often German students use the train - perhaps University of Lüneburg students go to Hamburg every week as it's only a half hour away. In this case I'd probably need an unlimited pass.  

I plan to do some additional traveling after I'm finished with my work assignment. Here is my plan as of now, assuming I don't need an unlimited pass:  
Eurail: Benelux-Germany, 10 days within 2 months ($409) --&gt; For first two months   
Eurail: Select Pass 5 Countries, 10 days within 2 months ($549) --&gt; For last month and change  
          Germany, Austria, Italy, Switzerland, France  

What do you think? Is this a good plan? or should I anticipate needing an unlimited pass? Perhaps I should consider a German Rail Pass (25 or 50?). Also, should I purchase my pass before I leave or once I arrive? (I'm not sure if interning at the University of Lüneburg could get me a better rate).  

Any general advice is also welcome or even anything about Lüneburg. Is ~$1300 roundtrip a decent price for a flight?"

gydm6,1,2011-04-27,I was a pedophile. AMA.,wishiwaslying,IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/gydm6/i_was_a_pedophile_ama/,"The reason for this AMA is that I hope some of the information about how it developed, about what happened, and about my life might help someone in a similar position, or someone with children at risk. I feel like it's at least SOMETHING I could do to make up for my deeds - but I'm well aware it doesn't make anything ""ok"".

Long story short, I was a pedophile (standard medical definition) for about 4-5 years. It started when I was 12, and working as an intern in a school for young children (mandatory for kids here). I started feeling attracted to a young boy (maybe 5 or 6) and told my self it was love. I then proceeded to take advantage of my physical advantage and position of authority. 

Things got gradually worse, especially since I found my way into the world of child pornography. There is some very sick things out there, but it's so easy to obtain, and gradually my borders slipped.

At first, I told myself I would never act on it. That it was just a fantasy.

Then, I told myself that the ""child-love"" people were right, and that it could be good and consensual.

Then, I did what I had promised myself never to do, and forced myself upon a little girl (touching ""only"". again, doesn't make anything ok but at least I didn't go further).

This eventually led to a drug-fuelled crash which ended when I changed my life, including leaving behind this sickness. Once I started going out of it, the thoughts gradually disappeared - so I've been forced to conclude that sexuality cannot be hard-wired.

I refuse to answer any graphic questions, but I'll answer anything I feel might help someone.

I don't know, I guess maybe I just need to finally tell someone now that it's over.
At least for me.

PS: 
while I might seem cold, I assure you I am well aware of the consequences of my actions. However, having dealt with it for 2 years, I can express myself without sounding too guilt-ridden. still does not accurately reflect my emotions however.

So... AMA.

EDIT:

I've been reading some other posts here, and a few ideas seem to be prevalent. 

1) *I was born a paedophile, I can't help it*
**False**. People can become whatever they want by indulding in fantasy. Eventually, it sticks. 

2) *I will never do anything/rape anyone*
**False**. I suppose most of ""them"" think so, but statistics say otherwise. Besides it only requires one moment of weakness, and is much easier said than done. I didn't think so, either, but by now... I've done what is definitively rape at least once (probably twice, but I'm not sure where to draw the line. Same girl) and touched several children without their consent... You slip. So the term ""slippery slope"" (That I heard **years ago** while posting on the internet to justify myself!) is true.

Tell me about the difference between college in the United States and your home country. **

I'm from the United States and my Indian professor and I have exchanged words about the cultural differences we're experiencing in terms of how little I can come in to his office hours. I explained I work full-time, go to school full-time, and have homework and other things to attend to on weekends (when the professors are not on campus). He assumed I lived at home and sort of dropped the idea of giving up my job for school, which isn't really an option. He's a nice guy, but I honestly don't think he understands how typical I am: I'm 20, moved away for college to support myself, live with no family around, make minimum wage, holding down a job and school both more or less full-time.

 An Indian co-worker of mine explained to me that, in her experience, once young people in India get into their undergrad or program of choice, they are taken care of for the most part by their family and live at home; school is their full-time 'job', with some residencies or something here and there depending on the degree. I don't know how common this is, but it made a lot more sense to me why that this could be why my professor didn't understand that I can't just quit my job. 

So I was just curious what the college culture is like in other countries? Not just from a foreign exchange student's prospective (where you're there for about 6 months and a transplant in the culture), but from someone who grew up knowing what to expect of college in their country. In terms of how much you have to prepare for entrance exams, if you have to intern, how much they focus on networking skills, partying, work (earning a wage while you're a student) expectations, etc. *edit*: Also, how you pay for school would be interesting, too. I know loans are big here.

So I just got my Logic level 1 end user certification (at 17 years old... woo!), and am looking to start investing in some better equipment than the 2 channel USB mixer and 2 mics that I have. I'd like to be able to record my band's album this summer, so a drum mic set isn't out of the question. Basically, here's my main questions:

* Interface. There's so many options - I'm looking for something around 6 or 8 inputs, with a high enough quality that I won't have to replace it in a few years. I've been eying the Focusrite Saffire Pro 40; does anyone have any experience/comments about this? 

* Mics. I've got an MXL 900 and an SM57; it was a decent combination for my budget in the past, but I'm working more now and can afford to spend some money on a decent set of mics. Let's say there's a budget of about $500 for mics; what are my best options? Should I get multiple cheaper mics, or invest in some higher end ones?

* Monitors. I use some Shure SRH440 studio headphones for now, as it's much cheaper than buying monitors, but I know I'm going to have to get monitors eventually. I've never mixed with monitors before; how much of an advantage do they offer over headphones for mixing? Are they worth the hundreds of dollars I'd have to save as a junior in high school (you can apply this question to all of these, I suppose)?

* Etc. Cables, room treatment, etc. How important are they? Guitar Center would have me believe this project isn't possible for under $400,000,000, but I've had enough of their advice. The internet never lies, so I'm asking you guys instead!

Furthermore, do you have any advice for an aspiring hobbyist producer? I'm starting an internship at a local well-respected studio; how can I maximize my learning here? Any good literature/magazine subscriptions you'd recommend? 

I'll be happy to reply to anyone if they would like more information or feedback.
Thanks so much!

Edit: Budget's probably not too much higher than 1000; for this reason, I'm considering waiting on the monitors, at least for a bit. However, I don't want to buy cheap equipment that will get replaced; if I need to save more than 1000 for now, then I will. "

I don't really have the time or money to fly out for interviews whenever, and the prospect of going out to San Francisco (I don't actually live there, but I'll be there this summer) that late without an internship in hand makes me extremely nervous. So, r/jobs, I turn to you for help. What do I do about the fact that I won't be available for interviews until it's too late? Should I just drop any references to interviews at all? I haven't gotten any responses from companies, and I've wondered if the fact that I'm unable to interview in-person has been a part of that. 

She also mentioned that, as a liberal arts student, I'm essentially screwed in the job market even though I'm majoring in Psych, which is about as close as I can get to studying marketing. She specializes in tech, so I'm not sure how valid that would be outside of Silicon Valley, but it shook me a bit. So if anyone has insight on that, I'd love to hear it."

I have been playing tennis my whole life and have played tennis on a team from high school through college. I have three years experience teaching lessons, both group and private (ages from 5 years of age through college). I have taught for the Lombard Park District in the past but this year I have decided to offer private tennis lessons in the Lombard and Elmhurst Area.

These lessons will be catered to the players individual ability and will focus on rules of the game, form, strategy, drills, games (depending on the age), as well as some matches. I am also open to adjusting my lesson plan to fit your/your child's needs.

If anyone is interested or knows anyone who is interested please PM me and we can talk about rates/location/times. I really appreciate it!"
gy7j2,0,2011-04-26,I’m two years out of college and disillusionment is a brickload on my chest. How do I find a decent employer?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/gy7j2/im_two_years_out_of_college_and_disillusionment/,"I get plenty of interviews and job offers, but every one so far has turned out to be malicious in one way or another. Please advise me.

My backstory: After getting a BA in English --I know, this is where I screwed up. Please spare the obvious-- from Wittenberg University in Ohio, I enrolled in a six-week master’s level program in publishing at the Denver Publishing Institute. After that, I moved to the DC area to live and work close to my sister, who just had a baby. Most of the work around here is through government contractors, and aside from the part-time jobs I took while I was getting on my feet, I’ve been both a proposal writer and a technical writer. I’m good too. I’ll limit my bragging to the fact that during my first six months as a proposal writer, one of my proposals won a 10 million dollar contract and created thirteen jobs.

The big lesson from my proposal writing job was to get a realistic picture of the company's expectations of hours and their feelings on work/life balance up front. In interviews, I ask about the average hours for similar positions and how the company manages comp time. I also try to talk to actual employees whenever possible. Any job that doesn't want you to wander around and talk to the employees after your interview does so for a reason; they don't want the employees scaring you off. And that SHOULD scare you off. The abridged story of that job should explain the justification for these things.

I worked in a back office as a proposal writer for a firm that focused mainly on defense contracts. I thought that I had bombed the interview because I brought in the wrong writing sample, but I got a job offer the next week. That’s when I should’ve known. I started out as an intern and for the most part was limited to forty hours a week. It was obvious the full-time writers stayed much later. The management explained this in the interview: ""There are times when we're busier than others, but there are lulls in between peaks."" I figured that when I started full-time, I'd be working a little later during busy seasons like when proposals peaked.  

A little later? Let’s pause on the hours for a second and consider that I had an hour and a half commute one way to this job.  After they brought me on full-time, I started working ten hour days nearly every day, every week. There was no fluctuation in workload like they'd said; we were busy all the time. I woke up at 5:30 for work and any time I managed to escape work before 5 PM seemed like a jinx that would bring on a night where I didn't leave until 10 or 11.

I tried to tell my bosses I was getting burned out.  I needed a better work/life balance, and they kept promising that they'd try to manage our workloads a little better. I noticed no difference. I was averaging at least fifty hours a week, leaving my house at 6:20 in the morning, every morning, and usually not getting back until 8 or 9 at night. I'd get home, shower, maybe eat, go to sleep, and get up to do the same thing. After a night where I didn't get out of the office until 11:30 and had to still be in by 7 the next day, I started to feel like I was going nuts.

The next week, one of my coworkers was sick. She took Monday off to recover and worked twelve hour days for the rest of the week so that she wouldn't have to use PTO for her sick day. Our boss had said that this was fine; HR had something else to say about it. Even after our boss approved it, they made her take the PTO for that day, disregarding the fact that she'd stayed even later than normal to make up for it. Our boss didn't stick up for her. I quit.

I had to leave that job before finding another because I would have never had time to look for one during my rigorous schedule, much less interview. I had only banked a month’s pay at that point, so I had to move quickly... but it was worth it.

My second foray into the crazy, dishonest world of government contract work was technical writing. The tl;dr on this one: After I scanned over all the documents and emails that I'd kept, trying to find that golden line that stated how long our training and temp status was supposed to be, I found nothing. They had fed us half-truths verbally in the interview and never put any of it in writing. That's the lesson from this job: Get everything that they promise in writing. If it's not in writing, you ain't gettin' it.

I was originally thrilled about this job because I was actually on contract, not in a back office, and was only allowed to work forty hours a week. It seemed like heaven. During the interview, they told me that I'd have to go through a one month training period and that I'd be on temporary status while training. This meant a low hourly rate and no benefits. So I thought, “One month? That's not bad.” When I got to the job site and spoke to the manager, I found out that the training period was actually three months. Ok, so I was less pleased about that, but I'd already accepted the job and figured three months wouldn't kill me. There were four other people hired for the same position, and we were all in the same boat. We’d all heard the same things during the interview process. We kept hearing about this big 90-day review, and connected it to the end of our three month training period. 90 days go by and we hear that a 90-day review is really only for full time employees and that ours would be an informal review to give us some feedback on our work. It was during these interviews that we learned that they had no intention of considering us for full-time positions until they knew if the contract was getting renewed in September. No health insurance. No bump in pay grade. That might change, but there’s no guarantee. They told us that thinking we’d get full time status after 90 days was a “misunderstanding,” but how do five people from five separate interviews all have the same “misunderstanding?”

I'm interviewing for new jobs because there's no way that I can keep putting off my student loans and living like a beggar until September for a job I don't even know I'll get. Last week, I had an interview that turned into a job offer. I had to decline because I noticed some huge red flags:

* They based their salary offer on what I told them I make at my current job, even though their job has a broader scope and more responsibilities.

* They mentioned in the offer letter, but not in the interview, that I’d need security clearance. When I attempted to renegotiate salary based on this, they refused.

* During the interview, they danced around all of my questions about average hours per week and comp time. The emails containing the offer letter and responses to my renegotiation requests were also sent way outside of normal business hours.

It's a shame because this place is a ten minute commute from my apartment, which would have been really nice. That perk, while huge, is negated if I have to work through dinner.

So where are all the good, decent companies that want to keep their employees happy? Are there companies who employ technical writers or proposal writers that don't suffer from high turnover rates? How do I find a company that won’t try to burn me out to make a buck? Thanks to my experience I know a little more about avoiding the bad companies, but I don't want to waste my time in interviews with them. I could sure use a little help and advice."

The problem is this, while applying to somewhere close to 30 or so different firms I have received limited response, usually just in the form of rejection letters I get in the mail. I am pretty aware an issue might be that I have very limited experience as I haven't had any prior internships due to spending my summers marching drum and bugle corps rather than working. I'm still submitting applications to any place, anywhere in the country, just hoping that something might come together.

At this point I'm looking for any advice/help. I am beginning to worry that if I can't find work and even if I find a way to finish my degree over the summer that having a masters with my limited job experience will be even more of a problem."

Sadly, I'm still in university, and I'm not really willing to drop out and move to California permanently.

So about me: I'm a freshman studying CS at University of Washington. I've been writing code for about 8 years on my own, and I have a 4.0 in every programming class I've taken to date as a result. Last year (my senior year in High School) I interned at Microsoft Research, where I published two conference papers (I'm first author on both), and the year before I worked at a [startup near my house](http://www.atigeo.com).

I'm willing to relocate for an internship so long as either the pay is reasonable enough to cover the housing situation, or there's some stipend for that. (Most of the other places I've applied have been in the latter.) Or if this is in the Seattle area, even better :)

If you can do anything, let me know and I'll send over my resume. :D You can email me at tyler@menez.es if you'd prefer.

I know we haven't been dating that long in the grand scheme of things...but I feel like if he saw me in his future after college, he would have made some sort of comment about it by now.  This isn't something that's bugging me a ton, but it is something that crosses my mind once in awhile and kind of gets me down.  

It really would be ok if he didn't see any sort of future for us....I mean, I would be pretty crushed for awhile because he's everything I could ever hope for in a guy, but I know that life would go on eventually and I would move on.  Everyone does eventually.  

It would just be really nice to know this now, because the idea of doing long distance this summer (he's a little brainiac and got an amaaazing internship), getting more attached over next semester...only to break up...is pretty painful.

Unless this is normal?  I think I might be used to guys who were extremely open and honest about their feelings on this sort of thing.  The guy I dated 5 years ago or so said that he could see us dating for the next 4 years (and he planned heavily for that), but that we wouldn't be together in 10 (which was a bit of a relief for me.  He was a great boyfriend, but he wasn't exactly long term matieral).  

The guy I dated before my current boyfriend was very much on the side of being certain that we would get married, frequently discussed wedding ideas, was saving for a ring, etc (regardless of the fact that I was very adamant that we had a limited future together...I think he was hoping I would change my mind if he just forged on ahead with planning this stuff).

So needless to say, since I'm a full time student, I've been watching these with some trees the last few weeks.

It seems to me that these shows are most comparable to the  gladiator fights of ancient Rome. I had this original thought reading the IAMA Maury Intern a few days ago. She said that the show isn't so much racially exploitative as much as it is exploitative of our lower social class. She also said the guests get paid a small amount of money ($150) and they are encouraged and amped up to fight before the show.

So, in essence, we are putting our lower class on stage in front of an audience to fight each other; verbally as is most accepted these days, but often they break into the physical. To complete the comparison the audience is constantly booing or clapping in the most basic of reactions to complicated situations, and they seem to follow the gist of whoever is playing the Emperor role (be it Jerry Springer, Maury, or Steve.)

So, someone should make me a picture of Joaquin Phoenix in Gladiator with his thumb in the middle position and put Maury's face on it. It will be a wonderful piece of social commentary, and I think I'd enjoy it in my current state.

Why don't I do it? Too busy with my trees. :)"

I have been fucking livid since I got my grade back, this would never happen on a math test. This takes out 7.5% of the total points for the class.

I need some advice on how to handle this situation, I want to stay in the good graces of the faculty since it can get me an internship and I want my grades to be accurate to my abilities.

I am a pretty decent 20m college student.

gzx5b,0,2011-04-29,An open letter to Donald Trump,[deleted],politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/gzx5b/an_open_letter_to_donald_trump/,"Sir,

Some people have written you and your presidential ambitions off as implausible enough to be funny. Most would say you are overtly arrogant and un-statesmen like and hope and pray that America is not misguided enough to actually elect you, should you decide to run. And, yes, I am one of those people.

However, after giving it some thought, I’ve decided to keep an open mind about you and what you could bring to the table. You’re trying to sell yourself as the guy who gets things done. Boy, how grand it would be to send someone like that to Washington. However, this past stunt pandering to the birthers is far from getting shit done. You got a president to show his birth certificate. BFD. Ken Star had Clinton describing a blow job he got from an intern to the entire country. Calm yourself.

You want to get shit done? Pick any one of the serious problems facing the western world and just tinker with it for a while. Put your resources (things like the team of personal investigators you sent to Hawaii to “research” things on Obama) to work on the economic crisis and come up with something intelligent and executable and not cut wholesale from republican bumper stickers. Be the brilliant businessman you claim you are. Please, fix America. How do we get the dept under control? How do we fix this healthcare issue? What’s to be done of the terrible tone of modern political discourse? 3 wars; What’s all that about? Israel. The Taliban and world terrorism. Rebecca Black and military spending... What do we do Donald?

What bothers me most about your run for presidency, sir, is that you COULD do the above things and so much more if you wanted to. You have the resources, the connections and the celebrity. And the fact that you won’t (and decide instead to try to endear yourself to your twisted perception of a shallow and vapid American public) bothers and offends me. 

Unless, of course, you actually can get shit done. Tell us how you would fix these issues, any one of which is exponentially more important than Obama’s fucking birth certificate. Get some ideas on the table. Start drafting the Trump economic doctrine and for god’s sake don’t make it into a joke! You don’t have to be liked by everyone but you do need to be smart. (Hell, Ron Paul ain’t for everyone but you can’t deny he makes sense from time to time.) Let the comments you make in your interviews be backed by the knowledge gained from intelligent conversations you’ve had with the people we all know you could have access to. Take Elizabeth Warren out on a date and pick her brain. For fuck’s sake, be as awesome as you claim you are. If you do this, I will support you. I will knock on doors for you and I will make phone calls for you. I will take whatever downvotes I have to take in your defence and I will like it. However, most of all, I will forget the fact that you are a pompous self aggrandising media whore who doesn’t deserve the honour of even running for President.

Can you do that? Will you do that? If I had to bet, I know where I’d put my money...

My girlfriend is currently studying her part 1 undergraduate course in architecture in the UK. She applied to a summer school in the British School at Rome for the summer - [link](http://www.architecturesummerschool.com/index.html) and got a place. 

However she is a bit skeptical about the whole thing. The summer school doesn't seem to appear on the British School at Rome's website. For a program that only accepts 20 people the application process was just a brief 200 word ""Please briefly describe why you would like to attend the Architecture Summer School at the British School at Rome"", she did not have to provide academic records or a portfolio of work. She also received an acceptance email before the official deadline was over, and it was quite short and abrupt, which is making her suspicious about the whole thing. (It's also quite expensive - £1650 for 10 days)

She is thinking about not accepting, and taking an unpaid summer internship with a small company near where she lives. Does anyone have any knowledge about this, does it look like a good opportunity or not?

Any help/advice would be greatly appreciated."

I'm currently caught between Finance or Accounting.  My Bachelor's is in Accounting.  What would you recommend and why?

EDIT 1:  A little backstory (was in a hurry when I posted this): I graduated in June 2008.  I'd been searching for 8 months prior for a job and not getting any calls back. Due to this and the financial situation back at home, running the risk of losing the house, I joined the reserves to have some money to chip in if it was ever needed.

I actually am planning on going for the CPA (already started buying books and looking up coaching courses for it) before doing a Master's; just want to start planning from now. And for the Master's I've got a 1-year veteran bump on my G.I.Bill plus kicker, plus I got a 20k loan repayment both which I haven't touched yet, so I'm not too concerned about where the money will come to pay for my tuition. 

It's not that I don't want a job, I would kill for a job right now. But still haven't had any luck landing a full-time job in accounting. I'm doing a part-time bookkeeping for a Doctor's office, which I'm not sure will last much longer cause she's made some shady suggestions as to how she wants to have her books prepared which I refuse to do, and is also trying to rip me off of my pay (tried to offer me $9.50/hr to do her books, from scratch; and also tried to persuade me into giving me $100 in advance, without us having set a pay rate or fee yet. Which I saw as her trying to legally bind me into the job.)

The reason I'm considering a Master's is because everywhere I look for a job, there's a request for 3-5years experience and/or Master's Degree (I know accounting's more solid, but I seldom see a request for it, they usually ask for finance; is there a reason for this?) And I'd rather be overqualified and just offer to work for lower pay, than be considered underqualified and be rejected without getting any opportunity to negotiate it over like it's happened so far.

Also, my accounting experience is minimal, as I've been doing the Army on ADT, MOB, and Training orders for most of the past time since I graduated up until last December. My experience consists of a summerjob, an internship, and the part-time work I'm doing now. I am still actively looking for a full-time job in the accounting field at the moment."

I'm currently living in Augusta GA, so I don't know much about the area. If anyone has ideas on furnished places to stay (or better, a room to rent to a kind young soul) from early May to mid August they would be incredibly appreciated."
h0mtx,4,2011-04-29,So I found out my sister is a Cam Girl.  What would you do?,bigbrother26,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/h0mtx/so_i_found_out_my_sister_is_a_cam_girl_what_would/,"I was working on my design final for school and my Adobe design premium suite trial expired. I couldnt simply uninstall and reinstall due to Adobes DRM so I asked my sister to loan me her Macbook Pro. I used it and got my project done. My sister (Annie) took the computer back. I asked for it again to remove some files I was needing and noticed that my sister just closed out her browser and didnt log out of her gmail.

You see me and my sister are college students. I work as a workstudy on campus making peanuts on the dollar but it does pay for gas and food so no complaints here. My sister informed me that she landed a job as a blogger and was doing fine with the money. I generally believed her due to her writing background in high school. I never investigated the issue. I would periodically run google searches of her name and never brought up anything.

That was until this past Sunday. I admit that I looked through her email. This was not a big problem for me due to one of other sisters (Linda) almost commiting suicide and if it was not for me and Annies investigation the situation would have not turned out well.

I started noticing that Annie was pulling in an amazing amount of money for simply blogging. She would brag about making $800.00 in two weeks and recently made close to $1500.00. This caused me to become even more suspicious about the whole thing. I found out through her emails that my sister is not a blogger. She is a Cam girl. She performs sexual acts on the screen and people pay her for it. From what I figured out she started off striping but has escalated to other acts.

As you can imagine a million different thoughts and emotions have been racing though me. As her big brother I do not approve of what she is doing. I dont know If I should tell my parents or talk to her on my own. I doubt that me talking to her will change her mind. If I tell my parents then that will ruin her relationship with them. She is quite emotional. If I do nothing and if she fully embraces the lifestyle and that leads to porn or other acts I dont know how I could deal with that.

Let me just get a few things straight. Im not jealous. In fact Im rather angry because my sister made up a huge lie a few months ago that she won an internship to Disney and had to go to Orlando for orientation. She an opportunity of a lifetime and threw it away, or it was a fraud and went for some meeting for the company she works for. My mother had loaned her money for the plane ticket. Also when I finally found out about who she works for I went into her chat room. It basically works like this. There is chat room and they all have access to the girls webcamera. Every one in the room can tip her and she can flash or do whatever she wants to get more tips from the chat room participants. I went into her room once I found her user name and she conducts her shows from my mothers house and will talk to and call my mother from her phone while on camera. I see that as very disrespectful. On top of that my mother gives me a hard time cause I cant bank money while my sister can.

I honestly dont know what to do. Im just asking for some advice and if there are any former cam girls offer your advice as well. I understand that its her life and she has the right to do whatever she wants with it. She is 19 years old. I just think that it will lead to a desructive lifestyle and future. She's already hinting that she is not going back to school next semester. We are not poor or have a hard life. She had a full grant to go to college and study anything she wanted. She was living on campus and was doing well her first semester. The thought of fame and fortune have clouded her thoughts. Just looking for your thoughts on the situation. Thanks. My apologies on any grammar or spelling errors"

I'd like to get a degree in Computer and Information Science and then continue with a Masters degree.  I hope to begin a career in information security whether it's corporate, government, or I've even seen internships available with the FBI, CIA, and NSA.  I have done some programming with C++ and Visual Basic back in high school but this was really simple stuff.  I need suggestions on any books, classes, and other websites that might help prepare me mentally for this field.  I also would GREATLY appreciate advice from any of you that have experience in systems analysis and information security.  I'm particularly interested in what programming languages I should begin familiarizing myself with and how they relate to the previously mentioned fields.  Thanks in advance to all replies.  I look forward to reading them all and hope to respond to all comments."

2. [Khan's Academy](http://www.khanacademy.org/) has been great to help with my courses. (I assume reddit already knows)
I wish he did some accounting classes though :D  

Anyone know any other useful sites?

I love for a class-help site where you can post questions and people answer them (reddit has been great for that). 

Is there any other internship/job finding forums? "

h0ium,0,2011-04-29,Tough college choices...can you guys give me some opinions?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/h0ium/tough_college_choicescan_you_guys_give_me_some/,"Hey guys,

So I am senior in high school. I have been in the International Baccalaureate program for 4 years and am ranked in the top 4% of my graduating class. I recently applied to and got rejected from all of the Ivy League schools that I have aspired to go to all of my life, but I managed to get into UC Berkeley and the University of Florida. I really don't have a preference between either of these two, so I am trying to make my decision based on what is most important in terms of academics and future goals. I had an eight month internship at an animal shelter and I researched a lot about veterinary medicine and have decided that I want to be a veterinarian, and someday attend Cornell Vet School. 

UF offers a pre-vet curriculum while at Berkeley I would have to major in biochemistry or molecular biology, neither of which would *really* help me in vet school.

On the other hand, Berkeley is ranked #23 while UF is ranked #53 (out of 2,600 colleges in the U.S.). 

UF is very close to home while Berkeley is on the other side of the country. However, California would be a beautiful location to start my college/life experience. 

The main choice I face is between choosing whether I should go to UF for my major or Berkeley because it has a higher rank (keep in mind I want to either transfer into Cornell during undergrad or go there for vet school).

TL;DR **I am a high school senior and 100% sure that I want to be a vet. I didn’t get into Cornell, and that’s where I want to ultimately go for vet school. Should I go to UF which offers my major while UC Berkeley does not…or UC Berkeley that is ranked #23 while UF is #53**
