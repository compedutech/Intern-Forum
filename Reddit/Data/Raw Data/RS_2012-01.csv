Coming into my second to last semester, my GPA is a pathetic 2.08.  I'm a Materials Science Engineer. I've had to repeat several courses but it's not like I'm failing out or anything, I just get a lot of C's.  I feel like changing majors really isn't an option at this point and I've obviously ruled grad school out.  I know (or at least I hope) GPA won't really matter after getting my first job but finding that first job is understandably worrying me greatly.  I would imagine I can't be the only person to have ever been in this situation.  I'm a bit stubborn when it comes to adversity and instead of jumping ship, I chose to ride it out (and go down with it...).  Optimistically what are my options?  Armed forces? Unpaid internships? Other ideas? I'm already going to work my butt off for the next two semesters but I've always found that easier to say than do.

This leaves one summer semester where I don't have anything to do, so I was looking into an internship (or rather, I have been for a month or so now). Basically, I'm having trouble finding a place. My school has a pretty good website to find jobs/internships, but I want to try and look around more on my own.

I'd like to stay in defense, but that's no requirement. And honestly, I'm open to try anything inside the scope of mechanical engineering. Does anyone know of any good job-search websites where internships are posted? Is it tacky or disrespectful to find companies I'm interested in, and then contacting their HR department to see if they would be willing to accept an intern?"

I'm a third year pharmacy student and I've started to become interested in joining the military after my internship (I unfortunately signed a contract with Shoppers to help pay for school and I'll need to work with them for 2 years). I have a BSc in biochem with ~1.5 years lab tech experience. I'm currently 23, so I'd probably be applying when I'm around 26 or 27.

I guess I just have a few questions for anyone who followed a similar path...

- What do you do in your day-to-day practice? Most of my experience is with patients in a community setting.
- What did you do before the military?
- Is there demand for this type of profession? I've noticed that the forces website lists the profession as in-demand. Will it likely stay that way? Judging by most of my classmates, I doubt we're joining the military in droves.
- Any signing bonuses?
- What's the potential for promotion? 
- Is 27 too old?
- Any advice?

Thanks in advance.

I've been having difficulty coming up with a decent list of places to look, mainly because I don't think I can qualify for government(DoD related) positions which seems to cut my options dramatically. I've attended career fairs and searched through my University's career site and I'm usually greeted with a requirement of some sort of government clearance. 

The following places is what I've come up with:
Paypal
Prometric
MICROS Systems
OPIS
AOL

With the exception of Prometric, the rest of the companies were the only non-government positions at our career fair that were actively looking for CS students. I'm primarily looking for places to apply within Baltimore City or Baltimore County, but anything reasonably close to that area would help. Companies like Lockheed, Northrop, SAIC, ect are all no-go.

I started dating my ex-gf in hs when we were both 17 and seniors.  It was the first and serious relationship for both of us.  6 months later we graduated hs and ended up going to separate colleges 8 hours away from each other, continuing our relationship.  She hated her university, and after our first year, she ended up transferring to my school.  I did not give her the idea, nor did I encourage it, in fact I tried slightly to sway her to go elsewhere, but she made up her mind and of course I was happy to be closer to her.  After the first semester she very strongly persuaded me to move out from my apartment w/ friends, and in with her.  After the second year of school was over I ended up in the midwest for a summer internship (home being the east coast).  She was happy for me to a point, but she was also a bit jealous of my success.  I noticed through texting/calling during this time that she wasn't as close as before.  When I come home I still noticed she was a little distant, and she tells me that she ""got used to things without me"".  That really hurt and I handled it passive aggressively, we were okay for the next year with usual ups and downs but were pretty happy overall I would say.    
    
    
Fast forward to this last summer where I returned to the midwest for another internship (this time for 6 months).  In June I fly home to see her for her birthday.  We have a fight that I can't even remember what about, but just remember feeling worse than I ever felt before.  We didn't resolve it and she left for her destination, as I headed back to the midwest, and I texted her to make sure that she made it safely.  We didn't call each other for a day or so, and then she texts me that she wants to call.  I say call whenever, and she says that she is nervous.  I ask why and she says because of the email.  Very confusingly I check my email to find that she wrote an email to me essentially breaking up with me stating ""I don't want you to be upset or sad, because no matter what I will always be there"".  I was so filled with emotions (anger, confusion, sadness, etc.) I don't even reply back (call/text/email).  I delete her from all connections (cell/fb/email).  I text her a week or so later asking ""Are you okay with this?"".  And she texts me back ""Well it seems you are .. blah blah misdirecting the question crap"".  
    
     
We text very strangely back and forth every so often for about a month, then she stops responding altogether.  I get an email from her saying it might be less awkward for her roommates if I moved out of the apt at school.  I thought the same (that it was a good idea for us not to stay in the same apt, I could care less what her roommates thought), but the fact that she said at first it was okay, along with saying that she would come out to the midwest (giving me hope that we could talk in person to work out the end of our relationship), and then changing her mind really upset me.  We didn't physically speak to each other for 5 months when I got back from my internship (it was me who initiated contact to meet up and talk).  We're talking and catching up for about an hour.  Then the first part of actually talking about the relationship was her apologizing for ending it the way she did, the whole time she can't even look me in the eye.  I said it was okay and that it was partly my fault that drove her to do that (I regret saying this now).  We talk for a pretty short time after that (mostly me) and she says that she has to leave to a relative's house.


After she left I didn't quite realize how I felt, but after the next day or two passed I realized I still wasn't okay.  I felt like I gave her just enough closure to be happy, while I'm stranded with none whatsoever.  I ask her that I want to talk, she says okay, but in a week and a half she can't find any time at all to meet.  I'm thinking this is an excuse as we're both on break and she's not working.  Every day is something different that she has 'possible' plans and I feel like I need to be on call for whenever she finally gets time to talk.  I even got so frustrated at this that I texted her back telling her that I can't just be on standby for her whenever she ""gets around to talking to me"".  She took it a bit more seriously and we plan on meeting tomorrow night.  I feel that talking to her (hearing more of her feelings/thoughts) is the only way to get this spiraling unhealthy ending of a relationship done and over with (Am I wrong?).


Throughout the relationship I regrettably shut out a lot of my friends and family.  She was hard to make compromises w/ spending time with my family vs. hers and as a result I got pretty close to her family.  Ultimately I know I am to blame for not being closer to my fam and friends while we were together.  Now I feel like I have no one to really talk to.  When I was interning it was easier to deal with because I was distant, I suppressed how I felt (still haven't really spoken to anyone about how I feel about this all), and because she had no influence to my everyday life there.  But now returning home/school it's awful since she was such a HUGE part of my life there, everything that I've known is gone.  I lost my best and closest friend and it just hit me all of a sudden.

It sucks because we have been through so much, and legitimately my happiest times have been with her.  Obviously not every part of our relationship was explained here so this might not accurately portray what we had.  Part of me wants to tell her to fuck off, but a bigger part wants to talk to her and try to work things out to an amicable state where I can feel better.  Either way I understand that it's over, I think it's for the better, and I personally don't have any temptation to reconcile the relationship.  But I just feel so unresolved.  Thoughts about what I should say/act or if this is even a good idea, or any general thoughts at all?  Thanks!

I’m very much interested in a biomedical-related internship, specifically something with a medical device company (Baxter, GE, Ethicon-Endo Surgeries, etc). Though I definitely will apply to more conventional ME companies considering the lack of exposure of BME material in undergrad. (Kinda hard to gauge what BME companies would want from undergrads)

-I’m currently debating whether to take an Introductory CAD course (a very time consuming one at that) as sixth class next semester, as I’ve heard from some friends that almost the entirety of the course is taught with NX. Up to this point I’ve always gotten the impression that 3DSolidWorks is where it’s at. Is it fair to say that some design software get more light of day than others? How about programming software (MATLAB, LabView, etc)?

Other than that there’s research experience (which I do have a semester of from last year, but it was back when I was in Civil and thought I would be an environmental engineer, not much pertinence there), and Excel skills. Someone mentioned in a previous thread about familiarizing yourself with [FDA regulations](http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/Overview/default.htm) if you want to try the medical device field. Would this be impressive to know from a hiring stand point? Or would they think that as an undergrad that I'm blowing smoke out of my...well you know.

nzt4k,4,2012-01-02,We were beaten to it because we took to long and were afraid. My biggest regret of my life this far.,businessmodel_bye_by,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/nzt4k/we_were_beaten_to_it_because_we_took_to_long_and/,"A friend propositioned me  on a business idea last February for a mobile application when we were both just 18 and finishing our final year in school.

The idea was for an app that ranks drink deals in your city's Night Clubs from cheapest to most expensive. The app would be free to download and free for the club for the first 2 months. Then after the 2 months were up we would charge a nominal fee for each drink deal the club wanted to submit. We would have location based services built into the app so that users could not only see what the drink deal was but also how far away the Night Club was from your current position. Via the app you would be able to put yourself on the guest-list too. We had a lot of different ideas and plans for the app to add on after it had been created and published. We were to split the ownership 60-40 in my friends majority.

We got very excited from February on wards about the potential of the app. We started doing mock ups of the app in classrooms around the school after hours. We had a plan of action by April 2011. It was at this point procrastination began to sit in. We had exams in June that would determine what University we would go to. We said to one another that we would only spend non-study hours on the project and that it would not get in the way of our studies. We soon discovered that app of this size would cost in the region of 7000 to 12000 dollars.
The combination of these two factors left the two of us concerned about whether the app was worth it. 

Fast forward to Mid July 2011 after our exams. My friend came back from an Internship in Singapore for a start-up social networking site where he had met some multimillionaire entrepreneurs who had inspired him to go all out on the app. His motivation rubbed off on me when he got back. We sat down and planned what things needed to be done by when. We both downloaded Photoshop and began designing every page of the app over the next month and a half. We decided that we would have to get the app sponsored in order to be able to pay for the programming of the app. We were going to get the leader in drink distribution of our country to sponsor us.

We got our College places at the end of August and not much work was done on the project until end of September because we wanted to settle in. 

Then it all went down hill. On October 5th 2011 I walked into College with a different friend. We were approached in the main square by some promoter and a conversation like this occured:

Promoter: Hey Guys! Do you have a smart phone?
Other Friend: Nah, getting one soon though.
Me: Me neither, I have a Blackberry, why? ( I asked why just out of curiosity).
Promoter: Oh right, ok well if you 'like' our page on Facebook you could be in with a chance to win an iPhone 4. A friend and I basically just made an app for Android and iPhone that ranks drink deals in Night Clubs from cheapest to most expensive.
Other Friend: Oh coo-
Me: What! (Grabbed the promoters phone to see it)
Promoter: Yeah its really cool!
Me: Is it successful?
Promoter: Well we released last Thursday and it has over 2000 downloads.

The design of the app was identical to what we had been designing except for the color scheme. My stomach sank. I ran out outside, my friend I was with had no idea what was going on. I rang my partner but he didn't pick up so I rang him non-stop for 10 minutes until he did. He was gutted and so was I. I wish them all the best though and according to the promoter he and his partner had spent their life savings on the app and had thought of the idea in February 2011 too.

As of today they have 25,000 likes on Facebook and the app only works in our city. So there is some serious potential for the application. It's called GreatNite if you wanna check it out.

TLDR; A friend and I procrastinated on an mobile application that had huge potential and someone beat us to it."

I was wondering if someone could help me out with the local culture and stuff.

1)How do phone plans work? Is everything prepaid with no contract? I'm used to a 3 year contract in Canada, but I'm planning on calling back to Canada and texting a bit, and also getting data if its cheap? (A friend mentioned simyo but didn't elaborate)

2)I have no internet service at the place where I'm living and cannot sign up/hook up internet. Would tethering be my best option? Are phone companies okay with this? (Canadian companies go crazy over this.. in the negative way)

3)Is Alemannic German easy to learn? I tried to dig up some material, but I couldn't find like a rosetta stone package or something similar. I'm like a 3rd grader with High German, but thats all I know.

4) Do people know English usually? If I got lost one day, should I ask someone on the streets or is that a bad idea? (No one will purposely point me in the wrong direction right? :S.. I heard awful stories from Taiwan and I've always been worried about new places)

5)What's the best way to start a conversation without being insulting? Should I attempt to speak in German first and then wait and see if they answer in English? Shaking hands is okay right? How can I tell between coworkers, friends and my supervisor? (Such as from what they say, the pronouns they use?)

* I am not doing this as a new years resolution, it's just falling in line with the timeframe - I've been training and making minor lifestyle alterations as I go - my current targets are going to be sleeping on a regular cycle and eating healthier - small steps - it's one of the biggest things we preach as healthcare providers and yet so few of us actually do it. 
* I have been training in Brazilian Jujitsu for around 3 months now, usually 3-6 days a week, and the weight has been coming off.  Slowly. I want to speed it up, and something that has been very prevalent here has been proper diet. I signed up for FitDay and am planning on using that to track my eating patterns and hopefully help me change the way I eat to a healthier pattern
* Supplements - I currently take 5000 IU of vitamin D, a spectrum silver, and am considering starting to take Yohimbine HCL, will definately be starting fish oil again, and am hoping to make sure I cover all my bases.  As a pharmacy intern one of my goals is to make sure I'm healthy overall, and want to make sure the supplements I'll get are going to be what they claim to be (we talk about how there's very light regulation on supplements, and none by the FDA so I worry about drug interactions, etc) so I was hoping I could get some more guidance in this regard.  This subreddit has a lot of information in it and it got a little overwhelming. 
* Eating.  This is more specific than eating healthy.  One of my biggest problems is that I never really learned portion control as a kid so my diet has been historically pretty shitty.  When I was younger I trained around 7-8 hours a day so my awful diet wasn't an issue because my MMA training was pretty intense so it wasn't a big deal - I was never 8% BF but I usually hovered around 10-12% which I was satisfied with (I was only in HS so getting shredded was not my goal, just to have fun fighting)
* My last question is this - I have started doing a program similar to crossfit prior to my jujitsu classes so I train from 5-8 3-5 days a week and from noon to 2 on Saturdays.  Am I going to want to supplement that excercise with running / lifting in the gym or am I going to want to just stick with what I'm doing now and with the modified diet just see what happens?  I don't want to overdo it and hurt my progress. 

Thank you /r/fitness and I look forward to learning more from you - I've spent a few hours reading and I've already learned quite a bit! 

Edit: I'm sorry but could someone link me to a good source for where I can learn more about Micro:Macro nutrient ratios? This is something I've literally never even heard of before... Makes me feel like I have a lot to learn - and this is disconcerting, I'm going to be a licensed pharmacist in a year...

Edit2: I found Swole.Me reading through the FAQ once more - it seems I misunderstood the micro:macro thing I suppose, just mineral/vitamin dense food is what I'm assuming it means.

I am about to graduate in June with my Bachelors in Electrical Engineering, and will be getting my masters after that. I am currently in a program that combines bachelor's + masters in 5 years.  I am extremely interested in getting a job in Brazil. I have always wanted to travel and I heard that is a place where there are tons of jobs for engineers.  However, I don't want to commit to a full time job without first having a short term internship.  Also, I don't know if this matters or not, but I am a girl.

Anyways, now that I have given a great deal of this possibly irrelevant information, I was wondering if anybody knew of a good place to start searching for internships.

Thanks!"

I breezed through high school, acing standardized tests and mastering concepts (except ochem, holy fuck is ochem hard) without any real effort. My parents aren't rich, but I have a nasty case of white privilege, I've never applied for a job but through high school always had nice internships in engineering firms, and I'm not doing so bad now either. (a friend of a friend knew somebody who knows a cofounder...)

I have rarely had to do something I didn't want to do. Homework? My teachers let me slide because I did so well on tests and was really good at kissing ass. 

This has fucked me.

When I try to do something, if it takes more that a little bit of effort I almost immediately lose interest. I decided last week to ask you for help reddit, and every day since then I've started writing only to delete my draft 10 minutes later and start browsing /r/funny . I dropped out of college, because they weren't so lenient about homework, and I just couldn't sit down to write papers and solve tedious problems. I've gone through a few jobs now, because after a month or two I get bored and just stop working, having solved all the fun parts of their problems.

Luckily I'm a computer programmer so I could keep this up for the rest of my life if I wanted to, computer programming pays ridiculously well. But I don't want to be so lazy! I want to start my own business, or go back to school and get a PhD in math! I want to reinvent the internet or play a big role in the creation of strong AI! 

It's gotten painful to meet anybody form high school, they all talk about how much potential I had and have, then I have to tell them I'm between jobs or working for some startup that isn't solving anything useful. It's painful not just to face my friends, but to face myself. I feel like I'm throwing my life away and badly want to stop.

tl;dr 

How do I keep myself motivated in the face of doing real work that isn't necessarily fun?
How do I train myself to delay gratification? At the moment, I can't for longer than a few minutes.

- It would be publicly funded through taxes.

- Single-payer. Universities still set GPA and test scores requirements. If a student is accepted, then the government pays thereafter.   

- For a tuition-free education, applicants would be required to serve some time in a volunteer service program like Peace Corps, Teach for America, or some other Americorps program, or some internship, or in the military (which includes salary and benefits).

ex) 4 year education = 1 year volunteer service program or military service (enlisted), (ROTC/officer training would be 3 years)

2 year education = 6 months (no military option)

- If a student prefers not to engage in the service method, then s/he can pay for college normally (scholarships and college loans would still be around).  

I'm in favor of European style publicly funded college education as way of eliminating student graduate debt (young people can't start a life or career with up to $100,000 in debt) and as a way of expanding access to higher education. 

I added the service requirements, because I felt it would be easier to pass and be accepted in America if there was something the receiver needed to give up (e.g. time), so it won't be seen as a ""handout"".

I was hired as an intern by a new company in my town where I am going to college. I was hired as a designer and was unofficial offered ~$500 a week. The work started right away, but I never went on payroll till a few months later. During that time, I was paid under the table at random. Came out to be only $700 a month. The work was fun and fit my schedule so I wasn't complaining to much at the time. They were waiting on papers I guess since they were a new company.

Then in the summer I got on the payroll and made about triple that amount. I was paid the amount for three months. Without notification my next check (they were monthly checks) was back to an even lower amount than the first time.

In the last two months I got the exact same amount (checks always ended in .00 cents) even though I had worked more hours.

Even though I should probably just get a new job, the hours are very open and allows me to work at home, and looks very nice on a resume.

My thoughts are to condense relevant information from my resume onto one slide then spend the remainder of the presentation expanding on the undergraduate and graduate research projects that I've engaged in as well as relevant lab work.

I exaggerate truths about my life, or just make things up entirely and spread it to my friends and family as if it were who I really am.

Most of the time, the lies are who I want to become, and by telling them I force myself to become that person to avoid humiliation with those I know finding out it wasn't true. Other times, they are lies that build on top of the initial lie when I cannot actually do what I wanted.

These lies started out small enough, lying on grades that I was getting in college to avoid uncomfortable moments with parents, lying to friends from home about college to be more of a life of the party, lying to friends from college about home to do the same. It was easy, most lies didn't require follow-up to turn myself into that person since they were stories about the past, not present. Then I started lying about jobs I was getting, telling friends from college about internships I was getting (that I wasn't even close to getting from my poor grades), lying to my family about the amount of money I have (next to nothing).

Last March, I lied to just about everyone I knew saying that I got an internship with a local company to my college, that their plan was to keep me working while I finished college and eventually start full-time. None of this had happened. I frantically applied everywhere trying to turn this lie into a reality, dreading what I would have to do if it didn't happen. Miraculously, in May, I found a company that would do just that. It was one of the happiest days of my life. I could finally get out of this rut and start living in the truth.

I worked for them during the summer, they told me to let them know within 2 weeks of the semester starting if I wanted to do part-time. This was to be my last semester. When I began the semester, I realized I wouldn't be graduating in December. I still had more requirements, more than I could take in a single semester. Depression set in, I didn't contact the company, but I kept telling everyone I knew that I was working for them remotely. I was so depressed that I stopped going to most classes, just wasting away the days.

I finally had to tell my parents that I would be staying another semester, still lying, making up an excuse that shifted the blame from myself to the school. No one else knows except them, but that's all they know. As far as anyone I talk with is concerned, this is my life:

I am done with college, starting with the company I interned for as a salaried employee, have an all-around great life.

What my life actually is:

I still have a semester left (maybe more), I am in contact with the company hoping to get part-time this semester, I have no money in my bank account, I am moving into an apartment by myself this semester, my family knows I still have more time at college and I have to start paying for that soon, but I'm not even registered for classes yet so I might not even still be enrolled. My family thinks I need to apply for a student loan to pay for this semester (which I will have to) but the amount they think it's for is 1 class, when it is much more than that, and they think I have a job, so getting a loan would be easier than it is in reality.

So my situation, the way I see it, boils down to getting this job and being able to register for classes. If I get the job and can register, I can apply for a student loan to pay for those classes as well as my apartment. I might not finish this semester, but could graduate with the promise of finishing up credits with night classes over the summer. That would allow me to become salaried at this company (if they would take me) and start paying off my debt and living the life I have made up for myself.

If I don't get this job, I have no idea what I am going to do. It really all boils down to that. I have no control over my current situation, and it's driving me into the deepest depression of my life.

The worst part of it all is that this job isn't even what I want to do, it's just the only company I can find that will hire me. I have so many dreams and aspirations but I feel locked into this situation through debt and college. I just want to get out.

TL:DR; I have lied so much in my life that I have cornered myself into a situation that is controlled by a company deciding to give me a job or not. If they do, it should work out fine, if they don't, my life will unravel."

We're a post-production house in Chicago focused mainly on commercial spot work.  And we're looking for the perfect intern to work with our engineering/IT department.

We fix things when they break.  We install and make everything work together perfectly.  Our projects include planning and installing new equipment, computer hardware and software support, maintenance of video and audio gear, IT networking, and general troubleshooting alongside our editors and artists.

If you're interested, you should already have some background in video production and post-production.  Knowledge about editing and graphics, and the software and hardware behind it would be nice.  Knowledge about video and audio cables...how to make them, crimp, solder, troubleshoot, etc.  Ethernet?  Yes.  Troubleshooting Mac, Windows?  Yes.  Linux?  Oh, that'd be real nice.

If you're dreams are to become an editor, graphics artist, audio engineer, or some other awesome person who sits in the chair and runs the gear...that's great.  But don't apply to this internship.

If instead...you think you've got a great mix of potential talent, interests, and desire to rebuild computers, wire networks, climb around ceilings digging in cable trays, and help support a video post-house...well...we should talk.  We're located in downtown Chicago.  Send me a PM with a non-form-letter introduction, and I'll be in touch.

I graduated in 2010 from a top 15 (but non-target) undergraduate.  I took a year off and did some lab work, applied to Medical school.  I've gotten a handful of acceptances thus far (w00t!), but during the last few months, for a multitude of reasons, I've really lost my passion for medicine.  My parents have both been in business (buying real-estate, etc) and working as an intern this past year for their company has really made me reconsider a career in finance.

I was looking at possible financial careers that would suit my personality type (very science-y), and being a Quant seems really interesting, especially quants who help develop algo models for trading.   It seems that an MFE or a Math PhD are the two best routes to take.  Is that the case? Any other options I can consider?  If I go either of those two routes, I'll have to spend the next year taking math courses (shouldn't be a problem, minus the whole losing out on a year bit).  

A basic summary of my qualifications thus far: 4 years Biomedical research, Chemistry major, ok GPA, great MCAT score (lol probably useless for finance).  


Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!

Also I'd like to play rugby again and try my hand at a Tough Mudder Course. Plus I need impetus to end my love affair with cereal and concentrate on making my on-again off-again relationship with broccoli more steady. 

Backstory: Came into college a thin but flabby weakling, got into rugby, got less flabby and quite a bit faster. Then I lost momentum at some point and stopped exercising regularly. I've graduated and haven't exercised since my last club rugby drunk practice (and I can assure you that was hardly exercising). 

At this point I can barely run ~~two~~ ~~miles~~ **a mile** without stopping, and I've also seen definite drops in my strength. It's all very discouraging and I haven't really got into it again. I feel like I'm right where I started before college, if not worse off. 

Measurements are:

* biceps 10

* chest 34

* waist 29 (eventual goal 27)

* hips 37

* thighs 20 (eventual goal 18)

* knee 15 (included because I'd like thinner knees, please, though they may just be shaped like that, alas)

I'd like to concentrate on getting to where I was:

* changing my shape (I never had a slim waist but I'd liked to -  and less chubby muthafuckin' knees)

* getting back that muscle and flexibility (especially leg strength and back/core strength)

*  regaining my endurance (I ran my 2 miles at about 7.5-8 min/mile and 6 miles at about 8.5 min/mile, which is much better than now)

I'll put up photos after work and current times/weights sometime this week. 

I'll be commuting about 30 miles round trip between home, internship, and work these next few months, so by necessity my cardio will be pretty much covered. Getting in that weight training will be the hard part, but if I'm going to fight off the starving, desperate hordes that roam the earth post-Dec 21 2012, I'mma need some muscle. 

Happy healthy body time, everyone!

o17un,7,2012-01-03,Hey Redditors of Ireland! I have been denied a passport because I legally changed my surname. Is there anything I can do? ,throw_meaway_love,ireland,https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/o17un/hey_redditors_of_ireland_i_have_been_denied_a/,"Basically I've lived in Ireland all my life with the occasional holiday and J1 summers. But September 2011 I legally changed my surname after my parents divorced. Without going into too much detail I chose to change it to my mother's surname as I found it was my way of saying thank you for leaving my dad. 

Now fast forward to this morning. I que up in the passport office in Dublin. Go to the counter. Have ALL of the required and necessary documentation (including all the documentation of my name change) and the woman in the passport office doesn't hear me out about the reasons of changing my name and declines my application on the spot. I'm told to leave the building.


Now, I know it's the law that says I have to wait TWO YEARS after changing names before I can apply for a passport. This law is in place so people with debt don't just up and leave our country without repaying the banks. 

I understand this reason, but I'm 21, a student with no money no credit cards no car no nothing. I've never had an overdraft and I've never had a loan. I've saved money in our banks. Not taken it. I don't owe the country any money, I may owe my mother a couple of hundred euros but I don't owe the state a penny. So I'm being penalised for what? For thanking my mother?

Anyway, I'm really stuck now as my college course requires me to do a 3-6 month work placement. This also requires studying abroad as there are no internships here in Ireland for the certain industry I'm in. I know I can get to the UK using a drivers liscense so I won't be entirely stuck. 

But my point is, I will be without a passport for two whole years.

I am currently trying to contact a politician to see if she will help my case. But in the meantime, has this happened to any other Redditor? Or does anyone know if there is something more I can do...

Due to me overtrusting some unfortunate advice from my school's advisors, I decided to graduate without a finance internship, with almost no networking. Combine this with the fact that my GPA was pretty mediocre (3.0-ish), and I have been unable to land any sort of gainful employment. Any referrals I have been able to obtain have been negated by what I am told is a lack of experience or the fact that the company wants a top GPA. Since i've been at this for a while, I feel like a change is due. Would it be more worthwhile to: 
1. Accept a much lower position (like a clerk job, ba/aa only preferred on posting) at a company that I am interested in getting a better job at?
2. Go back to undergrad and get an accounting degree? (I graduated debt-free and could remedy the networking/internship issues)
3. Keep on applying, and hope that something changes?
4. New Ideas?

However, I started attending community college full-time when I was 15, my Sophomore year of high school, and continued there through my Senior year of high school. I earned my High School Diploma, Associate in Arts and Sciences, and an Associate in Science: Mechanical Engineering track. 

I go to a pretty good engineering school and had more than 70 semester credits transferred in there, so even though I was admitted as a Freshman, I had Junior status. I only need two years at the university to graduate with a BSME.

SO! This is my first year at university and I need to apply for internships right now for the summer. I'm finding it really difficult to put my situation into words that the reader of my resume understands what I'm doing the first time they read it. The thing is, they can see that I am technically a Junior, but beyond having a bunch of community college transfer credit, there's nothing special. There are many other students that are Juniors who have way more on their resume. On the other hand, if the reader sees me as a Freshman, I would be immediately dismissed because employers want Juniors, maybe Sophomores at the youngest. It's a requirement.

I know this is the case because I went to a career fair and talked with representatives. They didn't understand my situation or even believe me until we discussed it for several minutes. After they understood my situation they were really impressed and pretty much offered me a job on the spot. I ended up not getting a job because the company followed up with our school's career connecting website thing, and on the website I couldn't change my year from Freshman so I didn't qualify for listing my name to the employer.

I am having a really hard time making it clear in my resume that I am even an acceptable candidate for Mechanical Engineering internships. Right now I have listed under my education with other info it says: ""Currently a Freshman with Junior standing; two years until graduation even though Elizabeth is only a First Year."" And then I list my community college stuff. Is there an easier way or clearer way to put this? Apparently what I have listed now is not understandable and the point does not get across.

I'm sorry this is so long and stupid. Any help at all would be greatly appreciated, and if you even read this I am very thankful.

I recently started dating a new guy. I like this guy a lot, we connect, he's into bdsm which is something I've always wanted to explore, he makes me laugh, he's my physical type, etc.

Here's the hitch: he lives an hour away, and my time is already stretched as it is. I almost did not go on our first date because I'm not sure I can commit much time to another partner, even if he is casual. I'm a graduate student about to start an internship, so that plus my two partners (and the fact that I'm a bit of a homebody with a polyfidelity slant) doesn't leave me a lot of spare time. 

Does anyone have experience with juggling lots of partners at once? what helped? What hurt? It is very important to me to not hurt or neglect my V partners at all, so even though I feel some NRE, I am not throwing myself into it. I'm wary of developing this further, even though I want to, because I'm afraid someone will get hurt. Thoughts?

Edited to add: I currently live with my V partners."

i'm going to graduate in May or after summer 1 this year with a degree in physical geography and certificates in water management and water quality testing.  i'm looking for an internship in central or south america, preferably 1 or 2 months.

i have some experience in the area.  i spent 2 years in panama growing up less than a mile from the canal, i spent a month in argentina/uruguay in 2010 and 10 days in belize summer 2011 working on a banana farm where i stayed with guatemalan subsistence farmers who didn't speak a word of english. while it was much more dangerous than i wanted it to be and i don't wish to replicate the experience, i would like to find an internship in oceanography, conservancy, ecology, water management, land management, pretty broad areas. the kind of work the peace corps does.  i speak passable spanish but i would not describe myself as fluent yet.  my preferred countries are argentina, chile, costa rica, panama, or uruguay. 

i currently have about 20 tabs open (already read) for summer internships in those places, but i am unsure where to begin.  i have heard a lot of internships are scams, and a lot of these would have me pay for them, which i have been advised against.

i would do the peace corps, but i am a medication-dependent anxiety sufferer and the places the peace corps would take me are not exactly well-disposed towards people who require daily, abusable medication. also the 27 month commitment is too much for me at this point. 

i searched for relevant threads before i wrote this up, not finding anything in the last 3 months.  any advice/relevant experience appreciated.  thanks."

She doesn't have a ton of money left to pour into this project, but she seems to really like the idea of French flaps. Not just any French flaps, but the more expensive kind that extend past the thumb edge enough to be able to be used as makeshift bookmarks.

I haven't found any self-publishing or print-on-demand options that even offer the flaps so I can get an idea of the cost. Does anyone know where I can look (beyond Lightning Source and Lulu) so I can at least get an idea of what she can and can't do when it comes time to publish her book?"

o2j0u,28,2012-01-04,"IAMA game design master's student whose first fulltime job is a game designer at an indie firm, AMA",awkm,IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/o2j0u/iama_game_design_masters_student_whose_first/,"Hey everyone, this is kind of a follow up to yesterday’s game industry AMA.  My name is Eric, and I’m here to give you a unique perspective on the games industry, mainly in that I have a master’s degree in game design and I work fulltime as a game designer at a small indie studio in NYC producing original content. AMA.

I can answer your questions about game design, game design education (mainly masters level), what it’s like at a small company/my impressions on big companies, and making games in NYC.

I have limited knowledge about the following in order most to least: programming, art, mocap, sound/music, AAA game writing.  I’ll do my best but hopefully I can defer some questions to my colleagues and friends.

**Background and Into Game Design**
I graduated from undergrad in 2009.  I majored in creative writing and minored in marketing.  I really wanted to go into advertising (art direction) but creative writing was the most creative thing I could find at school (predominantly science and engineering).  My school did little to prepare me for a art direction portfolio and found out too late.  It was also 2009 so any other job offer that might have been up for grabs were non-existent with the economy in shambles.  I took one game design course and played the role of an animator my senior spring just for shits and giggles.  It was a terrible experience and never wanted to do games ever again.

With nothing better to do, I enrolled in a master’s program at Parsons The New School for Design in NYC.  It was a MFA (fine arts, I know redditors don’t like us :P )in a program called Design &amp; Technology.  It’s multi-disciplinary tech program and luckily enough, I found myself in the game design track.  It was a lot of projects, theoretical game design, analysis, and experimentation.  I graduated from Parsons not even a year ago in May 2011.

During the time studying, I shipped a commercial game, struggled to complete a high-concept thesis game, met and spoke with tons of game designers and professionals, attended GDC, saw the rise of Babycastles, and watched the games industry in NYC get really interesting.

**Getting my First Job**
While completing my MFA, I interned at Muse Games for a year.  I went to a Unity3d Dev Night that was held once monthly.  I ended up chatting with some guy who worked there.  Later that week I emailed to follow up about an internship.  That guy ended up being the owner lol (networking skills are super important!).  I got it and before I graduated I shipped my first game after working my ass off.  Partially paid, so that was nice.  Worked there for a year or so before I graduated and then got taken up full time.

**Final Thoughts**
A lot of people asked if a degree is necessary.  The games industry is a trade/craft industry, if you can execute your good ideas then you’ve already proven yourself.  A degree is not necessary, but it is far from useless.  For example, I would have never gotten the connections I have now.  Well known people go to schools to teach, lecture, visit, and to recruit from.  If you’re successful in school means that you’re a team player and that’s by far the most important thing in the industry.  Nothing happens with one person... unless you’re an absolute genius.  Won’t rule that out.  So, there are options for you.  My suggestion to you is to learn some programming so you can execute some of your own ideas.  You’ll probably want to buddy up with a programmer anyway but knowing some scripting/coding is always beneficial.

I'm an american citizen, who has just completed a masters degree in Media Innovation from the NHTV University of Applied Sciences in Breda, NL.  I have applied for and received a 'zoekjaar' visa from the Dutch government that allows me leave to stay in the NL for one year...  However, I have decided that I'd like to live and work in the United Kingdom, preferably London.  The language barrier in the NL will always pigeon-hole (sp?) me as a non dutch speaker and I just feel that there are more opportunities in the English speaking country.  On top of that, I have a large group of friends and an SO in London, so I selfishly want to be closer to them, if I'm not in my home country.

I've just had an interview for a position with Sony here in London (i came over for NYE) and they really liked me and wanted to plan a second interview until they discovered that my visa only allowed me to work in NL.  I was had a feeling that the visa was NL-only, but have just received it a few weeks ago and hadn't really tested the waters yet to discover what I could and couldn't do with it.  Needless to say, it was devastating to hear that I've been stopped in my tracks on moving to London to be near all the people that I hold so dear.  :(  

Does anyone have any advice regarding what my options are?  I've got a masters degree from an NL uni, a bachelors from an american uni and really REALLY want to do this.  I can't be the only American kid looking for the chance to live and work in the UK, but sometimes it feels like it because no one can really recommend any viable solution.  

Hopefully one of you can give me some ideas... I'm considering BUNAC, but am afraid that after the 6 months internship that I'll be in worse shape than I'm in now, as i'll have already 'used up' my chance and the UK govt will be less likely to grant me anything.

Any help/advice is so much appreciated.  Thanks in advance.

I don't care who sees this, because maybe they need to see the truth.

I am a worthless piece of shit, and I don't deserve to live. I'm lazy, I'm weak, I'm stupid, and I treat the people around me like shit. I treat my mother like shit, and I don't even know why. She told me this evening that I'm being emotionally abusive...and she's probably right. She's pushes my buttons, and she's the only one I treat that way, but that doesn't excuse it. I'm always angry, always snapping, I honestly just want to be left alone but I live with her and my father (I'm over eighteen). I am moving out soon, but that doesn't make a difference. The damage is done. I have proven to my parents what a horrible, worthless human being I am.

I don't know what to do anymore. I've tried pushing through things, just ""being happy"" but at the end of the day I don't feel. I have a hollowness inside of me that won't go away no matter what I do. I had an internship essentially doing my dream, and I still wasn't happy. There was a job offer there, and I might have gotten it had I applied, but I chose not to apply for it. My mother says that nothing is good enough for me, but honestly I've just given up that anything will make me happy. I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me.

I honestly don't think I have the guts to kill myself, so I'm probably just wasting all of your time as well. I'm a weak-willed individual who will probably just continue living my miserable life because I'm too cowardly to do anything else. But I keep thinking of ""accidental"" ways to do it...things that I can't go back on once I follow through. I've lost almost everything that meant anything to me, and I'm so sick of living without it. I'm sick of being so weak that everything in my life has to be near perfect before I'm even slightly happy. I'm sick of being so weak that I have to rely on other people. I can't for the life of me think of any redeeming qualities about myself.

I don't see why I should live. I don't see why I have the right to live. If someone were to strike me down right now, it would not be murder - it would be a service. Right now I am a leech on the world, and I'm not sure anything I do can ever redeem myself."

**TL;DR**
First year: No friends, felt alone

Second year: met girl, girl broke up with me, got depressed, did bad in class, made a lot of friends who picked me up, then got kicked out of school, got back in, retook classes and did great

Third year: average, made a lot more friends, did okay in school, start drinking a lot more.

Fourth year: losing contact with friends because of living off campus (we all used to live on the same dorm floor), heavy drinking, doing terrible in my classes, bad anger issues, hopelessness feeling for school where I just give up for periods and then franticly try to get the work done, while getting bad grades on it 


I feel like I just cant do school anymore. I've never really liked school and homework. I'd rather just get out there and work.

(restaurant is in a tourist town and is closed in the winter) I like what I'm going to school for, but I just can't do good in my classes it seems... My failure in school leads to depression, which usually leads to me drinking more, and then raging, and then feeling depressed at how much of a fucking idiot I am. I don't know if its depression, anger issues, or both. I just want to get out of school and do something with my life and make my family proud. I don't want to put my mom, dad, and sister though that shit of getting kicked out of school again. Any advice would be appreciated, because I really have no fucking clue on where to begin...I don't have that depressed feeling all the time, it comes in waves, but when it does I'm the most unmotivated piece of shit in the world.



**Below is my original post. It's long.**

&gt;I guess this whole feeling can go back to my freshmen year. The first semester was just getting used to being on myself. Everything was fine in my books. Got along really well with my roomate, we did a lot of things together. Had three people I knew and would hang out with about once a week for a little bit. Not really friends at the time, but more like people you sat next to in class and would walk back to the dorms and talk too. 
&gt;
&gt;Fast forward to second semester, and I start to feel down. I had failed my math class first semester, and stupidly retook it, but skipped almost all the classes because I was just disappointed in me failing it. This was also the time I noticed that I was becoming more and more distant with my high school friends, and that I really only had 4-5 friends at college, and some of them weren't even really close.
&gt;
&gt;Anyways, got though the semester, failed the math class, and enjoyed my summer. 
&gt;
&gt;Second semester comes, and the beginning of the semester was great. I actually met a girl, and a few weeks later we were dating. This was also my first girlfriend, so that was an exciting time for me. Fast forward a month and a half later and we break up after spending thanksgiving meeting each others families. It came out of no where to me, and for some reason, even though we had been only dating for a month and a half, it crushed me. I became dopey for about a week, skipping almost all of my classes and falling extremely behind. 
&gt;
&gt;Unfortunately for me, I was blind as to how great our dorm floor was, and they quickly befriended me and pulled me out of my slump. I went from having 4-5 friends to having 20 almost in a weekend. Some of the people that helped pick me up are some of my best friends today. Although that social need was filled, my grades still sucked balls, and the only class I was passing was my math class, which was a remedial class and didn't even count in my GPA. I just blew everything off, saying I'd get a fresh start the next semester.
&gt;
&gt;Wrong.
&gt;
&gt;After going home for break and having a great time with my family and friends(Sister got married, 5 days later Christmas), I get a letter from school saying I was academically dismissed because my semester GPA was below a 1.0
&gt;
&gt;This letter fucked me up so much. I became crazy depressed at the time. It took me two weeks to write the appeal letter. I was also 40 minutes away from home at the time of this house sitting my sisters house and her pets while she was on her honeymoon. I remember constantly arguing with my mother on the phone, often times just hanging up in a fit of rage and sadness. (Un)Fortunately, one of my good college friends was also in the same boat, and together I think by talking to him, I was able to write the damn letter, and do the interview and get back into school.
&gt;
&gt;Spring semester comes and I do fucking great. I'm on top of the world, retook a lot of the classes I failed, solidified my friendship with my dorm buddies, and become a overall more social person. Instead of spending my spare time gaming, I'm out hanging with friends and enjoying life.
&gt;
&gt;I should also mention that I had a successful internship over the summer here.
&gt;
&gt;Junior year comes, I hang out and party a lot with my friends, probably because I'm trying to catch up with the first year of college I missed partying because I didn't know anyone. Second semester I turn 21, and even though I am drinking a lot and blowing money out of my ass on booze, I'm still doing relatively good in school. (although my 5k surplus I've had since I was a freshman is now down to 2k because of drinking, and careless spending on games (rock band and a TV).
&gt;
&gt;Now its this past semester, my senior year. I'm not in the dorms anymore, I'm living with 4 of my friends in a house. Whole new experience for me and I'm pretty excited for it. Living off campus is fine, but school isn't going so hot. Two weeks into the semester and I'm already failing my final computer science course. I'm spending 30 hours a week in the lab working on assignments for this class and I'm not even getting them done. We're also doing a HUGE group project for this class, along with the individual assignments, and I feel like I'm useless, and that I should just drop the class and change my emphasis so I don't have to take it. But then I realize that I'd have to go to school for another two years if I did that, so I decide to just man up and keep chugging. Things get a little better, and then they just go to the shit. I start doing bad, get frustrated, started drinking a lot more. I'd go out to the bars with friends and just come home and explode, going fucking apeshit. First outbreak resulted with a hole in the wall because I got pissed off at one of my roommates comments.
&gt;
&gt;After the first outbreak, I get a little depressed. Memories of that fall semester and the fear of getting dismissed hit me, and I feel like I'm just following that path. I have two big assignments and I just push them to the last minute. Somehow I pulled myself out of my hole and did the bare minimum on them, getting shitty grades, but better than a zero I guess. 
&gt;
&gt;While I'm trying to get a passing grade in this class, my other classes are taking hits. I'm taking the second math courses for the third time, and was actually doing fine in it, but after trying to dig myself out of the other class, I'm now failing that. Instead of actually trying I get in my mode that it's hopeless and just start skipping the class.
&gt;
&gt;Skip to the weekend before finals, my friends and I decide we're going to go to the bars. It's chilly, so I take a coat, and while downtown someone stole it. This has happened to me before, so this time I got really fucking mad. I had lost my roommates while searching for it, they had went home. I tried calling them to see if they had it, but they wouldn't answer there phones. Instead of being rational, I decide to build up this massive anger on the way home, and just go berserk. Smashing two lamps, two chairs, kicking a hole in the wall, and flipping the table. My roomates then call the cops on me right as I'm calming down, and then tackle me to the ground until I get there. (This just makes me angry again) They didn't press charges, but they wanted top kick me out of the house unless I agreed that if I outburst again I'd have two weeks to get out, and they would press charges.
&gt;
&gt;So now I've alienated 3 of my roommates, got a 1.4 semester GPA this semester and almost got kicked out again. What makes me even more sad is that I didn't even pass the class I worked my ass off to salvage, and it just ended up shooting me in the foot. On top of that because of my low GPA, I might be losing my financial aid, and my parents don't have the money to put me through school.

o24js,1,2012-01-04,I will tell my kids NOT to go to college and other rants from NYC Gen X Parent,[deleted],lostgeneration,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostgeneration/comments/o24js/i_will_tell_my_kids_not_to_go_to_college_and/,"I will be the first generation from my family to tell my kids NOT to go to college.
Let me start with some background info so you can see my reasoning.
My Parents were immigrants from Europe. Both have Masters Degrees. They lived with their parents until they came to the US. They left Europe because they could not make ends meet as Teachers and came to the US legally and are US Citizens. Because they didn't speak English this was a major block to their potential employment prospects. My mom was a housekeeper for years and finally moved up the ranks to that of Supervisor. She currently makes about $40K + benefits. My dad did various low paying jobs and eventually got into construction: working for a General Contractor for over 20 years. My dad has never made more than $35K and has never had benefits. It makes me sick to my stomach that even though he has all this experience he gets paid so low.
Like most people on here I was told the same thing about going to college and getting a good job afterwards! I had dreams about getting a good job so that I could help my dad retire early. I was so sick of my dad being taken advantage of that I was willing to support him if I made enough money. My dad is a very hard worker but he is just not a people person. There is no way he could ace any interview.
Even though both of my parents don't make much money [ New York City standards] they live what I would consider a middle class life: They have a house with a mortgage, a used car, cable tv and cell phones. They bought their house in Queens in 1994 and got a 30 year mortgage. They have about 13 years left or so on it. The house was $195K which was the most they could afford at the time. Same house today is about $450K. They were forced to buy outside of the neighborhood where we originally lived - Greenpoint, Brooklyn. If you are from NYC you know that area along with Williamsburg has exploded ! The price for a house now in that area is at least $750K and I am talking a piece of shit wooden house with no garage. There are condo buildings going up left and right all the time and I think the minimum is about $500K [ but I could be wrong depending on the size and # of bedrooms etc] Basically if you want to live as a family in that area be prepared to spend at least $750K.
OK back to me. So my parents thought that I should go to college and I would be able to get some good job and be better off than them. That was the plan. For my freshman year I went to a reasonably priced school called Hofstra University, which cost about $14K for the year back in 1995 - 96. I had to commute everyday and lived at home to save money. I also worked pretty much everyday to cover whatever scholarships and loans didn't. The commute from Queens to Long Island to school and then the commute from Queens to Manhattan to work took its toll on me and I decided to transfer the following year to a school in the city.
Here is where I started making major mistakes. I ended up going to NYU where tuition was over $25K if I remember correctly. Of course I got some grants etc, more loans but I was always short. Whatever money I made I was constantly paying it to the school to cover the tuition, books, etc. After I graduaded in Fall of 1999 I had student loan debt of approximately $50 - $60K. There were so many loans it was confusing to keep track of all this stuff. For the first few years I remember making only the minimum payments because my income was just so low. Finally in 2004 I made more money and increased my payments and by October 2009 I actually finished paying off my student loans. Yes it took exactly 10 years to pay it all off.
I have a Bachelor of Science in Finance. This is a hard major and people are supposed to make good money with this degree. Never happened to me. I do blame myself though - but only to a point. You see, I didn't even want to go to college and I really hated Finance after studying it. I only went because everybody including my very successful boss was telling me that is what I needed to do. I saw college as expensive and in the way of my job but I didn't listen to me, I listened to them. I started working at age 14 and at age 16 I met my main employer. This would become my employer for the last 17 years! Yes, I started working there at 16 in 1993 and finally lost my job in 2010. What's hilarious is that I was already there working at 16 yrs old so technically I didn't even need to finish High School! I could have dropped out in my Sophomore Year and nothing would be different. I learned everything I needed to learn on the job and eventually trained other employees.
After I got my degree I realized how hard it is to get a better job [i.e. with health benefits and opportunities for advancing an actual career] than the one I had been working at since age 16. I had no industry connections, my parents had none either. Actually I had 1 contact in the finance world and even he couldn't help me although I offered to work for FREE to get experience. He and other adults told me that most of the finance jobs go to the kids of the parents / relatives already working there at those firms. So the only other slots left were for students with very high GPA's that had managed to get industry specific internships at those firms. So if you didn't have that internship - you were toast. I would have gladly done an internship but that was out of the question because I was working to cover whatever the loans didn't. The big companies already had online recruitment then and after I submitted my applications I never heard back from any of them.
So here I was working the same job since High School and here come some recessions: 9/11 attacks, dot com burst etc. Had to take a second job during those bad years to survive. I even went to some computer retraining program on Sundays for several months during 2002 that was funded by the State. Didn't learn anything useful that I could use at work or to get better work. Turned out to be a scam school of some sort. I feel bad because the State was scammed along with the tax-payer and I.
So to sum this up I went to college but never got a job in my field or a remotely related field and never got a job even utilizing anything I supposedly learned in school. I was essentially cornered into holding on to my job until things improve. They never did. I was one of the unlucky graduates who fell through the cracks of the system. I was lucky that I did manage to pay off my student loans during the better years when the economy was good for all companies even the shitty ones. Then I lost my job the following year. And I ask: What the fuck happened? I just wasted 10 years of my life working and paying off some shit that hasn't done me any good. Negative return on investment.
During the busiest years at my old job I didn't have dinner with my family for 2 years! I only saw my kids in the morning when they went to school and then on Saturday and Sunday nights. It was like having ""visitation rights"" with your own family even though we lived together.
I want to puke everytime I see some ad in the subway for such and such college. Pictures of smiling kids with Graduation Caps. Such false hope !
One thing that I want to clear up is that I am not jealous of anyone else. I am pissed because others have figured it out before I did. I believe that everybody who works hard and is interested in working should be able to get a good decent job. And if you want to be exemplary then be a star performer and get the best compensation. But the average people don't even get a fair chance at average pay. Everything seems below average with no benefits and no stability.
I tell people that I totally fucked up when it comes to the whole college thing. I have a laundry list of what not to do. I am convinced that college is for few people either the priveledged ones or the lucky ones or the dirt poor ones that can get a full ride. College is not for the average person with no connections -- only to be saddled with debt.
You know, when it was time to go to college, everybody said ""don't worry, just go, you'll get that fantastic job later"" Now that we're out ""oh no, there was no guarantee of a job"" . Hey - Fuck You ! You should have explained that more clearly in the beginning and I would have never went. You should have explained that some people get good jobs with signing bonuses but some graduates get crappy leftover jobs and they're underemployed perpetually. There will be incredible competition for jobs - translation: there are NOT enough good jobs for everybody. There's no rhyme or rhythm. I feel like the whole jobs situation is like a Ponzi Scheme. The people at the top are the lucky ones and cash out. It's a combination of connections, luck and street smarts. I obviously have none.
Update on characters in my post: That 1 contact I had in Finance: Lost his job at Bear Stears when Bear crashed, now lives and works in Asia. His wife lost her job at Lehman Brothers, works somewhere in NYC doing something similar to her old job, their relationship soured from being apart, most likely will divorce in the future. My ex Boss: his company finally closed in 2011, getting divorced. My Mom: After she lost her job in 2008 [ at the place she worked at for 25 years] she rebounded and found a similar position in 2010, still there $40K + benefits. Dad: no change, still underpaid, still no benefits. Myself: A year ago I got my security guard license but couldn't find any legit guard work. Zero. Currently selling things online and in person to barely make ends meet. Studying for a CDL to see where that goes. I don't think I will ever use my degree for anything. It's too late and I don't remember jack shit anyway because I never had the oppurtunity to use and build on what I had learned.
Am I going to tell my kids to go college? Hell fuckin NO."

You see this year I'm going to get my shit together and beat this thing. This would seem contradictory, but I'll get to that later. I would like to share my story with someone. So here goes. 

It all started when I was about 15. I got beat up by a huge mob of people aging from 18 to in their 30's for no apparant reason. Afterwards I got scared of people and started to seclude myself from others. I lost myself in digital worlds and avoided interaction with others at all costs. Especially bars and clubs. 
After about a year of this. I was apathetic. I didn't feel anything in particular for any given situation, person or activity. I was the emotional equivelant of a brick.

When I hit seventeen something changed. I discovered Metal. It started off mildly with bands as metallica (Fade to black in particular) but after a while it developed into bands such as Immortal, Dimmu Borgir etcetera. I began to revel in mystisism, wicca, the black arts and things like that. Not practicing these arts mind you. Just learning abou them. Metallica's Fade to Black made me feel emotional about something for the first time in about a year. Metallica's Sanitarium made me feel like I was not alone. Dimmu borgir made me feel empowered. This music pulled me through the first rough patch. 
After a while I went to college. I got to know a few people who had similar musical tastes and I started haning out with people again. I still speak to them on a daily basis, because they live far away from me now. There were also some girls, who stepped on my heart and kicked me back down the slope I had been climbing ever since I started (the dutch equivelant) of college. I dropped out, and got a place for myself because people pissed me off again. 

I worked odd Jobs, Garbage man, postal service, store clerk. The jobs you don't need educations for. After a while I decided I would go back to school, I went to school to become a social worker, with the (stupid) idea the the things I would learn there would help me get my life back on track. 
The teachers there told me something that rocked my world. One half said that they thaught I was authistic, the other half said they thought I was gifted. I pulled the plug on the endeavour because I didn't want either Lable. I went back to odd jobs untill Januari 2011. The economical crash made it harder for me to get jobs without an education. Now at age 23 I came a'knockin' at social services. Explained my work related situation and told them that I wanted to do something constructive. 

They shipped me off into a project in wich I would orientate myself in the metal industry. Shipbuilding in particular. I found that I liked welding and ran with that for a while. Eventually I got an ''internship'' at a company wich specialised in offshore construction. I flubbed that because ever since ''the incident'' I've had trouble communicating with people face to face. And back to the downward spiral it was. Also, during all this I've been borderlining alchoholism since 18 years old. 

Where were we? Ah yes; the downward spiral. From august through december my alchoholism has spiraled out of control. I didn't give a flying fuck about anything anymore. Visiting my family for the holidays started breaking the spiral a bit. And I decided to go out on newyears eve. See some friends (Wich amazingly I still have) etcetera. 
So skipping to new years eve. 

A bit of wining and dining transpired. And after midnight we went to some sort of house party. Most of what happened there Is a blur, but it was good fun. Untill walked home with a friend, my bike was parked behind his gate. I made a fool of myself assaulting a streetlight, and he videotaped it. 
Waking up the following morning it dawned on me. This shit has got to end! So to repress the hangover I had what was left of my own beer supply, about cans. Aside from that I've been sober, and to my suprise I don't have any anxiety or illness from the sudden drop in alchohol levels in my blood. Aside from not being able to sleep at normal times. 

Usually I'd go to bed around 3 in the morning, and wake up at around 1 in the afternoon. I've been living this way since I flubbed the internship. So, tonight I'm pulling an allnighter, in an attempt to reset my day night cycle. And I will get my shit together. I will get tested for authism and/or being gifted any way, should my medical insurance cover it. If not, maybe social services can set something up. I shall make this life my bitch, I shall stand proud as ruler of my life.
With that I take my leave of you, for now. And I hope you enjoy the read. 
I also hope you might have some pro tips for me, and that my story was usefull to you in any way, should you be dealing with similar problems.

There's bound to be some grammar and spelling orders in here, but I don't want to change anything, so I will not proof read this. I hope

o1zt4,1,2012-01-03,Don't know where to go - Did I just potentially ruin my entire life with one phone call?,fraudisbad,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/o1zt4/dont_know_where_to_go_did_i_just_potentially_ruin/,"Hello Reddit, This is either going to blow over and be nothing at all, or I may have just been caught attempting identity fraud with a bank. 

So here's the story. I work for a small company as an unpaid intern for my older brother and his friend. Because it's such a small company, I am put in charge of paying off the company credit card online. Because of the holidays and my own negligence, I forgot to pay the card for the month of December. So when I realized this, I decided to call the bank to try to reverse the late fee for that month. I felt like I couldn't tell my brother or his friend, because this was my mistake, and I need to fix it myself. After waiting for 25 minutes for an operator, I give them the name of my brother's friend, my boss. Turns out my brother is the one who has power over the account. So I literally pretend to be my brother to try to get them to reverse the late fee. But a couple of security questions in, I realize I'm in over my head, and I won't be answering these right. So finally the operator asks me a question I don't know. It's obvious to the operator from the silence that something is fishy. She tells me over the phone, that if I am not who I say I am, that she'll have to report this to the fraud department. I was in too much of a socially awkward penguin phase at this point and my mind can't think of a thing to say to get me out of this. She states that they take fraud very seriously. So I simply apologize to the operator and say that I won't do this again. And that my brother was out of town but that I'll have him make this call instead to do things right. The operator at this point actually gives me the number to the right department to deal with late fees (apparently I called the wrong department...) I apologize again, and I hang up.

So, clearly I attempted to commit some form of identity fraud, even if the intent wasn't malicious, this is clearly some level of illegal. Also the bank and anyone else involved won't know or necessarily believe what I was trying to do. So Reddit am I to expect a huge mess from the bank and authorities soon? Or do you think nothing will come of this. If my brother, the person I was attempting to impersonate does not press charges, am I in the clear?

TL;DR: Got caught(?) committing identity fraud talking to a bank, cause I forgot to pay a bill and wanted to dispute a late fee..."

I get my diploma this month in Computer and Information Science. I'm a decent programmer, but I've absolutely 0 real world programming experience. My last year of school was really horrid in terms of advancing my programming knowledge - the hardest class I had was an advanced programming in JAVA class which consisted of copying and pasting code that was far too complicated for any of us to understand, let alone imitate without directly copying. I also haven't been doing many programming projects on my own time.

I don't know what job I should be looking for, now, much less where to find them. I was hoping there'd be internships related to CS/programming on CL, but I haven't found many. I did find an internship that sounds awesome (http://tinyurl.com/6ut95fq) but I'm not sure if it sounds too good to be true or what :/

So here I am about to finish my last 5 credits needed to graduate as a Math/Econ double major from a major Canadian school. My GPA is piss poor so far (2.4) and I want to work in finance. But then again so do the other million people with my GPA. Makes sense to have a GPA cutoff. I really did slack off over the last 3-3.5 years but I also had to hold many shitty jobs through school to pay for it. My transcript is really inconsistent, I have A's, B's, C's and D's over my courses. 
My work experience: last summer I did some market research for small business startup, tried to see what I could apply from the stats classes I've taken etc. Did a small marketing intern gig before that at RBC under a financial advisor. 
I'm trying to score another summer position hopefully bigger and better this time but its a sad realization now that I see no big bank will ever take me. There are plenty of good students with 3.7+ and better experience than I do, so that gives me literally 0 chance to even get an interview. 

So I ask, what do I do? Am I screwed for life? kill myself for being such an idiot during undergrad? My only hope is I finish strong and not be such a dumbass in my last year. 
Networking seems to be the obvious answer but where do I start? I don't know anyone in the industry except the FA i worked under at RBC, I already tried him and have an ok reference I suppose. Cold emailing? Boutique firms? Basically my end goal is to work in the risk management side. 
Oh and also I pretty much killed any chances of grad school in the process. "

o4jtp,1,2012-01-05,Need Advice about Applying to Law School! Try for Feb LSAT or Take ANOTHER Year Off?! HELP ME!,[deleted],LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/o4jtp/need_advice_about_applying_to_law_school_try_for/,"Ok this is my situation
I graduated from my undergrad in 2010. I took the next year off and did NOTHING (just worked in a shitty retail position, traveled a bitc, etc). This year I am currently doing my Education Degree as a back up in case I don't get into law school for September 2012 (now looking quite probable).

I did my LSAT in October 2011. Half way through I bombed my LG section, and I knew it right away. I freaked out and was only able to get through half of the next section, which was LR. I canceled my score half way through the test and left. Depressing.
I then studied a lot and was PTing at around 167 right before the December LSAT. However I went in there and majorly screwed up my RC section. RC was usually my best, I almost never got more than -3 on any section. This time? -13, worse than i have EVER DONE including my very first LSAT PT over a year ago.

So now it seems that I have two options

A ). Gun for the Feb. LSAT. The schools that I applied to will still look at the Feb LSAT, but obviously I will be in a bit of a disadvantage vis a vis admissions. Biggest con of doing the Feb LSAT would be the fact that this will be the THIRD time that I've written it and thus I won't be able to do it again until October 2013. Also I don't know if a month is enough time to really make sure I get a great score, especially considering I'm in the midst of my teaching internship

B ). Take another year off and have the time to prepare to write it in June. Hopefully get a great score and apply for September 2013. I was thinking of traveling next year and teaching in Seoul if I didn't get into law school for 2012. Con of this is, obviously, waiting another year. Also there is no guarantee that I will do any better in June. I have been studying for the LSAT since March and I have barely improved and now run out of resources. I really don't know what the hell I can do to get better.

Give me your thoughts! I hate to put it off ANOTHER year (since I'm already two years out of my undergrad) but at the same time i don't want to rush into the Feb LSAT incase I bomb that one as well. I seem to have a history of really fucking up on one section and ruining my score during test day, while scoring just find on PT's.

Oh P.S: My GPA is also not very good. My education degree is an undergraduate degree, however, and if I wait to apply for 2013 I'll have another six courses to add to my GPA (that i will be doing over the summer semester this year).

P.P.S: I live in Canada and would be applying to Canadian schools."

The individual works for the client in Europe currently. I'm trying to figure out the best way to go about this. 

I've ruled out a J-1 since I don't think we want to deal with the designated entity registration for a single person. 

Given the complexity of a H-3, I'm tempted to nix that one since I think most of the trip will be hands on productive work rather than training as that requires. 

So I've turned to a L-1B (Inter-Company Transferree with Specialized Knowledge). Any thoughts or experience in getting one of these? Any problems with using this visa for this purpose?

Appreciate any thoughts you guys might have. "

So she want to know who took it to maybe go to the pawn shop to buy them back. She kept the jewelry locked in a box inside a drawer in her bedroom. With the key (foolishly) in the same drawer where the box was. There are 4 suspects.

#1 The recurrent maid: she had a history of taking spare change she found lying around whilst cleaning. When this was discovered she was explicitly told ""...if you find any change please put it in this jar."" After which she stopped. She cleans the house every 3 days. And is somewhat in an on &amp; off working relationship with the family. After the holidays &amp; the incident, she had yet to return. Thus becoming the obvious culprit... until she came back. So, she was informed of the robbery and told about some ""investigation taking place soon..."" and was reported by the mother as ""not nervous"". She's been the only house keeper, except for...

#2 The one off maid: She was hired 1 time, when suspect #1 wasn't assisting to her expected schedule. Her one recommendation only hired her to do her ""outside"" work, plants and such. She has come back after ""the incident"". And is still looking for a steady job.

#3 The adult worker: the family has a ""home lighting business"", installing indoors &amp; outdoors lighting, shades, etc. They have people who help them install and visit the different locations. This worker has been doing jobs with the for the past few months. But he did put up a few lights in the family's main bedroom (where the box is). And at one time was all by himself in the house.

#4 The young worker: A young (20s) working intern. He has been working with the family for almost a year now. They lend him the office truck and also visits sites for installations &amp; repairs. He also did some installations in the main room (where the box was) and was by himself at one point or another.
These are all the possible suspects, since they all at one time had the opportunity.

Lately I've been in a rut.  I've been doing alright in my studies (3.5GPA) but that's all I've been doing, which is what is making me feel bad. I feel like I should be looking into internships, but the few that I have looked into require alot of CS related things (like multiple languages) that I haven't been studying. I've been meaning to teach myself Python and Java (in addition to the C++ that I've been learning in class), but I find it hard to get motivated.

I was wondering if there were any computer engineering related internships that I could be looking into because the few that I have been looking into are mostly CS related, which I can do, but I prefer some thing more geared toward my major. I'm thinking that if there was a clear goal (like an internship) to work towards, I'd have more motivation to learn more things outside of class.

Also am I the only one that finds the requirements for application for internships pretty high? Like multiple languages, project experience and  leadership/extracurricular... I can't be the only one that hasn't done these things...

First, some brief history. I'm 23, graduated from an IIT with a bachelors last year. I'm currently working with a reasonably good MNC firm in Bangalore. The firm works in the same field of engineering I have a degree in, and offers a very good opportunity to do well. 

I am 100% firm in my determination to join the IAS. I've written the exam already this year, and I'm awaiting results, but I really don't expect to qualify given my comparative performance. Initially, I had thought I would write the exam in parallel with my job. I did do that this year, but at the cost of practically having no life. More importantly, it's become very clear to me that I am spending large amounts of time doing something which will be of no learning value to me later in life. I could also use more time to study for next year's exam. 

So, I want to quit my job, and intern or work part time at some reasonably good public policy thinktank. That way, I'll do something I'm passionate about, get more time to study, and perhaps even have some free time. So, my questions to r/indians, 

1. Could you recommend any policy thinktanks, preferably in Bangalore?

2. What do you think of the idea of quitting a nice, secure, interesting job for mostly unknown and uncharted waters? 

3. General comments, brickbats, bouquets and opinions are welcome.

I had a largely terrible time in school and felt uninspired in most of my classes.  As a result I never really got around to going to college.  I took a ceramics class at community college, and then kind of just floated off for awhile to study on my own.  My high school offered a lot of AP classes when I went there, so I took a lot.  I got bad grades in most of my classes but I scored very high on all of my AP exams and on my SATs.  I graduated as a National AP Scholar with perfect 5s on 8 different exams.  I think I'm the only one to graduate from my high school with that honor and certainly the only one in my class. I got scores of 780 and 790 on the writing and english language sections of the SAT, as well as a couple of perfect 800s on my SAT IIs.  But my grades were pretty awful.  I got Fs my senior year in a few classes, even though I was the only to score a 5 in those classes.  I barely managed to graduate in the end on grades and attendance.  I won awards for my school paper in regional competitions but barely scraped by with Ds in the classes.  

So now I'm looking to go back to school and I'm really, really interested in the St John's program and I'd like very much to go there.  But I'm starting to realize all I've got is some impressive test scores and a horrible high school transcript, and not much to show for the last three years.  I got an internship at a company which later turned into a paid position I held for awhile, but my bosses ended up under serious investigation and I don't know if I should even put that down as experience.  I certainly can't ask for a letter of recommendation.  I was also the captain of my school's debate team, during a period where we won our annual cross-town debate with our rivals all 4 years, but the teacher-sponsor for the team recently got fired from the local paper over a plagiarism scandal so I don't even know if his recommendation is good either.

So I'm wondering if I have any kind of a shot applying now, or if I'll need to go back to school and prove I can get good grades.  What do you think?"

Basically there are a few NGOs and humanitarian groups that are looking for ""legal interns"" in Africa, but I'm not sure how strictly ""law-focused"" the position would be (compared to, say, an internship with the DA or something). Seems to be more document review and interviewing individuals. The NGO positions look very compelling, and it's really what I'm interested in, but I don't want to spend my summer doing something that doesn't really count as a 1L internship.

I know this post is confusing. If anybody has any anecdotal experience or advice, please post!

That's okay, but I'm looking for advice from people who work in the creative industry that could give her a helping hand. She's incredibly passionate about these things, and I'm really hoping there's a way to turn one of them into more than just a hobby.

For example, she's hand drawn some really great illustrations recently, but has very little experience of using Illustrator, Photoshop etc which seems to be an industry requirement right now. Would it be a good idea for me to purchase this stuff for her, and a Wacom tablet?

On the clothing front do people ever get into this without going the traditional route, ie degree, unpaid work for a year or two as an intern, then working your way up? Would it be a waste of time if created a web site for her to sell her products? Similarly with the art thing, is it worth me setting up a web store?

Also, is there a subreddit for growing up? or how to grow balls, man up, and get a fucking job? I feel like a piece of shit, and my life isn't even that bad. Thanks for reading."

I (24m) met her (21f) on OKCupid 3 months ago.  She had been seeing other guys she met online. We had sex on the first date. She's into BDSM and being submissive and rough sex, rape fantasies, likes to be tied up, told what to do, enjoys being scared. She admittedly has some issues and ""crazy"" tendencies, but is on Zoloft and keeps it under control.  I let her see other guys the first few weeks, even encouraged it. She claims not to have had sex with any of them and eventually deleted her OKCupid account and stopped seeing others.  We started taking pictures and posting on r/gonewild. She got a ton of positive attention (like 5000 karma off of her first 6 pics).  She really started enjoying it, asked her mom for a webcam for xmas. She started camming and made $130 her first hour.  She made a few hundred more the next couple days, but then calls me and tells me she got wasted with a girlfriend who works at a strip club as a door girl and ended up stripping and had a lot of fun.  I didn't mind until she admitted that she had regretfully gone too far and had sex in the VIP room for $200 and gave the manager a BJ for $50.  So that threw me way off.  Then she did it again the next night, had (protected) sex with 2 guys and gave (unprotected) head to maybe 6 or 7, she couldn't remember.  At this point, I was pretty disgusted, but I could tell she was hating herself for it.  Her plan is to strip (without putting out anymore) for the next few weeks before she starts her internship so that she can buy a car and then she'll be done.  I'm afraid the easy money is going to be too much for her to quit so easily.  She has stripped 2 nights since and has made $600 but is noticeably sadder and detached.  She says she doesn't want to do it anymore but continues to.  What should I do?"

**Edit: How my cover letter looks below**

Basically my current cover letter is:

Hello, 

I am interested in x position. I am a graduate from X university with a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science. (this is where I get a little unsure of how to approach it). During my time at X university, I also wrote as an editorialist/opinion columnist for the school paper, in which my columns would often broach the subjects of income inequality and the labor field. 

I also interned at the State House, for X (X) of X during the 200x legislative session. In my capacities there, I researched much of the legislation that was pending, including a controversial bill about puppy mills, and local industrial troubles the community was having. Additionally, I created an excel spreadsheet to collate all constituent surveys for the state X party.

Background: 22, female, in college


I'm sitting here absolutely terrified of the next couple days.  I did pretty terribly this semester and I don't want to tell my parents in fear of yelling, name calling, and hitting.  I've been applying for jobs and looking at apartments and loans and on-campus housing but I don't think I'll be able to move out as quickly as planned.



My parents are good in a lot of ways - they help friends out, they are charitable, but they have never 
been...emotionally available.



They are stuck in their ways, racist, and very controlling. When I was a kid I remember not allowed to do normal kid things, like sleepovers, because they think ""white Americans"" are sick people and can't be trusted. They both are South Asian immigrants. My dad came here to go to school at an ivy league institution and they are both are conservative; this also meant I was not allowed to have guy friends over. When I started high school I wasn't allowed to go to parties/hangouts for this reason (It took a lot of convincing but I managed to fix this). I am not allowed a boyfriend (although I have had a couple behind their backs starting college). 
They don't see why I should need to be independent. I was not allowed a small job during high school I don't have my license; they say I can just ask them if I ever need anything. My friends have been giving me driving lessons when they can. Since I live at home now I am confined to the parents' rules and curfews (can't be out past 9 even if I'm on campus, no parties). I don't drink or do any recreational drugs, and I've never gotten into serious trouble, or trouble at all. Usually my parents' plans trump mine to I'm forced to sit at someone's house and stare at a wall because heaven forbid I'm not in their sight. I can't be home alone for more than 12 hours, so if they are invited to stay at a friend's place over the weekend I am dragged along even if I have no business being there.



They are harshly critical.  My dad always has had high expectations of me in terms of school; I remember them telling me they were ashamed if I didn't meet up to their expectations. By the time I got to junior high I had huge test performance anxiety. I have never been an unmotivated student; when I'm not feeling terrible I get straight As...but my bouts of anxiety have increased over the years and it effects my grades.  My parents reactions certainly did not help. When it got really bad (this pat year) I started losing a considerable amount of weight and having panic attacks but my parents had their own diagnoses for those too. It is always that I don't care enough or study enough or that I should ""just turn off your so called thoughts"".  Whenever we have an argument and I raise my voice out of being upset I am met with a slap to the face. I am threatened by a slap or worse if I don't behave like they want.



By the time I was a senior in high school none of this changed; in fact it got worse. I remember that the school counselor wanted a list of good attributes from my parents about me so she could better write recommendations for my college apps and they told me they didn't have a single good thing to say about me.



For my first two years of college I went to an out of state university that I fell in love with. The only reason I was even allowed to be so far away was because my dad had a friend who was a professor there and they found an all-muslim apartment for me to stay in so other people could keep tabs on me. Despite this I was able to lead a fairly independent life. I had a job relevant to my degree and a good social life, which I had never had before. My anxiety worsened though and I ended failing a couple classes in those two years. I tried to explain to my parents how I felt and about my anxiety but I was told that anxiety and depression don't exist, and that if I wanted to see ""real"" problems that I should go to a third world country. They think that antidepressants and therapy unnecessary and ""turn you into a zombie"". Their solution was to take me out of college (they did not allow me to have loans in my name) and make me go to an in state college while I lived at home. This was summer of 2010.



I was very distressed by this, but my dad had opened up a chance for me: If I finished all of my gen eds at a community college in one semester (fall 2010) I could go back and I would be able to graduate by the summer. Motivated by this, I took more than the allowed number of credits and got straight As. I was so happy and I had started planning to go back to my old college and applying for readmission. However, whenever I tried to talk to my dad about this he ignored it until I was running out of time and I confronted him. He then changed his mind; he said I could go back if I attended a local 4 year college and took many high level courses (more than I had ever taken in one semester) and get straight A's. I was crushed but I still had that opportunity. So this spring 2011 I worked hard, found an internship, despite having massive panic attacks and losing about 15 pounds. I started seeing the school counselor, going to group therapy and taking medication for my anxiety - all behind my parents' backs. All during the semester my dad kept reminding me about my past failures...like that was supposed to be motivating or something?  They started betting that I would fail.  I ended up taking two incomplete grades for 2 classes with the understanding I could work on the final projects during the summer. My parents gave me so much shit for this. There was a point during the summer where they sat me down every day and yelled at me for being a failure on purpose and saying that I didn't intend to graduate. I would be terrified when my dad came home, not wanting to hear it again. I was not allowed out of the house, the couple times i did go out in those 3 months I was yelled at and called lazy. They made me drop my internship opportunity because it was too far for them and I couldn't drive there (again, no license).  I kept seeing my counselor while I could but it got harder and harder to apply the coping techniques I was taught in therapy. Unfortunately I ended up failing one of the classes and taking a C in the other. This Fall semester was difficult for me. I felt like I had been pushed too hard and I'm just not motivated any more. 



A couple of other things my dad did to 'help' me: child block on internet, can get to barely anything other than gmail; threatened to delete my email/facebook/etc account by force and have my computer usage monitored (this terrified me as this was my only way to talk to friends), because apparently I waste too much time on the internet and he thinks that is the issue.



I failed half of my classes and I am trying to care but really I just want out of this house. I haven't told them about my grades because I'm scared of them and my own reaction. When midterms came in I had a panic attack and went to see the emergency counselor and called up my friends if I could stay over for a couple days...I had never felt so terrified and hopeless. I don't want that to happen again. I don't want to be called names or be taken out of school or be hit. I don't want to be confined.



This fall I started looking at jobs and planning to move out...parents would never approve of course so I will have to do this when they are out of the house. I haven't found a job yet so I'm hoping that I get a room in a dorm on campus. I am currently on that wait list and I was told that I would know my assignment by this week, however they're behind and when I called them up they said I would know if there was a room for me in the dorms next week. I have been putting off the grades discussion for a while now and I don't know how long I can keep it up. I was hoping to never have to tell them ""I failed because I am angry and scared and resentful towards you"" but since housing is taking so long I don't know what is going to happen. I was hoping to move out next week. I just don't want to be in this environment any more. I am an adult and I want to be treated as such.


TLDR: My parents are controlling and critical people, and I want out. I have taken steps to remove myself from them but I still feel hopeless."

On [Day 10](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/lxv3z/10_incredible_sex_defining_goals/), I outlined some goals that I was trying to use NoFap to help me accomplish.

To reiterate, NoFap is just part of the equation. Don't expect magical results purely from not fapping. The path to success is paved with hard work. NoFap just gives you some extra motivation and energy to do that hard work.

Here are the goals I outlined 63 days ago, the progress I've made with them since, plus a new goal I've set for myself.

* **Move out of my parents' house and become financially independent.**

Success. I got a full-time paid internship at a great company and I've moved out of my parents' house into a nice apartment. When I interviewed at the company (after 2 weeks of NoFap), it seemed the people who interviewed me could really feel my energy and I believe that helped them decide I'd fit in. Next, I need to plan a budget and stick with it.

* **Move to a city (New York? Boston? SF?) and make the most of city living.**

I moved to Boston. I like it here so far. I've been on several dates in the city but I feel like I should explore the city more and get better acquainted with it. Plus, I want to join some groups/clubs/meetups or whatever to meet more people.

* **Become more social and socially adaptable. Become a ""contributor"" to social situations.**

I enjoy the presence of other people a lot more than before NoFap. It's easy to just vibe with other guys, and it feels good. A few guy friends of mine who I hadn't talked to in a while met up with me one night, and it was chill. Now we're hanging out again, because we all just... I dunno, produce good vibes.

* **Speak with charisma, authority, and virility.**

I feel more comfortable expressing myself with my voice. I rarely have to ""warm up"" mentally before talking on the phone to a girl or something. Plus I've gotten a few comments that my voice is deep and rich. To continue this goal, I'm going to listen to Roger Love's Vocal Power and practice the techniques. (Roger Love was the vocal coach for Billy Idol, Anthony Robbins, and others)

* **Get in sexy shape and build muscle.**

Not much progress on this front yet. I want to start going to the gym at my work, or maybe do P90X now that I have an apartment with room to exercise. Perhaps join a rowing club (I used to row crew) in Boston once the weather gets warmer.

* **Cultivate meaningful relationships with both women and men, expanding my social circle.**

I've made a few friends since I've moved to Boston, but I would love to make more and have a real solid group of friends. Not really sure of the best way to fast-track this one. Maybe I'll find some meetups or something. Any suggestions? I'm still partying with friends from outside the city, and have introduced them to some of the friends I've made since moving.

* **Sleep around and have amazing sex with beautiful, interesting women.**

I know everyone gets into NoFap for different reasons. Sleeping around happens to be a goal for me. I don't think there's anything wrong with it if you stay honest and don't lie about what you want with a girl. Two weeks into NoFap, I broke it off with a girlfriend who was a drain on my energy and expected more of me than I was comfortable giving her. After ending that, I went about 5 weeks with no female contact. I got back in touch with my manhood and what it's like to be totally free (that's still something I'm pursuing more). Now I'm currently dating (and sleeping with) three girls. One I met online - breaking up with the gf motivated me to try OKCupid. The other two I met through friends. I feel close to all of them and I share a little world with each of them. They all know I'm dating other women. As far as the sex goes, I haven't had trouble getting hard anymore like I sometimes used to. Oh, and one of them is coming over tomorrow night to cook me dinner wearing just an apron :) Still, I want to continue dating more women until I find one I want to be exclusive with.

*****

Since I originally wrote down those goals, I've started a journal that I write in every now and then. It's mostly a catalog of positive experiences and how I achieved them, and where I plan on taking my life to next. I've written down new goals, most of which are sub-goals of the above ones. But here's a new one:

* **Achieve a clear mind**

I got a book [How to Meditate](http://www.amazon.com/How-Meditate-Practical-Kathleen-McDonald/dp/0861713419/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1325728420&amp;sr=1-1) from my sister, and that seems like a good place to start for this one.

*****

Finally, to all the newcomers, stay with it! From my experiences, it's clear that NoFap is simply a part of living a life that you control, wield, and direct.

Also, write down your goals. And under each one, write a few actionable steps you can take to start fulfilling that goal. Then do them. Course-correct once you get some done and see where you're going. It's that simple.

I want to grow in 2012",pmm621,business,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/o638s/please_help_im_a_serial_entrepreneur_that_needs/,"I just realized I put SOO much text (sorry).  If you don't want to read my entrepreneurial background (life story), please just see the last two paragraphs for a more in-depth description of my question.  Thanks for ANYYY help Reddit! 

All of my life, I have had crazy fun idea's on how to make money, and start businesses.  Most of the idea's I would start to plan out too much, and I would never get done.  Then, I thought, O.K I need to look more into Entrepreneurship, and learn from books.  Books told me I should create a business plan for the idea, and then tried to pitch it to investors and businesses.  A friend and I had an idea about offering car insurance as a company incentive for industries that are very competitive.  We literally worked years on the business plan, and getting everything all together.  Once we had everything together perfectly, we got together with someone in UPMC's financial department only to be told it was a good idea, but if they liked it they would just steal it.  (SHIT!)  Since this didn't work out at all, I said forget it, I'm just going to get into any idea I have.  Luckily this was at the same time Nintendo decided to come out with the Wii, and royally under-stock inventory.  I started buying and selling Wii's during this crazy time, and making good money (so this is how you do it, I don't need a business plan at all).  

From here, I invested in a horse, started importing blue-tooth headsets and gucci necklaces, and started creating t-shirts for different collegiate groups.  I became a serial entrepreneur within 6 months, and learned everything I was read about was bull shit!  Also, I learned that you can work on all of your ideas at the same time, and hustle at all of them.

That summer I filmed a feature length movie, and sold products online to help fund my summer.  (www.laidoffthemovie.com)  From there, I kept up with different online sales businesses until I graduated from Penn State in May 2010.  

Now I had a dilemma, either go after a business idea I was very passionate about, and had been working on for my whole college career, or trying to create an automated income to survive?  I figured I could possibly get investors to invest in my business plan and idea, but didn't want to go through the trouble I already faced with my first attempt.  I also thought it may be a better call to create some income first, and then I wouldn't have to worry about financial stress of investors.  Lastly, I had just read ""The Four Hour Work Week"", and Richard Branson's autobiography ""Losing My Virginity"", and thought this was the best call.

I stayed at Penn State during the summer (nobody is there), and brainstormed for a month about what to do (after taking a nice 10 day graduation present to myself trip to Ireland).  I created another online company re-selling ionic foot detox baths, and bulk orders of vuvuzela's, and occupied my time with those.  I learned how to create online presence, manage inventory better, and this time I actually went through all of the legal aspects of creating a business: tax ID number, fictitious name, etc.

In February, two friends and I created a shuttle company in Panama City Beach for spring break, and had a blast while making some money.  During this time though I didn't put enough time into my two online businesses, and not thinking to automate better, lost a majority of the long worked for progress I made on these.

From there I worked with creating different transportation companies in Florida, and then went out to California to start an amusement park ticket broker company with my brother and my best friend who worked with me at Panama City Beach, my other friend went to Peru to start a clothing company (www.indiesourceabroad.com).

I have now been working with my brother and friend on this ticket re-selling business and it has been great.  We have 4 employees, and are able to get them to work on some tasks.  I also work a lot on this clothing business with my two friends.  

Throughout reflecting over all of my business ventures, I see myself as a creative entrepreneurial visionary who gets tied down by the day to day tasks.  Every business that I brainstorm and get on paper has perfect goals, and plans for success, but if I am doing day to day tasks on any business, it seems these don't get done.  I would love advice on how to manage multiple businesses, and pretty much just brainstorm the business idea, plan out everything that needs to get done, and find a way to get it to the place it needs to be.  I think VA's and interns could be a great way to start (I've never used either), but would love all advice on how people have overcome this.  (I know focusing on one business all the way through towards automation or selling it is probably a good call, but I'd like to see other options first)

Thank you sooooo much for any help, this would honestly be a great thing to figure out for my future success, and I would be indebted for life to anyone that can help out.  I wish you all great success in 2012, and would love to give any advice I can as well"

Person Number 1: Had internship with this person, published 1 paper with him in systematics and another one to come. Understands my love of behavioral ecology, has read my scientific writing samples and seen my scientific talks. Closest thing to a mentor for me. Not a local to the area of the internship in question. (side note, I wouldn't be able to provide a stamped letter for him because of distance, which I feel is common cutesy)

Person Number 2: Took 2 classes with him, got A's in both (one was a graduate class, and I am an undergraduate). I am conducting my senior honors thesis AND masters research with him. Published 1 paper with him, another one to come in systematics. Also work as an RA in his lab under an NSF grant. Haven't talked with him about my goal to enter behavioral ecology. Doesn't know my personality as well, has never seen my scientific writings or talks. Is a local in the area of the internship in question.

I would generally expect for a typical urine test which I can easily break for 2-3 weeks to be clean.  However, I'm a little worried that whatever company gives me a job will do a hair follicle test.  I am most likely being paranoid but my best frient applied for a job at Sesame Place last summer and claims he did not get the job because they wanted to do a hair follicle test for drugs. He has buzzed hair (like me) and shaves all other hair off of his body or at least enough to be shorter than an inch and a half which is apparently how long they said a hair needed to be to complete the test.  He claims that due to the short time limit they gave him to grow his hair to this length that he would not be able to do that.  My friend lies a lot though and I tend not to believe him on a lot of things but this is something I would not want to risk. I have buzzed hair that is clearly shorter than an inch an a half however, my leg and armpit hair will meet the length and I do not plan on shaving it.  

The last time that I toked was Christmas (Dec 25, 2011) therefore I would be good to go by March 25, 2012, but I don't really want to spend 3 months of my stressful spring semester at college without the trees to help my anxiety.  I haven't had a problem with not smoking but I have been looking into detox methods and there seems to be a decent amount of special shampoos and conditioners that can detox your hair follicles.  The serious ones seem to be around 70-80 USD, which I do have the money to spend on it so that is not a problem.  

I ask for you help ents.  Has anyone had previous experience with using any of these? I look for all of your insight on companies/brands to check out.  I hope you have all had previous success with this and can help me.  I'm going to keep researching but I figured you all would know best! Thanks!

The program that I want to apply for is a 4 hour flight from my boyfriend. There aren't really any comparable programs in his area, so my alternative would be to try and get a job near him. He also is unable to move for the moment because he is still working on his bachelor's. I know that grad school will have a long-term benefit over getting a job right away (at least, I hope so... can anyone speak to how useful a master's really is?). At the same time, though, I'm hesitant to ""waste"" 2 years of time with my boyfriend, the person I'm going to marry, while we're both young. I'm nervous that I'll be alone in a big city, missing out on experiences with him, and that I'll regret it. It's not that the time apart will hurt our relationship; it's just that I'm worried that it'll be 2 years of unhappiness (especially for me), and I'll wish that I had just gone for an entry-level job or internship near him and had more carefree good times together. I don't want to feel like I wasted our time together as young people by being away. At the same time, I'm concerned that if I opt for a job and then decide I want to go to grad school later, it'll be much more difficult to get letters of recommendation. Has anyone been in a similar situation? I feel like someone with more life experience might be able to give me some advice, can't talk to my parents about it (because they want me to pursue my career at all costs, without considering my concerns).

So, I just finished another drama after awhile, called **New Heart**. It was mainly about thoracic surgeons and their struggles in their department. Indeed, in the Western world, thoracic surgeons are more popular, and the department is very difficult to get into. However, this drama showed that in Korea, it is not such a popular field because of all the losses and stress that comes from heart surgeries. The drama started with an interaction between [Choi Kang Gook](http://wiki.d-addicts.com/Jo_Jae_Hyun), a well known thoracic surgeon and [Lee Eun Sung](http://wiki.d-addicts.com/Ji_Sung), an intern at a countryside hospital. After a heart incident with a patient, ES decided to go to Kwang Hee Hospital in Seoul to enter the thoracic department. Meanwhile, KG was requested to return to Kwang Hee since they were going to open up a new Cardiac Center soon. This was when ES and [Nam Hye Suk](http://wiki.d-addicts.com/Kim_Min_Jung) were chosen as first year residents in the department. Initially, HS was very cold and only cared about getting the job done, but after witnessing ES's caring nature and passion towards the patients, she became a much kinder person. She also started falling for ES, but he did not want to start a relationship with a co-worker, since it may not end well and then it would become awkward since they had to remain colleagues. The rest of the drama revolved around ES and HS becoming closer, hospital politics, and various medical cases. It was an interesting drama because though there was not too much romance, the medical field interests me, so I found this to be a really good drama. It had plenty of dramatic scenes and lots of laughs as well. I would definitely recommend this drama to anyone looking for a good medical drama. I give this drama a **4.5 out of 5 stars**. Let me know if any of you have watched this drama, and what you thought about it!

A few comments about the dramas (**SPOILERS**):

- I really liked ES's jolly personality/optimisim

- The catheter insertion was hilarious (for the secretary of the state person)

- His first time in the hotel was hilarious

- HS cries too much!

- Not sure if they should be running around the hospital so much... hmm...

- MM was sooo annoying!

- Hospital politics is too much! *sigh*

- Hug from behind made my heart beat from a scene after a long time!

- Way she stopped talking to him to get his mind off the pantient was cute

- I love all the idol dances... Wonder Girls/Big Bang

- Aww nerve damage... luckily ambidextrous

- When KG had to go back... it was so sad

- 4th year resident and MM make an odd couple

That's it for now.

I'm off,

I know for a fact that she is still in love with me, and that she is looking for the easiest end to the pain. I have explained this and countless other things too her.  Aside from email me and her will have no contact for a week, and then she will make her final decision.  I have dated many girls and would not have gone through this for anyone else, she is literally the perfect girl for me, and I the perfect guy for her. I trust her completely. She is not using me and I cannot let her go if there is still a chance. Oh, and she has an internship this semester, so she won't be here with me for college again until summer.

We are both 21, her long distance boyfriend is significantly older. Me and her have been together for 3 months like this now.  I'm not sure how to make her see that the easy option isn't the best one. He knows shes cheated and she knows shes cheated. In their three years they never had anything as special as me and her had in 2 months. I have to make her see that he is not the right choice."

o566e,1,2012-01-06,Is this really depression?,aaaashc,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/o566e/is_this_really_depression/,"Hey Reddit-

So I'm in college (sophomore) and I guess the sophomore slump has hit me hard. I ended up scraping by with a 2.5 GPA for the semester, including a D in one of my classes. This is extremely odd for me, as I usually set my sights on a 4.0. I knew I was taking hard classes, and along with extra currics, maybe I stretched myself too thin? In any case, during the semester I would have these moments where I just didn't care anymore, or just feel like life was just kicking me in the face nonstop. The best thing that I could do was just keep doing whatever I was doing, and I figured that the motions would eventually set me straight. I was also trying to transfer into my university's business school, so I had to get good grades and keep everything in good shape.

It's winter break now, and I have ended up spending a lot of my time at home, preferring to be bored on the internet than catching up with my friends. I only ever leave the house to go to the gym, because I guess that is the only structured activity that hasn't gone down the drain yet. When I'm alone, I just think about how crappy my grades are, how I am still single, how I haven't lost any weight, how I don't have a job or internship, and how much effort it will take me to suck it all up to go back to school in a week. Basically, I just want to give up.

I don't really think this is depression, other than the fact that I feel somewhat lazy/heavy, and that I just don't want to talk to anyone. I don't really want anyone to know what I'm going through, so I try to have a somewhat normal schedule. 

So am I just in a funk? Sorry for blabbing."

CLARIFICATION: As a result of being overworked, I barely feel the thrill I once felt of studying what I love, and the future seems daunting.  Changing career paths sounds like a viable option, but I fear feeling like a failure, even if it means loving that work more.

o53kl,2,2012-01-06,How to negotiate an insulting salary...,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/o53kl/how_to_negotiate_an_insulting_salary/,"First I would like to disclose that I feel very fortunate to have been offered a full time salaried position in this economy.  I know there are others who are jobless and would love to have any job.

With thats said, today I was offered a full time position and need advice on how to negotiate my salary and what my next steps should be.

A little background: I was unable to find a job in my field (finance) when I graduated like many others.  I took a different job because it paid well (starting $50k) and worked in an unrelated field for 2 years while still searching for a job in finance.  I landed an interview at a reputable and prestegious financial company, and due to my bad interview skills and ""lack of experience"" although I had two finance related internships while in college, I did not get the position.  I was, however, offered an internship instead.  Eager to learn and wanting to get my foot in the door, I took the risk and left my full time salaried job to take this internship position for pretty much an hourly minimum wage in hopes it would lead to an employed position. I have been ""interning"" for the past 6 months, and I put that in quotes because for the past few months I've taken on all the responsibilities that the permanent employees have, but on intern pay.  I was told in November that they were interested in hiring me in January but they wanted to train me and give me full time work effective immediately.

Today I got the offer.  I wasn't expecting as much as I had been making at my previous job but I was thinking it'd be in the same ballpark because when they had initially phone screened me for the full time position, they asked what my current salary was and I told them it was $52k.  The offer was for $37k.  This I found to be truly insulting.  First off, the hours required are long, 9.5 hrs a day, M-F.  Secondly, they know I left my full time position at $52k to take on this internship for dirt money.  Thirdly, I don't know why, but they felt it was ok to train and give me full time responsibility when I hadn't even been hired yet.  Fourthly, I have two years professional (but unrelated) experience, have my degree, and have been out of school for almost 3 years now.  Finally, my friend who works there doesn't even have her degree yet, but she was finally hired after interning there for 2 years and her offer was greater than mine.  Oh also my benefits won't kick in for another 3 months because it's a like a trial period even though I've already been interning there for almost 6 months.

I have to give them an answer tomorrow.  I don't want to take the position, but I will because I have nothing else lined up.  I was womdering how I could negotiate my salary without coming off angry at the offer."
o531k,9,2012-01-06,"Paul Against ""the Family.""",SyntheticSylence,Catacombs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Catacombs/comments/o531k/paul_against_the_family/,"I have an internship this year in a United Methodist church in the rural South.  It's a fairly small church, with about 90 people attending any given Sunday, but steadily growing.  They've focused their efforts on building a large youth program.  The idea, as it's been explained to me, is that if they get the kids in the church with games, food, and other fun things, they also rope in the parents.  Two for the price of one!  They also have a fixation on building a million dollar ""family center.""  Certainly, I thought, this is an odd thing for a religion founded on a celibate homeless man to do.

Paul, himself, was celibate and suggested that others should be as well.  ""It is perfectly all right to marry, but it is better not to get married at all."" (1 Cor. 7:38)  Christianity was radical in that it suggested that not having a spouse is a perfectly normal and fine way to go through life.  In fact, certain people are called to live such lives as a witness to our hope.  We do not need sons to live forever.  We do not hope in our children to carry on our family name.  We don't need to procreate to continue to grow.  Our hope is in Christ, who has defeated the powers of death and will come again to set the world to rights.

This was also in direct contrast to the logic of Empire.  Augustus was rather concerned with the decline in ""family values.""  After all, the family is the foundation of the state (especially in Roman times when the *paterfamilas* was a sort of emperor of the household) and the more families, means more children, which means more soldiers to fight for the *pax romana.*  This logic has not gone away.  When politicians tell us about the importance of the family, and how it is the foundation of our civilization, this is what they're getting at.  We need healthy families to produce healthy children so we have healthy adults to run our nation.

I don't think the church is meant to support the state.  And certainly a strategy built bribing kids with fun so we can drag their parents long is more cynical than hopeful.  But I also think our present fixation on ""the family"" is what Paul would call a ""work of the Law.""  The works of the Law are those ethnic markers by which a Jew could be said to be in the covenant.  The most obvious of these being kosher and circumcision.  The idea that a Christian would have to become an ethnic Jew in order to be """"delivered from the present evil age"" was absolutely repugnant to him.  Indeed, he called it another Gospel!  

&gt; You irrational Galatians! Who put a spell on you? Jesus Christ was put on display as crucified before your eyes! I just want to know this from you: Did you receive the Spirit by doing the *works of the Law* or by believing what you heard? Are you so irrational? After you started with the Spirit, are you now finishing up with your own human effort? Did you experience so much for nothing? I wonder if it really was for nothing. So does the one providing you with the Spirit and working miracles among you do this by you doing the works of the Law or by you believing what you heard?  Understand that in the same way that Abraham “believed God and it was credited to him as righteousness,” those who believe are the children of Abraham. But, when it saw ahead of time that God would make the Gentiles righteous on the basis of faith, scripture preached the gospel in advance to Abraham: **All the Gentiles will be blessed in you. Therefore, those who believe are blessed together with Abraham who believed.** **Galatians 3:1-9**

The works of the Law functioned as an instructor, given to the Jews in order to prepare them for grace.  And now with grace, deliverance does not come from being a Jew, deliverance comes from belief in Christ crucified.  So that ""It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me."" (Galatians 2:20) and ""There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus."" (Galatians 3:28)  The message is universalized.  Christ is for all regardless of status.  All that is asked is that you repent, believe, and are baptized.

And Jesus, himself, was celibate.  His mother was impregnated out of wedlock.  And to make matters more complicated, Jesus' mother is also his wife (so to speak).  This is, after all, why she came to represent the Church.  She says the ultimate ""yes"" to God, and becomes the bride.  But I digress.  The point is that often churches are inhospitable to single parents, or single people in general.  I know this is a big problem in the church I am working.  I know this is a common problem across all denominations.  (Perhaps it has something to do with our evangelism strategies?)  Family values is, with this reading, unbiblical.  This is because the nuclear family is a symbol of middle class respectability.  It is a status symbol.  There are perfectly Christlike people who don't bother to get married (in fact, as we've seen, that makes them all the more Christlike), as there are Christlike people who through circumstances they could have helped or couldn't have helped, are single parents.  This, of course, is not to say marriage isn't an ideal witness to Christ's love for his church.  But it is to say that another witness is our love for our own who are broken by sin.

Too many people seem to think you need to be married with two children (brother and sister, preferably) in order to be a good Christian, and we need to knock it off.

While I could go the way of dish washing and fry burning, I've invested a great deal of time into my passion: coding.  I'm not any sort of code guru and at the moment I have no formal training.  I've worked extensively with java, even getting 'paid' to teach it at a summer program but I have never really undertaken (and completed) a large or complex project.  Right now I'm trying to get up to speed on C++ largely because it looks to be a good place to start.  I genuinely hate web and mobile development as I view the platforms to be too much of a moving target to go after at this point and if i stick with the basics I can easily adapt down the road (right?) though I have the ability to do it (I currently manage two separate sites).
I just started looking and stumbled upon an internship opportunity for a game company caught.  Unfortunately they indicate that they are looking for full year interns and while I could maybe pass as having the proper skills (algorithms and c++ knowledge) I'm afraid to try.  For the record, I'm not even a gamer.  I enjoy and am reasonably familiar with the company's product and I like game development for the challenges (I've been messing with SDL in C++ and JOGL recently).  It is, however, not a career I'm dead set on yet and I'm told that its wildly competitive given the influx of crazy-gamers-who-want-to-make-games.

Has anyone else gone through this before?

He said he'd take a look at it, and that sometimes the magazine does hire unpaid interns. I haven't heard back from him. I called to follow up once, but it was just a voicemail; is it stalker-y to call again? I'm getting the feeling that they aren't that interested or they would've called me back.

o77rq,0,2012-01-07,Need some fitness advice.,[deleted],Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/o77rq/need_some_fitness_advice/,"Current: 21 6'2'' 205lbs 24% BF  
  
Im looking for any advice you might have as well as critiques of my diet and workout plan.  

First off a little back story of what I've done.  
  
During this last summer I had an internship out of town where I worked out 4-5 times a week and ate very healthy. I started at 230 and by the end of the summer (10 weeks) I had dropped to 220.  
  
Once school started I started to slip and ended up hovering around 220 until November. During November I did ketosis while working out for a few weeks and ended up at 200lbs. I ended up slipping again over the holidays and lost a little bit of muscle but still ended up at about 205.  
  
 
So heres my question:  
I want to start gaining muscle but at the same time not gain any more fat or if possible lose some more. I've always had the body type that builds muscle fairly easily but with that I also tend to get chunky if I dont watch what I eat. Im just not sure that my routine is going to work out the way I want. My plan was to do ketosis again to lose more fat and get around 180-190 but at the same time I DO NOT want to do that diet again if I dont have to.  
  
Here are some pictures of me right now.  
[Side](http://i408.photobucket.com/albums/pp166/rje946/2012-01-07151010.jpg)
[Front](http://i408.photobucket.com/albums/pp166/rje946/2012-01-07150943.jpg)

What I want to do above all else is have pecs. They're about 50/50 fat muscle right now but Im wondering if I start gaining mass will my pecs fill out? or do I have to lose more fat before they will look good? Im assuming I need to do more upper pec exercises to kind of lift them up? maybe im stupid though idk haha.  
  
Im hoping that If i just build mass then everything will fill out and ill look a lot less pudgy. Does this sound reasonable? or should I do ketosis to lose another 10-20 lbs and THEN start building mass?  
  
I was planning on working out 4 days a week in the afternoon before dinner with 1 or 2 days of cardio. I was looking at different exercise plans and found this one:  
[Workout Plan](http://www.collegebodybuilding.net/mass-building-routine.html)
which I'll be following unless someone has a better suggestion.  
  
As far as diet I was planning on eating something like omelettes and oatmeal for breakfast, these packages of tuna/salmon for lunch, and then for dinner mix it up as like a recovery meal with a protein shake with various fruits and healthy snacks throughout the day. By recovery meal I just mean non diet stuff that is probably not too healthy that has some carbs and fat.  
  
Well thanks for reading this and if you cant tell I have no idea what I'm doing and need a lot of advice. Im not really sure what else I should put but if you need more information just let me know."

Please give me some feedback, I really want to get an idea of how my writing is at this point. Thanks in advance!
______________

He’s had a comfortable life so far. The world was his for the taking since the day he was born. He just had to wait until he could walk, until he could talk, and finally until he was old enough to move out of his parents’ house. He told himself that was the time he would start living his life. 

He moved out into the cheapest thing he could find, since he knew it was going to be temporary anyway. He was going to wait until he got better grades, got better accreditations, so that he could get a good job, so that he could get more money, and for that day where he could move into a nicer place and really start living his life.

So then every day he waited at the red light, sitting and waiting in his car to get to work. He could have biked to work, but he did not know how to ride a bike. He used to want to learn, but his parents told him to wait until he was older, and now he was old enough to drive a car so he had no need to learn anyway. 

At work, he waited for his manager to retire so that he could get promoted and get paid more. Then, he could finally afford to move out to that nicer place across the street. He worked harder than the rest, and his work came first. He decided having friends now could wait. *Why have friends now when better friends would come later*, he thought. 

He waited for money, he waited for a nicer place, and then he waited for the right woman to share the things he waited for. So he waited for the beautiful secretary that sat across from him to ask him out on a date. She smiled at him every day. *What is he waiting for*, she thought.

He decided to wait two weeks before he would make his move, to make sure she was the right one. Two weeks later, he decided she wasn’t worth waiting for because she started dating the new intern. He decided that there was going to be a better woman than her, but he just had to wait just a bit more.

He had more money, so he put it in stocks. He would wait for his money to grow. Maybe he would move into a bigger place, and get a nicer car. He planted seeds in his garden so that he could wait for them to grow. Once they grew, his property value would increase by 1.8%. 

Once he found the right woman, he would wait one year with her before it was time to have kids and start his family life. His real life.

Right now, he just had to wait for his cold to subside. This was a long one, but he could wait. He was waiting in his bed when he heard a knock on the door.

*Maybe this is what I’ve been waiting for.*

“Well, I’m here!”

A sudden feeling of dread clutched at his heart, draining the strength away from his legs.

“But… but why are you here?” he exclaimed in a panic-stricken voice.

“Oh, hmm? Not expecting to see me so soon? Weren’t you waiting for me?”

“No! No… no…” said the man, tears trickling down his face. “I was just waiting to get started with my life!”

“Oh, well. What did you expect? What were you waiting for? You didn’t go after life, which means you were just waiting for me.”

“No… Wait!”

“There’s no more time for you to wait.” 

Only then did he realize that by waiting for life, he had waited for death.

I applied for an extremely sought out specialist graduate programme at a very reputable firm. Ultimately they only accept five people for this programme. I just had my phone interview which went amazing, and I am waiting to hear back. My dilemma is that I applied for this position thinking that my father's company in London could sponsor me and I could get a Visa through them, but after more research I am not sure if that is possible. Even though this company that may potentially hire me has the means, I know they are not looking to sponsor anyone. Despite the fact that they know I am an American citizen and I do not have a EU Passport, but are still considering me for this programme.

I was wondering if I was asked to partake in the next round in London, and ultimately hired is there a way I could apply for a tourist/working visa once I land in the UK?

I know I am extremely qualified for the job, and this is the only thing standing in my way. Unfortunately Tier 1 visa's are no longer applicable. I am working on my Greek Citizenship, which should take about 3 years at this point. Any realistic advice or a smart way of accomplishing this!? Like if my dad's company takes me on as an intern?

o705x,5,2012-01-07,"My ""I'm tired of looking for jobs"" rant.",[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/o705x/my_im_tired_of_looking_for_jobs_rant/,"Forgive the bluntness, but I'm really sick of looking for jobs. I graduated from college december of 2010, as a late 20's graduate, who paid their own way through college, working the whole time, taking an internship in my desired field, while still attending classes full time after the 40 hour work week at my internship.

And I didn't expect to have jobs thrown in my lap, and I still don't. But I am so sick of the (already tedious process in itself) browsing all the generic places to look for jobs, sending my resume out like a shot in the dark, hoping someone somewhere offers me something. I've applied for unpaid internships on top of working the crappy jobs I was working this last year just to have some form of personal progress to a field worth working, to no avail. 

And the crappy jobs I've had, it amazes me that some people seem(ed) almost surprised that the economy is going into the toilet. The minimum wage has barely been touched in decades, while cost of living goes up and up, even for the two miserable retail jobs I had last year, you have to know that for every position you apply for, whether it's toilet scrubber or fuck, even president,900 other people have all ready applied, sent in their resume, etc. 

The first shitty job, I learned every aspect of this retailer, went to their ""training"" thing to be a better person at the part of the job I did, all for less than a dollar above minimum wage. And when I found out someone who didn't know or do a quarter of the jobs I did made a dollar more, their response was ""well you shouldn't know that"" and ""we only give raises once a year"" and I believe they even said they don't give raises that were more than that. This same employer proceeded to then ask me if I was ""dedicated"" to this less than a dollar above minimum wage job, when I took my second job, and that jobs hours conflicted at times with this job, a second job that paid a dollar fifty more.  On top of that, the GM literally yelled at me and an employee from the vet that is inside our business because as I was walking by she gave me info on my pet, and then proceeded to just talk for less than 20 seconds, despite the fact that at my wage, I could sit there and do nothing for an entire hour, and they'd still be out less than a 10 spot, god forbid I converse with a coworker, why that's almost 20 cents of lost time.

The other job was slightly better for a while, but even there, I know when business slows you have to cut employees hours, but i went from working 6-7 days a week and forty plus, to working a 2 hour shift. All this at a business which when I was hired mentioned they were opening I believe 50 new locations in the next year. Maybe you shouldn't be opening 50 new locations if you can't afford to pay employees for 2 hours of work. 2 hours necessary to make sure that everything is ready for an entire 13 hour day of business.  And it's always interesting to me to work a job where the district ...whatever unique name they give them.... making certainly somewhere in the 60-100k range tells the GM making 35-50k a year to tell the back manager making about 30k to tell the hourly employees who if they even got 40 hour weeks would only make about 13k a year, that the labor costs are way too high. In that situation, I know a real quick way to trim about 150k of fat.... 

Additionally, after several months of working often 6-7 day weeks at this job, picking up every single hour I could get, offering to help in any way possible, when I told them after a week where I got 12 hours that I was going to move out of town to stay with the rents to save money, unless I could get a raise and more hours (because where I was living wasn't cheap), they told me they could give me, maybe,...a quarter raise maximum. Now I understand all the basic arguments about economics, worth of labor, etc...but there has to be at the same time recognition that in 2011/2 what can a quarter get you? As Wyclef Jean once said, NOTHING, motherfucker. If I even got 40 hours a week at this job, which I didn't, that'd still only be 10 dollars. So to offset the cost of living, I can now have an additional 40 dollars a month. Maybe. Sorry I'm not jumping like a pig in shit for your trickle down pennies falling.


I admit, I am particularly (some would say VERY) recalcitrant, and a stubborn prick at times. But how much do you have to be shit on for less than a livable wage? Wages in this country are a joke. If I were making a decent wage, enough to pay my bills, eat food, and not live in squallor, god forbid, I could probably say yeah, some bosses are dicks, and deal with it. But that's where we are a society. Anyone who DOESN'T view 8 dollars an hour as a positive thing is somehow an entitled piece of shit. It's like that Doug Stanhope bit ""How much is it worth to have your life suck? 13 bucks an ow'a..."" I don't want a handout. I've never gotten any aid, any unemployment, all I want is to work 40 hours a week at a wage where I can actually keep my lights on.

/end rant.

I'll go back in my little corner and listen to my angry david cross and doug stanhope bits

**TL;DR** I'm a stubborn recalcitrant and at times a prick, but begging and groveling to shithead managers for 8 bucks an hour? What fucking planet is this?

o6kj7,11,2012-01-07,Friends abandoned me. Help?,[deleted],MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/o6kj7/friends_abandoned_me_help/,"Hey Reddit. Have I a tale for you. 

I go to school in a city. A relatively big college, and at the start of this story I had a few close friends, but two friends were closer then everyone else. We'll call the first close friend, Friend A, and the second Friend B. Everyone else I know through conversation or school. 

I'll be trim with the details. Friend A is a notorious jerk (he has classified himself as a douche, but a good kind of douche) from overreacting to going too fast with girls too quick, as well as lying and other things. I've been friends with him for a little over a year or so. I was friends with him because I felt bad for the guy, and knew that other people were shitty to him, so being there for him would be the right thing to do. Friend B had been friends with him for a long time, since junior high, and said he's been like this for a long time, and like me, he was nice enough to put up with him.

Introduce Girl A. She's really cute and nerdy and awesome. (she's a fellow redditor) I know her from last year, and she knows me somewhat. Friend A takes notice of her more and starts talking about how cute she is. I 'take notice' her as well. During this, Friend A goes through constant 'likes girl + creeps + goes too fast = ends bad' stages. 

Needless to say, Friend A and Girl A don't end up. Friend A goes way too fast, does many shitty things (but doesn't realize it right away) Girl A mistakenly leads him on a bit and that turns into a mess. Throughout this, he realizes I like her, and I can see he's bugged out about it. About a week or two after I tell Girl A that I like her (after we flirted, but still after her and Friend A didn't end up together) and she likes me. She's liked me for a long time. We start dating, and currently, we are in a relationship (which is awesome).

However. Shit changes. Friend A is pissed off, and he has a right to be. I have a talk with him and he says a bunch of things, and we talk it out.. at least I thought we did. I promised not to be couple-y about it and not to rub it in or mention her. I keep my promise. He starts messing around with this girl (we'll call her Girl B) I had a short fling with. 

Friend A and Girl B are messing around, and Girl B tries to end it, but lo and behold, they end up in a relationship a short while later. During this, he talks about how pissed he is at me and how bad of a friend I'm being behind my back. I confront him about it and he says how shitty I'm being, how he really feels, a bunch of stuff. I tell Friend B this, and he agrees that Friend A is being shitty (Friend B and I would rant sometimes about A's antics here and there. Sidenote: Friend A &amp; B and I have two other friends, which I will call C &amp; D) 

It's still pretty rocky after the talk. Friend A doesn't talk to me as much anymore, Girl B and her friends (who I used to get along with rather well) act weird around me, and act offstandish to Girl A. Friends A, B, C, &amp; D, along with a few other friends, have a party and don't invite me. They go out and neglect to invite me. But after shit had cooled down, finally Friend A talks to me and it gets a little better, even though I'm still wary of him and our 'friendship'. 

Cue winter break. Girl A and I are doing great. Talking about our relationship and dating and awesome shit like that. Friend A and Girl B seem to be doing good too. But it's weird, Friends A-D don't try to get a hold of me at all during break, or speak to me (except for one time for Friend A &amp; B. A, I wished him happy birthday, and B, I asked him how he was doing. Short conversation.) Finally, the tipping point, Friend C makes a post on FB, saying something to the point of me not being their (A-D's) friend anymore, and Friend B agrees. 

At this point, I say how close me and Friend B had been. We were friends for a year, but we talked and had deep conversations and I said how I depended on him and how we were best friends. And this happens.

So now.. I have no idea what to do. Break is over in a few days. (We're a state school, western state, but I won't say which because that's silly anyway) I don't have that many close friends, my really close best friend being far away in an internship. I talk to other people, sure, but they weren't as close as Friends A-D. 

What do I do? Am I being melodramatic? How can I get closer to new friends? Sorry if this isn't the right section.

TLDR; Lost friends who I thought were close, who I could depend on. At a loss. Help?"
o6k7i,0,2012-01-07,Shitty friends &amp; no where to go. Help?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/o6k7i/shitty_friends_no_where_to_go_help/,"Hey Reddit. Have I a tale for you. 

I go to school in a city. A relatively big college, and at the start of this story I had a few close friends, but two friends were closer then everyone else. We'll call the first close friend, Friend A, and the second Friend B. Everyone else I know through conversation or school. 

I'll be trim with the details. Friend A is a notorious jerk (he has classified himself as a douche, but a good kind of douche) from overreacting to going too fast with girls too quick, as well as lying and other things. I've been friends with him for a little over a year or so. I was friends with him because I felt bad for the guy, and knew that other people were shitty to him, so being there for him would be the right thing to do. Friend B had been friends with him for a long time, since junior high, and said he's been like this for a long time, and like me, he was nice enough to put up with him.

Introduce Girl A. She's really cute and nerdy and awesome. (she's a fellow redditor) I know her from last year, and she knows me somewhat. Friend A takes notice of her more when she gets a haircut and starts talking about how cute she is. I 'take notice' her as well. During this, Friend A goes through constant 'likes girl + creeps + goes too fast = ends bad' stages. 

Needless to say, Friend A and Girl A don't end up. Friend A goes way too fast, does many shitty things (but doesn't realize it right away) Girl A mistakenly leads him on a bit and that turns into a mess. Throughout this, he realizes I like her, and I can see he's bugged out about it. About a week or two after I tell Girl A that I like her (after we flirted, but still after her and Friend A didn't end up together) and she likes me. She's liked me for a long time. We start dating, and currently, we are in a relationship (which is awesome).

However. Shit changes. Friend A is pissed off, and he has a right to be. I have a talk with him and he says a bunch of things, and we talk it out.. at least I thought we did. I promised not to be couple-y about it and not to rub it in or mention her. I keep my promise. He starts messing around with this girl (we'll call her Girl B) I had a short fling with.

I tell Friend B this, and he agrees that Friend A is being shitty (Friend B and I would rant sometimes about A's antics here and there. **Sidenote: Friend A &amp; B and I have two other friends, which I will call C &amp; D**)

o6k4a,12,2012-01-07,Going through a rough time right now. What do you bronies do to cheer yourself up?,allthatsleftareponys,MLPLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/MLPLounge/comments/o6k4a/going_through_a_rough_time_right_now_what_do_you/,"Sorry if the topic isn't very pony-like. I came here because I didn't feel it belonged in the official subreddit. Sorry if there's a better place. (Throwaway because I don't know. I feel awkward asking this and don't want it tied to my main.)

Like the topic said, I'm going through a rough time right now. I've pretty much run myself down to my last nerve, and in a few months I'll be doing an attempt at an internship. An internship that I feel like, if I don't obtain, means I've wasted the last five years of my education and may as well start living on the street now due to not having a foot in the door to even get an entry level position. [](/flutterfear ""Coupled with my parents already saying ""Get an apartment or an alleyway if your degree fails,"", I'm at my wit's end."")

Needless to say, I feel like I'm about to go insane over how depressed I've been the past few months. I'm pretty poor, as well, so I can't do anything crazy. But what do you guys usually do to cheer yourselves up when life has you down? I want to try other things than sit around and listen to music or play a video game, because I feel like they're wastes of time now. But I'm so run-down and exhausted that I can't think of anything creative on my own.

Sorry again if this isn't the correct place to ask something like this. I'm just curious. (And maybe a little bit desperate.)

**TL;DR**: What do you all do when life has you down, other than listen to music or play video games?

*EDIT*: I'm heading to bed, and logging out of this account for the night. I appreciate the ideas given so far, and still would not mind hearing more. Thank you all, as well, for willing to be helpful/understanding. I will check in tomorrow, but if I don't reply to you, please don't take it personally! I will still see and be thankful, even if I don't re-log into this account and make it vocal. Thank you all again. Bro-hoofs all around."
o6jy6,1,2012-01-07,A Guide to a Career in Investment Banking,FuckYouImFunny,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/o6jy6/a_guide_to_a_career_in_investment_banking/,"I wanted to make an investment banking guide for future undergraduates (maybe graduates) who would like to go into investment banking. I know this would have helped me *tons* if I read this before I started hunting for a career in Investment Banking. Other users, feel free to call me out on things you believe I am incorrect on, add more information or ask questions.

The topics of discussions will be:

* Background
* Essentials on your Resume
* Networking &amp; Getting the Interview
* Getting the 2nd round (Super day)
* Professionalism

***Background***

As a background, Investment Banking is basically the crux of what a Finance position is. This includes Mergers &amp; Acquisitions, Restructuring, Financial Advisory &amp; Services, and many more. You do not need to major in business to get into Investment Banking. I have seen people with a Music major, History major, and all sorts of different majors go into Investment Banking. What you do need is a stellar GPA - 3.5+ is normally the requirement, but it can vary. Anything closer to 4.0 increases your chances for an interview.

At the lowest level of an Investment Bank, you have Analysts that do the brunt of the work - pitch books, modeling, talking with clients, etc. Associates are the next level up, and have more responsibilities but I believe do the same work. Then you have Vice President's, Directors, and Managing Directors. Managing Directors work the 9-5 basic schedule normally, but their job is to maintain relationships with people and get deals. You will probably start off as an intern or an Analyst.

Investment banking is grueling hours, normally 80-100 hours a week. You will likely work from around 9 AM to 12 AM, that's the standard cycle. Weekends are fair game, I have heard Saturday you may come in for half a day, and Sunday it depends. I have heard people work Monday – Sunday, 9 – 12 AM… so basically expect no social life. Even if you finish all your work by 8 PM, you normally stay until 11 PM just in case any work sparks up. Lunch is normally skipped unless you could probably scarf something done at your desk, and there is normally time for dinner.

***Essentials for your Resume***

To be remotely considered, you need a good set of experience and extracurriculars. You want to get *involved* and hold leadership positions. It is important you do not waste your summers… You need a go to plan BEGINNING your freshman year, because it will make your life much easier the earlier you plan. For a Freshman, try to get some internship or leadership program over your first summer. This increases your chances of obtaining a better internship your Sophomore summer. For your Sophomore summer, I have seen Sophomore investment banking internships at some places, which is crazy because they are starting at such a young age. Experience is probably the best thing for investment banking – they will see your head is in the game and you know what you are shooting for. If you obtain a Sophomore IB internship (very few out there I believe), I can guarantee you that you will have a huge advantage over a ton of people.

Junior year is your last year for an IB summer internship (technically whatever your 2nd to last year is). Make sure you have extracurriculars as well, because they want to see you can balance school &amp; activities. Frats/Sororities can be very helpful since there may be people in the frat/sorority going for IB, so you can have a helping hand. This is another way to network Remember, your resume speaks a lot about you. It is the entrance exam – the more and better extracurriculars with a high GPA, the better your chance of getting the first round.

***Networking and Getting the Interview***

The first basic goal is to obtain an interview. This normally happens by networking. If you have some investment banking club, workshop or seminar at your school, that is where all the networking will likely happen. The resources provided by your school can be extensive, especially if it is a top undergraduate business school. Getting involved is the key, knowing the Director of the IB programs is a huge plus. Once you get into the program, you should be given tons of names. It is basically cold-emailing people, asking for a phone call. To stand out and have your Director like you, *get involved in the program*. Answer questions, ask questions, just participate by raising your hand. He will note that you are taking this seriously, and will refer you to investment banks who will be asking him/her for the best students.

Networking is extremely important because it gets you the interview - *your first goal*. You want to talk to as many people as possible in the company without sounding obsessive or annoying. I normally shoot for 2-3, but 3-5 is probably good too. Normally you want to talk to Analysts before you make your way up to Associates, VPs, and I would leave out Directors/MDs because they're extremely busy. 

If you schedule a phone call with them, call them at the time you scheduled. If they do not pick up, leave a voicemail and e-mail them saying that you left a voicemail and hope you can speak with him/her later on in the day or week. If they pick up, introduce yourself. Ask them if they’re still free to talk, and if they say yes, just act normal. Ask them how their day is going, what they’ve worked on today, etc. I would say include some small talk before you begin actually networking. Then say something like, I’m interested in working/interning at BLAH, and I was wondering if you could tell me more about the program. Listen, I would try to take notes, and then just ask normal questions that pop up into your mind. You can ask them about their experience so far and some of the deals they’ve worked on. I would try to act more informal after all your informational questions are answered (near the end of the interview), what they like to do for fun, some of their interests/hobbies, etc. End with if they have any questions for you, answer, and then thank them.

Normally they might ask you behavioral questions such as, why do you want to do investment banking, why our bank, or even tell me about yourself. Have good answers to these questions and any other questions you can think they might ank. You really want to be seen as a person someone can easily get along with – fun, confident, smart, etc. This is really important, because no one wants to work with someone they cannot get along with. If you are working with someone for 100 hours a week, you want to be able to get along, so THIS IS JUST AS IMPORTANT AS BEHAVIORAL/TECHNICAL QUESTIONS!

If you don't have the resources to network, I don't really know what you can do. Apply online, try to call their offices to speak with an Analyst maybe, try to do something. Doing nothing is the opposite of what Investment Banking is. 

***Getting to the 2nd round***

Your second goal is to get to second rounds (after getting the first inerview). This normally means learning your behavioral and technical questions. Behavioral questions are questions such as, ""Tell me about yourself."", ""Why our bank?"" and ""Why investment banking?"". Those are the most usual behavioral questions, but it can extend beyond that. Technical questions are basic finance/modeling questions. Questions such as, ""How do you calculate WACC?"", ""Explain to me how a $100 deprecation expense flows throw the three financial statements with a 40% tax rate.""

In my opinion, technical questions get you to the second round. You need good answers to those three behavioral, but from what I have heard, technical questions is what separates you from everyone else. Ways to study for technicals are through books - Mergers &amp; Inquisitions (website), a Wall Street Oasis Study Guide, and you could probably just search it online. I recommend the first two books because they really have a lot of technical questions. However, searching advanced/unusual technical questions using Google will be very helpful.

There may also be brain teasers as some types of questions. One question I got was, ""Determine how many fridges are in the US, and show us your thought process."" Other may be quantitative such as, ""What is 9^3?""

***Professionalism***

Professionalism is crazy in investment banking. There is no horsing around when it comes to people. One mistake can really fuck you up. I have heard stories at my school where a student sent an e-mail to an Analyst at Goldman Sachs, but he had BAML (Bank of America) in the paragraph. He was obviously copy pasting the same message to everyone, thanking them. This spread like wild fire to the university alumni, and he was basically denied a lot of interviews for that. Do not do anything stupid, TRIPLE AND QUADRUPLE check every e-mail. Make sure you have your resume attached to the first e-mail, and make sure the file is in PDF and its name is LastName, FirstName. 
Make sure you thank people, and be grateful for the chance to speak with anyone when networking. If there is a presentation you are attending, THANK THEM after the presentation. This is also a great way to network at presentations, be the first one to go up to people and begin talking, thanking them for coming down and whatnot. 

TL; DR - There is no TL; DR for Investment Banking. If you scrolled to the bottom to only read this, you probably aren't determined to go into the field.

If you message me, I could probably just send you all my books on Investment Banking. They may be outdated, but it's a start.

o6ivz,60,2012-01-07,"Bethesda, QA, and respect for gamers",Headbomb,skyrim,https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/o6ivz/bethesda_qa_and_respect_for_gamers/,"I am the author of small, but almost necessary mod for *Skyrim* -- Weapons and Armor Fixes (or WAF, which you can find [here](http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=4719)). I'm not writing this reddit because I want to pimp out my mod, in fact I suspect most of you won't care for it and would rather wait for the [Unofficial Skyrim Patch](https://unofficialskyrimpatch.16bugs.com/projects/7078/bugs), from the same guys that made the [Unofficial Oblivion Patch](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Tes4Mod:Unofficial_Oblivion_Patch) and the [Unofficial Morrowind Patch](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Tes3Mod:Unofficial_Morrowind_Patch) (both of which literally fix thousands of bugs beyond the last official patch for these games), or are console gamers, in which case you don't have access to mods. No, what concerns me is why it's even necessary to have such a mod.

As of version 2.00 of WAF, 955 Weapons out of 2,848, and 872 armors out of 2,762 are affected. This is roughly 33.5% of all weapons, and 31.6% of all armors/clothings/jewelry. While not every of those are major issues, most are. And this is not taking into account [the massive problems with the Smithing Perks themselves](http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=6047), or [zillions of erroneous or missing recipes for crafting](http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=1020). Having such a large number of weapons and armor affected by so-easily fixed issues speaks volume about the quality of the bug testing/QA going on at Bethesda, or how much they really care about putting out a polished product.

At the very least, 85%+ of these problems can be spotted simply by sorting the items according to various properties (weight, name, weapon type, material, ...) and play a little game of ""spot the intruder"". These is not the big ""OMG, this game is huge and complex, so it's normal to have a few things slip through the cracks"" stuff. This is basic QA stuff, requiring no more than a few hours' time from some minimum wage intern. It takes me more or less 5 hours to do the whole thing from scratch, with hacks, 3rd party tools (which are very early in development), and zero documentation. *And I never had any modding experience prior to Skyrim.*

We on the PC are very lucky that Bethesda gives us the privilege of doing their job and uncrapping their game. I can't imagine how users playing on the Xbox 360 or the PS3 must feel ([assuming they can even play](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUoDfO1pWto)). Don't get me wrong, *Skyrim* is a good game, but shame on Bethesda for releasing it in such a poor state. And shame on the gaming press for awarding early beta releases &gt;90% scores (the PS3 version has a [92% metascore FFS!](http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-3/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim)), and several GOTY awards.

We as loyal gamers and fans deserve better. Bethesda should look at studios like Eidos Montreal for listening to their fans (who gave us features like the ability to turn of augmented vision in *Deus Ex: Human Revolution*, even if *they themselves* felt it added to the game, because they RESPECTED their fans enough to not pretend to know what we wanted better than we did), and care for them equally regardless of platform, giving us both a true controller interface, and a true KB+M interface (not to mention proper graphics and basic options such as the ability to key bind controls out of the box for PC users). Or studios like CD Projekt Red for their beyond-phenomenal post-release support of their games (*The Witcher* or *The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings*).

It is our responsibility as gamers to let Bethesda know we deserve better. Because it's not our gaming press that will do it, for fear of being cut off the money train of early access and exclusive interviews. Nor will it be Spike TV, who's opinion Bethesda seems to consider more important than ours. Nor will it be their focus groups, because they clearly are disconnected from our needs and wants.

So tweet, write letters, blog, reddit, ... anything! But don't sit on your chair pretending it's OK for Bethesda to ask 60$ for a beta-release, or for the gaming press to give them GOTY/SOTY awards. Otherwise, it's just going to be one painful BOHICA for *TES VI*.

o6i4g,2,2012-01-07,General admission advice/would an internship help me? (IR masters or PHD),BrutalCassius,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/o6i4g/general_admission_advicewould_an_internship_help/,"Hi everybody,

I just graduated and I'm now living in LA while my wife finishes up her MD residency. I'm trying to plan out my life so your help would be awesome.

I've been planning on going to law school for a while now but I've recently realized that I hate most lawyers and don't want anything to do with law school. It's always been my dream to go to grad school but I thought my inability to do math would preclude from any real programs. After taking some GRE practice tests I'm now only missing 1 or 2 on each math section and 2 or 3 on each verbal, I think that puts me in a pretty decent spot. I dicked around my first two years of college so my overall GPA is a 3.5 but got a 3.8 during my last two years when I took much more intensive classes. Will my GPA keep out of all the good IR programs?

Finally, I've got this unpaid internship offer at an organization that deals with international politics but the general vibe that I got from going to the office is that I would mostly be involved with general office work and not any actual research. Should I bother with that 4-month commitment or just try to find a job and save up some money?

Thanks a ton."

A few days ago, I had to show up at the beginning of the school year for local public schools and have been working very hard already, teaching as much as two ensembles a day and a music appreciation class.  I've been working very hard the past 4 years and am in my ninth semester.  I was counting on having excess aid like I have every semester to find a place to live and afford a little food.  I am currently between staying at a friend's for a few days and living out of my car.

To my surprise, when I received my bill for this semester today, I found out I wasn't receiving any aid.  Since I had been interning from 7-4, I didn't have time to make it to the financial aid office before they closed.  I called them and got passed around to different people for a while before I ended up at an answering machine.  No one could tell me why I wasn't receiving any financial aid or why I wasn't eligible for student loans this semester.  I owe $3,200 in tuition and fees so that I can intern at a school while receiving minimal university facility.  The money is due by January 11th.

I have a job lined up for next fall that is close to my home town and an ideal setup for a beginning band director.  If I can't go to school this semester, and can't afford to pay the $400 for Praxis II tests, I will permanently miss out on this opportunity.  I've been a good student.  Due to some troubles with developing my thoughts into words on paper, my GPA is a 3.075

I do know that I wasn't eligible for a Pell Grant due to my EFC(Expected Family Contribution).  My parents own a small automotive shop, but they are currently having a very difficult time and don't make much profit anyway.  That doesn't explain why I'm not eligible for student loans, but no one can tell me.

If I don't graduate this semester, I won't be able to find a job for at least a year or longer, and working in minimum wage jobs wouldn't facilitate the thousands of dollars I need in an appropriate time frame.  I feel as if I'm doomed and a victim of a flawed system.  Is there anything I can do?"

 I am entering my final interview for a consulting firm this Monday and filled out an application today that asked ""Have you ever been convicted of a crime?"". I marked ""No"". A lot of people I've asked said that I can mark ""No"" because underage drinking is not a misdemeanor or felony. I think I marked ""No"" for my current internship and still got the job. 

Does anyone know if marking ""No"" was the correct answer?"

o675t,2,2012-01-06,PED issue in MMA - Is it being taken seriously enough? Do you care? ,zxeuk,MMA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/o675t/ped_issue_in_mma_is_it_being_taken_seriously/,"General question for debate really. With the news of Cyborg testing positive, what is your feeling of PED (Performance-enhancing drugs) use in this sport? how much do you care as a spectator or as someone who trains/fights. Can more be done about it, is there enough awareness etc? 

I'm just interested to know what people think about it. It seems like this issue is kept in the shadows until only when a fighter is caught. Lets be honest for a moment and not kid ourselves, even though we cannot prove it, we can likely assume there have been many top and non-top level fighters out there, past/present who have likely used PED's at some point in their careers. But as we only have the current state regulators/commissions to rely on, it seems we can only just accept/turn a blind eye until something official comes out and a fighter is banned from testing positive. Basically there are fighters who chose to take this  advantage, whether large or small which goes against the point of sport and competition, but also putting their opponents at a disadvantage and risk of getting hurt. Does it not bother anyone else slightly when you really consider it? There are many fighters I love to watch, but at the same time when you see Cyborg in the news, they too could also be. Just because they haven't been caught doesn't not mean they aren't doing anything or haven't done anything before fights. Which ultimately leads me to think more needs to be done, such as stricter penalties. It bothers me that some fighters have or will take damage during a fight with someone who could be potentially cheating and intern have a strong advantage over them, it just isn't right and hurts the sport and the fighters. Anyhow this is just my take on it all. "

I am not poor or sick or suffering from any great misfortunes, I just feel empty.  And it’s been killing me for the better part of the past 3 years.

It’s my second year in college, and all I can think about is how thoroughly disappointed I am in myself. I seldom finish the projects I start, I procrastinate until I hate myself, and loathe committing the necessary time and effort to my studies. It is little wonder that I see the accomplishments of my peers and resent myself for lacking the willpower to catch up. It’s been two years since I graduated high school, and I still envy my classmates that got into their dream schools. Talk about letting go right? 

Don’t get me wrong…I am not failing out of college. My gpa is a 3.66… not the worst but could use some work. I’ve had surprising success finding a job (though perhaps cs just has good prospects) and landed internships both last summer and this upcoming summer.  I know I should be grateful, but instead I am disappointed and bitter. I just honestly don’t believe I deserve anything. I joke to my friends that I want to drop out of college and become a hermit. No one knows that I’m not actually joking.

I don’t know why I am this way. But I had to get it off my chest.

Between being at the school for 10-12 hours a day, coaching, and working at the campus bar, I had almost no time to make it to the gym. My diet also fell to pieces because of time and money constraints. Consequently I've put on about 10 pounds, and lost a considerable amount of strength and muscle size. Now it's time to right the ship.


**Goals:**

1. Get my weight down to 190

2. Stay consistent with my workouts, don't miss a day

3. Stay consistent with my eating, only 1 cheat meal per week

4. Get my Squat up to a 5RM of 205


My plan is to attend BJJ three times a week, and to do a modified Stronglifts program in between training days, and to do some light yoga in my basement on my rest days. I've whipped together a basic diet plan on Fitday that has me eating around 2500 calories per day with a 40/30/30 macro ratio. That should have me dropping a couple of pounds a week, but if necessary I will add a tabata workout at the end of my lifting days or decrease my calorie intake. 

I spent 6 weeks preaching at a bunch of Grade 10 students about fitness principles, so it's time to put my money where my mouth is.

I ran into some health problems my 2nd semester and wasn't able to focus on my studies as well...suffice it to say, I dropped to a 2.8.

EDIT 1: Thank you so much everyone for the much needed advice. Some of you asked me if I have done research. Actually, I have worked in 2 research labs in high school, and I believe I will have another internship/ volunteer thing this coming semester. It is a small lab, but I am using it to get my foot in the door and to see how research works at Cal. I will go ""full force"" by applying for URAP in fall semester of next year, or just emailing professors whose research I find interesting to ask for opportunities. I will use the SLC/tutoring/studying with friends/ and office hours as much as possible this semester. I have friends in every class this semester, and we are already planning study groups and dates, so hopefully that will work out.

But yeah, thank you so much everyone. But honestly, I am a bit confused about the GPA aspect. I've heard numerous times that GPA doesn't matter, as well as a lot of other people saying it does matter. Like you guys said here. My friend's dad who has hired people before (he is an engineer) says he doesn't even ask about GPA, just if they have relevant experience...so yeah, you can see why I'm confused, lol.

In the spring of last year, I attended one of those IUT sessions, the session you go to in order to switch majors. I didn't fully switch then, as I was weighing options, but I worked out a scheduled plan with someone there. They told me when I wanted to make a formal switch, it would now be super easy, and to just hop into an advising session. No problem.

So in the fall, I got an email saying there was a hold on my scheduling because I haven't yet fully declared. no problem, I thought Id just go get it done now. Then I started getting interviews for pretty much my dream internship. Availability was a huge question, so I held off on scheduling (and in turn, formally declaring). Not only that, some serious personal/family stuff got in the way, along with a internship i was already doing, and working to pay for school.

Now I have everything I need in terms of my internship schedule and was ready to schedule classes, only for temple to tell me I somehow messed up, and never attended an IUT (which is a requirement at fox). 

I not only meet all the requirements to enter (GPA really being it, along with the IUT which they say I never did), I've been following along the business route, taking all business classes.

**so heres the issue:** will they even let me take classes in the spring? they said I cant schedule cause I didnt declare, now they are not letting me declare. I plan on going down tomorrow to the academic resource center and to speakman to raise some hell. 

Im really at a loss here. any advice/tips on the matter from anyone familiar with this crap please let me know."

o89hx,1,2012-01-08,I hope this provides encouragement to the musicians out there and insight to the music lovers.,[deleted],Music,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/o89hx/i_hope_this_provides_encouragement_to_the/,"So I felt like Reddit would be an awesome place just to talk about what it's like being an aspiring professional musician/songwriter/producer. I hope that what's happened with me in the last couple years can help some other people who are pursuing similar interests, as well as those of you who just love and consume music but may not think about or fully understand what goes into making it.

I've been making music my whole life and realized - luckily - pretty early on that it is what I wanted to do with my life. There is no road map for a music career which scares many parents, including mine. When I graduated from college (not a music college), I moved to South Korea for a year to teach English and see the world. I was afraid I'd lose either my passion for music or not have the time or people to play with over there to facilitate musical growth. Turns out, that motivated me even more to get it going. I had a band in South Korea. We toured all over the country and I cut my first full length record as the chief songwriter, producer, mixer, guitarist, vocalist, all that jazz. It was a great experience and I had a great time.

My girlfriend and I returned to the states and decided to move to Austin, Texas. She liked the city and I felt like it'd be a great place to pursue music production and songwriting. I quickly got a job at songwriting demo studio through sheer luck on Craigslist, which just goes to show that you never know which outlets or connections are going to help you out so work hard at all of them.

This is not meant to offend any of you who pursue popular songwriting as a career in the vein of Dr. Luke-type stuff (who I definitely respect), pop country stuff, all that jazz, but I was turned off very quickly to the attitudes of my coworkers. Everything was money driven and the passion for music was buried under a passion for money and fame. These people were shallow and worst of all, very ignorant and lacking in the compassion department. However, we had some pretty big time people contacting us for tracks and I felt fortunate to be there. I viewed the experience, and still do view pop songwriting, as kind of in the vein of advertising: it is not necessarily art but it requires a challenging composite of artistic ability and more pragmatic reasoning and I very much like that challenge. I worked very hard and tried to write songs but there was almost an immediate lack of respect from the guy who ran the studio. When someone doesn't respect you, it doesn't take long for you to reciprocate. This is a LOOOONG story in and of itself but let's just say there was an incident over songwriting percentages (we're talking 2%) and I was physically threatened so I quit working there.

The next year and a half was really dark for me. I was in a pretty deep depression. Not suicidal but music, the thing I love most, had caused me real pain. I had bought into a lot of the bullshit I hated about the music industry, hadn't written anything decent in over a year, and couldn't get any clients to produce or mix. I thought about giving up, I barely even listening to music. However, I did manage to get a great gig touring as a guitar player for a terrific folk singer who pays me well and respects me, and vice versa. Holy crap, a real musical relationship with integrity! This slowly started to turn it around. I got to tour all over the country, meet amazing people, and get paid. She also valued my production and mixing skills and started hiring me to mix and master her music. Score! When I wasn't touring, I started making a conscious effort to let music back into my life the way I used to. I started seeking out new music, started listening just to listen, to feel something instead of dissecting it, trying to figure out how to sell it. I can honestly say that one random day, I heard the song ""Burden of Tomorrow"" by The Tallest Man On Earth and that started my rise out of depression and back into exploring the beauty of music. What a gorgeous song, it made me feel something from music again!

About 5 months ago, I got an unpaid, demanding internship at a reputable, local studio and started working my ass off. Things are going well there. I also found out recently that one of the songs I wrote on at the aforementioned songwriting studio got picked up by an artist on Mercury Records as her first single. That's huge! My first major label credit! Most importantly of all though, I started making my own music again which has honestly been the thing that has brought me back to who I really am: someone who loves music and wants to make it for his own sake. Music finally makes me feel good again!

To all of you who are pursuing music in any way similar to me, keep at it! The low points will make you stronger and you'll break free sooner or later. I don't anticipate staying up forever, I know it'll be up and down the rest of my life, but I have cleared the first hurdle. No longer depressed, feeling great about things and ready and confident to keep at it! For those of you that love music but don't aspire to do it as a career, remember how hard the artists you love work at their music and appreciate it and how much emotion goes into every sound you hear.

I know this is longwinded and it is only self-serving in that I am getting a load off my chest. I hope it helps someone. Here's the first song I've produced as my alter ego, Lonely Child. I hope you like it, just making it has helped me tremendously and that's what it's all about!

No internship experience, some work experience (grocery store, drywall and other maintenance etc.)

Can't get a job for the life of me, can't even get one at the local min. wage hubs and I've applied to all of them.

Can't enlist in the military (I have a medical condition and my waiver was rejected when I tried, even though I can run a 280 MC PFT)

Honestly I don't know what the fuck to do; it seems as if crime and suicide are my only options. 

I am extremely fortunate in that I do not have any student loans to repay and that I am able to live with my mother for essentially free, but I cannot live like this.

I think about suicide every night, sometimes for hours...maybe if I wasn't such a vagina I would have gone through with it.

Hell, if I had a gun I would have offed myself 200 times over in the past year.

If I pursue a life of crime lets be honest, this will just lead to my suicide eventually as career criminals (besides white collar) especially starting from the bottom don't seem to have the best chances of staying out of jail or living, and if I were to get sentenced I would off myself then.

I am completely unemotional when thinking about suicide as well, it just seems like the reasonable thing to do. Apologize to my mother for being a piece of shit burden to her for the past 22 years and end it.

All I can see for my future is drowning in a river of dread and depression.

what is the point?

I've fucked up my life beyond repair (or what seems like a lot of work to seemingly repair something that I did not know would need reparation in the first place)

Good grades in school, get into a good UNI and go for engineering, what could go wrong...

fucking waste of four years, the most miserable and unproductive time of my fucking life.

I am concerned on whether it looks ""ok enough"" or if i should be aiming towards maybe a different style or using an inDesign template. Also should my academic project and internship experience be merged? Should i keep my GPA even if its &lt; 3.0? Should I even keep the activities section?

I am mostly going to be applying for programming jobs so I feel the resume won't really change from job to job right? However I also have this obsession of getting a job in Antarctica just doing menial work like dishwashing/janitorial etc. and was wondering how I could adapt my resume to fit for that job as well. I used to be a lab assistant in high school and volunteered at a library one summer if that helps.

Thanks for taking the time to look over my resume, means a lot!

My parents are rich enough to pay for (most of) my college education. I have an internship lined up which would put me in the top 25% of U.S. *household* incomes and I'm only 18. I don't even feel like my passions for the things I'm good at (math / CS) are really my own, as my parents played a huge part in shaping me as a kid, and my natural tendency is to be lazy and apathetic. I have an exceptionally awesome group of friends which I fell into pretty much by accident.

Right now I try to find time to volunteer but what I do seems negligible compared to what has been done for me. I would donate money but I'd rather help my parents pay for my college first.

What are the best ways to improve the world around me with (temporarily limited, at least until I graduate) time and money? To anyone in similar situations, how did you achieve a clear conscience?"

So I joined ROTC a little late, my junior year. However I did so well with credits it is going to take considerable effort to stick around for a full year after LTC. I would probably only have a semester left (even then, maybe part time) in my ""senior year"". IE 3.5 years for a 4 year degree. (I feel like I joined the party to late!)

I opted to take LTC after my junior year (this coming summer) and right now I'm in MSI classes. However I'm on the fence because I may finish school before the year is out if I contract after LTC. (Thus maybe graduate and attend OCS? and drop ROTC?)

Can I attend LTC and not contract? Do I sign the papers before or after? I think overall it would be a great experience and I would most probably end up in the military but my time is short as an undergrad. I would like the training but I know full well that afterwards I will be saying no to contracting and graduate very soon.

Advice? 

Essentially since I joined last semester with 83~ credits (now 96) I joined as a senior in my junior year at the school. But if I do a semester next Fall, improve some grades(by retaking courses and aim for A's), get a Spring internship, I could have a full senior year. You follow?"

I'm currently a junior physics major at a university in the USA.  I'm here to see what advice you may have to give me regarding what I do this summer and what I do in the future.  First let me explain.  

I don't know any scientists really and we've never had one in the family.  In fact, I'm the first person in my family to study hard science in college.  This past semester I started doing research in high energy particle with a professor at my university, and I realized that a career in industry might not be what I want, but rather I might prefer going into academia, getting the Ph.D., the whole shebang.  I really fell in love with high energy particle and I'm trying to plan out the next few years right.  

I've forgone internships for the past two summers (after freshman year I worked manual labor and after sophomore year I studied abroad in China), but I have to do something physics-y this summer.  My question to you is: what do you think is my best move?  

The options:  
1) (the one I've pretty much decided on) Stay in the city my university is in, make a pittance of money, and continue my research work either on a scholarship or with funds from the department.  
2) Take an REU somewhere near where I live and make a little more money, but abandon my exact research and my current advisor.  
3) Do something else.  

Other factors:  
•Money is not an issue for me.  I don't have a lot of it at all but my schooling is paid for mostly by scholarships, then my parents, then by my own funds, and then by loans I don't plan to worry about until I can.    
•My research advisor and I get along extremely well.  In fact, I don't know if I would have made the same decisions career-wise if I had worked with someone else.  We click very well and I love my project and I love learning from my advisor.  
•My grades are good.  I have above a 3.85 GPA right now.  
•My housemate might stay in the city as well over the summer, in which case I'd really like to live with him then (we get along really well too).  

I think that's everything.  Any and all advice (including grad school stuff or cool stories) is greatly appreciated.  Mainly I'd like to know how actual physicists do things and how you guys would have decided if you were me.  I'll try to come back through the day and give more details if you want to know them.  You guys rock.  

Thanks,

I am currently a first year student pursuing a PhD in Epidemiology. My background was in Anthropology, but fortunately I was given a fellowship for the first two years which stipulate I can't hold a job and should focus all of my time on my coursework. Last quarter I took 5 courses, this quarter I am in 6.

The thing that worries me is that fellow first year students are working in order to pay for their tuition/stipend so they are getting work experience. They are also not taking as many credit hours as I am. I guess my question to you guys is this: should I try to find unpaid internships this early in the game for the short breaks that I have? Or should I just buckle down with coursework until my qualifying exam? I think that by devoting so much time to getting classes out of the way I should be able to finish more quickly, but I'm worried it would be to my detriment overall.

I have an internship this coming summer that, after it's completion, will add $35,000 to my savings (after tax, etc.) I will definitely not use all of the money in my 529, there will likely be $37,000 left when I'm done school. I have no loans and no debt. When I graduate, I will likely be in the $65 - $75,000 / yr salary range. I'm looking for ways to invest for the best return, but I have no investing experience and have no idea where I should put the money.

o9eqs,8,2012-01-09,"Staying couple of months in Boston, which bank and provider (and some other questions)?",Alfredo_BE,boston,https://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/o9eqs/staying_couple_of_months_in_boston_which_bank_and/,"I'll be in Boston for an internship from March 'till June(ish). Though I've been trying my best to avoid it, chances are I'll need to open a bank account. Reading all of the horror stories about BoA and others on Reddit, are there any local banks which are trustworthy? The last thing I want is to end up with is an account I can't close after I'm gone, fees to pay, ... I don't care about high interest, it's only for a couple of months.  

Another thing I'll need is a cellphone provider. Again, I'm only staying for three months and a bit, so prepaid seems like the best option. The provider needs to support GSM/UMTS (no CDMA) and can't operate on the 1700MHz band (which leaves T-Mobile out). I'm only familiar with AT&amp;T, but their data plans are a bit expensive. Most of my communication will be dealt with via Whatsapp and VoIP, so data needs to be included.  

One other thing is the combination of housing and public transport. Right now, I've arranged for two weeks of couch surfing in Brookline while searching for a more permanent place. I need to end up in Jamaica Plain. Since Brookline doesn't appear to be part of Boston and Jamaica Plain does, would it be best if I searched for housing in Boston and its neighbourhoods? How reliable is public transport in Boston, or would renting a bike be a better option? How bike-friendly is Boston? On a 0 to Amsterdam scale.

And finally, the weather... I was expecting snow this time of the year, but it doesn't look like that's happening any time soon. What are the odds of it freezing/snowing in March? I'd rather avoid stuffing my luggage with winter clothes if possible.  

Boston appears to be a great city, so I'm very much looking forward to this!"

o97r4,12,2012-01-09,Looking for advice on how to transition from English teaching to another career in China,pearlysoames,China,https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/o97r4/looking_for_advice_on_how_to_transition_from/,"*I did a quick search of r/China and couldn't find a relevant thread. If I missed it please enlighten me.*

I have been teaching English in China for about a year. Background:

I graduated from a good public University in the United States (my home country) in December 2010 with a **BA in Economics** and came to China immediately (I had already studied for one semester at Peking University in Spring 2010). 

In April I found a job with an English teaching company. I started teaching 1 on 1 TOEFL and SAT classes in Beijing. I was promoted to full time teacher in Shenzhen in August as part of a new, large program they were doing. I just got promoted again to director of the program (supervising 4 high schools using our program) and editor of next year's textbook. 

The company I work for has a lot of integrity and I like teaching. Also the company is growing like crazy and I get paid really well for a teacher (about 22k RMB/month). The problem is I cannot see myself teaching (English in China) as a career and the opportunity cost of committing more than a couple years to doing it is too high now. 

I have almost zero outside professional experience (not even internships) but my resume is otherwise pretty good (stuff I did in college, service and leadership) plus I'm a killer interviewee. My Mandarin is high intermediate in the outside world but in a professional setting it would probably be beginner. 

My questions are thus: 

* Where do I go to look for jobs?

* What kind of jobs should I look for?

* What are the best jobs for foreigner college graduates in their mid-20s and how can I get one? 

* If I am currently not qualified (language, experience etc) how should I go about getting qualified or what steps would you recommend I take? 

**tl,dr; I like teaching English teaching for now, but what else can I do for pay in China and how?**

EDIT- And yeah, I'm white, tall, blue-eyed etc, but I'm looking to move beyond the jobs where this is a major factor determining whether or not I'm hired. 

**VERDICT- It sounds like I'm doing pretty well where I am and I need to just more aggressively study Chinese and keep my eyes open for more opportunities. I had an intimation this would be the case but I was somewhat naively hoping someone had a magic elixir of success in China or a suggestion of ""the job"" for which I should apply. Thanks for the good advice and positive responses all around.** "

Starting out with the beginning of college this past semester, I joined my university as a part of a deferred program in which you did your classes at a community college, but you'd live on campus. I started off the semester pretty slow socially, but picked up speed. I met a lot of friends, hung out with people, the only downside was my grades and tests suffered because of it. Over time, both the social activity and grades slipping magnified, and at the semester's end, it was revealed to me that I'd not be returning to the university due to poor academic performance. Currently, I'm in a few thousand dollars worth of debt, not going to school, and at a near minimum wage job. There are many worse situations I could be in, but I need a direction to head in. If I were to pursue a college education, I'd wanna look into applying to different art schools (preferrably for a BFA in game art/design, and already have somewhat of a portfolio), or look into internships at different game companies. Another alternative that I'm looking at (but unrelated completely) Is the armed forces. I've looked at it as a prospect before and discussed with my family, would most likely join the Army if I did. I've read a lot of stories (mostly on here, honestly) about how military life is, and as far as I can tell, it's no peach, but that's maybe just what I need. What do I do, reddit? Lend me an ear and some advice."

I wouldn't ask except he was really into me too, seemingly very genuinely, he stayed up past dawn to talk to me. Can anyone help?

o948r,4,2012-01-09,Oh really?  What about the wife's side,suziehomie,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/o948r/oh_really_what_about_the_wifes_side/,"This is a throwaway because I am pissed.

Yeah, sure, I ""follow him all over the net"" because he does the exact same to me.  He can even see what I am doing because, unlike him, the computer I use is visible from where the other person sits.

I bring in 90% of the income.  His amount, most of which is tied to what I get through my disability - a whole whopping $173.  The rest is from his paperroute OF WHICH I DO NEARLY HALF!  He does 60 papers, I do at least 45.  The route is about 110 papers.  That's it.  That's all he does.  He gets about $100 for 110 papers and I do nearly half the route!  Guess what I am not going to do anymore?  Yup.  And he has said for years, he'd be happy to be ""househusband"" if I brought the money IN.

Well, guess what, boys, I do.  And I do chores too.  I just don't stop when the chore is ""done"" like leaving dishes to dry on the dish rack and a dirty kitchen.  I leave a nearly spotless kitchen, to the point of washing the floors if they need a wash.  Hell, I have been scrubbing out the toilet once a week, if not more often, just to make sure &gt;&gt;I&lt;&lt; have  a clean toilet.  I'm also the only person of 5 people in the house, 2 adults, who manages to put a new roll on.  I ask him to do something and it takes months if not years to do it.  I wanted pictures hung when we first moved in 13ish months ago - he finally did it today after I got the second hanging kit!  The first kit ""disappeared.""  I wonder why?

""Hypochondriac""?  I noticed he didn't bother to mention that we had a flood over the last few days coming in from outside and enough mold/mildew/damp spores have come in or were created to make my allergies go nuts.  I am HIGHLY allergic to mold.  To the point of deathly allergic and needing an epipen.  I took my allergy pill and several other medicines today just to be able to breathe, but they took hours.  I woke up this morning and nearly threw up because of the size of phlegm balls that were trapped in my throat.

Oh, noes... poor him.  Poor widdle man who cleans and doesn't even do it properly.  Widdle man who says ""I'm gonna get a job"" and never bothers to even bother apply because ""there are too many barriers.""  Excuse excuse.  I got myself an intern position at a farm that has lead to a potential job for him too!  I'm handing raw fleece, and prepping it to be sold to crafters.  He has the option of joining in on the fun and getting paid for it - while I do it for free!  I was supposed to be THERE at my job today, but could barely move when I got up because I could barely breathe!

I used to take pain pills to help me move and do the chores I was supposed to do as ""wife and mother"" until I very nearly fried my liver.  I still can't drink anywhere near as much as I used to and I have to be careful how much and what type of painkillers I take now.  I'm lucky I can walk and he's complaining about how bad he has it?  I spend most of the day in various amounts of pain, and have been for over a decade.

Oh yes, let him cry on your shoulder.  Let him whine about how hard his life is.  I don't force him to look for work.  I don't force him to go to the local job club.  I don't make him pound the pavement.  If he worked full time, or even with a part time job - not a paperroute - I could see where this whine is coming from.  He's just feeling sorry for himself.

You guys don't even see the other side of the story.  The fact that I have to tolerate his sexual fetishes is just the start.  Or how about how I birthed 3 kids for him when other women wouldn't even look at him twice.  I knit for him.  I buy him clothes to wear - which he refuses saying they belong to me, even though they do not - shoes, socks, underwear... I buy him the toiletries he says he likes.  I let him buy beef when my stomach can't handle it, and not just a small steak, he buys giant roasts.  I've tried to be loving and supportive about everything he has ever done, even when he's messed up royally about it.

You want to talk ""hypochondriac"" then let me point out that he had atrial fibrillation a few years ago and ever since then, anytime his heart beat is even slightly weird, he freaks out about it.  Yes, he's on blood pressure meds, so what?  At least he can take the pills that help him out.  I can't.  He injured his arm catching a running kid.  I nearly broke my hip trying to protect our newborn when I fell carrying her.  I also fell up the stairs trying to get our then 4 year old back in the house and was stuck there for 20 minutes because he couldn't be bothered to listen to his little girl say ""mommy fell.""  It was another 20 minutes before the ambulance came!  He has ""degenerative disk disease.""  Well, I have ""congenital hip defects"" and ""abnormal bone growth"" in my lower spine.  I also have problems with my knees - also congenital - and dislocated my shoulder and other problems, one of which is causing my headaches... Basically, I am in pain 24/7 and can't take pain meds or antibiotics for what ails me, and his ailments, not only can he take the pain meds and blood pressure meds, he is too stupid to remember.  I am not going to make one of those weekly med kit things again - our kids could get into the meds and that would not be a good thing.

I spend days trying to kick him out of his depression.  If you only knew the lengths I go to to try to get him out of his ""funks.""  Guess what?  He's not the only one who has had to fight depression all their life.  I do it too!  He can at least take the psycho meds the docs scripted him but refuses.  The ones I was scripted made me manic.  His make him feel like he's slightly out of sync with his body.

Yes, our landlords are inspecting tomorrow, but gez, they've had the house on the market for over 6 months now and it hasn't sold.  Why?  Because the rents on the suites are less than what an owner would have to pay for a mortgage because the real estate prices are way too high and tomorrow, someone is supposed to be coming over to help ""dry out"" the carpet.  The handy man was supposed to fix a bunch of problems and he hasn't bothered to book an appointment to come in.  This place can't be sold with the holey floor or flood damage or blocked pipes or wood bug and ant infestation.  Those problems, and more, have to be fixed first before they can even think of selling the place.

Well, boys, guess who is sleeping out in the car tonight.

Also how do you get the least amount taken out.  Will i get less taken out if i'm a dependent or not?

Thanks"

I am an intern working with a non-profit agency, helping to facilitate support/education groups for teen parents (ages 14-22). Most of these parents are low income and rely on some form of government assistance. I am in my mid 20's and have no children, and my experiences with and knowledge about kids are largely from what I've learned in my various child development classes. I was hoping the redditors in [/r/parenting](/r/parenting) might have some good suggestions regarding potential topics, or websites/books that are beneficial (for both me, and the group members!). 

We have a basic curriculum that covers topics such as bonding, nutrition, home safety, and resume writing for the parents. I hope to add something more to these groups, which is hard when it's a non-profit with basically no money to spare for books or supplies. I'm looking for what lies beneath the typical websites that pop up on a google search. I have ideas for topics such as discipline techniques and relaxation methods, but I think the minds of parents would be much better in generating some useful ideas.

Thank you loads in advance. I recently found that this subreddit existed, and I'm so very glad that I did."

I was wondering how I explain that while I currently do not have any of the skills they seek for the internship, I will by the time it starts? Also, do you think this will affect my chances of getting the internship?

Unfortunately I was never able to land an internship so my resume is essentially blank on the experience section outside of school related projects. On the upside I had a very high GPA and it is a very good school.

I have always been interested in airplanes, rockets, spacecraft, etc, so I think this is where I want to look. Also, I am most interested in the R&amp;D/Design aspect of things regardless of industry. I like to work with my hands as well.

Some of the companies I have looked at: Lockheed, Ball, Northrop, ITT, ULA, SNC, SpaceX, The Spaceship Company, etc. I am not looking exclusively at large companies, but the truth is I have no idea how to find good small companies... If anyone has suggestions on these or other companies I am open to them.

So, I am wondering what to look for in an entry level position to at least some day end up in a design or perhaps project lead type position?

And as for grad school - I can't afford to pay my own way, and as such have pretty much dismissed it. However, if an employer or other third party would pay or help pay I would consider it. I don't know much about this since I have operated on the assumption of not going...

What do I do?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ob7hd/reddit_my_mother_seriously_hates_my_sister_and/,"My mom is currently going through a divorce that started as a result of her walking in on my stepfather (my sister's father) beating my sister. My sister has developed serious emotional and behavioral issues because of this. Our mother has been incredibly apathetic toward the fact that my sister has these issues, and when we tried to report the abuse or tell her, she would tell us we were lying and refuse to discuss the issue or bring us to a family friend nurse that would overlook our bruises and cuts. Throughout the divorce, though, my mother has been guilting me into watching my 16 year old sister on weekends because she can't handle my her moods and behavior. My mom goes on ""overnight work bonding trips"" and ""just needs a night off"" every week complaining that my sister is too much to handle. I feel like I'm being selfish telling her that as a 20 year old, I'm parenting her daughter more than she is, but I buy all my sister's food, make sure she's on birth control, picking her up from dances and work, and I'm the one she gets pawned off on at any given moment when our mom wants to go out and party.

For example: This past weekend my mom decided to have a date stay over, but didn't want my sister at the house, so she asked me to watch her. When I said no (simply because I wanted a weekend to myself), she left my sister waiting for someone to pick her up from work. 

I love my sister and I don't mind seeing her every week, but with two jobs, an internship, and college full time, I can't worry about babysitting my sister because my mom doesn't like her. What do I do?

TLDR: My mother doesn't want to take care of my sister because she doesn't like her, so she pushes her off on me. What do I do?


EDIT: My sister needs to be watched because of her self-destructive behavior. She has a lot of emotional and behavioral problems that cause her to need ""babysitting"" to make sure she doesn't cut herself, get pregnant, get into serious drugs, or anything you wouldn't want happening to any other teenager. She has so far proven herself incapable of keeping herself out of trouble at and outside school because her own mother doesn't give a shit."

* What kind of skills are important to put down? (Should I put down programming languages I am comfortable in or only those that really apply?)
* What benefits should I be looking for?

* What questions should I ask about the job? (I am kinda lucky in that my teacher is department manager so I think I can find out a bit more about random stuff through him and it sounds as though php position would be working under him.)"

Did undergrad in Political science, A- average grade, finished at 19 in 2009. Worked 2010 as 'management intern' and then business development and sales for a travel company in the UK. Went back and did some stas courses, etc, and began a Masters of Business majoring in Applied Finance in August, currently a GPA of 6.5/7, or 84% grade average, so missed that perfect 7 by a hair. 

Am just beginning to job hunt, but I have been on and off volunteering doing research and writing for a local non profit, and just generally reading ahead of my courses as well as working on Excel and, uhhh....lurking on Reddit.

My question then, and keep in mind I am based in Australia although I am a US citizen intending to return there eventually, is how employable do I sound? I ideally want to move into consulting - management and strategy, but I kind of want to do it by first going into research and business analysis, and then get a PhD in Public Policy and Sustainability or something in a few years.


ultimately I just want to either get an internship or a low level job in finance within the next month or two. I know that sounds vague, but really I just want to boost my CV  and get a better feel for the industry so I can get a better idea of what career path I want to take. I'm at a disadvantage in terms of networking (I did all my networking around the Pol Sci department in New Zealand, and not in Finance in Australia) so I'm really going to have to do this the hard way so I guess any input, advice is welcome - anything at all - I really just need to bounce ideas off people with the same interests I guess.

The deadline is the beginning of next week so there is a rush on outreach and any help would be greatly appreciated.
I have attached the casting call, please feel free to email blast it out to everyone you know and anyone who may have an interest! 
 
If you can also email it to any other great contacts in O'ahu, that would be incredible.

a woman in my office is granted a raise due to the fact that she is the only woman and the company ""cannot afford to not have a female employed due to the potential for sexist repercussions"" instead of being fired because in fact, she is a bad worker and employee, we are currently training another two female interns, and their work and proficiency is far beyond XX employee in question.

what in the fuck... is that?

also, anyone else find that companies and HR departments are cancelling out perfectly qualified people for jobs that they should get because company needs another man, woman, African American, Asian, Caucasian ect?

how about the people that deserve the job or the raise get the job or the raise?

in a perfect world i suppose

TL;DR Is equal opportunity just as bad as ever, but only now we put a smiley face on and ignore it because the concept has changed?

Now it's time to start looking, and since I haven't received any really awesome internships I wanted to email my old boss to see if I could get a job from him. I have already previously emailed him an update on college life. I wrote this email to send to him. 

How can I improve it?

Hello &lt;Name&gt;,

I hope you had a great holiday and are having a happy new year. I'm back in &lt;Home&gt; after finishing my first semester at &lt;School&gt;. It is really an amazing experience.  There is always something to do on campus! Next semester I am going to be the lead student government reporter for the &lt;newspaper&gt;, which includes covering &lt;school's&gt; student elections next semester - a big deal because our student government controls about two million dollars! Now it is time to start preparing for next summer.  I'm looking to stay in &lt;home&gt; so I can spend some much needed time with my family.  I would love to work with the &lt;business&gt; again if there was any openings or special projects you needed someone to work on.

Thank you,

oafxt,0,2012-01-10,UChicago Application Essays (mostly just to show my friends),[deleted],writing,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/oafxt/uchicago_application_essays_mostly_just_to_show/,"**Question 1.** How does the University of Chicago, as you know it now, satisfy your desire for a particular kind of learning, community, and future? Please address with some specificity your own wishes and how they relate to UChicago.

I must be honest.  I probably know very little about UChicago compared to other applicants.  I can tell you, however, that the little I do know has placed UChicago in my list of top three schools. You have a very effective advertising campaign. Your school is displayed, and rightfully so, I would think, as full of an imaginative, creative student body, with many opportunities to showcase its excellent talents. This scavenger hunt, in particular, piques my interest to the peak my interest can be piqued. I consider myself imaginative and would jump at the opportunity to stretch my imagination to such an extent.

Your student body also possesses a wide range of backgrounds. I have experienced life through the lens of an entitled majority that I wish did not exist in its present form. UChicago presents a diversified environment with no such barriers, and will provide me with a variety of different viewpoints and perspectives that I might otherwise not have the opportunity to experience. Such viewpoints will help me prosper in an academic environment.

Pertaining to my future, UChicago is an impressive school. Employers recognize that. Your people will provide me with internships in my desired field of Psychology, placing me ahead of my peers. In today’s competitive job market, anything that sharpens the edge I have over fellow prospective employees is much appreciated. Although it is quite possible I have failed to impress you, receiving a college education at UChicago cannot fail to impress employers.

*Question 2 (Optional):* Share with us a few of your favorite books, poems, authors, films, plays, pieces of music, musicians, performers, paintings, artists, blogs, magazines, or newspapers. Feel free to touch on one, some, or all of the categories listed, or add a category of your own.


Favorite music artists: Relient K, Switchfoot, Koji, OK Go, Beirut
Favorite books: The Bible, East of Eden, Brave New World, Nineteen Eighty-Four, Lolita
Favorite films: Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Pulp Fiction, Juno, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, Memento
Favorite television shows: Community, Parks and Recreation, Modern Family, Futurama, Arrested Development

I have struggled with depression several times over the past three years. A major issue of mine is how much free will I actually have, if my behavior is so easily altered by circumstance and mood. At one point, before I was aware I was depressed, I puzzled over the fact that my behavior constantly contradicted my desires. After reading The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, I was convinced in what one might call ""the duality of the soul."" That is, that there were two sides of me: the lazy side, determined by mood, and the aspiring side that very much wanted his homework done. This view of mine changed, however, upon reading East of Eden. The book's theme of ""timshel,"" or ""Thou mayest,"" struck a chord in my heart. It inspired me to make my own decisions, independent of mood or circumstance. This encouragement on a logical and emotional scale, ultimately leading to an end to my depression, is what makes East of Eden the favorite book that I've read.

**Essay Option 2:** Observation, Hypothesis, Experiment, Analysis, Conclusion; since the 17th century, the scientific method has been the generally accepted way to investigate, explore, and acquire new knowledge. The actual process of intellectual discovery, however, is rarely so simple or objective. The human mind often leaps from observation to conclusion with ease, rushes headlong into hypothesis-less experiments, or dwells on the analysis, refusing to conclude.

Tell us about your non-scientific method. (Diagrams, graphs, and/or visual aids allowed within your essay.)

**The Daily Social Experiment**

I have labeled myself in the past – labeled myself “nerd,” “geek,” and “weirdo.” I have finished fiddling with those annoying things, as I have now grown a sufficient quantity of body hair, and I cannot bear to painfully remove any of it while switching labels. With my newfound maturity, I have learned to defy labels and categories. I call myself “quirksome.” What it means, beyond quirky and handsome, I cannot tell you. What I can tell you is that I allow my quirks to shine through and consistently invent new ones for myself to try on like clothing. Life is a constant experiment, but I do not worry whether or not my peers will approve of my new behavioral “outfit.” For the opinions of my friends matter exclusively; all others are superfluous.

I once had a conversation with a friend about the band They Might Be Giants. We did not speak of the group’s new songs. We did not speak of its tour dates or its Twitter page. I simply asked her why she was unable to make it to a concert at which it was performing, but I did so in a complex and utterly quirky fashion. I proposed reasons for her inability to attend based on popular They Might Be Giants songs. Perhaps worms were denied admission to the concert, or she had to study for a test on Early Civilizations. Having heard such witty suggestions, she could not help but verbally regard my creativity, to which I mentioned her phenomenal graduation speech from last year. However, I made the mistake of attempting to share such a conversation with the world. I took screenshots of the dialogue, erased our last names, and posted the affair to Reddit.

Alas, the world was none too kind regarding our fun. My post received multiple down-votes, leading to much disappointment. I later realized that many of the down-votes were due to capturing the conversation in too low a resolution, so that it was practically illegible. However, I had already learned a valuable lesson about others’ opinions. One must not allow the world to rain on one’s parade, because it rains all the time. If you want to parade all the time, as I do, you must not be afraid of getting wet.

**EDIT**: I was very short on time when writing this, so it was quite rushed (though some of it was pasted from [my Columbia application](http://www.reddit.com/r/Proofreading/comments/nz5y3/columbia_university_supplement_due_midnight_est/)). Still, I'm happy with how it turned out. I got to read the other prompts just now, and found this one in particular to be *very* entertaining:

**Essay Option 6**: Don't write about reverse psychology.

oaet8,6,2012-01-09,"I'm confused about whether he's interested (yes, it's another one of those posts)",foreveralone323,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/oaet8/im_confused_about_whether_hes_interested_yes_its/,"Some background:


We met at work (me 22F, him 21) where we both had internships this past semester. We didn't work together that much but the times when we did we had some pretty good conversations, and most other days we got to have a quick chat together. Eventually, after a few months, he suggests we have a movie night some evening (at this point he knows I am a HUGE fan of movies).


Since then - except for a gap around the holidays - we've been hanging out about once a week, and each time it's been just the two of us watching movies/tv, playing video games, or playing piano and billiards together. Also since then, I've been trying to figure out if he's interested or not, and there are a few things that are making it difficult:


* **We are both stereotypical shy and awkward engineers.** He's given me the impression that he's just as inexperienced and out of practice as I am, which means both of us are too afraid to make a move (and I'm not even sure if he actually wants to make one).

* **He is the nicest human being I've ever met.** Seriously. I'm surprised he's not Canadian and if he were, they would probably also be astounded by his kindness and generosity. This is something about him that I'm very attracted to, but at the same time he's so pleasant with everyone that I cannot tell if he's flirting or just being friendly (plus he's shy).

* **We've never spent time together in a grown up date-like evening.** He has a second job and his family and old friends keep him pretty busy on the weekends, so we've only hung out after work, during the week, and (to top it all off) at our parents' houses because we're both living at home during our internships. Hence, it's kind of hard to even get a hint of a romantic atmosphere when one of our mothers is 50ft away and can probably hear us talking. *sigh*

* **He's told me on a few separate occasions that he really likes hanging out with me and he enjoys our time together.** But that's mostly the extent of the affection that he's shown (again, shyness is a bitch). There was one evening right before Christmas when we hung out and at the end of it he gave me a hug. However, the next time I saw him we didn't hug, but I'm wondering if that was because we greeted and said goodbye in his truck which is large enough to make hugging awkward.



As you can tell, I've probably over-analyzed the hell out of all this, but I'm just looking for some extra insight since I'm (obviously) not very good at these types of things. I have been trying to subtly flirt with him by making a lot of eye contact, touching him when we talk, laughing a lot, etc. but it's hard to gauge his responses.

**tl;dr** He's so nice and shy that I can't tell if he's interested or just really friendly.


Thanks, Reddit! Your advice is greatly appreciated :)


**UPDATE:** He said he's open to the idea of going on a date, but he doesn't think he's romantically interested in me yet - a polite way of turning me down. He did add that he really does like me and thinks we make great friends and I happen to agree. So things didn't go as badly as expected."

I hope this can get some views and commentary.,socialeeinept,ForeverAlone,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/oae26/advice_on_my_situation_if_not_just_read_i_hope/,"I'd just like to preface this by saying that I've fundamentally never really known how relationships work. I've never seen my parents tell each other they love the other. I've never seen them kiss or do anything remotely romantic (they're still together). I've only viewed relationships in the media and amongst a few friends. 


**tldr; I'm forever alone.**


**THE BACKSTORY**
[~2 Years ago]
Basically there's this girl I've know for a couple of years and during the time we were getting to know each other well I would basically talk about her to my best friend not really indicating how much I liked her. I'm not blaming anyone but myself(I saw it coming but was too late) but about a few weeks later they started going out. It's absolutely miserable to have your best friend complain to you about the girl you like.


They dated over a year and during that time we became really good friends. (This sounds lame) At that time this couple became my two best friends. Being a coward, I never let my friend know how it kind of tore me up inside(too dramatic?). I always listened to his problems with her and suggested useful advice. I


tldr; My best friend ended up going out with this girl I liked. 


**NOW**
Throughout the years I've still considered her one of my best friends. 
They've been broken up for more than 6 months and it didn't mean much to me. She was off in another state at a different college. However, now she's working an internship near the city I study in and my interest in her has returned. 


We've been talking casually and she's brought up hanging out in a cheery, exaggerating manner. Things like ""We can hang out all the time!"" She's also asked me multiple times to find her this chick flick for her on the internet that's still in theaters (no screeners). I'm also probably going to be literally the only close friend near her. When we hang out in a group she flirts strongly with me as opposed to other guys. 


**tldr; They broke up. She's in town. Wants to hang out.**


**MY MIND IS FULL OF FUCK**
I'm just going to dump a bunch of things that have been plaguing me.
We've never hung out just the two of us. What if she doesn't want to and or wants a third wheel?
She's talked to me about guys she's previously liked? Friendzoned? Probably. Assuming so, why does she keep flirting with me. Do I perform boyfriend duties while remaining a friend? Maybe. She's called me [adjective] friend e.g. bestest, best. Do I outright ask her out? I'm afraid of ruining our friendship. Do girls just watch chick flicks alone? I'm probably reading too much into it. 


**tldr; I'm insecure. Don't want to ruin relationship by asking her out. Am I too naive to think she likes me?**


Just a tidbit: No one knows how insecure I am, they may suspect it but I've successfully maintained a demeanor of indifference to dating.



**WELL thanks for reading up to this point. Thank you so much.** I know by posting it here it's really just preaching to the choire. I mean you don't really ask people who can't swim how to improve your swimming. I really just needed to get this out. I couldn't talk to my best friend about it and I didn't want to let any of my other friends know how insecure I am. I feel like right now I'm going to ask her to hang out, just the two of us not specifically on a date to get a better feel on the situation.
Excuse, the 1 day old account, people know my redditor username.


Also, the ex, my best friend, is currently my roommate."

They were annoying, but manageable, and they didn't really impact the quality of my life all that much. But when my best friend died from cardiac arrest a few years ago (he had a minor heart condition but it wasn't thought to be serious) that pretty much sent my ""OCD"" into overdrive and now my anxiety is well over 9000.

I'm a junior in college and last year I went to the counseling center to see a therapist for the first time (a little more than a year after he died and I basically went insane). She was an intern so I'm not sure I really got the full experience of being in therapy. She was nice and gave me some handy short-term relaxation techniques (clenching fists then releasing, etc.) but I am definitely not any better for the long-term. She also told me, during our last session, that she was leaving the school, so if I wanted to continue therapy there I'd have to be switched to someone else and essentially start from scratch, which pissed me off to no end. Since then I haven't gone back to the counseling center at all.

I have absolutely *crippling* bouts of hyponchondriasis. Sometimes they just pass when I occupy myself with something like a movie or a video game, other times they lead to full on panic attacks. Because of my friend I have become incredibly obsessive of my heart. I constantly check my own pulse to make sure it's good. But if it's too fast, I freak out. If it's too slow, I freak out. I don't like to sleep directly on my chest because I think that somehow that could put a strain on my heart. Sometimes when I feel a minor twinge or tweak in my chest area I have burp to ""clear the area."" This obsession has basically spread to the entire left side of my body. If I feel something in my neck, I start worrying that a major artery has been severed. If I feel something in my leg, I probably have a blood clot.

To make matters worse, it seems that I have recently developed minor heart palpitations (PAC's). They are supposedly totally benign and a lot of people have them and don't even know it. Except -- I know it. I can feel every single one. Feels like my heart stops for a second, then corrects itself and proceeds normally. You can imagine how nerve-wracking this is for me.

It's getting to the point where it's seriously impacting the quality of my life. I can't go five minutes without worrying about something. My mind races all the time. I have trouble sleeping. I have trouble forming relationships with people. I have trouble focusing in class. I know I need to see a therapist again, but I'm starting to consider that I may need to start thinking about medication options as well.

On top of all this, I have awful obsessions about death (my own, but more often my younger brother's or my mom's) which I neutralize by ""wishing them away"" or doing some ridiculous ritual to make the thought go away. I realize how ludicrous this is but I can't stop doing it. I just can't.

I'm not sure what I'm looking for from you guys. If you actually read through this whole thing and are still reading, I sincerely thank you with every fiber of my being. I guess just telling my story helps a bit. I would like some advice about therapy, or medication, or just any tips or tricks. I'm not depressed, I'm not suicidal, but I just can't deal with this anymore.

My local gym charges alot! Thats not all, my only option would be to sign up to a long contract..... This isn't realistic as I'm not earning - so can't commit and if I get hired Il have to move.

So anyone have any advice? What do you guys do?

Additionally its winter here, gets dark like 3 - I get home at 7. Using the bars at the park isn't ideal. Also I'm interested in resistance exercises not cardio.

My grades have been decent; I have a cumulative A- average. I maintained an A- average (""second honor roll"") in my freshman and sophomore years, but have seen my average grade slip to a B+ this year. I currently have high A's in AP English and my school's college-level Middle East History elective. However, I have B's in first year Greek, third year honors Latin, and AP calculus. I have a B+ from my school's orchestra and string performance course. My science grades from my freshman and sophomore years were both A's.

I have not taken any SAT II's yet -- probably a mistake. I just received my PSAT score, which was a 218. I did not prepare for the PSAT, and expect a better SAT score, between 2200 and 2300. I will be taking the English and AB Calculus AP's this year.

In terms of EC's, I am a co-head of my school's Democrats club, nonpartisan political club, and current events club. I will be a co-head mof my school's Classics club by next year. I also sail (JV -- I started as a Freshman) and started theater this year. In addition, I worked at a restaurant during the summer following my Freshman year, and I plan to intern at a think tank this summer. I write poetry, and attended a writers' conference at Middleburys' Bread Loaf campus last spring.

My main volunteer experience is with Round Square's service project in India. Over the month of July, thirty or so students from all over the world and I helped to build a mud-brick construction school in Kashmir. We also taught English and math classes. I plan to volunteer at a soup kitchen over next summer.


Given my profile, what calibre of schools should I be looking at? I'm hoping to go for a polisci major (weirdly, politics is my passion) if that helps. Thanks!"

This is gonna be unorganized and choppy - sorry. So, I started a new 6 month internship with another girl, Katie, at an automotive company about 3 months ago. We joined a group of all men including 2 male interns. Everyone on the team is great except our douchebag boss. While the boys were working on vehicle builds and tests Katie and I got the task of ""reorganizing"" our lab. This meant we were in charge of literally CLEANING the lab. We emptied/wiped/dusted desks, lockers, cabinets. We were in charge of scheduling carpet vacuuming and calling facilities to schedule equipment and carpet cleanings. He never called us by our names, but girlie 1 and girlie 2. He would introduce us to his bosses and other executives as the girlies. ""No need to call them by their name."" When we would be asked to work on ""real"" engineering tasks he would tell us those tasks are not priority and to find something to organize. When an engineer would give us a task he would redirect it to one of the male interns. When we have tools in our hand he screams across the lab ""what are the girlies doing with a screwdriver?!"" Also, he makes me and Katie check in with him every morning to make sure we come into work on time - by e-mail since we beat him to work. Even though the engineers could vouch for us and we're never a second late. We also have to tell him when we leave. However, the male interns don't have to and they're typically late and leave early. To top it all off yesterday an engineer had a performance review with him. My boss told the engineer that ""some people think that you may have an agenda with the girlies. something not to do with work."" This is only the half of it and it's only been 2.5 months. I'm beyond aggravated. Should I report this to HR? Wait until my exit intern and express my concerns then? Or am I being a GIRL? Lol."

I am very sure that I can obtain a job here after graduation. However, I have been planning on joining the Peace Corps and then going to grad school afterwards.

My Peace Corps plans are falling through (depending on an appeal) due to medical concerns on their part. My work history is all in water, environment, and biology.

There is a career fair with many job openings coming up in February, and career-development opportunities opening up at the [large government agency] this spring as well. 

My main concern is that I have wanted to travel and see the world after graduation, or at least do something cool than grind away at this job. It's close to my family and friends but I have never lived anywhere but Kansas. 

I have the following options:

1. If Peace Corps appeal is successful, volunteer for 2 years and then go to graduate school. No income, but this would be the experience of a lifetime.
2. Continue to work at the [large government agency] close to home, rather dull but it would be stable and I could get a hold on life financially (get out of debts) with a comfy salary and yearly income increases.
3. Apply for out of state jobs which would be less comfortable and certain, but a change in scenery at least
4. ?

I have also considered traveling with jobs that are less marketable when I return, such as teaching english abroad in Korea or China. 

What would you do in this situation? 23, male, been told that there is plenty of time to see the world, also been told that the next 20 years will fly by and if I don't do something cool while I'm young, I likely won't get to"

ocfeg,7,2012-01-11,"Finish as quickly as possible or acquire some more in-
depth knowledge?",_no_mad_nomad_,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/ocfeg/finish_as_quickly_as_possible_or_acquire_some/,"Hi AskAcademia, I have to make an important decision soon and would like some further advice (adding to the advice from family and friends) on what to do. 

Since I am not from the US, I think I have to explain some things before I start with the actual problem.

First off, I'm in my B.A. at the moment, studying in Europe. My major is social/political science, minor is (public) law, but my faculty is very interdisciplinary, so I also had some economics classes. A B.A. here lasts three years, i.e. six semesters. I just returned from an exchange semester somewhere else in Europe which was officially labeled as a vacation semester (to avoid tuition fees etc. - the university suggested to do that). 

I have the choice now of finishing within the next semester, factually having studied then for six semesters, but officially only five; OR I study for two more semesters, factually studying seven then, officially six. This is relevant because if we officially study more than six semesters, tuition fees rise. 

I don't really know now what is preferable. Reasons why I think studying seven semesters would be a good idea:

* since the faculty is interdisciplinary I lack a certain amount of in-depth knowledge in some areas, so another semester would give me the chance of improving that
* no further tuition fees because I'm legally not extending my B.A.
* a unique chance being at university to develop further as a scholar and a person so I should not rush through it as fast as possible but use the opportunity to become a GOOD scholar
* I could take more methodology/research methods classes which I think are very important
* I could further improve my grades (I do not know how that GPA works, but on a scale from 1 to 5, where 4 is pass and 5 is fail, 1 being the best, my average is 1.7 which is already quite good, but it could be better still)
* more time for language proficiency that will benefit me later (mainly looking at French here)
* time for two internships (one in the summer and one next year in the summer between my B.A. and M.A.), further improving my chances of being admitted to a better Master's programme

I'm definitely sure I want to go on with an M.A. (Or MSc for that matter), so studying longer in my B.A. would probably increase my chances of being admitted to a better programme.

On the other hand, I feel like I'm already ""late to the party"" a bit and do not like the thought of ""losing"" another whole year because of one further semester in my B.A. 

So I think the basic question is this: should I try to finish my B.A. as fast as possible because it will look odd/strange/weak to further potential employers if I took ""extra time"", or is it more important to become a well-educated individual with actual skills that took his time to really learn about ""what's going on""? ;-)

From my wording you can probably already guess to what choice I tend more, but I still want to hear what other academics have to say to my decisions ahead. Any comment is heavily appreciated and I thank everyone in advance that took the time to read my text.

Have a nice day!"

oc2eq,7,2012-01-11,I've got a somewhat tricky problem regarding an internship/job.,everythingistakenwtf,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/oc2eq/ive_got_a_somewhat_tricky_problem_regarding_an/,"So I'm 19, a freshman in college, and I'm looking to apply to some jobs over the summer. Obviously my biggest two choices are retail and restaurant work, but frankly I would rather try and get an internship, even if it mostly involves getting coffee. Problem is, I'm a freshman (Business major, btw) and generally we don't get hired by any companies due to lack of skills and etc.

Now my girlfriend's dad owns a pretty large company, and I was thinking of potentially trying to get an internship there. My girlfriend actually did an internship there, during which time she called me to help out at the place, so they know I can work pretty well. The kicker is that her parents don't know we're together. In any case, If I do get an internship there, I would be able to keep it professional. Oh and the gf's mom also works there, she was kind of a boss, not sure in what capacity exactly, but she told us what to do when I helped out.

Anyways, what do r/jobs? I keep thinking of potential disaster scenarios, but this is probably a really good opportunity that I'd like to pursue. I have not talked to my gf about this yet. Any advice? Thanks in advance!"

I've moved to Boston for an internship that lasts through March. I am currently subletting a place I found on Craigslist but the place ended up being unsatisfactory for many reasons (dirty, cold, sketchy roommate). I can elaborate more if needed, but this guy has been known to steal from/scam his roommates and there is no lock on my bedroom door. He knows I intend to leave and has started looking for someone to replace me. I'm terrified that I'll be kicked out before I find a new place to live. I don't know many people in Boston at all as this is my first time in the city. I've been checking Craigslist obsessively but every opportunity so far has fallen through. If you or anyone you know is looking for a subletter, I'd be extremely grateful if you'd put me in touch with them. Here are my ideal circumstances:

* Price: $500–$750 with utilities and wireless (included is preferable)
* Period: ASAP–end of March
* Furnished (with at least a bed, desk, and dresser. I have sheets for a full bed. I don't need much else.)
* With 3 roommates or fewer
* ~30 min or less from downtown Boston (North Station is where I work) in a safe area
* A small or no deposit would be ideal, since I'm not staying that long. I don't mind paying first and last month.

I don't have a car or pets and I don't smoke or drink heavily. I keep normal hours and though I'm very friendly, I don't get crazy or go out too often by any means. I'm a fun and extremely reasonable/quiet roommate. I'd also be gone during some weekends as I visit NYC fairly frequently.

Any help anyone could offer would be deeply appreciated. You can PM me for more information. Thank you."

With the current events and situation in US politics I have been pondering about attempting to enter into it as a career. I'm 20 years old, so I have plenty of time ahead of me to prepare and plan out what I aim to do and how I aim to do it. Where it stands as of right now is figuring what I should do with the time ahead. I've come up with a few examples of things that could potentially increase the overall influence of my lifetime career such as: getting a PhD or masters (enrolled in art school, have the support to switch and go for another degree), taking time throughout the next few years to dive into politics (intern for local politicians, attend city council, etc.), collecting sources and information that will benefit the campaign (keeping up to date and relevant, an example for today would be SOPA/PIPA), and garnering support, funding, advisers, representatives, etc.

I feel as though it wouldn't work as well if I didn't explain what my goals are and how I feel as a person on situations today. My end goal would be to run for President in 15 years. I don't feel confident enough to say if I'm a Democrat or Republican, but I understand that without associating myself with one or the either I would most likely be unelectable (at least in our current times). With that said, here are a few things that I see needing change in America:

- Corporations are not people.
- The Gov't is NOT allowed to bail corporations out of bankruptcy (there may be exceptions but it's rare). 
- The destruction of unions, pensions, and worker benefits is creating a type of ""paid slave"" in current society (under 20k salary/year, insurance for self but not for family, etc.)
- Police brutality results in immediate and permanent removal, and in some cases let go with absolutely NO BENEFITS (in severe cases).
- A Police officer should never be overweight, and should have access to 24/7 trainer/equipment/etc. (because they shouldn't be overweight or even fat, EVER)
- The Gov't will not touch the internet.
- The Gov't was founded on the belief of a free man, not religion.
- NASA funding should continue.
- Other forms of scientific funding should continue/increase (too broad to delve into right now).
- The Gov't has no right to tell you what you can and cannot put into your body.
- Gov't salaries are too high.
- People shouldn't be allowed to live on the streets (read below)
- The Gov't should fund accommodations for those who can't afford a safe, livable home.
- Sales tax should already be added onto products (on a per item system; carton of cigarettes for $60 (12 packs in a carton), sales tax at 8%, $64.8 for the carton, $5.40 for one pack).

I will be updating this list as quickly as possible, please bear with me.


There is a lot more but it's difficult to throw everything out there at once. If you would like to ask me about a current issue that you'd like to get an answer for I'd be more than obliged to answer it. All I want from you fine folks is information and support, help me make this a reality. Any assistance is greatly appreciated, and if you have any questions feel free to post them."

Its a web-based scheduler for application licenses thats built on top of flexnet publisher. I'm using the codeigniter framework for the backend which I really have begun to like for its ActiveRecord method to database access. However, I'm having some trouble with some of the more advanced SQL stuff.

I have two tables, features and licenses which look like this:

features:

    +------------+------------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
    | Field      | Type             | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |
    +------------+------------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
    | scheduleid | int(10) unsigned | NO   | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment | 
    | username   | char(50)         | NO   |     |         |                | 
    | feature    | char(50)         | NO   |     |         |                | 
    | date       | date             | NO   |     |         |                | 
    | start_time | float(3,1)       | NO   |     |         |                | 
    | end_time   | float(3,1)       | NO   |     |         |                | 
    +------------+------------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+

licenses:

    +---------+----------+------+-----+---------+-------+
    | Field   | Type     | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
    +---------+----------+------+-----+---------+-------+
    | feature | char(50) | NO   | PRI |         |       | 
    | max_lic | int(4)   | NO   |     |         |       | 
    +---------+----------+------+-----+---------+-------+

Now that I'm thinking about it, feature should probably be a foreign key. I'll fix that later. For now, I want to insert scheduled features into the features table. Whenever I do that, I want to avoid overscheduling by checking that the # of licenses per time period is less than max_lic. (start_time/end_time is always a half hour block, so I probably could get rid of end_time also). I'm thinking that I'll probably have to make use of MySQL transactions, but I'm not sure of how I should write the query to check for overscheduling. Essentially I would want to do something like this:

Assume:

    myDate = TODAY();
    myFeature = ""gcc"";
    myStart = 9


    (SELECT count(*) FROM features WHERE data= myDate and feature = myFeature and start_time = myStart) 
    &lt; 
    (SELECT max_lic FROM licenses WHERE feature = myFeature).

What would be the correct way of doing this check, then inserting to avoid race conditions and ensure consistency?

(I probably could've graduated last semester, but I'm a video production major and didn't think I had enough experience to warrant graduation and job search, so I took an extra hour while my parents were still paying for school and used it this semester to do an internship I could spend the majority of my time at instead of taking stupid, pointless classes.)

For the last month and a half, I have been KILLING myself trying to find an internship. I've exercised every connection I have (my cousin is a producer in NYC and has connections at ALL the major places, including Colbert, John Stewart, Live! with Kelly and The View and STILL couldn't get me in anywhere.) I made countless phone calls and emails, spruced up my resume and cover letter to perfection and no returns.

I was a total wreck all last week, crying and feeling incredibly depressed for the week before school started. I felt like such a failure. I didn't want to be a disappointment for my parents by not being able to find anything, I didn't want my boyfriend to think I was his loser girlfriend (an idea he quickly exterminated last night during another panic attack) and I was terrified that all of the time and effort I have put into school and previous internships and unpaid practice had gone to waste.

I'd been emailing with a post-production company in my town and hadn't heard back from them in awhile. I emailed, I called, and no one would get back to me. As a last resort, I went back to the place I already had an internship at the past spring and re-interviewed with them. I spent a good thirty minutes bitching to my boyfriend about how I had called this company HE had a connection at and no one would respond to my calls or even send me an e-mail back. I got in a fight with my mom on the phone last night, and ended up a sobbing mess curled into the fetal position on my boyfriend's bed.

After he calmed me down and pried me out of bed for Jeopardy and a cold beer, I opened my laptop and discovered an email from that company. It was the owner, apologizing profusely for not getting back to me sooner and asking me to come in for an interview today. 

I went in, and everyone was immediately super nice and friendly and welcoming. They sat me down and asked me a bunch of questions, and then showed me the kind of stuff I'd be working on. I'm going to be in my own editing suite, they're going to give me real projects to work on and do on my own... I'm not just going to be sitting behind someone and watching them do it. I'm over the moon with joy. I was practically in tears on my way out the door because I'm so excited. I was so terrified things were't going to work out for me, but they are definitely looking up! I just wanted to share! 

edit with tl;dr!

**TL;DR:: After over a month and a half of depression and anxiety over not being able to find an internship and feeling like total shit with no support from my family (and a TON of support from my wonderful SO), I landed my dream internship at an AMAZING company where I'm going to get some great experience.**"

1) GPA, it's not great. I just checked my most recent transcript and I have a 2.667. My major gpa is not any better unfortunately. I did just get a 3.006 this semester, and I am on the up and up, but I do not know how best to convey this in a resume.  I know it is a great debate whether to put a low gpa on there or not. I would love to get some more opinions on the matter.

2) I don't have a ton of work experience in the field. my android developer position is a small job for a friend of mine, but most definitely my most relevant experience. I am not sure what else to put on here to be able to take those other jobs off, but I am also not sure they are doing me much good.

3) I have worked on some projects just for the hell of it that I think are pretty cool, but not sure where they would go on here. For example, I built a MIDI controller from scratch and performed a song on it. I threw this under 'other skills' but it was a rather technical project...

I have access to the program and a guide book, so here's my question:  Would I be wasting my time trying to teach myself the program?  Obviously it couldn't hurt to try, but will I be doing much good here?  I don't know exactly what you guys do with it, but I'm assuming you don't just draw weird shapes with pline (I worked through a couple chapters so far, and that's it).  If you could give me some advice about this plan to learn it in general, and maybe some areas of focus (what to pay attention to most if I go ahead and try to teach myself), that would be great.


**tldr: Would it be beneficial to try to teach myself AutoCAD?  If  so, what should I focus on?**

Thanks in advance!"

I am currently working full time, in house at an ad agency as a contract designer. This is my first paying contract design gig and I started as a paid intern last Spring. 

I am currently working on a big project with a huge scope. My contract has already been extended on two separate occasions. I am due up again at the end of February, but I just received an email from HR about being extended again through March.

The thing is I am still being paid at an intern rate ($15/hour). I plan on emailing back asking to negotiate a new pay rate. I work with several other contract designers (including a good friend who was shocked at what I was being paid) that are paid at least twice what I do. Is there anything I should know before essentially asking for a raise?

TL;DR: Is there a good way to ask for a raise as a freelancer?"

Advice is welcome! ,Cosmicchris,PublicRelations,https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicRelations/comments/oe6jv/how_important_is_it_to_have_a_variety_of/,"I am currently studying Public Relations and I've found myself in a bit of a twist. 

I've been chosen for a fantastic internship with a company that I love. The hours are long and there is no pay(a stipend wasn't offered up front, but also wasn't asked for)but I still feel as though the opportunity outweighs the monetary repercussions. 

The company is about an hour away from my university, so I will ultimately be paying to get to the internship. I'm a little concerned that as a senior I should be working to save some money for when I graduate. 

I've had an internship already and I've worked for several years doing non-profit work with two separate organizations. The agency where I would intern offers reputation and crisis management, which I have never experienced and would like to. 

The cherry on top is that I've recently had some health problems and I quit a job because the doctor asked me to take it easy. I want the internship terribly but I'm caught between the money and the health issues. 

How important is it that employers see I've participated in more than one internship? Will this make a big difference in the hiring process?

Opinions are welcome. Thanks in advance for the advice!"

I'm an engineering undergrad from Asia and I've freshly applied for this [interdisciplinary program](http://tppserver.mit.edu/index.php?id=55) (Engineering + Policy) at MIT. 

The thing is, for my application, based on my personal evaluation (I try to be very hard on myself), and comments from friends

- my essays are good, if not great
- 4 referrals (*1 from a prof in charge of academics, 1 from a prof under whom I did research, 1 from a professional, and 1 from a colleague in a student organization*)
- my GRE scores are pretty ok (*88 percentile*) but not fantastic for AW
- luckily, IELTS scores are maxed
- resume is full of experiences in broad areas of interest (*research, corporate internships, extra-curricular activities, competitions with wins, leadership roles etc*)
- overloaded graduation requirements almost close to double degree requirements
- *plus* a Minor

**BUT** my grades aren't fantastic. GPA is 3.9-ish out of 5.

Am I hoping for too much to get in? I want to know because... I've been obsessing about this, losing sleep even and I want to move on if I could have someone tell me if this is a realistic possibility or not.

P.S: It'd be great to know of any similar programs anywhere in the world that I could apply to. I'm quite certain this is my *calling* as it were.

You don't need to go to a fancy 4-year college.,runblue,teenagers,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/odyox/as_a_nonteen_can_i_make_a_suggestion_you_dont/,"When I was in highschool, all of my friends in AP classes were competing over who would go to the nicest, most prestigious university. They wanted to study things like philosophy and art. 

I bought into it. I did food science at a 4 year university. Now? I can't find a job. Do you know who does have jobs? Nurses and IT people. I thought community college was for people who didn't know what they wanted to do or were trying to save up more money to transfer out later. But in the end, they were smarter. Why? Because you don't need history 101. You just don't. You don't need 20 hours of electives. You need to know what you will use on the job. You can watch documentaries and wikipedia shit on your own time, you don't need to pay thousands of dollars for that information anymore. 

Yeah, there are a lot of things that you do have to wade through 4 years for. But don't do it because it is what your parents expect. If you do 8 years of school, be damn sure that that is the only way that you can ever be happy. Don't spend extra time and money paying for something that a Tech school can give you equally well. If you do need to go to a 4 year college, don't go out of state or to a more expensive private school. Make sure that it is accredited, and then go to the cheapest one available. You do not need to go 5 states over because whatever school is ranked 5 points higher and will look better on a resume. No job cares. It is not worth 10,000 extra dollars.

In the real world, college doesn't matter, only experience does. Get as many internships as you can. My dad tried to tell me this and I didn't listen.

Hopefully the economy will be better for you guys. Good luck.

EDIT: a lot of you are right. I am not saying that you should not go to a 4 year university. I am just saying that you don't NEED to in order to be a happy and successful contributing member of society. You can have equally prestigious jobs not going to a 4 year college. Make sure that you have accurately assessed the job market, the college course program, and what you want out of college before you go. If you don't want to do these things, wait until you do to make these sorts of decisions. **Going to college is not ""just what comes after highschool""**"

Goal 1) Employment.

Goal 2) Fatherhood (after #1 / after finding a goal in life / after learning to be mature enough to raise a child.)

Goal 3) Some sort of graduate degree.

(I don't necessarily want to be a father before I attain employment or post graduate education.)

If I've posted it wrongly in either one, please let me know and I will remove the offending thread.


I had a pretty rough first semester in college (academic probation, retaking a class) and now I'm afraid my GPA is going to be prohibitively low for job hunting. However, I want to work this summer (preferably some kind of internship, but realistically speaking I will be taking a minimum wage part time job) and don't know how to get started. I've applied for jobs before, but only at places that mostly hired high school students, so I don't know how to apply in the ""professional"" world.

I guess my main questions are:

How do I find openings? Do I email places I'm interested in? Would a Linkedin account be helpful (I only know it's for business networking, but not many details)? Will I be given a chance to explain my GPA (it's not actually a good reason, I was overwhelmed by college), or would it not matter to them?

Is it possible for me to find any position that will help prepare me for my future (I hope to be an engineer), given how low my GPA is? My biggest concern is that potential employers will see my GPA and think I won't be a good worker.

I'm sorry if I'm coming about this all the wrong way, but school is basically all I've known my whole life and GPA always defined worth and intelligence at my high school, so that's all I know about the world to be honest."

So I'm in Computer Sciences right now. I was always more interested in humanities and social sciences in High School, but I did not see myself finding a job after University with that. I thought business, but it never really appealed to me. Then I found out about computer sciences, and thought, hey, I like computers! This sounds like a great idea!


And it's been ok, but I'm quite frankly getting sick of it. And I'm only three years in. I can't stand the culture, and I feel disinterested in many of my classes. I can program, but it feels so empty and hollow. I honestly can't see this being my life. Plus, I've completely lost my interest in video games in the last year which was where I wanted to work (cliche, I know, but at least there's an ounce of creativity in that field).


So this semester, I'm also taking a few courses that belong in something called ""Humanities Computing"" or ""Digital Humanities"". These concern themselves with science fiction, the history of computers, and the social influence of computers and video games. I *love* these courses, especially the social influence part. I actually want to go to class now.


I stopped to think about what interests me, and looked at a few of my University's grad school options. One of them is sociology. It sounds damn interesting. I've always been interested in different subcultures. I find computer and video game nerds especially interesting. And I've always wanted to be a professor...


But seriously? I'm quite sure a sociology after-degree would take at least another two or three years after my current one, then if I wanted to become a professor that's for sure six years of grad school. That's possibly nine years! I'll be in my thirties. Not to mention the risk of not finding a job, or failing grad school outright. 


I am for sure finishing the Comp Sci degree. I have a 1.5 year internship coming up, and then I have a year of school after that. I've put too much work into this to just stop now, and I have too many people counting on me. 


But I do not want to program for the rest of my life. I feel like I've already sort of screwed up my life and I'm only 20 years old. 


Has anyone been in a situation like this before..? What would you do?"

I'll try to be as brief as possible without skipping vital info. I can give more details if needed.


I am studying Aeronautical engineering in a well known Brazilian university. Government just announced last year that they'll be paying for brazilian students to go study or have an internship abroad, pretty much in any country around the globe. Basically, all I need is language knowledge and a letter of acceptance by the college or university -- in the same engineering field -- that would agree in having me for 6 months, or 1 year.
So I am out in the look for a professor who is needing help with any project in the aeronautics area. It is actually free help, since Brazilian government will pay fully for my stay (they are desperate, I know). Any company in the aeronautical field, with connections with a college/university (so it's a student internship, not a working one) is in the deal too. I'm looking for a place in the U.S., since I've already lived there and know my share of english.
I thank you in advance, for reading through all this. If you know any professor or company in the aeronautics field, that is willing to accept an extra hand and help a graduate student, please let me know via PM or comments below.

Recently, I've been offered an intership at a prestigious medical school (I'm not going to give the name for legal reasons) and am really excited to go. As a student in highschool, I think the opportunity would be really rewarding as I hope to some day have a job in the medical field. I am scheduled to intern during the summer for approximately 4 weeks. During which, I will, not only work with MDPHD doctors, but experiment with blood samples and extra DNA (kind of a nerd, but I LOVE this kind of stuff).
Normally during the summer, I attend a summer camp for 8 weeks (basically takes up my whole summer). I've made a bunch of great friends there and have a strong connection with the place. If I was to accept the internship, I would be unable to go to camp. This summer would be my last summer ever to be a camper at this camp. All of my friends and I have been looking forward to this summer ever since we started going. There's a lot of myth and excitement about being there this summer; we get tons more privileges than the other campers and everyone remembers THIS summer. 
I don't want to let down my friends, but I think the opportunity at this medical school is too important. My parents, though very supportive, haven't really leaned towards one decision or the other and I'm having a really difficult time deciding what I want more. Do I take the internship, and lose the summer with some of my closest friends? Or do I go to camp, but lose the intership at the medical school? Any help/advice would be greatly appreciated. "

Need help figuring out what to invest in with a Roth IRA,strikerpro10,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/od8cl/recent_college_grad_with_new_job_need_help/,"Hey all, I have been lurking for a while and I was hoping I could get some opinions on my investing goals.

I just graduated college with no debt, no student loans, and a well paying job in my industry. I currently have 3k in cash which is the start of my emergency fund which I will continue to grow. I will be doing 401K matching with my company and anything extra I want to put in a roth IRA. 

I have around 12k invested in a brokerage account at Schwab. I started investing in mutual funds years ago while I was working internships and other jobs. I recently (within the last month before I started working) reinvested and balanced my holdings doing a ton of research and getting a well diversified portfolio in that account with ETFs and a few mutual funds.

My question about the Roth IRA is that I sometimes get hung up on how my money is performing and I want these retirement accounts to be worry free. Should I just stick my money in a vanguard target fund or should I go with a diversification of some total stock, bond, and international funds? I figured that since I will probably contribute a flat ammount with each paycheck to the roth that a fund would be better than an ETF because I can buy partial shares.

I don't want to get hung up on tracking the performance of my retirement savings too much and I do want to make the 401k and Roth a priority and just use the Schwab account to more actively invest if I can afford it going forward into my life. Is the target fund the best play here or could I benefit from a bit more involvement on choosing some specific investments my part?"

A few weeks ago I decided to look for and take a new internship. I applied for one at a local start up and a few other places around my college town, and get an offer for 14 an hour as before I was making ten, at a cool start up.

The day after I accepted the offer from said start up I got another internship offer for 22/hour from a IT company. 

I told the IT company sorry, and started at the start up. I did not enjoy my first few days, and am beginning to regret my choice.

I am worried however that the IT company will be worse, as there are NO women, I work from home part of the time, and I would be the only person under 30 working there. But the pay is amazing and it seems like a good gig.


I do not know what to do. I am torn. Any advice?

Tl;dr, I got two job offers one from a start up that pays less and one from an IT company that pays more but is boring. Advice?"

I built my first computer when I was 16, and made some pocket change doing odd jobs around my community. I earned my CompTIA A+ Certification in 2010. 

Now, I'm a Computer Science senior at a state school in PA. I'm 21, and going to graduate in May (unless for some reason I fail to pass all m classes). My school concentrates primarily in Java, while teaching you some C++/C (this is our basic/intro programming class), and COBOL (yes, they still teach that). Right now, I've been independently working on an Android App (which probably 60% finished, as I just completed the database-end of it).

My skills in more detail:
---------------------
Intermediate Java - decent understanding of Abstraction, Inheritance, etc. Have experience doing HTTP socket work, GUI/Swing.

Android - Getting close to completion with first app. Using Eclipse/SDK

Adobe Fireworks and Flash - I've done some independent stuff with Flash, and I minored in Communications Media so I have some Fireworks experience. Makes for some better ""programmer art"".

COBOL - Took a required class in COBOL. Know roughly/decently how stuff works.

Database - Basic experience with Oracle and a good bit with SQL. Know SQLite somewhat due to Android. Know how to normalize somewhat, ER diagrams, etc.

-------------------

I've only applied for a few jobs recently, but I've had a certain bank shown interest in hiring me (they called me the next day) for a COBOL internship position. It pays decent, as well. I'm worried about getting stuck in a rut though, as I'm not passionate about COBOL at all. I told them I would get back to them.

Since I was young, I've also been into gaming. It became a stress reliever during certain parts of my life. Therefore, I've been interested in game development. I've had a course with it involving Unity 3d, but I thought the class was useless. I have done research in the game industry, and i know alot of people tend to warn others not to get caught in it, due to long hours, deadlines, etc. I still have a huge passion for the field though.

Any advice on what specifically to watch out for? With my experience, what kind of jobs do you think I could take on? I see many jobs that want years of experience for a low level position. I live near the Pittsburgh area, but I'm definitely willing to travel.

The Economic Consequences Of Being Young

In March of 2009, the famed animated adult cartoon South Park aired an episode addressing the global recession.  In the episode, young Stan interrupts his father, Randy, from watching television.  He asks “Dad, why isn’t there anymore money?” Randy, a caricature of the modern middle class American, replies, ""it's simple economics, Stan.  I don’t understand it at all.”

South Park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker, renown social critics with influence among young adults comparable to that of Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert's, echoed a troublesome discomfort many Americans have with economics and the laws that attempt to contain it.  Often times the only direct interaction we have with the laws that govern our wallets are when we pay our taxes, which are done either by hiring professionals or by following the same sort of step-by-step instructions we use to make boxed macaroni and cheese. Public school curriculums may require one semester of basic economics, completely forgoing financial literacy, attempting to offer students a grasp on extraordinarily complex issues that even those with bachelor’s degrees in economics are ill-equipped to confront.  Young adults are cast off into the world entirely devoid of any knowledge regarding one of the most important institutions in the country.

But as uninformed as we are, we must ask if anybody really understands some of the processes that led to this recession.  Only a small minority of professional economists predicted the arrival of the global recession when the sub-prime housing market collapsed. So-called “toxic assets” were bundled and traded and juggled so often that, at points, nobody knew who actually owned them.  

Beyond assessing the judgment of the experts, the sheer complexity of this issue is overwhelming for the average American.  The core problem of economic instability is fused to other major problems like healthcare, poverty, and unemployment, creating a grotesque monstrosity we ask our representatives to slay.  Meanwhile, like any other predator, the monster feasts on the old and the young, those finishing high school and college, those surviving on increasingly strained social security.  These are the core supporters of the Occupy Wall Street movement, and their anger is justified.

If the legacy of our grandparents' generation is their valor during World War II, and our parents’ is the turmoil of the sixties, enduring the Great Recession and the War on Terror might just be ours.  But merely enduring is not enough.  We're obliged by the great legacies of our forefathers to fight any and all injustices we encounter.  But exactly who or what are we fighting? An intangible system of economics that not even the government can wrangle?  That’s the frightening part.  Nobody seems to be able to answer that question.  Wendy Cunningham, a specialist in youth development at the World Bank in Washington, writes “The only surefire cure for youth unemployment … is strong, sustained economic growth that generates so much demand for labor that employers have no choice but to hire the young. Economists have been breaking their teeth on that goal for decades. If we knew how to get growth right we’d win the Nobel Prize.""

So much for the experts.  Looks like we're on our own.  That's scary stuff, especially when we can no delude ourselves into believing we exist outside of the economic realities of the planet; especially when you consider all of the other aspects of young people’s lives affected by unemployment.

This is a deeply personal issue for a lot of people.  Unemployment robs people of their dignity.  This appears especially true for the ""Occupy"" folks who just spent eight years in high school and college under the assumption that they'd actually get to use the skills and knowledge they worked so hard to acquire.  With only a bachelor’s degree, they're under-qualified for most professional jobs and overqualified for menial jobs.  They exist a sort of netherworld, desperately scavenging for the few jobs they think you can get along with hundreds and hundreds of their compatriots who are stuck in limbo with them.  A year of this takes its toll.  You stop going to parties because you can no longer bear the question “What do you do?”

Many have pointed to the unbalanced cost/reward ratio of college and have begun to preach against the virtues of a college education, after which a twenty two year old might find themselves with one hundred thousand dollars in loans and a degree that can't find them a job that earns more than twelve dollars an hour.  Does this mean college is a waste of time and money?  No.  Slacking your way through college and taking only easy classes is a waste of money. But a big part of the problem is that college degrees are subject to the same economic conditions as everything else.  The more people that have something, the less that something is worth. And unfortunately, many universities have been perfectly happy to dilute the significance of a college degree in order to accept more students and the tuition revenue they bring.  And there's not much that can be done because college degrees are required for most professional careers.  

This may not be a problem that the government can solve.  Perhaps the only thing one can do is to figure out what you love doing and work harder than everybody else.

ofs6f,4,2012-01-13,"I can't bring myself to do it because of the body it leaves, but I give up.",throwaway5554321,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ofs6f/i_cant_bring_myself_to_do_it_because_of_the_body/,"I give up because there's nothing left for me here. And I don't believe in any afterlife, but hell if I care, because rotting in the ground seems more productive than what I've turned my life into.

All I ever wanted was to make some friends and maybe do something with my life. I struggled through all of elementary and middle school because I was the ""nerd"", the kid who loved school and loved video games. I grew up with three friends to my name, and loads of friends who used me, who were only my ""friends"" to help get homework done or get ahead themselves. I had shit stolen, I had my finger broken, I had death threats written to me, all because I thought these people were my ""friends"".

But the three I talk to became 6 in High School. I was so happy -- my group of friends doubled. Both groups of friends were a blast to hang out with. But the shit continued to be flung at me, that I wasn't good enough to hang out with other people. I was the butt end of every joke. Even the senior year yearbook had not one, but three pictures of me in an embarrassing situation. My 12 years of education were hell.

And through it all, I discovered, I have no talent. I have no skill for anything. Anything I put myself towards is just a waste of time, because I'll never be good at it. And the only thing that makes me happy, drawing things, is a waste of my time. No one appreciates if I draw something for them. No one even acknowledges I do it.

Yet I threw away my college education for it. I didn't want to do medical school or law school like my parents wanted. I wanted to be an artist. All 6 of my friends immediately started giving me shit about it, that I would starve, that they couldn't believe they were hanging out with someone who wanted a ""shit degree"".

I got accepted into the first college of my choice. I was, once again, extremely happy. It was a renowned school. I had to uproot my life and move across the country to the west coast, but fuck it, this is what I thought would make me happy. I discovered through the next 3 years (haven't graduated yet) that, without fail, I am the worst artist of the bunch in my classes. I'm nowhere near as good as them.

I'm nowhere near as good as my brothers. They draw furry porn. Yeah, I said wit, and I'm not lying. And yet, what little ""clean"" stuff they shows my parents, they love. They draw wolves or some shit that my parents have gotten framed and hung on the walls. When relatives or strangers ask who drew them, they will beam and let everyone know, ""Oh, my two eldest sons!"" When they ask about me, the youngest? ""Oh, he's... Well, he's... Anyways, you should see some of the other stuff they've drawn! Let me go get the book."" I shit you not, I'm consistently thrown to the side by my own parents.

So a recap so far: My friends threw me aside because I wanted to do what I like doing, my parents put my two older brothers on thrones while not even acknowledging what I do, nevermind the fact they've made THOUSANDS OF FUCKING DOLLARS DRAWING PORN OF FURRY PEOPLE. They don't even have the fucking courtesy of using a reference, oh no, they just draw the smut, broken limbs and all, because it's ""sexy"". So I bust my ass trying to improve, because I'm always the worst in my classes, and I get not a single soul letting me know that, ""Hey, you're doing better than you were previously!"" It's like, ""You could actually try and draw space battles or fantasy characters or whatever, but you're probably better off just drawing furry people getting it on. I mean, it worked for your brothers. Who cares if you hate furries, you're poor and pathetic anyways.""

So I figured I would ignore them. It gets better, that ad campaign said. I mean, I know it wasn't directed at me, but they have to be onto something. It has to get better, right?

Nope!

I sat myself down and thought, really thought, ""What can I do with the skills I'm trying to learn?"" I love movies and video games. I love the stories they can tell, the animation, the emotion they can evoke in people. So I thought, ""I'll try and get an internship with a company that works in entertainment! That way, I will have even the slightest foot in the door!""

That'd be great, except I was turned down by every single one I applied to. Even the local west coast, smaller-business animation studios, the ones that produce shitty children's cartoons, don't want me. I'm apparently so bad at what I want to do that not even a children's cartoon, not even a good one but one that is just mindless drivel, doesn't even want me.

So what do I do? I'm a waste of everyone's time, it seems. I'm not even good enough for my own parents! So what does it matter? I just want to end it, but I'm sick of wasting everyone's time. I want to end myself in a way that won't leave a mess, but that's nigh impossible. That's literally the only thing keeping me going is knowing that there would be a body that someone has to deal with. But that won't last forever. I get closer with every time I feel like this.

I give up. I just want this to stop. 23 years of hell, and the last time I was truly happy was when I was back home with my friends, the friends that won't even speak to me anymore. I give up. What good am I?"

ofs3h,19,2012-01-13,Why I Love Polyamory,housepage,polyamory,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/ofs3h/why_i_love_polyamory/," I moved out to Seattle to intern in 2009 to intern at Amazon for a second summer. After about a month in town, I met a lovely, kind, and open-hearted girl, *Sally*, and soon enough, we hit it off. I had until this point been in one relationship in my life with a lovely lady named *Meg*. About halfway through our first date, she laid it on me. ""I am not single. I actually have a boyfriend at home,"" she said and set about explaining to me about polyamory. Up until this point, I had barely even heard of polyamory much less thought about being in a polyamorous relationship. However, this girl and I really hit it off and I decided to open myself up to the possibility that it could work. 

Soon enough, I met her long time partner, *Frank*. *Frank* turned out to be a software developer like myself so we found common ground almost immediately. However, it took me a while to get to know him. He was fairly quiet and worked long hours over in Redmond. As I spend more time with him, I found that he was a fantastic, caring guy and I could see that he cared deeply for the girl I was falling for. We ended up iming each other frequently with interesting computer programming articles and over time developed a close friendship. I consider him to be one of my absolute best friends in Seattle. Funnily enough when our relationship with *Sally* ended, *Frank* and I have stayed on together living as roommates to this day. He is such an important part of my life and an absolute rock for me.

Even as I grew more and more fond of both of them, it was still really hard sometimes. The times when I woke up alone in bed, the times when I was just sitting there in my apartment on the Internet alone while they were having a nice dinner, the times when I was really stressed from something and they were across town together sending me cute text messages. I could not help but be jealous of the fun that he was having with someone I was beginning to care about a great deal.  

However over time, we formed an understanding and a solid web of communication about how we were feeling and communicating about our uncertainties. I felt like I was intruding at first and stepped lightly. I wasn't quite sure where I fit into the elaborate puzzle that was their lives together. They did so many things together. They went to *Sam's Club* together. They took care of their *dogs* together. They had built a home together and they were so beautiful together. There were many pictures of them about. There was a magnet on the fridge from the time they went to *San Diego*. I was awash in their relationship every time I encountered it and I was staggered by it. They had been together for three years and had many stories to tell of the wonderful times they had together. *Sally* always cooked dinner and *Frank* always came home from work and got his beer and they were nice enough to invite me into their home. 

They were amazing enough to  welcome me into their lives with open arms and I am eternally grateful to them both. They introduced me to this new city and gave me a solid base to work from. I got to meet their friends and acquaintances. *Sally* showed me all the hidden corners of Seattle and *Frank* always made me laugh with a funny coding story from *Amazon* or a corny joke. They both brought much warmth and happiness into my life and made me love Seattle so much that I decided to make a real go of it here. I moved back here after I graduated and things went amazingly well for a long time. 

We laughed, we loved, we enjoyed Seattle and unfortunately ended eventually over differences of opinion. Both, *Sally* and I and *Frank* and *Sally*, had a few things which we were unable to find a compromise about after much trying. In retrospect, one of the major reasons that I stayed in that relationship for so long was my fear of losing *Frank* from my life. *Frank* had become a close friend, a confidant, someone I could talk to and *Sally*, unfortunately, would have made it hard for us to interact on any sort of regular basis. However, we both decided that we had the same differences with *Sally* and parted ways and in the end, I got a best friend, two years of magical adventures with a lovely lady, and a healthy understanding of how much another human being can love someone you care about deeply and the deep bond that can form between two such people. I am forever indebted to *Frank's* openness for all the amazing things that it brought into my life."

This does not describe what I do at all.

This does:

* operates the back end of proprietary technology
* assists in the composing and performing of recorded music used on US and international television stations
* customer service of all kinds
* database management (metadata, and proprietary tech)
* **Perhaps most important:** coordination between development team/IT and customers.  I also organize and do QA work.

I would love to get some serious suggestions, as now I have my own assistant, am rising in the company a bit, and really need something respectable title wise.  It will also facilitate a raise I think...

I always had an ambition to do comics, animations and voice work, but I was always steered to the wrong places. For instance, I ended up going to college for graphic design on the advice I got from counsellers back in High School. As I progressed, I ended up getting an internship at a comic/animation company, but they went bankrupt and I never had the chance at getting further. and I have yet to work within that field again.

After that, I was struggling for 5 years doing menial and abusive retail work where my managers never let me progress and force me to work long hours (even off the clock in some cases). I ended up walking out on one job due to that my one manager told the head of graphic design department there to not bother with me.

During that time I tried to do voice work as I always wanted to, but all I kept doing was expensive classes with a ""promise"" I'd get work. but not once was I called in and they have removed my name from their site. It feels like no one would tell me where these mythical auditions are being held.

During this whole time of trying to make it in this world; I ended up having my condo forclosed and having to live in a basement with my fiance at a friend's house for a year.

Since then, we have moved into a decent apartment &amp; I managed to find a job doing graphics, but it holds no promises of advancement, no paid vacations or days off, no raises, and gives no benefits.

I also have been seeing a private voice coach who is reputable, but it's tough keeping up payments for the classes while worrying about my bills.
--------------------------------------------

At this point, I feel like College was nothing but a waste of time. I since hid away my BFA out of shame. I get paid the bare minimum to pay for rent and a bill or two; my checks get garnished due to that I don't get paid enough to make student loan payments that they're demanding. I have not been able to get insurance or save for my wedding and it's killing me inside that I am not doing enough or making what I should be to have better quality of life.

Only thing I can ask is, where did I go wrong? Why is it so difficult? Where do I go or look to get what I truly want to do? Was College truly a waste of my time?

Forgive me for sounding so demanding and that this post is out of wack, but I want to succeed, I want to really live out my dreams"

I currently have a Datacenter Internship working at an EXCELLENT company. They're consistently top 25 companies to work for in the US. They actively spend money upgrading IT, rather than looking at is as a sunk cost. My main responsibilities include 100% control over the physical aspects of the Datacenter at our company. To put it in perspective we have a top-of-the-line DC, but only ~40 racks (not including UPS-related ones). They have no problem trusting me to transport ~$30,000 between DataCenters in different cities on a weekend trip. A lot of my duties are on the software side of things also (provisioning servers, VMs, troubleshooting, etc). We also have 5 full time competent System Administrators. I would say I'm pretty much already a Jr Sys Admin, without the title.

Question, in depth: This internship is a 1 year commitment which is over in May. I'm pretty much guaranteed a job with this company doing SOMETHING. They often have IT helpdesk positions open which include on-site and remote support. The liklihood of my getting a job as a Sys Admin there after this internship is unlikely, but I might be able to find something else higher up than a helpdesk position. Anyway, the question is this: Should I stick with this company and work my way up through helpdesk positions to get to a Sys Admin position, or take my chance and try to get an actual Jr. Sys Admin position with another company? My concern is that I'll end up at some company who doesn't care about IT with a bunch of incompetent people.

**TL;DR Work for an AMAZING company as a DataCenter Intern. When my internship is over should I stay with them and get a lowly Helpdesk Technician job and work my way up to a Sys Admin role, or try and get a Jr. Sys Admin role with another (less amazing) company?**

I'm halfway through my term, and I have 4 months left to make a better impression. So far I've been known as the hard-working, quiet gal;  I don't mind this, but I'm worried that people find me anti-social.

To add to this, my boss isn't too keen on my right now. He treated the last intern in the same position I'm in now as practically his niece. According to a coworker who worked closely with this intern, my boss took her under his wing and helped her with everything, but he's making very little effort to make me feel welcome (gives vague advice, barely acknowledges me in the hallway).  I have a feeling he finds me too quiet.

Reddit, I'm running out of time. I have good work ethic but my shyness and lack of knowledge of the office life isn't helping me at all. Do you have any good advice?

With a GPA of 3.0, I'd need a VERY good score on the MCAT combined with good recommendations from the internships I've held as an undergrad to have a shot at medical school admission. Part of what took me so long to decide whether to go for it was fear of rejection.

And now my other friends are saying they're leaving at 6 now, and too bad for me I shouldn't have scheduled the appointment. Now I'm missing out on this awesome road trip that I've been looking forward to all winter break all because my ""friend"" is an asshole who can't wait 5 hours to leave.

My last quarter (which would have been Fall quarter of my fifth year) I got straight Fs, and failed out. Afterwards I re-enrolled back the following year, but with really poor grades mainly Cs, a D- and an F. I ended with a 3.23 GPA. It's been a year since I graduated, and I've spent the past year mending my fragile psyche.

Having said that, I have a few research internships under my belt (one with a professor of mine, one with IBM, and one with NASA, which was this past summer). I have two professors who are writing my LORs and the third is a branch head at NASA that I had worked under (she really liked me!). I applied to UC Davis, UC Irvine, and University of Maryland. Please give me some feedback on my prospects for admission and whether I should also apply to their Masters programs since the application deadline is the 15th.

While I expect form responses, maybe their interns will take the time to actually read my letters.

---

Senator [    ],

I am writing to you regarding US Senate Bill S.968 (Preventing Real Online Threats to Economic Creativity and Theft of Intellectual Property Act of 2011). I am urging you to vote against this bill. When you vote later this month, know that your constituents are watching and please consider the following:

1.	The Protect IP Act will threaten the vibrancy and freedom of the Internet:
There is nothing more important to the cause of spreading Democracy around the world than the protection of Internet freedom. The Internet is the great equalizer; and if we have learned anything from the recent events in the Middle East it is that content-sharing web technologies can be incredibly powerful tools for building communities and sharing ideas. If this bill is passed the United States will join the likes of China, Russia, and Iran— by using censorship, regulation, and arbitrary enforcement of ambiguous laws to limit the creative and social potential of the Internet.

2.	The Protect IP Act will discourage investment in American businesses
Recent studies have shown that this bill will discourage venture capitalist investment in American Internet startups. The risk of government interference will push these opportunities oversees along with countless American jobs—if there is one thing that frightens investors more than risk it is uncertainty. Because PIPA and SOPA are so ambiguous, they could be applied at will to foreign and domestic websites—blocking sites without so much as a trial.

3.	The Protect IP Act will not stop online piracy
The Internet will find a way. The few people dedicated to online piracy will not be stopped by any number of regulations. Even sites that are removed will still be accessible by using IP addresses. This bill will punish legitimate companies and users instead of those responsible for copyright infringement or intellectual property theft. 

In conclusion, I am urging you to vote against US Senate Bill S.968 because it violates the basic principles of due process and freedom of speech, hinders American business, and frankly will not be effective. The Internet is too important to become a victim of corporate greed or misguided litigation. This bill and its implications for the future are too important to be pushed through congress before it can be fully explored. 

Thank you for your time,

[SOPA_NOPA]"

The programs will be handling sensitive data so I don't really want a company that paid to have it's name placed at the top of a search return (unless it's actually quality software).


Here's what I'm looking for:

&gt;&gt;File Synchronization

I wouldn't mind having something that maybe I can setup on a server at my house so it's a completely personal VPN connection.

I've come under a bit of bad luck in my life and my mother is forcing me to move out of the house this summer. I am in college during the regular times of the year, but during winter and summer break I live at home. 

I've been thinking about whether or not I should bring it up with my boyfriend if I can stay at his house over the summer. I would get a job and pay some rent and for my food and everything; I'm not trying to bum off of him. I know he would say yes in a heartbeat. 

But here's the catch: The relationship is still very new, as in less than 6 months old. I don't know if this would be a good idea. We're in a steady relationship, very compatible, no real issues. I have stayed at his house before (albeit never longer for a week) and we get along great, but obviously that's not the same as living together for four months. 

I am wondering if it would be wise to consider this a viable housing option or not. Right now I'm really leaning towards no, but considering my unimpressive resume (only ever had one job before) and lack of any sort of funds, I'm not sure what I can do. I'm trying to get an internship with housing somewhere, but as a college freshman I'm not sure I'm competitive enough to make the cut for most of these internships."
oepjj,2097,2012-01-12,Are you guys REALLY contacting your Senators? Not from what I'm seeing. The phones were quiet in my Senator's office today. GET OUT THERE AND CALL ABOUT PIPA/SOPA,IWorkForASenator,politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/oepjj/are_you_guys_really_contacting_your_senators_not/,"Throwaway

Frankly, I don't believe people are calling. I work in a Senator's Office (I won't name which) and I only got a handful of calls about SOPA/PIPA. And that's AFTER we had about 2-3 front page posts on Reddit about them. We talk a big game, flaunt our shit, but in reality, are we doing anything? **CALL YOUR SENATOR OR REPRESENTATIVE.**

I know some of you have sent letters and emails, and I am thankful for those. But the reality is that letters and emails take a ton of time to process, sometimes even months (depending on the office). It's even worse if a senator is well known and gets a ton of letters already (McCain, Kerry, Reid, Franken, Sanders etc...). Phone calls are instant. They take up time.

Here are some tips to help your call make a difference:

* If you call the Senate, call it ""Protect IP Act"". If you call the House, call it ""SOPA""
* RESPECTFULLY AND CONCISELY voice your concern.
* Offer examples, solutions, and express how this is a voting matter.
* Call YOUR Senator, then MAYBE call out-of-state senators. Some offices only take into consideration opinions from their own constituents.

Those are the tips I can offer. I hope you take them into consideration. Get out there and make a difference. Show the voice of the American people matters.

**Edit:**

Thanks for the response guys! A lot of you have been asking ""What should I say?"". While there have been a lot of great responses to those questions, keep this in mind as well: Simply calling and saying ""I am Joe Schmo from So and So and I am calling to let the Senator know that I oppose Protect IP Act"" is already more than nothing. Trust me. Normally, interns are on the other end of the line and they are just as terrified as you are :). 

Some extra talking points:

* Instead of blocking websites that promote piracy, why not promote incentives that reduce piracy? Spotify, Netflix, Steam, Hulu... We are in a digital age, and holding onto physical media is becoming more and more obsolete
* Explain how Rep. Lamar Smith's website would've been taken down with SOPA/PIPA
* Explain how modern stars like Justin Bieber (bad example) would've never gained recognition if SOPA blocked their content

*Also, phones have voicemail. So if you don't want to talk to someone, call after business hours ;)*"

I am looking for the study/intern abroad experience but I do not need any class or internship credits so I would rather not do it through a college program where you have to pay tuition on top of travel costs. I would like to travel sometime this summer.

I would love to find an opportunity to live work (or volunteer) someplace for the summer in a school or something else with children. 

As far as where I'd like to go I don't have any strong preferences. I went to on a tour of Europe when I was in high school and would like to go someplace I have never been before (we visited Vienna, Venice and Paris). I think I would like to visit a ""less developed"" area where there is more need. 

Sidebar questions:

I am tolerant toward diverse climates, I am comfortable being a ""fish out of water"", in fact that it what I am hoping for. I'd prefer countryside to cities, but I am not opposed to cities. I will try anything food-wise, although my intestines are sometimes less than appreciative of some of my more adventurous eating. I only speak English but I am comfortable traveling to a non-English speaking country given that there are enough English speaking people that I can stumble through day-to-day communication. I am looking for a living situation where I am not alone, roommates or home stay. 

My question is how to begin searching for a place to visit or how to look for jobs/volunteer opportunities and housing. I have tried Google but the results are overwhelming and I don't know which organizations are trustworthy. "

I'm a 22 yr old, female, college student that should be graduating but isn't. I've transferred 3 times and can't seem to settle on a major.  I live at home still, and don't have a job.  

It's not that I don't want to work, I would love a steady job more than anything, I think mans purpose in life is to work, but I just lack so much motivation to do anything.  I've only had 3 jobs before and all of them have been temporary. 

I think my lack of motivation is mostly due to the fact that I can be very indecisive due to the fact that I want to make the best possible decisions.  This more often than not, leads me to get too caught up in thinking about things rather than just doing them.  I'm terrified of making a wrong decision or doing something incorrectly, so instead I do nothing.  Often, I start thinking strategically to my own detriment.  Example, I may think an internship or job is too advanced for me, or has too many applicants, so I won't even bother to waste my time applying.

I feel terrible for still living at home and not being able to contribute.  My brother and parents think I'm still here because they provide for me and I'm just content.  I'm really not.  I hate it.  I hate even asking for anything from them.  I don't have a car, I never want presents for holidays or my birthday, I never want to go out anywhere because I always need to ask them for money.

I guess thinking about it, my problem right now is that I need a job to pay off my student loans (I don't qualify for financial aid because my parents make too much and I'm a dependent).  I'm only going part time next semester because the tuition is less and I was hoping to be able to work more instead.  But no job yet.  At the same time I'm postponing graduating because I think I should go to graduate school, but I havn't even thought about GED's or what I should apply for yet.

I'm so embarrassed.  I'm afraid of even getting into a real relationship because it would mean admitting these things.  I'm 22, still live at home, don't have a car, still ask my mum to drive me places sometimes, don't have a job.  Who would want that?

I suppose first thing first is to just apply to anyplace, CVS, grocery store, anywhere.  After I hopefully get something paid, then I guess I should look into unpaid internships for the summer. I guess..."

But, when I see a ""minority mentorship program""... a program in which every minority 1st year student is assigned a 3rd year mentor whether they sign up for the program or not, red flags start to go up for me. First of all, it obviously places those students at a competitive advantage simply because of their race, but furthermore, it seems extremely condescending to assume that they would need a ""mentor"" to succeed.

In law school, everything is graded on a curve... everybody could know the material, but the teachers need to assign ~20% As, ~20%Cs, and the rest Bs... in that we're all being compared to one another, I find it really troubling to put certain people at advantages based on race. We're not going to approach the ""post-racial"" society that so many dream about while we still support discriminatory practices.  

So tell me, does this seem unfair, or am I just looking at this the wrong way?

My science grades are terrible, GPA 2.7. Among the sciences classes I've taken, I only have one A, a few B's, a couple of B+'s and B-'s and C's. I'm a senior in college, majoring in Psychology, and I have two quarters left, with space enough for 3 science classes before I graduate. I CAN defer graduation a year to improve my grades, but I feel like a post-bacc program would be cheaper.

My grades are bad, but I think my extra-curricular activities are pretty good. By the time I graduate, I would have completed over 250 hours of shadowing, some of which were for private offices as well as community service volunteering. I've been a research assistant for a psychology lab for 2 years, served as an intern in London also as a research assistant in a psych lab, and I've taken around five workshops/programs that are pre-dental related. On top of this, I clean houses as a job and I am a private tutor for elementary school children.

I haven't taken the DAT yet, and I was thinking, if I did well in the DAT and since my extra-curricular activities are pretty good, would it balance out my extremely low GPA? Or would that take a miracle?

I honestly don't have a good excuse as to why I have low science grades. My psychology classes have really good grades, but that's because they're easier, so I wouldn't know how to explain my bad grades.

Sorry for rambling. I just don't know what to do, and my mom and I just had a huge fight over what I really want to do with my life. Thanks for all the help! :)"

I'm 26 and should know this by now!,rebent,malegrooming,https://www.reddit.com/r/malegrooming/comments/oh2hg/how_the_heck_do_haircuts_work_im_26_and_should/,"I've never really cared about my hair - as long as it wasn't obnoxious or smell bad, I was fine with it.  But I'm about to graduate from grad school and have an internship this semester *as a consultant*, and I don't know the first thing about hair cuts.

[Photographic evidence of my hair at different lengths](http://imgur.com/a/CtZE0#0)

How much are they supposed to cost?  I think $20 is a good price, but the only places that cheep around here (southwest michigan) are great clips and cost cutters etc, and they usually butcher my hair.  I thought about going to a *Hair Salon*, but they charge upwards of $50!  That seems like way too much for me, especially if I'm not going to get any better of a hair cut.

And that leads me to point two: What the fuck, my own hair?  I have... wavy, large-curled hair which comes from whichever ethnicity produced it - dutch or jewish being the most likely culprits.  When it's short, it's all cowlicks.  when it's long, it's a full-on white-boy 'fro.  My classmates and colleagues all have these really great, professional, business-person haircuts but I never think that my hair would lay flat enough for them.  Will having a more-expensive haircut solve this problem?

A related problem is that I never know what my hair should look like.  I go in and they say ""how do you want it cut?""  What I want to say is, you're the expert, you figure it out.  but I don't.  I say ""short on the top and the sides, but don't use clippers.""  Is there some way to figure this out?

And finally, how often am I supposed to plop down my hard-earned cash to get a haircut?  Biweekly?  Monthly?  Typically I get about 5-6 haircuts a year, and it seems like I should get more, but I am so afraid of the whole process that I just don't do it.

**TLDR**: How do you find a place to cut your hair, how often should I get it cut, how much should I pay, and what cut should I get?"

I'm in IT, I've done work as a Network Analyst, Network Security SME, and I'm currently trying to get into the web side of things, work has me designing various sites for deployment on SharePoint, but I'm aware of other platforms as well, have ran personal sites for about 8 years now, mostly Perl based, getting into Ruby now.

Border crossing however, said that I had ""insufficient ties to Canada"", they basically said either I need to own property here, have a job to come back to and set a specific date to come back, or the only way I'm coming in is with a visa of some sort. Also, now I have a record and will be harassed (""scrutinized"" was their word) any time entering or leaving America.

So, back to today. My fiance has to fly back to Mountain View to be at work on Monday, I don't know what to do. I'm asking Reddit for help in whatever way you can... if that's tips on what to do or people to talk to, awesome.... if it's a sponsorship visa to be an intern at your bay area company, ideal. I'm at a loss, I've given up everything to move to the states to be with the person I love to start our life together and just had those dreams crushed by some border guard. Please help :("

ogoko,17,2012-01-14,Why The Time To Build A Wawa At Temple Is Now.,TheHeadiestBrah,Temple,https://www.reddit.com/r/Temple/comments/ogoko/why_the_time_to_build_a_wawa_at_temple_is_now/,"[If you'd care to first check out this heavily relevant article from The Temple News I wouldn't blame you.](http://temple-news.com/2010/11/08/freshman-initiates-petition-to-bring-wawa-to-campus/) 

As many of you may recall, the construction site that's currently blocking half of the sidewalk on Broad St. between Oxford St. and Cecil B Moore Ave. is eventually going to be the home of a multi-purpose complex that will house over 1,000 students along with a considerable amount of space for retail shops. The complex is intended to serve as a ""gateway"" to our fine school for those arriving from center city.

Looking back a few years, Wawa and Temple seem to have developed and maintained a strong, mutually beneficial relationship. Wawa has consistently offered a number of internships and corporate training opportunities to us Owls (I believe mostly within the Fox School) in addition to partnering with STHM (represent), which has provided interns and student volunteers for Wawa-sponsored events as recently as this past July for the Wawa Welcome America Festival.

One can only assume that on an executive/corporate level, Wawa must think somewhat highly of our institution, as licensed by the ongoing nature of their recruiting efforts. Wawa doesn't interview Temple kids for cashier/deli jobs, their objective in recruiting us, as far as I have seen, has been exclusively for managerial or management-track positions. I believe it stands to reason that since Wawa, by their past actions, has clearly embraced the notion of allowing Temple and our alumni to play a considerable part in the day-to-day operation as well as the future development of their organization, that they should in turn be as greatly enthused by the opportunity to become a part of the ongoing development of Temple's community as well.


In writing this I was reminded of the work of two students within my major who completed a semester-long research project as one of our school's requirements throughout this past fall. In this particular class, students are given almost total autonomy as far as picking what to research, this particular pair chose to design their study to explore perceptions of what the student body finds to be lacking from main campus along with what those students would want to see built to address those deficiencies. The most common opinions found in their study (by a fairly wide margin IIRC) were that students believe that campus doesn't have enough options for places to eat and that there are not enough businesses that are open 24 hours a day on campus. In light of their findings, I must deduce that a majority of the students that provided responses to this survey share the sentiment that the time for a Wawa to be constructed at Temple is upon us.

I think there is a strong case to be made as to why the currently-developing site on Broad St. presents the ideal set of circumstances for the introduction of Wawa to our beloved university. Wawa's stores are generally fairly small (~3,000 sq. ft. according to their website) but attract a great deal of foot traffic day in and day out. It could work out to the benefit of other would-be businesses in the new complex in that a Wawa, by it's very presence, would act to provide a constant stream of visitors (potential customers) to the immediate area while leaving a great deal of the physical space open for other businesses to occupy. I'd think that maximizing profit per square foot is in the best interest of any real estate developer, I see no reason why this instance should be the exception.

In spite of these lengthy musings and in spite of my great personal desire to see this initiative come to fruition, there is much reason for  apprehension in that the good ol' online petition method has already been attempted with regard to this cause and has fallen short of realizing its goal. As such, I'm at a loss as to what might be the best way to go back to collecting and subsequently conveying our community's support for this initiative.

To those of you that share in this vision, I'd appreciate any input as to how you think one might make the best effort to organize/utilize our community to make an honest go at this. This semester is going to be my last on campus as an undergrad and I know I'm going to be too poor to donate to the school's alumni fund until I pay my loans off. Regardless, I still want to try to give back and make an effort to leave Temple as a better place than it was when I found it for the generations to come. To that end, I think a Wawa would do quite nicely.

**TL;DR: I dream of a world with touchscreen hoagies and f'real milkshakes for all Owls**

Ill just leave you with my thoughts/where i mentally have arrived at this point in time.

I am currently a year and a half out of college with a bachelors in CRJ and a minor in psychology. Since being out of school i have worked as a security guard in philadelphia at a lvl 1 trauma center. While I enjoy my job and it is interesting/admirable I really think it is time to move up. Also, I was able to completely pay off my loans from my undergrad. 

I thought about it long and hard and I was split between CRJ and psych careers. I had a falling out with the CRJ system and i did well in my psych classes. What was really interesting me was the field of applied behavior anaylsis. The material seems to come easy to me and a professor even picked me and another top student in the class to assist with his research on nicotine tolerance. Also, I even took a personality/job test it basically gave me the same information i had in mind.

So here I am wandering what I should do. I have tried to get jobs or internships in relation to ABA but no one would pick me up. I would like to go back to school but im not sure about a masters or phd and the different options i would have with them.

Any advice or resources would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time."
ogl8w,0,2012-01-14,"Hey Reddit, I'm 18 and insecure about my life. What do?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ogl8w/hey_reddit_im_18_and_insecure_about_my_life_what/,"I suppose I don't really have a reason to be insecure about myself, but here's a little background info. 

I'm a college freshman who's doing well in school so far (3.9 GPA in the first semester). I went to a top ranked public high school in the US and because I slacked off, I now go to a fairly small university with about 6000 people total where I have a few good friends there. I love the professors and my newfound interest in learning, but I can't seem to really fit in socially. That's not to say that I'm not a sociable person. I can get along with people very well, but I haven't really made any friendships that mean something to me. Most of my close friends are all from high school and they're all very smart. All of them ended up in places like Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, and UC Berkeley/LA/Davis. 

I suppose I may have developed an inferiority complex because I spent 4 great years in HS with them. In those 4 years they helped me realize that my education was important to myself, but at the same time, I couldn't/can't stop comparing myself to them. They're all extremely talented people with goals and here I am sort of drifting through life. Sometimes I can't help but feel like I'm not doing enough with my life. I feel like I'm uninteresting even though I've had really fun times with my friends. I'm usually the person they go to talk to about their problems because I always listen and try to give advice, so in turn, I don't end up venting about my worries often because I feel like they're insignificant in comparison. Sometimes when I talk to them, I hear their stories about how fun their lives are and how they're going to parties and enjoying their classes, I can't help but feel jealous and wish that I could find a place where I'm completely comfortable at my school.

Over the last few years, I've switched my focus between varying engineering disciplines (chemical, mechanical, materials) and am now contemplating Computer Science and Engineering. I've considered transferring to another university where I think I would fit in better, but at the same time, I'm worried that I won't be able to do well there. Where I am now, I'm doing very well and am pretty much at the top of my class. I also get along very nicely with my professors, but I don't feel comfortable amongst the majority of the students. It may be an elitist attitude that I have, but I don't feel like I can be friends with people who have even less of an idea than I do about what they want in their lives. I keep worrying about research and internship opportunities and I feel like I'm not taking enough units to compare to my friends.

Tl;dr: I miss the company of my old friends who are essentially sociable nerds, have an inferiority complex, and am undecided about my future.

What can I do Reddit?"

For the past year I've been interning in the IT department of a financial company. It was my first internship, and I did a ton of grunt work with the HelpDesk during that time, but I stayed on because they payed really well and constantly dangled a job opportunity in front of my face. I also believe that I learned more from the internship than I had during some of my later classes, and I made sure that I kept honing my skills during slower periods.

Fast forward a few months. A co-worker, the company's Backups Administrator, mentions he may soon be looking for an assistant. Primarily, he's looking for someone to stagger hours with and take some of the stress that is associated with being the only person responsible for a major part of infrastructure (and so he could accomplish more with some Disaster Recovery related projects). The job may also involve acting as a lackey for some of the other departments (Database administration, UNIX, networking), and I am excited about the possibility of still absorbing more information from these other professionals, especially since I wouldn't be making an intern's hourly wage anymore. Shortly before he considered me for the job, he mentioned this new hire would probably be starting around $60k.

Fast forward to today, and the job is essentially guaranteed (I'm reading the NetBackup literature and everything). No formal talks about salary, however.

So, /r/cscareerquestions, I'm willing to answer any other questions you may have/ heed any warnings. Does this sound like a good opportunity for a new grad, or am I selling myself short?"

Computer Lottery...,[deleted],misc,https://www.reddit.com/r/misc/comments/og9sq/who_knows_maybe_futile_computer_lottery/,"So let me get this out of the way.... I'm sort of looking for a handout/ multiple handouts. My computer just died(May it rest in piece) and I'm having to type this on a Touchpad (gross!). I just moved to DC to live with my aunt and uncle. The good news is that I get to live here rent free but the bad news is that the job that I do have now is only an internship, and an unpaid one at that. I don't want to ask my Aunt and Uncle as I don't want to overextend their hospitality 

So anyway, back to my computer. It just died. And I use it. A Lot. I have a weird plan and was hoping that you guys could help me. I want you guys to buy the parts for my new computer, but after I have a paying job for a few months or a year, I want to give the computer that you helped me build back to one of the people that helped pay. So think of this as a lottery. For every dollar that you put into the computer, you get a ticket into the lottery drawing. So say the total of the computer comes to $600 dollars and you gave me a $60 computer case, you get 60 tickets into the lottery. That's a 10% percent chance of winning a computer in no later than a year. A $110 GPU, gets a 110 tickets(18.3%) But any thing helps. You can donate money instead of actual components or even some parts that you have lying around.

One thing about it how I used my old computer. I liked to play games, I never had them at the best settings, but I managed. I have a lot of music backed up to iCloud(thank god). I was editing softball recruiting videos on it before I moved here, so it would need to be able to that. Well anyways, I don't know how I can prove that I'll give this up when I get a job, but I want everyone to know that I will.

Within a couple of years, it was no longer an internship, but a junior developer position.  Lots of ASP, some ASP.NET, database management, etc.

My second year of college, I began working at a small contracting company.  Despite being in college, my previous experience pretty much made me the senior developer at the company.  I worked on a large variety of projects, directly interacted with clients, spec'd projects, even helped make the sales.  Despite being in college, I'd work 20-30 hours a week, and full time (or more) over my summer and winter break, so I'd say this is very legit experience.

I graduated college a year ago and am still with the same business.  I may be moving quite far away this summer though, and if I do will be looking for a new job.

My concern is this:  Do I represent myself as best I can, with over 5 years of professional experience with a large variety of technologies and projects?  Or does it look suspicious to HR to claim X level of experience having only just graduated college, such that I should write my resume around my education and one year post-college work experience?  I could potentially see myself applying for non-junior/senior level positions, but I'm not sure if my young age will make this a poor choice."

I never really bought weed myself, since I was more of a casual smoker so I usually just chip in some money when a frient goes and gets some. So the whole thing is still kind of foreign to me!

*Relationship Length: 1 year 4 months
*Gender: Male (20 - Me) / Female (19)

I'm currently a college junior (three semesters left) and my girlfriend is a sophomore. Since day one I've been very open to my girlfriend that my education comes first. Where this comes into conflict is when we began dating I was the run of the mill party animal and taking entry level engineering classes. Over the course of the relationship I've changed and I’m now the try hard college school student. This transition this has caused minimal tension with our relationship as I’ve slowly drifted away. The more time I spent on my studies the less time I spent with her. This boiled down to the point where I began seeing my girlfriend roughly only about once a week on the weekends. Where this comes into a shitty situation is in my absence of being a good student my girlfriend quickly bonded with my roommates and personal circle of friends. This means if we did break up it could become quite messy. 

To me it feels like the spark has died. :( Our relationship is just so bland now it’s pathetic. I’ve had this feeling for quite a few months (~4-5) ever since I spent the summer out west alone for an internship. At which point we queue in the twisted tale of the old first high school love, my best friend throughout high school. There has always been a connection between us two. We never dated due to bad timing between relations. Ideally she is the male version of me aka my best friend. (The type of friend who jokes around about getting married, having kids etc.) Her father even refers to me as his future son in law. It’s been a rough three years on our friendship since I moved away to college but not a day goes by that I don’t think about her. 

So…… Here I am wondering what to do. Continue in what feels like to be a lie or do I break it off and chase down this dream girl.

ohjsv,36,2012-01-14,I'm blowing the whistle on Blizzard's ties with British Intelligence,WoW_Whistleblower,conspiracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ohjsv/im_blowing_the_whistle_on_blizzards_ties_with/,"It took me a long time to build up the courage to make this thread. I've had TOR installed for quite awhile, but it took these 12 empty beers on my desk to really bless me with the bravery to tell this tale. A tale we will consider hypothetical, and for entertainment purposes only.

Let's say, hypothetically of course, that I have a brother-in-law who, before deciding to switch professions, served a lengthy internship with MI5 a couple of years back. MI5 is akin to the CIA of the United States.

Our media and populous alike have been swept up in post-9/11 fear and have been rendered susceptible to numerous avenues of fear mongering, ultimately resulting in a slow descent into a paranoid population of terrified lemmings under the protection of an increasingly totalitarian regime bent on the dissolution of personal liberties. Perhaps not as noticeably as the United States, but noticeable nevertheless.

I'll cut to the chase. My brother-in-law, who I wont bother to grant a pseudonym and will henceforth refer to as BIL, has a tendency of bestowing a great deal of trust in me after he's had a few too many at family gatherings. He's told me some shit that the educated minority wouldn't find too shocking, but one of his drunken tirades has never sat well with me.

**Blizzard EU leaks World of Warcraft customer information to MI5** in a bizarre manner in order to potentially thwart school shootings, involving a cocktail of enhanced CCTV techniques, racial/income/neighborhood profiling and sadistic in-game behavior. In-game behavior including, but not limited to, high-level players returning to low-level areas such as Elwynn Forest, and spending an unusual amount of time one-hit killing enemies, an action which isn't rewarded with XP, or serves any other purpose than to, from a psychological standpoint, and in the manner of a lunatic with a God-complex, execute bullies who have previously victimized and frustrated the player.

These players are automatically IP geographically located, cross-referenced with information in their Battle.net accounts, red flagged and monitored meticulously by MI5 supercomputers, and eventually actual agents, granted the use of specific buzzwords and/or unusual behavior is discovered.

Now I'm sure you're asking yourself why Blizzard would  involve themselves in such unfathomably invasive bullshit. I asked myself, and BIL informed me it was the result of subtle threats and comprehensive blackmail at high levels of the Blizzard corporate chain.

Ever wonder why politicians are so crooked in the United States? and around the world for that matter? Sure, they might be subject to corporate bribes, among bribes not so publicized, but they're much more subject to succumbing to fear. After all, the shadow governments, i.e. intelligence agencies, holding the strings strive on their greatest weapon. Fear. And anyone with a large enough voice in any government or industry is subject to its merciless grip. Intelligence agencies across the globe are the masters of blackmail and assassination. If they weren't, the 1st world wouldn't have such a choke hold on the planet. And as we all know, the greatest wars are won without fighting a single battle.

**I'll answer almost any questions**, unless any posed could aid in the contribution of a dossier on myself or anyone close to me."

In hindsight, this was a huge mistake. While the material is interesting, I feel like like I am basically just a very specific, narrow field of mechanical engineering; limiting my areas of my work. For example, I went to Westinghouse's intern cafe recently and there were probably 3 nuclear engineering positions, 10 ME, and 6 ChemE. The MEs and ChemEs could interview for their specific fields as well as nuclear but I could only interview nuclear. It feels like job opportunities with a BS in NE are very limited and unless you get a PhD and go work for a national lab, there really isn't anything that great for a nuclear engineer. I also feel like the whole nucl department is not as well prepared as others in ME, EE or ChemE (I go to Michigan which is a top university for nuclear engineering so it isn't like I'm at a university with a bad reputation). I now feel obligated to get a PhD so my undergrad work wasn't a waste. I really regret going NE and wish I went ME, EE or ChemE (advice for future students). Does anyone else feel this way?"

I have a history of mental illness, specifically depression and anxiety... I was diagnosed as an Aspie in elementary school, but I feel that was a misdiagnosis.

I have gone from being in an approved-private school to a PhD program. I recently accepted a very prestigious internship.

I've still got a lot of stress. While I network and make friends fine, I haven't had much luck with women. I lost over 50lbs, but I still obsess over my weight/looks...

Which leads me to today. I felt kind of crappy all day. I took it as a sign I shouldn't drink so much... I went out drinking Friday and Saturday, and had a lot both nights (8+ drinks). I drank a lot of water, so I didn't have a hangover, but I noticed my mood was off. I made a mental note to watch my consumption in the future. I also had a slight ache in my chest, but it felt like a sprained muscle... it's hard to descibe.

Anyways, I went to the gym and was doing bent over rows, and suddenly, it was like there was a rock in my chest, riight in the middle. If you drew a line between my nipples, right in the center... and this rock was throbbing, and the pain spread to my back. 

I sat down, and started to feel scared. I know someone who had a heart defect and just flat out died playing basketball. And while I sometimes feel anxious, I have only had a panic attack once. (And I'm not sure if that was one or a heart issue as well)

Anyways, I am not sure what happened. On one hand, I was not stressed out... I have a few small things to do this evening, but otherwise it was a leisurely day of reading journal articles and writing some simple code.

The pain is still here, but slight. If I move, it gets worse, but not terribly so. I'm pretty convinced it's stress related, but I thought I'd try asking the internet to be safe.

I am a little stressed now... I had a couple small things to do to day, but tomorrow I am very busy so I need to do these small things (like read a book chapter) tonight, or I won't have time...

ojxw9,2,2012-01-16,Acquiring Skills and Graduate School,whatwhatwhat1,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ojxw9/acquiring_skills_and_graduate_school/,"I realize that what employers want and what corporations need in people are skills and experience.

Over the summer I graduated from a top 20 university with a bachelors in Business Administration. I feel like it helped me grow as a person, improved my critical thinking abilities, taught me the basics of financial analysis and other ""business"" things but didn't give me any real solid ""skills"". This is probably what they're shooting for with undergraduate education, so I don't particularly blame my schooling for my inability to land a job.

I worked for the entirety of my schooling at a local retailer and between that and full time school I presumably didn't do enough extracurriculars besides being an officer in an environmental student group.

After graduation I was able to find an unpaid internship back home working for the county as a budget analyst. I work like 25 hours a week doing whatever odd jobs they can think for me to do. They've been really good about not making me do menial things like filing and I've been getting a lot of experience in excel and SAP but still no real ""skills"".

I enjoy the internship about as much as I could expect to enjoy working for free, and would love to get further invested in that area of expertise but the county is laying off more people than it's hiring and I have only had one interview in months of searching.

I feel like as time goes on computers will replace most of the typical office jobs that people are strangling to hold on to now, and my job search is only going to get harder and harder. I've been a computer geek from the earliest times I can remember and have been pondering going for my masters in a field like Computer Information Sciences. Day after day of job searching and it seems like there is always a multitude of openings in the information technology industry. 

My problem is that I've already taken out a considerable amount of student debt (~30,000) to be able to afford the original university. I imagine it'd cost about the same to go for my masters and is that really a feasible amount of debt to have as a new graduate? Will a masters degree teach me skills that are desirable in the job market?

I'd love any and all advice on how I should progress with either graduate school (and how affordable that would be), or other ways of possibly acquiring skills. Or maybe my entire thought process is wrong and you can show me the light."

Specifically, whether they tend to reward projects that are high-aiming, ""pretentious"", extremely unique or artistic and likely never to be built, versus projects that are more practical, utilitarian, and are more likely than not a re-hashing of various famous buildings and contemporary ideas.

Do they prefer to see something they've never seen before? Or something they can actually see being built? Trying to take individual taste out of the equation, and assuming the projects are of equal craftsmanship, legibility, beauty, etc."

Overview:
Veritas Scientific Corporation is an applied neuroscience startup company based in Arlington, VA.  It is in the process of developing its P-300 NeuroTruth technology, which will provide brainwave-based deception detection and truth verification for the National Security industry.  This transformative technology will revolutionize the nature of our National Security in all forms of interrogation, threat screening, distinguishing “friend from foe,” and pioneering prevention intervention.   P-300 NeuroTruth derives its efficacy from the P-300 Event Related Potential (ERP), which is to say that 300 milliseconds after a stimulus (a face, name, or location, etc.) is presented to a subject, the brain responds with a decipherable brainwave pattern.  This reaction occurs before the conscious mind can manipulate the information.  


Responsibilities:
 Interns will be tasked with assisting Veritas Scientific in using its MATLAB programming language to: 
A) Write a program that will reliably isolate the P-300 ERP (a marker of recognition) 
B) Directly interface with an EEG
C) Design an appropriate interrogation atmosphere that is conducive to isolating the P-300 ERP.
	

Eligibility: 
* We at Veritas Scientific Corporation are seeking 1-4 interns with MATLAB programing experience.  If interns  have not previously used MATLAB, extensive experience with another programming language is required.  
* The other 4 interns will be tasked with helping the company on the management side: finding Venture/angel investors, writing proposal materials, identifying future government or defense contractor clients etc.
* Neuroscience coursework in addition to programming experience would greatly enhance an applicant’s eligibility.
* At least a Junior or Senior (Graduate Students and Alumni welcome).  Sophomore applicants will be considered if they have taken at least 5 relevant programing and/or neuroscience courses.

Duration: 
Typically one semester. Preferred start date: January 20th 

Benefits: 
Paid transportation to and from work 

Required for Application:
* Transcript 
* Cover letter
* Phone or in person meeting

ojr9g,6,2012-01-16,"GF went through my email, now thinks I'm lying to 
her",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ojr9g/gf_went_through_my_email_now_thinks_im_lying_to/,"We've been together for about 6 months now and I just recently moved in with her.  I'm 27, male, she's 24.  I left for work last night and left my e-mail account logged in, and being very open with each other, this wasn't a big deal to me at the time.  While at work, she texted me ""you should really log out of your e-mail account.""  I laughed and joked around about it and then she started saying things like ""Gross.  I'm really irritated.""  and ""This makes me feel like shit.""  and ""I hope you weren't planning on getting laid tonight.  You can use those pictures.""  Thinking she found my fap folder, I tried explaining that (which she already knows about and is fine with).

Later she said ""I can't believe you're asking other girls to send you pictures, what else are you doing behind my back?""  Now realizing what she saw was a series of 'naughty' pictures a no-longer friend of mine of 5 years sent me a couple months ago (ex-friend because of these emails), who was trying to give me incentive to come visit her 3 hours away on her internship.  She's absolutely batshit insane as it turned out.  She had a crush on me while I was with my ex of 3 years, and later creeped on me through her as she was a mutual friend between me and my ex.  I was somewhat okay with this while I was single, but she has had a boyfriend the whole time, and still does as far as I know.  I didn't realize HOW crazy she is until she sent me those pictures, but I didn't know how to take it.  I stopped talking to her then, and a couple weeks later, she sent more.  I asked her to stop it and haven't talked to her since.  She kept bugging me to come down still and kept asking what's wrong, but I didn't know what to say to her, so I just ignored her.

Anyway, after trying to explain this to my GF, she thinks I'm full of shit and that I'm probably doing other things behind her back.  I told her I'd show her our texts if my phone didn't automatically delete them after a few days, but she wasn't having it.  She later told me to stop texting her and that she needs some time alone.  I responded with ""Alright, just don't make it forever,"" and she replied, ""I don't think that's your decision to make.""

We haven't talked since, and when I came home after work (around 5am... stopped at a mutual friends house for a couple hours to calm down), she was sleeping on the couch and then got up and went to bed.  I tried to talk to her today, but before I could even get a word out, she grabbed her purse and ran out the door.

Now I know I probably should have deleted those e-mails, but I'm not unlike any other neckbeard out there who has 5,000 unread/undeleted e-mails, so I never did.  I could have logged out of my account, but I wasn't worried about it at the time (obviously).  Is there any chance of me getting her to trust me again?  Should I let her come to me when she's done giving me the silent treatment, or should I try to talk to her about it first?  I feel like I really fucked up, but I don't really know if I'm in the wrong here or not nor how to fix it.

TL;DR GF goes through my email acct. finds naughty pictures from 5-year friend that I'm no longer friends with because she sent me those pictures while I'm with my GF.  GF thinks I'm doing shit behind her back now, doesn't believe anything I say and now has me on the silent treatment.  How can I regain her trust, or am I fucked now?

UPDATE: Welp, woke up this morning and she's talking to me again!  After giving her a couple days of space, we're good again.  We haven't really talked about it yet, nor do I think she wants to anymore, so I guess I'm just going to leave it at that until she wants to bring it up again.  I do have plans for tonight involving a cheesy letter and flowers and probably candles, so we'll see what happens."

Browsing through this subreddit I have seen a repeated theme of having to be very good at math and a general good student. I would describe myself as a good student and decent at math (I will be taking AB Calculus next year and have always been in honors math and sciences but I am not the smartest in the room by any means). Do I need to be a young math prodigy to become a successful engineer? 
Also fields that seem interesting are materials engineering and aerospace engineering. If you are one of those, do you have any advice, any regrets, or do you enjoy your major choice?

Same interests, same sense of humor, and she even thought I was good looking.  I'm 22 years old and I've never even been on a date before, I'm always awkward and nervous around women and I tend to over think things which has always stopped me from ever making a move.  I decided this time would be different; I manned up and asked her out and within a week of first talking we were on our first date.  

It was fantastic, she was also a novice at the dating scene and so we were both learning as we went.  By the time Christmas came along I thought I couldn't ever be happier, we talked all day at work, would go out on most weekends, and were both telling all our friends that we had finally met someone.  I was excited and nervous but everything seemed to be going right.

After new years I headed back to university for my final four month term.  We were both a bit anxious about this but were sure we could get through it.  We were both looking up ideas for Skype dating etc. and would be trying to meet up on weekends if possible.

Last week however, she had an interview with a company in another county (leaving out details in case anyone sees this), and was pretty sure she nailed it, and sure enough just a few days ago she got the job offer.  We had a long and sad talk where she told me she would be taking the job and that the best thing would be to end our relationship, as long distance would just be too hard (neither of us have much money to travel, student loans etc.).  I told her I would be willing to try long distance, but that if she didn't want to I would respect her wishes.

So that's it, she’s going to be moving soon and I don't even know if I'll get a chance to see her in person again.  I'm a complete wreck, I've gone from the happiest I've ever been to feeling like complete crap in under three weeks.  It’s not like we were having problems or anything like that, it was going so well and now...it’s just...over.  I can't concentrate, I think about her all the time, I don't feel like doing anything.  She says she feels the same way but I know she's got her new job and moving to distract her.

I don't know how to deal with this.  I've never felt this sad in my life, I was so ready to finally be in a relationship with someone and I poured my heart into it, and now it’s just gone...a victim to circumstance.  We try talking sometimes, but it’s completely different and awkward now.  I don’t even know if we’ll be able to maintain a friendship and that makes me feel even worse.  I'm not mad or angry, I understand her decision and I know it’s hurting her too.  I don't want to try and forget because there was nothing bad about the time we had together, we both thought it was going to last much longer than this.

I’m normally a pretty happy guy, I play video games and go to the gym, I have school and friends I hang out with and I know I’ll feel better in time.  But what do I do right now…until that time comes?  I feel so empty and sick to my stomach; I don’t know if I want to go back in time or forwards…I just don’t want to be here.

**tl;dr** first relationship was going amazing.  Now she's moving to another country and thinks it would be too hard to go long distance.  I accept that its over but I feel like crap, like what we had was cut down just as it was really taking off...don't know how to deal

Any advice would be really appreciated.

I earned my degree from a highly-ranked university in the Northeast and have worked a couple different positions since then. Right now I'm in a call center. Lol. Now that I've graduated I see that connections trump all when it comes to scoring the gig you want. Living at home without a single connection to pull from has kind of left me cornered. If I were to attend grad school my main goal would be to make those connections to set myself up for an excellent position. I would make sure I had decent scholarship money and work on internships and connections from the moment I set foot in campus. Should I do it?

I have about 20 servers across 4 offices connected over a WAN. Around 200 users.

Here is what I could think of so far, but it's not much.

1. Pull specs off current machines for and perform inventory of IT equipment.
2. Wipe and do a clean install of OS on 10-20 machines that I have that are still functional that I planned on donating to a charity to give away to people.
3. Setup/design/order/configure a new NAS box with RAID that I need for D2D backups.
4. Help me rack equipment in the one office that just has towers/servers sitting all over the server room (as well as recabling it all)
5. Help with a  wiki (but this would just be mostly data entry, as the wiki is already setup, but just not populated yet with information for end users/IT staff)
6. Setup how-to's for end users (simply shit like connecting to the correct wifi SSID, we have some completely technologically incompetent employees who needs guides for simple things, including screen shots)
7. setup 2 or 3 VM's that need put into production but I haven't gotten around to doing yet


Now, as I'm assuming I'll have this intern for 3 months, I can't really think of what else to do to have them occupy their time with.

Some stuff I am working on that I think might be out of their range
1.fix replication issue between DC's (still trying to figure this one out myself)
2. Migrating to google apps off of exchange 2003
3. Creating a public facing website for one of our sub companies (this intern would be from a computer networking background, so my guess is they would be a poor choice for helping to create a website)


Any suggestions at all will be helpful, I don't want them to be sitting there the majority of the time with nothing to do, I'd like to give them experience in every aspect of the field and hopefully walk away with a better idea of what the position is actually like."

I'm looking for some input and opinions. I'll be finishing up my bachelors in either Fall 2012 or Spring 2013. I'll be applying to start a graduate program for Fall 2013. I'm currently most focused on a non-terminal Masters degree to eventually continue onto a PhD program. 

The reason I'm not putting all my focus into a PhD program right away is that for various reasons I sucked at freshman year/first semester of sophomore year, so my GPA is only at around a 3.2/3.3 overall. I currently have minimal research experience (working on it), and am applying for HR internships for Summer 2012 (my understanding is that this is as close to an IO internship as I can find). 

Now to the point. I am a New York State resident attending a state school for undergrad. I have always had a deep, abiding love for Canada, and have always felt that I fit in better to their social system and general culture than I do here in the US. While I'm not desperate to get out of the US, I am very attracted to at least grad school in Canada, if not long-term plans for permanent relocation and duel-citizenship. 

So I'm wondering if I do go to school in Canada, will I be limiting my potential in the US job market? Would potential employers look down on my degree from a Canadian university? I'm most interested in going into the private sector, hoping to open my own consulting firm down the line. 

Also, from what I've read, I/O seems to be a fairly steadily-growing field in the US, but does anyone know if is that inconsistent in Canada?

oilrl,3,2012-01-15,Reasonable salary for an Intern in Canada,[deleted],EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/oilrl/reasonable_salary_for_an_intern_in_canada/,"Hi everyone.

I'm having an interview for an 6-month intern position in a large city in Canada and I want to make sure what I ask for as compensation is not unreasonable and enough to make a decent living for the length of the internship (lodging, food, transportation, insurance, whatever and sightseeing).

I plan on asking for CAD 20/hr. This is not a random number, rather one I thought about. In my country, I make €20/hr tutoring other students, so this is IMO a base for what I'm worth. I will also have completed my fourth year of studies (Ind &amp; Mech) which would make me a graduate in Canada (although there's no bachelor here so I'm going straight to master's). Therefore CAD 40k/year doesn't seem excessive to me, considering that I'm well qualified for the internship.

I'd like to know if this is a reasonable demand for an Intern in Canada in a small company, and if I'll live comfortably off it (I don't want to make a ton of money, rather enjoy living there)."
ollat,1,2012-01-17,My girlfriend got raped almost 8 year ago. It still haunts her to this day.,staticvoidmain,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ollat/my_girlfriend_got_raped_almost_8_year_ago_it/,"I met a wonderful girl a few months ago which I could describe easily as my soul mate. It was idyllic and perfect. She's beautiful, smart, funny and full of joy.

When I started going out with her I noticed small scars on both of her wrists. I asked her about it and she brushed it off. I must have had a worried look because later she spit it all out. At age 13 she was raped and she tried committing suicide because she felt it was her fault and she felt dirty. I didn't inquire more about it. Fast forward a month later. She studies nursing and begins an intern in a psych ward. She returns to me after her first day down and angry so we decide to drink.

After a few drinks she begins to cry uncontrollably. I ask her what is wrong and she tells me it still haunts her everyday. She said since I came into her life it started to go better (I never noticed her having issues and being haunted) but it happened again after her first day at the ward. 

She cried all night. She wanted to talk to me about it. She explained how it happened. It was her first sexual contact. She was a virgin. She said after she felt dirty and at fault so she tried committing suicide. She then slept with lots of guys to try to make the pain pass and because she felt so dirty.

I am the first to know about this. Not even her parents and 3 year ex know about it. I was speechless. I love her so much but felt powerless. I don't know what to do, Reddit. When she was telling me how it happened I imagined the scene in my head and almost cried of madness.

 What can I do to help her? I'm with her and we have had beautiful moments since then but I still feel the need to help her."

Here is a link to my other [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ohu2f/what_juicy_secret_do_you_know_about_your/c3hf19t)

For the lazy:

&gt;I work as an auditor. I have access to every person, every document, every scrap of information the client possesses. Some of the shit I see is nothing short of amazing.
&gt;
&gt;HR personnel creating fake employees and paying themselves second salaries...for years. Companies regularly will shift large losses into years in which they are already underperforming; if you're already going to miss the earnings report, my as well get all those pesky balance sheet losses out of the way.
&gt;
&gt;Probably the biggest kicker in our entire industry is materiality. When we audit a company's financials, we don't ensure accuracy. Officially, in our opinion, we state that our procedures ""provided reasonable assurance that they financial statements, taken as a whole, are free of material misstatements"". Materiality is just an arbitrary amount, set by the auditors, based upon risk. I have certain clients where ML is &gt;$10mm. That means we could find million dollar errors and still give a clean opinion because it is under ML.

**TL;DR:** I make sure companies don't lie *too much* on their financials.

So IAmA, ask away

Edit: Figure I should add one more good story that I told the BD interns this morning...

During my first associate year at the firm one of my good friends from my start class was doing fixed asset testing at a client.  Their offices occupied eight floors of a huge building.  On each floor there were three kitchens.

My friend was incredibly smart but super serious so the senior and manager on the job decided to break her in a little bit.  The team got together with management and they put a line item into a report that showed microwaves as an asset with a large balance so they were picked for testing.  This complete bullshit.  They were fully depreciated, had no value, and from an audit perspective were entirely useless.

They told my friend, we'll call her Jane, that each of the microwaves must boil a cup of room temperature water in under three minutes.  They wrote testing procedures that dictated the water must be eight fluid ounces from the nearest tap and must be left sitting out for at least five minutes to ""acclimate"".  They told her a day in advance to bring a measuring cup.

Jane spent six hours on one of her first clients microwaving cups of water and writing up the report.  Her report included PAJE for five of the microwaves that took longer than three minutes to boil.  All the while, her entire senior staff and the client upper management were laughing their asses off.  Jane has been on that client since and fucking loves that job."

oleyc,6,2012-01-17,24-year old boyfriend is unemployed and doesn't seem to be looking...,detartsurf,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/oleyc/24year_old_boyfriend_is_unemployed_and_doesnt/,"Dear r/relationships, I could really use your help on this one. I'm 26, my boyfriend is 24 and we've been together a little over 2 years. We've lived together for about a year. He graduated from college in May 2011 and is still unemployed. I have been working full-time since I graduated five years ago and make a pretty good salary. 

When my bf first graduated from college, he said that he wanted to ""take the summer off"" because he was burnt out from school and wanted time to figure out some relationship things with his parents (he has had some difficult relationships with them). I said, OK, that makes total sense. By the time I graduated I was totally burnt out too. He told me that would be kind of a ""3-month"" thing and he wanted to look for jobs in the fall. 

(Now, for those of you who might say, why would you even let him do this in the first place....I guess I don't have a good answer. I empathized with him feeling burnt out after graduation, and I'm making enough money to be the one who pays for dinner or the movies or things like that. It didn't really used to bother me because I knew that we were in completely different places, financially---I had been in the work world for several years, whereas he was a college student/recent graduate. I really did think that he would want to just have a few months to veg out and then I truly believed he would get down to business in the fall and have a job by, say, October!)

Anyways, it's now eight months after graduation, and five months after ""the fall"" and he is still unemployed. This would not bother me as much if he really seemed to be putting his all into looking for a job, but I don't think he is. I asked him to tell me what percentage of effort he's putting forth to look for a job, where 100% effort is getting up every day and spending the equivalent of a full days' work (8 hours) looking for jobs, polishing up your resume, networking, looking into internships, volunteering, etc, and 0% is literally doing nothing. He was honest with me and told me that it's pretty much around 10%. He knows he is not looking as hard as he could be and acknowledges to me that he needs to put more work into it, but he doesn't actually do anything about it.

At one point he was close to having a job interview at a retail store that he was just dreading working at and he cried about it so much that finally, I said he really shouldn't work there if it would make him feel truly miserable, but that he had to step up his efforts and he promised he would. I don't believe that he has.

I know that every day I am contributing to this problem because I am still paying for everything. He literally has no money and so he is completely financially dependent on me. He's said that I should tell him if it ever starts to really bother me that I'm paying for everything, and he'll get a job, and I have told him that as long as he's truly putting forth his best efforts into getting a job, it doesn't bother me. Again, if he were truly putting a lot of effort into finding a job, or if he were a full-time student, or something, I don't think I would have a big problem with this. But right now I feel like he's my child or something---I am just financing his ability to play video/computer games all day and then go out and do fun stuff with me/friends at night and on the weekends. I know that I am enabling him and I feel badly about that, but I don't know what to say or how to get him to get off his butt and truly look for a job. I know that maybe what he needs to hear is some sort of ultimatum, but please keep in mind that I do truly love this person. He is a wonderful guy in so many ways and I don't want to just yell at him and say that he's worthless and needs to get off his ass and get a job or I'll kick him out. How can I tell him that he needs to get a job in a caring, respectful way? His lack of motivation frustrates me on a daily basis and it is taking a toll on my feelings for him because I only see him as lazy and mooching off of my good intentions. I also get mad at myself for being so soft. It seems like every time I talk to him about looking for a job he has one excuse or another---he was really sick that day, or he did look but there was nothing good, etc, etc. In five months he has had one job interview and it was for a job that I FOUND for him. I routinely send him job postings that I find and even part-time kinds of things on Craigslist. We went out a couple weeks ago and he said, ""I realized I was completely ignoring looking for part-time jobs, I think that could be a viable option for me"" and I got really frustrated at him because I was so angry that he HADN'T been looking for part-time jobs in the first place! I would be thrilled if he had a part time job! He asked me how I felt about that and I tried to be calm and said ""I would be ecstatic if you had a part time job,"" but inside it just made me even more furious.

Every day I am resisting the urge to just blow up at him and tell him that I am sick of his bullshit and him taking advantage of me. Overall, it makes it hard for me to respect him as a responsible adult because he shows no drive and motivation to be able to take care of himself. Maybe that would be good, to just ""get it out of my system"" because I am so tired of being patient. It has gotten to the point now where I am sacrificing things for myself, financially, that I would like to have, because of things that I have paid for for him.

His student loans come due in March and I have made it really clear to him that I draw the line at helping him pay for his student loans. Because it is only a $40/month payment and that is something that anyone working even a minimum wage ($7.25/hour in my state) job could afford.

Reddit, this is getting to the point where it is affecting every detail of our relationship. I feel like he should be more grateful to me for the fact that I pay for EVERYTHING and he feels like I treat him like a second-class citizen sometimes. I'm worried that my resentment toward him not looking for a job is subconsciously affecting the way that I treat him. How do I tell him that I'm really upset with this situation without hurting his feelings?

P.S. Sorry for the rant-like post, I just don't know how to resolve this situation!!!

TL;DR: BF is unemployed and barely looking for a job; I am losing respect for him and sick of being financially responsible, but don't know how to get him to change."

One kind lady even offered to put in a good word and connect me via linkedin to him so we could discuss it.

I would greatly appreciate any help or advice. Does anybody have any experience with http://geneva.craigslist.ch/ ? The advertisements there do not really offer much information or pictures, often even missing an address.

It would be great if you could point us in the right direction

EDIT: I should have probably mentioned that the budget would be up to 1100 CHF a month"
oknez,109,2012-01-17,The Little Girl,SuperSayan,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/oknez/the_little_girl/,"I've been a police officer for almost 30 years. I've seen it all. Or so I thoght.

A few weeks ago I was cruising around town on my way to my favorite Starbucks like any other normal day. I had just been out on a school teaching some first graders about traffic safety so I felt pretty good. I got back to my car and sat down, pulled the seat back a bit and took a sip of the steamy hot coffee. It was a pretty fine day, the weather was a little dull, but it didn't really bother me. All of a sudden I get a call over the radio. I didn't recognize the voice, but we just got new interns at the station so it was probably just one of them. Some girl claims her mother needs help. The address is only two blocks away so I decide to check it out. I pull over next to an apartment complex and walk up to the front door. As I'm about to ring the doorbell hoping for someone to let me in I hear a faint voice behind me. I turn around and is greeted by a small girl. She appears to be 7 or 8 years old. Very, very pale with huge cirles under her eyes,. He lips were slightly grey as if she was ill. Her hair was flat and looked very dirty. She wasn't wearing anything besides a little white/grey dress. No boots or socks. I offered her my jacket, but she declined. When I told her why I had arrived and asked if she knew anything she motioned me to follow.

We went around the back of the apartment complex and down a small staircase to a basement which appeared to be the place to park your bicycle. She walked over to a door, which led on to the rest of the basement and opened it. Suddenly she picked up her pace and started running. I tried to keep up, but... She looked underweight, but she was jumping around the corners like a deer running from a predator while still telling me, in a silent whisper, to follow her. I couldn't hear the slighest hint of her being short of breath, her voice didn't change at all. At some point I lost her. I stopped to catch my breath and looked up. I was standing before a door. I placed my ear to the door and heard a familar noise. I couldn't figure out what it was, but I forced the door open and found myself in a washing room. The noise was coming from a washing machine and there, on the floor next to it, lied a woman. She lied in a pool of blood. Her clothes was torn into pieces and she had bruisers on her arms and legs. I called for assistance and an ambulance and ran over to check her pulse. She was barely alive. I picked her up and made my way outside. 

At the bicycles I was met by paramedics who took care of the woman. They told me she was gonna be fine, but only because I got to her in time. I figured the girl had seen her mother on the floor and called for help. I just couldn't find the girl anywhere. I wanted to let her know her mom was gonna be fine. After searching the rooms close to the washing machines for a good half hour I gave up and went back to my car. My coffee was freezing cold so I went right back to Starbucks to get a new one. 

I arrived at the station shortly after. The new interns were standing outside smoking so I went over there and told them about the little girl and how the call had saved her mom's life. They all looked at me like I was from another planet. Apparently, neither of them were on calls. I apologized and went inside. My boss rushed down the stairs from the dining room and told me to follow him to his office. As I sat down he started questioning me about the call. He was eager to know what I was doing in a locked up basement next to a woman who had been raped. I told my boss about the call on the radio, the little girl who had opened the door and shown me the way. My boss was confused. The paramedics couldn't get into the basement because the door was locked up good and barred from the inside. They had to wait for someone in the complex to remove the bar and unlock the door.

I deciede to take the afternoon off.. I had no idea about what had happened. I definately heard the call on the radio and the girl had been standing there right infront of me, without a doubt. How she managed to run away from me - I don't know.. and why she ran back and locked the door to keep the paramedics from enterring I don't know either... Puzzled I headed to the hospital to check up on the mother. A kind nurse showed me where the mother was lying. She was asleep so I picked up a newspaper from a newspaper stand and sat down next to her bed.

After about an hour the mother woke up confused about where she was and what had happened. I told her she had been raped, but luckily her daughter had found her near the washing machines and called for help. She looked at me with an odd look. She had never been a mother. She was pregnant 8 years ago, but the child was stillborn. 

Now I was kinda scared. I excused myself and told the woman to call the station should she remember anything about her assailant. I walked out of the room and headed straight towards the nearest elevator. I pressed the button and waited for the doors to open. For some reason I felt an urge to look back on the woman one more time... so I did. 

And there she was."
oklbn,2,2012-01-17,Am I being too harsh to Furries?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/oklbn/am_i_being_too_harsh_to_furries/,"I despise furries, not because they are creepy or delusional. I dispise them for what they have done to the puppeteering and costume industry. 

I’ve worked for about 10 years in entertainment, started when I was 17. I’ve had some great opportunities in the FX and costuming industry that culminated when I landed an internship with Jim Henson Corporation. I’ve done costuming and puppetering for countless companies including Disney, Dream works and Warner. I’ve been everything, from kick ass monsters in horror films, to several recognisable characters on children’s shows. 

A number of friends know what I do and I’m ok with them joking about it. But gradually I’ve found my work as a costumed performer crossing paths with the stigma or furries and my sense of humour is dwindling. Whenever people ask what I do for a living, and I tell them, the first thing they always bring up are “hey, do you know what furries are?” 

I always feign ignorance, and they always feel the need to tell me. It infuriates me. I work with kids, and though I’m not prude, I just feel that anybody who is in this line of work should not be motivated by a costumed character fetish. When I go to a gig, whether it be a TV show, or just working on a cruise line, I can always spot the furry that got cast. They have this air to them, this really unnatural focus on the costumes that goes beyond healthy.

The last big gig I did, we got a furry fired. Though, he was getting on the nerve of most of the cast, I’m not sure he did anything outside mentioning he was furry. A group of us literally told the stage manager that we felt his personality was getting in the way of the groups comfort level, which on a cruise ship, is all it takes. I felt kind of bad, but at the same time, I’m so sick and tired of people associating costumed characters with sex obsessed weirdoes.

These days, I’m transitioning into working as an illustrator, and hope to cut back on costumed work. I think this is in part, to the fact that I just can’t stand furries, and in the rare cases I cross paths with them, I just want to punch them. Am I too harsh?

To start, I know this question has been asked one million times, but because this is such a big decision for me, I'm hoping someone can offer some valuable insight into my situation.

So a little about me, I am a junior studying Aeronautical and Mechanical engineering.  I have a 3.61 GPA, a lot of leadership experience and two previous engineering internships, with one this upcoming summer at GE Aviation.

Basically, as I move to complete my undergraduate studies, I am starting to weigh the following options:
1.  Enter the job world - I feel I will have no trouble getting a job I want, because I have had good luck with jobs in the past and I am a good candidate.
2.  Fifth Year Masters Program - This is something my school offers.  You receive a masters in engineering, for only one more year of classes.  Is this extra year of school worth it?
3.  PhD - I teach a calculus class and have always loved teaching, and am about to begin undergraduate researcht in the field of Engineering Dynamics, so maybe PhD is the way to go?  Is a PhD worth the time if I don't want to end up in academia?

Thank you for any advice you can offer."

om2q3,1,2012-01-18,Where to start?,[deleted],seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/om2q3/where_to_start/,"So for one reason or another, I find myself taking a semester off from college. I've read some things about seduction but never really took it seriously in the past. With my time away from school, I really want to take this seduction thing seriously and get some actual confidence and game before I go back... I want things to be different. My main goal is to get a girlfriend, I'm not looking to be a huge player who hooks up with a ton of girls. 

Basically I'm wondering where somebody like me should start? Just do as many approaches as possible? Is there anything I should read in particular? I'm definitely planning on using this subreddit to share my experiences/successes/failures, but WHERE TO BEGIN?! 

There is a friend I have here at home that I'm sure I can convince to work at this seduction thing with me (he's also an AFC) so I will have somebody to keep me accountable hopefully. Also, I'm working an internship 10-6 on the weekdays so most of what I'll be doing is working out/researching/reading on weekdays, and testing things on weekends. And maybe approaching girls at my internship if I can work up the confidence, but I don't want to fail majorly there and show up to work every day as the weird guy who tried to hit on all the other intern girls... 

Basics about me: I'm pretty much an AFC, not very high self-esteem at all. Not a virgin and I hook up every once in a while, but haven't had sex in about a year.


I hope you might have some advice for a newcomer like me. I really want to give this my all, and hopefully I'll have some good results to share with you guys over the upcoming months. "

However, I was close enough to see that wasn't the case.

Does anyone here know of omen attached to such a thing? The only thing I could find was a lone fox meaning good luck (in Welsh culture, which my family is Welsh) and three crows means a wedding in some Native American cultures."

olqkh,6,2012-01-17,I no longer fear it...,[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/olqkh/i_no_longer_fear_it/,"I have recently transitioned from fearing suicide to not fearing it at all. I'll try to give you some background. I don't know what I hope to achieve with this.

I'm 25 now, but I started being depressed in high school at 15-16 due to various factors. Maybe it was part genetic, maybe it was my bad family situation, maybe it was because I was a closeted gay at a single sex school. I grew up in a western country that has rampant homophobia and racism ingrained in society and from my late teens I felt a need to escape it. I had always thought about suicide from time to time, but never thought about it seriously until I was about 22. A friend gave me an intervention and said I needed to go get treatment. Before this I was against psychiatric medicine because of the seemingly changed personalities of my friends on it. I have now been on anti-depressants for 3 years, either having medications that didn't work or gave me bad side effects. I've gone through a bunch of them. I either feel dread or nothing. I don't know what it's like to cry anymore, it's been close to 10 years since I've been able to, even in the worst situations, like a friends funeral.

You could say I'm moderately successful, though in my eyes I am not where I wanted to be. I have a degree and I am working on my second (postgrad) one in a foreign country that doesn't speak english as a first language. I have worked at large corporations overseas doing summer internships multiple times. Despite this, I always fell short of my performance requirements and never managed to get a full time job, partly due to lack of effort on my part, partly due to asshole managers, partly cause it was very hard, and partly because i was stressed and depressed and still had to try put it aside to succeed. I have been trying to get a full time job outside of my home country for 3 years now. I don't do well in interviews, I tend to be badly judged in a short time with extremely technical questions.

More recently, I did badly/got screwed at my summer despite working sacrificing many nights and weekends and didn't get asked to come back full time. However I subsequently did well in university (though I could have done much better with my ability). Despite high pay at summer jobs, every cent goes into my education and I have no support from anyone and I'm not eligible for scholarships in this country. I have had to do crazy things just to get my study visas and I definitely have had less money to support myself as I would like. As a result I can never go out, never see friends, can't eat out, and have had to reduce the amount and quality of food I eat to make money last longer. Despite my frugal spending, I realised recently that I had overspent what little I had from unexpected costs and I won't be able to continue to the end of my degree without work. Getting a part time job is hard here, let alone one in english. I can barely afford my psychiatric appointments and medicine. I might have to go back to my home country without finishing my degree with only a few months to go.

I haven't had a relationship with any of my family for at least 2 years and have had to rely on friends as family since my late teens. I stopped talking to them because the anxiety and depression from even thinking about them was too much. A phone call or email will completely throw me off for the day. I haven't felt love for them for a long time. The idea of a working family seems so foreign to me now and I can't relate to wanting to be with them. I understand the instinct, but I don't feel it.

I have a network of friends around the world, but as you can imagine, not being physically in their locations makes it hard to be close to them. Most find it too much effort to talk over different timezones. I usually have 1-2 friends I am close to at any one time, but it changes year to year. I had a non-serious open relationship for a few months when I was 23, but have never otherwise had a relationship due to falling in love with unobtainable people (which luckily I stopped a few years back). I've never had someone in love with me at least.

A few months ago I started thinking more about my philosophies on life. I have always believed in the personal right to suicide, but it was never an option to me because of the hurt I've seen it do. I had a friend hang himself over a girl about 3-4 years ago and I saw the damage it did to everyone. On this past New Years Eve, I was alone as usual due to lack of local friends and money to go out. I got the most suicidal I had been in a while. I started to think that the only reason I was keeping myself alive was to not hurt those that knew me. This point has really stuck with me over the past few weeks.

I am frantically trying to make my situation work but I should have been fixing this earlier. I have had offers of small short term loans from friends who can't really afford it but the overwhelming guilt of accepting them and the uncertainty of employment/ability to repay them after finishing my degree makes me feel like it's not a realistic option. As soon as I get down to only having enough money to buy a one way ticket 'home', I think I'm going to leave.

I don't think I can handle going back in this state of mind though. I can't tolerate the general populous in my home country and their conservative attitudes. I can't handle starting over again with nothing and having to take a underpaid job with strict working environments. As far as I am concerned, I couldn't be happy that way, having lived through it already. The glimpses I've had of what it would be like to work and live overseas in the places I temporarily lived have felt like life is taunting me. My best effort with balancing sanity and work performance hasn't been enough to get me where I want to be. I feel like I have failed myself, and to me that is what matters most. Even if I got where I wanted to be, I'm not even sure if I'd be happy, and my quest for happiness seems almost selfish.

I'm an atheist, and I am perfectly OK with being cold and lifeless after I die. I hope they use my organs at least. I don't even want to be buried, I want to be burnt. I'm not about to go kill myself I don't think, not immediately at least. I think about who I'd leave things to based on who needed it the most and what kind of note I'd leave behind. Whether I should translate the instructions. I've gone from suicidal feelings from being impulsive and temporary to being meticulously planned and date TBD when I exhaust my current options. I'm currently on my backup-backup-backup life plan, and unsure where to go from here."
olpft,4,2012-01-17,Where to go from here?,TesticleTophat,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/olpft/where_to_go_from_here/,"I am trying to find a good path to take my career. I want something that is both interesting and valuable. Money is not too important, as long as I can support my family and be secure (50k+) but if it pays more, no complaints.

I understand I have to go with what interests me and I will certainly consider that factor, but I would like some ideas that go in to from my current experience. Being an office manager, it doesn't really depend on the business, as long as I can do those basic clerical tasks. Quite frankly, it's getting too easy and I want to start specializing.

A little background: I have an Associates Degree in Computer Networking; which isn't anything to brag about, but I do understand a great deal about computers. Most of my work experience has consisted of office management. I have about 5 years of experience handling everything from data entry, payroll, customer service, web development, hiring, etc... I am great with Office and Adobe CS, all the usual programs that are essential in an office. 


I have worked for a property management company, non-profits, small retail stores, and as a freelance programmer and web designer.  I also have pretty good knowledge of carpentry/construction that I picked up from working in property management. 


A lot of people say to go down the path of computer networking or administration, but most of these jobs require a Bachelors (which I can't afford) or are graphic design jobs, and other than very simple websites, I am definitely not a designer of any sorts. As for programming, I can only do basic scripting; however, I have a good handle on PHP/MySQL, but only to an extent that it's a hobby and not a skill. 


Some have recommended accounting. I enjoy math and I am good at it. I know how to use Quickbooks, but I find constant, repetitive data entry very boring and I don't think that path is for me. I'd rather take someone else's data and turn it in to charts or PowerPoint, then point to it during board meetings.

I have some customer service experience, but I am no salesman. I am very quiet and introverted.

What are some other directions I could go? Has anyone else had similar issues?

If it matters: I'm 24, married w/ no kids. Wife is a full time student, so I cannot go back to school right now. Training, Certs, and internships are fine though."
olp8n,0,2012-01-17,What will happen if I switch to a running based exercise plan? Will my muscle turn to fat?,fit_for_cali_throw,Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/olp8n/what_will_happen_if_i_switch_to_a_running_based/,"Ok, some background: About three years ago, I realized I was fat. So I started eating better, and lifting weights. 

So yeah. I tracked my calories on MyFitnessPal, I lifted weights 3x a week, and twice a week, I ran a 5k.

That worked pretty well. I dropped from a peak of 240 down to about 190. But I've been plateaued at 190 for a while, and slowly creeping back up. I feel that this is due to my lifestyle: I am a grad student. I travel a lot, and I often end up in crappy hotels with no exercise facilities. On winter and spring breaks, I have no access to gyms either. 

I have been considering moving to a running based workout, since I wouldn't be relying on having equipment around. The big catalyst was when I hurt my back yesterday doing a deadlift... I will be out of commission for a couple weeks, and I don't want to risk that happening again...  

I am currently 190, trying to get down to 170 by May 1st (when I start a summer internship in California). If I wait the 2 weeks my doctor recommended to start exercising again, I'll have 14 weeks. I don't wanna lose a week during spring break, and another week or two due to travel. 

Also, I like running more than lifting. 

So, r/fitness, what do you say? Will my muscles turn to fat, or will I just strip away the fat to reveal the godly physique hiding under my rolls?

I'm looking for some solid advice on how to accept an offer from a company for which I've been ""interning"" for the last year and a half.  Although the offer they extended is a raise from my current pay rate, I feel it is far below average salaries for entry level BSMEs in my area (San Jose, Silicon Valley).  

I've been doing research on websites like Salary.com, Indeed.com, EngineeringSalary.com, and PayScale.com.  What I have found is that there are wildly different predictions on what I should make, here is a summary of this data:

All sites were supplied with the same information:

* Mechanical Engineer I
* 1 year experience (actually been interning at this company 2.5 years)
* 100-250 employees
* San Jose, CA
* Degree from Santa Clara University (top 20)



* Salary.com: **72k**
* Indeed.com: **101k** &lt;--- WTF? Sounds unreasonable
* EngineeringSalary: **75k** 
* Payscale: **54k**
* Homefair.com **72k**
* JobSearchIntelligence.com **68k** &lt;--bottom 10th percentile, 90k median

My current offer is for 63k which is 5k more than I make as an hourly intern.  The benefit package is just about the best you can get (profit sharing, stock purchase, even education and veterinarian)

My question is this:  How do I present this information to attempt a massive renegotiation of the offer?  I myself do not trust the accuracy of these websites and wonder if there is a better data set I can present.  Is it unreasonable to ask for at least 70k?  What do other low level experience MEs make (if you feel like divulging that info)

Any advice, experiences, data etc. is greatly appreciated, I really don't want to get screwed on my 1st offer. 

Thanks!

**edit:**  Wow, thanks for all the advice everyone.  To fill you all in, I did compile all the information from my research and presented it to my manager.  He was surprised that I was attempting to renegotiate but entirely willing to hear me out and let me say my part.  Basically the gist of the argument was that our company does not fully compensate salaries based on the cost of living adjustment in the area.  There is a small bonus for employees in San Jose ~6%, far below the COLA of about 50%.  He took my argument upwards and I ended up with an offer for 65k.  
I think the take away here is that **it never hurts to do your research and learn more about what your company will and will not do for you**  Had I just accepted I would've left money on the table and not had the experience of learning how they came up with my offer.  I'm happy with how this turned out and grateful to all you reddit engineers for giving me the courage to just go for it.

Most of these parents are low income and rely on some form of government assistance. I am in my mid 20's and have no children, and my experiences with and knowledge about kids are largely from what I've learned in my various child development classes. I was hoping the redditors in [/r/socialwork](/r/socialwork) might have some good suggestions regarding potential topics, or websites/books that are beneficial (for both me, and the group members!).

We have a basic curriculum that covers topics such as bonding, nutrition, home safety, and resume writing for the parents. Some topics I am exploring are discipline, relaxation/stress management, and couponing! I hope to add something more to these groups, which is considerably hard when it's a non-profit with basically no money to spare for books or supplies. I'm looking for what lies beneath the typical websites that pop up on a google search.

I originally posted this question in [/r/parenting](/r/parenting) and got pretty much no response, so I am hoping that maybe the minds of my fellow social workers might have an idea or two to throw my way.

My goals (and the goals of the agency) are to prevent child abuse and neglect, and promote self-sufficiency and esteem in the teen mothers. I am only in my internship for a couple more months, and I would really like to leave these girls better off than they were when I met them. Thanks for your time.

Short Version: I've been friend zoned by my college friend and I'm gonna graduate soon. Don't know what to do.

Long Version: I'm a college senior and there's a girl that I've been friends with for while now that I've met here in school. I started liking her only about a year ago. I found out we have a lot more in common than I thought, we have similar interests and goals. Unfortunately, by the time I started to gain interest, I was in that damn friend zone. Even though we both go to the same school in Virginia, she actually lives in Jersey while I live here in VA. Currently, she is actually roommates with my best friend and his girlfriend right now. The four of us have actually talked about moving to LA once we graduate (we're all aspiring filmmakers). All of us actually spent the past summer in LA working internships and whatnot, getting a feel for the California lifestyle. Even though we all talk about being in LA together, there's still uncertainty, especially on my part, as to when we'll all be able to be out there together (I have a potential job opportunity in New York; 2-year commitment). As mentioned before, we're all gonna graduate soon, and I don't know what's gonna happen after graduation, so right now I'm trying to decide whether I should say something or not to her about how I feel.

I've never had a girlfriend before if that answers anyones ""Am I socially awkward with women"" question. Shit, I've never actively wanted to pursue a woman until now (and to think, I'm 21 in a school with 70% women). I can say that I honestly do not care if she rejects me or not, my biggest concern is that she wouldn't want to be friends with me anymore. I have talked to my two best friends about this, but they're even more clueless than me as to what I should do.

I'm just worried that if I don't get this off my chest before we graduate, I'm going to regret it, but I'm also afraid that if I open up to her, things will get awkward between us which, as a result, would get awkward amongst our group of friends. What do you people at reddit think?

The invitations say to dress business formal, but , truth be told, I have no idea what this means, especialy to engineers, who aren't well known for having fashion sense. Do I wear a suit? Is a blazer and dress pants good enough? What kind of tie? etc.

This is the kind of event where people can leave with internships in hand, and I'd like my dress to convey me as the kind of guy who deserves one. However, the only suits I have a 3-button monstrosities tailored for my junior prom. I was thiinking of wearing grey slacks and a white shirt with a navy blazer, conservative tie, and brogue boots.

Brothers,

As some of you may already know, I have been interested in the world of finance for some time. After a series of summer internships, however, I have somehow found myself without a full-time job offer for the upcoming year. Fuckin' Obama's fault for strangling this economy.

Luckily, due to the tough job market, my dad has agreed to let me access my trust fund early (mid 7-figures) to start a relatively small hedge fund, &lt;redacted&gt; Ventures, after graduation. I'm emailing you guys today to let you know that, for the rest rest of the year, I will be recruiting 2 full-time employees and 1 intern to help me get this off the ground.

With my financial expertise, help from my powerful father and connections, and a skilled team, I have no doubt that this fund will rise quickly to prominence. We'll all get filthy rich and, inevitably, bag hot slampieces. If possible, I'd love to give all 3 of these positions to my brothers. 

Although you would technically be working for me, I like to think of it more as a team effort. I know that my education and background qualifies me to lead a venture of this sort, and I would really appreciate your support. Below are the job descriptions. If interested, please email me a resume, cover letter, and paragraph describing why you would be excited to work with me.

Position 1: Lead Investment Analyst
-Because I will spend most of my time networking, raising money, and handshaking with industry bigwigs, I need someone with a strong quant background to take care of the majority of actual analysis. 
-Finance experience preferred but not required
-Compensation: Low six figures with benefits

Postion 2: Office Manager/Secretary
-Although this may not sound like the most prestigious role within a fund, someone needs to hand the day-to-day operations and while I and my Lead Investment Analyst conduct strategies to make us all rich. This person would also be in charge of hiring hot secretaries for us to ogle (and possibly slam) during the workday. 
-Detail oriented person needed
-Compensation: $70,000 base with benefits (like working close with a slampiece)

Position 3: Intern/Pledge
-This position is available to all sophomores and juniors. Think of it like pledging my hedge fund (so Ringo and Rolfes need not apply)
-I will judge this position primarily based on how hard you pledged and how I rate your slampiece pulling ability
-Compensation: $25/hr with a good opportunity for full-time employment post graduation.

I'm really excited to get this going, and I hope some of you will be joining me. Let me know if you have any questions at all.

Sincerely,

While my parents were and still are understanding and would never try to push me into situations I'm ready for, I realize it's only postponed the inevitable. Anyway, I would really like to work with video games in some way but I have no idea where to start. I remember reading from another AMA it's useful to know a progamming language and that C++ is apparently a good choice, but once again I have no idea where I would start with that or what type of things I need to learn beforehand. No one I know including our career/college councelor could give me any help more specific than things like ""apply for internships/jobs"" and ""work hard"". There was also some thinly veiled disapproval for my choice as if it wasn't as good as a ""legitimate"" career like working in law or something. (of course, this school is somewhat pretentious and most likely wants their girls to go on to things that are more ""professional"" than working with video games.) Also, I would like to mention ahead of time that yes, I am aware that such a career isn't just playing video games all day fun fun fun, but it's what I want to do regardless.


So basically I have no real world experience whatsoever and this is a serious problem because I'm graduating in about 3 months. Any relevant advice is more than welcome, though any advice about preparing myself and getting into the gaming industry would be greatly, greatly appreciated."

I can probably get a high-paying consulting internship which I feel would be a great thing to have on my resume for any career path -- or I can network and try to get a job at the NHL offices in New York.

onop5,3,2012-01-19,On letters to Senators,[deleted],politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/onop5/on_letters_to_senators/,"I see people post letters from Senators here a lot, so I figured I should contribute something in case people don't know this.

I was an intern for a very powerful Senator from a small state about ten years ago. Things may have changed, and people who have done this more recently can probably add better insight regarding how the approach to e-mail might've shifted, but this is what I gathered:

If someone is looking at the letters or e-mails sent to the office, it will be an unpaid intern, or maybe a low-level mailroom staffer. 

1) In the case of this Senator from a small state, any letters sent by someone from out of state were discarded. Period. They couldn't vote for the Senator, so he did not give a shit. Only letters from zipcodes and cities within the state ended up being opened.

2) The content of the letters themselves were not examined or pondered. These things were noted:
     a) the issue in question in the letter (gun control, abortion, etc.),   
     b) whether the person was taking a pro or anti stance 
                 *to elaborate: there was a spreadsheet. a pro-choice letter added a '1' to the running tally of pro-choice letters. a pro-life added a '1' to the running tally of pro-life letters
                 *same applied to legislation, etc.

3) All the info available regarding the constituent was logged when this letter was. First and last name, state, zip code, phone number.

4) People who were very strongly pro-gun had a note in their file bolded, bright red, and underlined as 'very strongly anti-gun control'. Now, this senator was also anti-gun control because that was a big point among voters in the state, but this is something to note

5) With regards to e-mail, at least at that time, less attention was paid because e-mails could be from anywhere. In order for the e-mail to merit any attention there had to be some explicit identifier indicating it was from a constituent of the state in order for it to be considered-- otherwise it was disregarded. (This may have changed-- ten years is a long time). Also, notice how many Senators have forms on their websites that ask for zipcodes before your e-mail is sent through? That is why-- it is probably filtering them before they even reach the system. If you are from CA and writing a senator for WY, then it probably doesn't even go through.

6) Last step of the process: there were form letters saved in the computer. The intern or low-level staffer, if this was a resident of the state, printed out the appropriate form letter, went to the auto-pen, signed the senator's name with it, sealed it up and mailed something back.

So, essentially, if you write a senator? You add to a tally. That's where your voice gets through: if those tallies add up, it tells the higher level staffers something.

I don't know if that was helpful, but there you go. Don't ask what state or senator this was. It was a long time ago, but I thought this might be useful info if anyone didn't know about it.
_____

A couple unrelated things: the state was small enough that every single mention of the Senator in the major state newspapers was sent onto him daily and distributed throughout the office-- even letters to the editor. The Senator was very intent on seeing these, so he was obviously keeping a personal tab on them.

On a last point: I remember even back then being amazed at how many freaking red-carpet, movie premiere invites a U.S. Senator received, especially in a state that had nothing to do with Hollywood. I only dealt with that mail pile once, but it was a daunting stack of movie premieres, fancy parties, etc.-- but I digress.

 I lost interest in any career in the political field after that, so I have nothing more to contribute here."

Usually when I write these guys it takes a few days to get a response. They must have the copy/paste interns working overtime....

****

Dear (jthurman):
 
Thank you for contacting me about the PROTECT IP Act (PIPA), S. 968, and its House of Representatives companion, the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA). I appreciate your input and want to let you know my view on this important issue.
 
I stand with those who stand for freedom in opposing PIPA in its current form. Freedom of speech is an inalienable right granted to each and every American, and the Internet has become the primary tool with which we utilize this right. The Internet empowers Americans to learn, create, innovate, and express their views. While we should protect American intellectual property, consumer safety and human rights, we should do so in a manner that specifically targets criminal activity. The extreme measures taken in PIPA not only stifle First Amendment rights but also hamper innovation on the Internet. 
 
S. 968, as currently written, allows for abuse of our Constitutional rights, giving the Attorney General sweeping powers to block domain names of websites they deem ""dedicated to infringing activities"". Under current law, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act requires service providers to block access to only infringing material, but S. 968 would block access to entire websites that may carry a page containing infringing material generated by a third-party user. In my view, this is an unacceptable violation of our First Amendment rights. I also worry this type of censorship will be used as a model for foreign repressive regimes to censor the web within their own countries.
 
S. 968 also places too great a burden on small Internet startups, as the bill would provide a private right of action to copyright owners. Since the bill would force the takedown of an entire site, not just the specific infringing page, it would hold user-generated websites liable for any content posted. This fear of liability and resulting uncertainty will cripple innovation on the Internet, one of our greatest economic engines.
 
I am also concerned about the bill's provisions that would undermine the security of the entire Internet. Network engineers and cybersecurity experts warn the technical implementation of the Domain Name System blocking requirement cannot function with the new security protocols, also known as DNSSEC, currently being implemented across the worldwide web.
 
While I support the underlying goals of the bill to crack down on online intellectual property theft, I believe PIPA in its current form is unacceptable. It will have widespread unintended consequences that will stifle freedom of speech and Internet innovation across the globe. This bill places far too much regulation on the Internet and will impact more than just those foreign ""rogue"" websites for which it is intended. I cannot support a bill that recklessly tampers with the Internet and our inalienable rights as citizens of a free nation.
 
Thank you for taking the time to contact me on this issue.  Please feel free to contact me at (312) 886-3506 or online at http://kirk.senate.gov if you have any questions or concerns before Congress or the federal government. It is an honor to serve you in the Senate."

And I had to go to the hospital, with no insurance. All they did was pour saline on the wound and put gauze on it, followed by a tetanus shot, administered by an intern.

The physician by the way that I only saw for one minute, she walked into the room, said ""That's pretty bad"", handed me a prescription and walked out. A nurse is the one that cleaned the wound. I currently work a minimum wage job, that I only make $280 at every two weeks. And I can't afford to make payments currently seeing as their minimum payment plan is for $177 a month. They are now (already) threatening to sent my bill to a collection company...I really don't know what that means, but it's very intimidating.

Hey ya'll, this isn't the first time I've posted here seeking advice. Seeing as I'm one of the younger fellows of this subreddit, you guys have been immensely helpful in helping me sort my career concerns.

I recently got the opportunity to interview with an actuary at a small pension consulting firm in a Chicago suburb in hopes of landing an internship or weekend/summer job. I am meeting him today and have some questions prepared to ask him, but am also anticipating questions from his end and doing my research. I have no exams under my belt of course or any professional certification, this is more of a way for me to get introduced to the career through a professional. Might end up doing basic office work all day, which is fine with me if I can get useful career insight.

So do any of you have information, advice, or other things to offer before I go, especially relating specifically to retirement/pension actuaries that I can understand with a high school education? I told him that I am leaning towards the casualty route with CAS but that I'm more than open to all other paths.

Girl I've been good friends with and talked to since high school visits me at college last year. Over our time apart, through text/facebook/phone I came to realize I wanted to be more than just friends.




I told her my feelings at a party that night, to which she responded ""Oh, throwaway4fa you are hilarious!""




When she realized I was not joking, she ""broke down"" and told me that her parents were going to divorce. She was really shaken up about it and couldn't see herself getting involved with anyone considering she didn't believe that she would ever find ""that special someone"" anymore.



I told her I understood, lets not make things weird, I'd rather be friends than be nothing and hey, who knows, someday you may be ready and I'll be there for you.




Fast forward a year (two weeks ago), and she is ""in a relationship"" on facebook with some guy who was a year below me in highschool. I'll tell you guys it was a blow to the gut. We had still talked often, exchanged texts most everyday and even got together to do a small gift exchange around christmas. I thought things were looking up.



After Christmas though, she stopped texting me at all, and only would speak to me if I texted her first. I was at a loss for what the fuck I did, I asked her multiple times if something was wrong and she said ""no"" of course.



Then, two weeks ago I log onto facebook and see her new relationship in all its glory.



Like I said it was a kick in the gut.



But the more I thought about it...you know what? I though to myself fuck it, if she can't appreciate me then she doesn't deserve to be in my life at all, as a friend or anything.



The most powerful catharsis I have ever experienced took over, and guys I've got to say I feel fucking great! I'm working my ass off in school (already worked hard, but now I've got this new drive to prove to her that she picked wrong, and I'm going to make her regret the fuck out of her decision), and at my internship. 



Asking out a girl who I have been talking to at school tomorrow wish me luck and goddammit, get motivated!



tldr: Girl broke my heart, now I'm out to prove her that she chose really, really fucking poorly"

I know it has been done before, and truthfully I kind of hope it will be done again, but I'm gonna share with you all my thoughts on Day9 and my small story of how I ended up where I am now.

How did I get started with Starcraft?  How did I hear about Day9?  Christmas 2010, I really wanted Starcraft 2.  I didn't know shit about it.  I couldn’t have told you the names of the three races.  I was what you would call a complete noobie.  I had heard about how huge it was in Korea, but I had no grasp of anything beyond that.

I played through the campaign, and of course I thought I was the shit at Terran (really Terran it up :P).  I was eager, after besting the campaign on normal difficulty, to start my adventure into ranked.  I'll have you know, I went straight into my ranked 1v1 placement matches, because practice league sounded boring, and I didn't need 2v2, 3v3, or 4v4 to prove my worth.

My first game?  I was probably finishing up my barracks when a handful of reapers jumped over the wall into my base and started ripping apart my SCVs before I knew what to do with them.  I was freaking out.  My 30 APM to make workers and build a barracks was already too much for me, and now I had these units, that I had honestly only used in one mission in the campaign, completely murdering me.  I'm pretty sure I cried a bit, I felt so awful.  The other guy kind of realized what was going on, and was really nice though, and apologized for doing such a cheesy build.  

I kept playing, and by my 5th placement match I was actually able to beat the other player by outranging his cannons with siege tanks!  I was placed bronze, but I wasn't giving up! A few games later, I had a pretty rough loss again, and afterwards the other player suggested I check out some videos to get a better grasp on the game.  He recommended HD, Husky, and Day9.  I subscribed to all of them on youtube, and started watching and learning, and while HD and Husky are awesome, Day9 completely blew me away!  Noobie Tuesdays were a godsend, and Funday Mondays, which were still pretty new at that point and really fun/ interesting.

Before getting too personal, I'd like to start with some of my thoughts on what makes Sean such a popular figure in the Starcraft 2 scene.  

Sean's level of fame hasn't changed who he is.  He is a regular person still like all of his viewers.  He gets it.  And his imperfections, while possibly detracting from his ""professionalism,"" help him earn the respect of his viewers.  As was part of his intention from the beginning, the chat/ chat involvement really helps to create and foster a sense of community.  It's kind of like sitting there on a giant sofa with thousands of friends all watching along :3

I think a lot of people don't realize the mental level that Sean must have regarding the game.  Knowing the game is just as much part of his job as it is part of a current Pro's job.  Years being a competitor at Brood War helped him develop and understand the competitive mindset behind a game like that.  I will hear people complaining that he can't possibly know the game at the same level as a pro player, and truthfully, I think in a lot of ways this is bullshit.

This culmination of Sean as a person, unafraid to joke and make mistakes and the former pro/ professional caster part of him, come together in a really nice mix.  Beyond that he is an amazing orator, and a genuinely nice and awesome person.  Beyond all of that though, he doesn't treat his viewers as fans, but instead as friends.  He shares himself with his viewers, the very personal and private side of himself.  He reaches out in some ways to every corner of his viewership, may it be some obscure joke, or calling out people and taking the time to be say ""so-and-so is awesome"" before a daily.  He treats his viewers in a way that I could only treat a handful of people I am personally close to.  This, on top of his amazing talent for entertaining/informative casting commentary, is why he is so popular in my opinion.

Now, for the whole life-saving part… (or at least I feel like he did).  I'm a long time atheist, and it has been a long time since I have really been afraid of death… I've struggled with depression for a long time, and like many others suffering as well, suicide is always one of those very real things on your mind.  About a year or so ago, a good friend of mine's roommate killed himself.  A seemingly happy college kid, with a lot of things going for him, not too different from myself, now gone.  It's something that at the very least has left me thinking quite a lot.

As I stated, I've always been pretty depressed, but I've fought it with relentless positivity.  I really enjoy helping others, including my girlfriend, Felicity :P, who also has a lot of difficulties with depression, and I were our own little support group.  Things were looking great around this time, back in the spring of 2011 when I was playing a lot of Starcraft and had just gotten into Day9.  I was offered a job as an intern at Microsoft.  It was an amazing opportunity career-wise for me and I couldn't really turn it down.  It was going to be a long way away in Seattle, though, and my girlfriend was going through some really difficult stuff around that time.  All of this made what should have been an easy and exciting opportunity really difficult for me.

Sure enough, after about a month or so, and a good bit of discussion between the girlfriend and I, she came to the conclusion that we should break up after a long four and a half really solid years of dating. I was respectful and understanding about it, and we even still talk and see each other on occasion.  At that time, though, the mix of a stressful new job, being on the other side of the country, and the fact that this all happened right in time to be the worst 21st birthday present ever made it really rough on me.

The next day, I just didn't show up at work.  It took weeks for it to sink in fully.  Everyone at Microsoft was super cool, and I promised them I'd put in extra time.  I was… to say the least pretty emotional.  I had three really close and amazing friends that helped me out as they could, but when that stuff happens and you've already had a pretty hard time dealing with depression, you need a distraction.  Day9 was that distraction.  I started watching live every day after work.  The AHGL at this time, and getting to see the Microsoft team play live was also really awesome.

I'd fall asleep listening to his dailies or different interview podcasts he had done.  And when I felt bad, Sean was there.  Since then, when I feel shitty and bitter, I'll just put on one of my favorites.  I'll listen to the Valentine’s daily, or ""what natural expansion?"", because I never get tired of watching poor little Megumi stars try to fly :3  So many different gems and moments.  

But you know what really did it, what got me from all of that to being much more awesome?  It was Sean.  He doesn't seem that different from me.  You can tell just how much he has been through.  He has dealt with many more stressful situations than I have.  Relentlessly positive, but still having a pretty tough time dealing with everything going on, just like me.  Recently, he gave his talk on relentless positivity and gave his analogy for emotions using kittens and ninja stars.  That struck a chord.  Yeah, that’s what’s going on.  I've taken a lot of ninja stars in a row, and it suuuucked.  But after getting hit so many times, you start to get a bit numb.  Either you can start being numb to the kittens, or you can take all of that and try to maybe stand in front of a few ninja stars for someone else (or you know, help them look for kittens).

There is no limit to the different ways Sean has been there for me.  Not a celebrity, not someone I look up to-- a friend that knows just how important it is to be relentlessly positive too, and for being everything he is, I have a great respect for him.  I've been a proud subscriber since around the time he started his subscription service.  I try to stay involved and play a positive role in the community.  I remember arguing with one of my friends about how weird it would be being famous and having all these fangirls swooning over you, so I figured it'd make a pretty funny and interesting question for his AMA. [on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16PNOH48Ys&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=1311s) [on Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/jzzi0/iama_day9_lol_ill_be_doing_a_live_ama_tomorrow/c2ggl2p) .  And of course that was my favorite answer :3

Also, I totally have my own version of Manfred. :3 A cute little otter named River that my ex gave me that I cuddle up with every night! MAN MODE! &lt;3

So, for all of this and a lot more. For everything you've done for us, my story along with others.  For not letting fame go to your head and taking the time to be a friend to all of your viewers for over 400 episodes now.  Thank you, Day[9].  Thank you, Sean.  

Don't ever stop doing what you do.  You quite possibly saved my life.  It has been a rough journey, and it may get rougher.  But hey, every once in a while you get a kitten. :3 &lt;3

P.S.  Just watched Daily 403 (The COMPLETE FAILURE DAILY) and that's exactly what I’m talking about.  Just sitting back and talking to his fans.  Not powering through a struggling daily.  Being open with everyone :3

TL;DR  I’ve been through a bit of shit and I’ve struggled with depression, but Day9 and how awesome and friendly he is with his fans, is a constant pick-me-up.  He brings the kittens!

To start, I'm pretty sure I need to go to college, only I have no clue how to search and decide.


Right now I'm getting english riding lessons at the historic riding academy near my house, and I've been riding for about 6 months. I started because I could get a credit for my school, but it quickly turned into an obsession. I'm very close to start jumping, and very excited to do so. I also just picked up an awesome internship at my lesson place. It's my favorite thing in the world and I absolutely love doing whatever is asked of me there. 


One of my school admins overheard me talking about horses and offered me the chance to work at her barn in exchange for her giving me lessons as well. I love cleaning the stalls and changing the water and lungeing her pretty horses. So now I have 2 barns to go to.


Doing all this has really made me thing about my future and what it could bring. Since I only came into the equine community a very short time ago, I am clueless on what kinds of job options there are and would really like to know what I could do and what colleges to could go to. What kind of horse jobs do you have? Anything would be a major help!"
omt2g,16,2012-01-18,The Guilt of Quitting?,malomonster,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/omt2g/the_guilt_of_quitting/,"I am currently a PhD graduate student. I still need to defend my MS thesis, but it's on the way and will be completed this year. I'm in a strong lab with a professor who gives me lots of room to explore and find my niche in my field. I love my labmates. The thing is, I think I'm done.

I'm only in my first year as a PhD student, but I've been an active undergraduate researcher (3.5 of the 4 years I was in college) and did what turned into a 3 year MS.

I've had ""I should just quit"" feelings before due to stress. I know that sometimes I fluctuate between being an amazing scientist and being a fool that no one has figured out yet. Lately, though, it feels like I just don't have the passion and dedication everyone else around me has.

Other than my near-apathy for the work right now, I have plenty of reason I don't want to quit, and most of them are guilt-driven. I don't want my MS professor (who groomed me as an undergrad) to be disappointed in me quitting. I don't want to let down one of my internship mentors (who rejoices every time he sees me presenting a paper). I don't want to abandon my current professor after just a year in his lab.

Has anyone here quit? Either for a short period of time or permanently? What are you feelings about people who drop out of the academic program? I feel like I'm being irrational and that my friends and colleagues will understand my leaving; however, when I've mentioned it in the past, the concept has been scoffed at and I've been told, ""Not *you*!"" 

*Sigh* Maybe I just need to go see a counselor about this..."

In addition to my degree, I have just completed an internship with a small local business where I created graphics for daily product reviews on the company’s website, uploaded videos and other information to its blog and social media sites, and designed other various print and web materials. I have experience working independently on projects but have also worked with multiple designers on collaborations. Once you view my portfolio, you will see that I am capable of not only creating small, informative graphics and logos that quickly get the message across, but also newsletters, posters, and colorful eye-catching graphic art as well. As an example, in 2009 I was awarded first place out of 35,000 entries in the national Victoria’s Secret Design-A-Tee contest and my shirt design was sold in stores across the nation.

omp6c,2,2012-01-18,Question of what skills to list - Computer Science,diamond29,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/omp6c/question_of_what_skills_to_list_computer_science/,"I'm going to be graduating with a BS in computer science in the spring so I'm getting my resume together now to send out for jobs that are hiring in the summer. I've used maybe a dozen or more languages and frameworks since high school.

My question is, what languages and skills should I be listing on my resume? 

Last semester I did a project with OpenCL and C and I recently just made a simple visual C#.net app to learn a bit about the language and brush up on sql. The only languages I think I really feel comfortable taking interview questions on would be c, c++ and java, but I've used a dozen things like php, ruby, mysql, python, html and c# on projects before and haven't touched them since.

I do feel rather unprepared compared to what I've read on the internet to expect and I am trying to brush up on everything through some side projects. I'm mostly just worried that I will flounder if they ask me some intense php questions or something like that. I feel like my greatest asset is being able to pick up any language relevant to a project and be productive with it.

Another point worth noting...my mother passed away right before last summer break after a long bout with cancer and then my father followed suddenly after. This has definitely had an effect on my coursework/ability to prepare myself for employment, particularly when I had to drop my internship at school to go back home. Should I bring this up in an interview or not? I do think my resume would look different without this happening."

As a hill staffer I want to say today's level of activity was extreme and that it was noticed.  Good job.  Our phones were ringing off the hook from the time we opened until we shut them down at closing time.  

In my office (which was already a ""no"" on SOPA/PIPA) we received the following: 

* ~800 Emails, largely from individuals who had not written previously. 
* ~250 phone calls
* ~50 faxes 
* Dozens of posts on social media sites (twitter, facebook etc.) although these are not really counted to the same extent.  

I would say most Congressional offices send out between 1500 and 4000 pieces of mail a month.  Sometimes more, but offices have to be REALLY good with mail to be much higher than that figure on a regular basis.  
Generating 1,000+ points of contact in a DAY is meaningful and that means that every office will take these concerns seriously, even if they may disagree with your stance.  Seriously impressive stuff.  If young people chose to meaningfully participate on this level regarding other issues, they would have much more influence over the political process than they do today.  

I would like to reiterate some tips for contacting a member of Congress: 

**1. Be polite and respectful.** The people answering the phones are probably almost as young as you are, and likely care about the same things.  Taking out your frustration on a Staff Assistant isn't going to accomplish anything but getting you hung up on.

**2. Be concise.** We don't need you to list off and explain your 18 bullet points about why SOPA (or Keystone XL, or NDAA, or whatever else) is the worst thing to happen to the country in years.  
State what the issue you're calling about is.  State your position.  Keep it short - when you hang up, that phone will be ringing with someone else about the same issue.  Staff Assistants and interns don't set (or even meaningfully influence) policy and your long-winded explanation will be wasted time for you both.

**3. Please, please: Know what the hell you’re talking about.** Don’t call me and ask why the government turned off Wikipedia.  Don’t call me and ask about the bill to turn off the internet.  Don’t call me and just be completely oblivious.  Please read a summary about whatever it is you’re calling about so that you can at least refer to the right thing.  If you want to be taken seriously at least put 30 seconds of effort into it.  

I don’t expect you to know or understand the intricacies of private causes of action and what they could theoretically do to social media sites on the internet.  I just want you to understand that the government didn’t force reddit or Wikipedia to shut down today, but that it was instead a protest to raise awareness.  This isn’t rocket science.  

**4. Leave your Information.** If you leave your information, you demonstrate a) you are a constituent and b) you want to be counted.  Calling up and telling someone you support a bill but refusing to leave your information means that you won't be counted.  Why?  Because we can't verify that you are calling from X state or district instead of Y.  If you are in state or district Y and can't vote for the Congressperson, they aren't concerned about what you think, because they don't represent you.  

This is especially true for emails.  Don’t just fire off an email without any identifying information.  Make sure that we can tell you are from the district.  Include your full name and address.

**5. Ask for a Response if you want one.** You are one of several hundred individuals calling the member of Congress about the same issue.  Are you going to get an individualized response?  No.  Don’t expect one.  Expect that you are going to get the same letter that everyone else contacting us about the topic will.  Make it clear that you want to hear back though.  You may not, but adding that expectation puts pressure on the offices to actually respond.  

**6. Don’t bother asking for a response via facebook or google+.**  I’ll be honest – it’s hard to keep track of all the avenues that people try to communicate with members of Congress.  While not ideal, Congressional staff rarely have a set up to log and track comments and questions sent in via social media.  Why?  Because, as above, we can’t verify that you are even a constituent.  If you aren’t a constituent, we aren’t supposed to respond to you (due to Congressional courtesy.)  If you want a response, please either call, email, fill out a form on the member’s web page, or send a letter in the mail.  It isn’t that much extra work, and there are meaningful processes set up to track and respond to those sorts of inquiries in many cases.  

**7. Acknowledge the good Members.** I see a lot of cynicism here on reddit about members of Congress being bought and paid for.  And some of them?  Yea, they are.  But - are some of them honestly good people who fight each and every day for American citizens?  Absolutely yes.  More than you would think.  If your member of Congress has come out on the right side of this or any other issue you feel strongly about, please spread the word!  Like them on facebook.  Circle them on google plus.  Reshare their posts and make positive comments so that they know people appreciate it when they go out on a limb to do what is right.  Members of congress doing the right thing are often overlooked on social media and I think that is a tragedy.

I'm following this link https://www.laquadrature.net/wiki/How_to_act_against_ACTA , though I'm not sure what to expect. I've read that in the USA an intern of the congressman will answer and simply note you down and add to the system. Does the same happen here too? I'm calling my representative from the trade commitee, there are 4 numbers listed next to the person. Two of them in France. I'll just assume all of them reach where I need to call. What language do I open with? I'd expect them to speak English, but if I open up saying ""I'm from Lithuania"" in English I think it might make the conversation akward if the assistant (or the MEP) is Lithuanian too.

Just not to appear like an idiot... These guys aren't voting, they're just preparing the proposition for the plenary vote, right?"

omgf0,1,2012-01-18,My boss was talking about me to other coworkers,perhapsfired,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/omgf0/my_boss_was_talking_about_me_to_other_coworkers/,"I'm an intern at a marketing firm in upstate New York. I returned to work over winter break, and I'm about to go back to school. Today, my boss told me to search through his email to find a report I had sent him. I searched my name, and instead of finding mail I sent, I found a conversation about me. I can't go into specifics, but the conversation basically stated that they didn't want me to return to work after I had finished my time there this past summer break. My boss basically said that he felt bad and couldn't say no when I contacted him before coming back this month, even though this is my third year working there during school breaks (did he think if he didn't contact me that I just would pretend the job hadn't existed?)

No one knows I saw this email. I feel humiliated. I've been walking around this office all month and everyone was probably thinking ""ughhh...I thought this guy got canned."" The real kicker is that my boss told me on the last day of my summer work days (the last time I saw him before he sent the email to my coworkers) that he couldn't wait for me to graduate so he could hire me full time. I'm stunned and embarrassed. Each time I've returned back to school, my boss is always so kind about my work performance and gushes about how excited he is for me to return for next school break. I don't get it. I honestly cannot think of a single thing would change his opinion from the time he offered me a job and the time he sent me the email. I went back to school several hours away. 

**TL;DR despite the fact that my boss told me he can't wait to hire me once I graduate, he and his second in command have been emailing how they didn't want me to return back to work from school**

Reddit: I know that I cannot tell him that I found this email, but what would be a good way of starting a conversation about this? My best guess is to ask for a performance review. I feel like at the very least he owes me some honesty. I apologize for any grammatical mistakes. I'm typing on my iphone, and I'm super flustered.

I've been reading for a while, and I just wanted to get some feedback/advice: 

I graduated with a Masters in HCI (from an interdisciplinary program) last year. I'm trying to break into the UX research field, and have had a terrible time with it. I've been applying and interviewing for 8 months now, and I still haven't been able to secure a job. There AREN'T any junior/entry-level UX positions...what's an entry-level type person supposed to do? 

I've got enough projects that I think prove my worth, breadth and depth [they've been reframed so as not to seem too much like academic projects], and a couple of decent internships [when I went for the big internships, they said I wasn't experienced enough. Now that I've graduated, I'm ""too experienced"" for an internship, but not experienced enough to hire]. 

I'm not *the best* designer (research/analytics strengths), but I can do some wireframing and web design. I also code some (though I'm not a confident coder, but I'm working on it). I also worked with a lot of social media management/marketing before, with employed jobs. I'm well-versed in design theory and application (I also have an undergrad background in psychology, lots of traditional research and statistics). 

There are a few that I've botched, but there are many more where, after being referred or knowing someone at the company, I interview, apply, and can't seem to get to the next stage. How *do* people get these jobs? Is it a close relation to a ""UX ninja/rockstar""? Am I supposed to be positioning myself in someway to be seen and well known (the other students who graduated with me who are UXRs at the big companies didn't have to do that or go through most of what I have, and they're not very forthcoming about why they've had different experiences). 

I've talked about my frustration @  [/r/jobs](/r/jobs) before, but I wanted to get a different perspective from people who are actually IN the field working. All I want to do is conduct usability testing, and brainstorm/design digital and technological innovations that make computer interaction easier and/or people's lives better. 

I've gone to NPO and other organizations locally for freelance/free portfolio work, but they're pretty well covered by ad/design agencies - and those guys aren't looking for people like me (it's an elite crowd - if you're not friends with them already/are ""like them"", then you won't get hired). 

Well, I think I've very thoroughly ranted. Hopefully it made some sense. Thanks.

Even if you’re ridiculously busy, ANYONE can get in touch with their Members of Congress and have their opinions heard. I’ll start with the easiest. In general, you want to get in touch with the Washington, DC offices of your Members as that is there legislative issues are generally handled.



**PHONE CALLS**


Phone calls normally take just a few minutes, even if you have to wait a while to get a human being on the phone due to high call volumes (fairly typical of Senate offices or anyone high profile).


When you call, have the name of the proposed legislation and bill number ready. House bill numbers start with “H.R.” or “H.Res.” Senate bill numbers start with “S.” When someone answers the phone, just say “I’m calling to oppose/support [insert legislation here] [insert bill number here].”


 If you want to give a specific reason why, give it, but keep it short. The first person who answers the phone is typically a staff assistant (lowest paid person the totem pole) or an intern, and unless they’re a supreme idiot or have been authorized to speak on the issue (highly unlikely), they will not be able to engage you very much.


The most information they will ask of you is your zip code - this is to find out if you’re a constituent living in their district. You are welcome to provide more information if you would like to get a letter or email in response to your opinions or concerns.


So what happens to this information? Well, it gets tallied up and is given either to the Chief of Staff, press person, or whoever is in charge of knowing what people are calling in about. Easy-peasy. Admittedly, offices that have very safe districts (little to no competition come election time) don’t really bother with doing this.


I also cannot emphasize it enough: BE POLITE TO WHOEVER ANSWERS THE PHONE, NO MATTER HOW STUPID YOU THINK THEIR BOSS IS. Most Congressional staff are overworked, underpaid, and normal labor laws do not apply to them. Be kind.


I saw a Reddit post that encouraged talking to the Legislative Correspondent (LCs) or Legislative Assistant (LAs) who work in the issue area. If you're living in a district with a small constituency, you could probably do it. Senate office or anyone high profile, it will probably be very difficult. LAs and LCs typically do legislative research all day long on top of meeting with lobbying groups, organizations or other government officials. If you want to take this route, prepare to be patient.



**WRITING YOUR CONGRESSMAN**


Writing your Congressman will not only engage him or her on an issue but solidly puts on you on record on where you stand. 


RESIST THE URGE OF USING EXISTING TALKING POINTS OR A FORM LETTER. If you send a form letter, you’ll most likely get a form letter back. You get more or less what you receive.


Keep your letters concise, specific, and under a page. Please note that all sealed, paper mail sent to Congress is irradiated and delays receipt by two weeks. If you insist on sending something on paper, drop it off at your local Congressional office. If you want to put it in an envelope, KEEP IT UNSEALED. Trust me, they take biological threats sent in the mail very, very seriously.


Here’s the secret if you REALLY want someone in an office to look at your letter: address multiple issues. Seems counterintuitive, but let me explain how Congress works...


Each Legislative Assistant (LA) in a Congressional office specializes on a limited of issues. For example, one might specialize in Education &amp; Labor and Judiciary issues, and another will do Environmental and Armed Services issues. They will take a look at all correspondence that relates to their issue areas because they need to know what constituents care about.

So if you write a letter with concerns in multiple issue areas, you're likely to get more than one person who's going to look at your letter and they will customize it to answer all of your questions. Custom, multiple-issue letters like these also almost never go out unless they're reviewed by the Chief of Staff or a press person.

A bit of background:

I am 19. I met this fantastic girl at work (also 19), she was there for a month and we really hit it off. When her internship ended I asked her out and we started dating. That is all nice and sweet. The problem is, she was my intern. Also, my father works for the same company, and her father is my father's supervisor. Naturally, we kept it all secret.

She lived 3 hours away, and because of our schedules, we only saw each other on the weekend and as we got closer and close the pain of being apart got more and more difficult. It was a great relationship, some of the best times of my life, and I know It was special to her too as I was her first boyfriend. 

However, all the distance was causing issues. It led to me being clingier. After about 5 months in, It began to lead into silly little fights on the phone day in and day out. 

We broke it off at the turn of the 6 months. After another round of stupid pointless arguing that evening, over skype. She told me she can't do this anymore and she needs her time and space. I felt heartbroken, we always talked about how difficult it would be but in the end ultimately worth it all. And I felt like her saying she can't carry on anymore was her giving up. It really crushed me.

We kept talking, promising to be friends and all that. However, we met up twice since then (it has been about a month) and both times we acted like a couple. We still talked daily and texted all the time. However, the other day we got into an argument (she didn't want me at her birthday, and all the reasons she gave were terrible, I respected and accepted that but I let her know how much it upset me) and then I proceeded to get very upset. Here is where I fucked up and the shit hit the fan:

When I texted her later, she did not respond, but I kept doing it, I freaked out a little bit on her. It culminated with me telling her that I am going to tell her dad. This is something that would hurt her very much, and I did it anyway. I said it out of anger. 

She called me back right away, she said she was in class. and she said she can't believe I would threaten to hurt her like that, and that I broke her heart. I instantly regretted it, I did not realize quiet how much I hurt her. I apologized profusely but she was hurt too deep. She told me not to contact her, and she told she would contact me when she was ready to be friends (if that happens at all). The last thing she texted me was ""You hurt me, I need space"". I agreed.

I feel like a massive asshole now, and a terrible person. 

So What do I do now? I feel so lost and confused. I love this girl, I want her in my life as a friend or as a girlfriend. Is there anything I can do to fix this at all??

**TL;DR: Close relationship fell apart from distance. Tried to be friends. Didn't work out too well. I freaked out, acted like an asshole and hurt her over a text. what do I do now?**

I am 19. I met this fantastic girl at work (also 19), she was there for a month and we really hit it off. When her internship ended I asked her out and we started dating. That is all nice and sweet. The problem is, she was my intern. Also, my father works for the same company, and her father is my father's supervisor. Naturally, we kept it all secret.

She lived 3 hours away, and because of our schedules, we only saw each other on the weekend and as we got closer and close the pain of being apart got more and more difficult. It was a great relationship, some of the best times of my life, and I know It was special to her too as I was her first boyfriend. 

However, all the distance was causing issues. It led to me being clingier. After about 5 months in, It began to lead into silly little fights on the phone day in and day out. 

We broke it off at the turn of the 6 months. After another round of stupid pointless arguing that evening, over skype. She told me she can't do this anymore and she needs her time and space. I felt heartbroken, we always talked about how difficult it would be but in the end ultimately worth it all. And I felt like her saying she can't carry on anymore was her giving up. It really crushed me.

We kept talking, promising to be friends and all that. However, we met up twice since then (it has been about a month) and both times we acted like a couple. We still talked daily and texted all the time. However, the other day we got into an argument (she didn't want me at her birthday, and all the reasons she gave were terrible, I respected and accepted that but I let her know how much it upset me) and then I proceeded to get very upset. Here is where I fucked up and the shit hit the fan:

When I texted her later, she did not respond, but I kept doing it, I freaked out a little bit on her. It culminated with me telling her that I am going to tell her dad. This is something that would hurt her very much, and I did it anyway. I said it out of anger. 

She called me back right away, she said she was in class. and she said she can't believe I would threaten to hurt her like that, and that I broke her heart. I instantly regretted it, I did not realize quiet how much I hurt her. I apologized profusely but she was hurt too deep. She told me not to contact her, and she told she would contact me when she was ready to be friends (if that happens at all). The last thing she texted me was ""You hurt me, I need space"". I agreed.

I feel like a massive asshole now, and a terrible person. 

So What do I do now? I feel so lost and confused. I love this girl, I want her in my life as a friend or as a girlfriend. Is there anything I can do to fix this at all??

**TL;DR: Close relationship fell apart from distance. Tried to be friends. Didn't work out too well. I freaked out, acted like an asshole and hurt her over a text. what do I do now?**

I don't know where to turn and I figured you all would give me some interesting responses. I want to make a million bucks and this is why.

I am about as close to the 99% as I can get. I'll be graduating from a highly ranked University in May with a B.S. in something that I learned employers prefer to hire environmental and civil engineers for. I even formed a professional society for this particular career and had a very successful career fair. During the fair we had a discussion panel for all the employers and they basically told me that despite my great record and experience, I need a M.S. or PhD and a minimum or 10 years experience. Furthermore if I did meet those qualifications I would probably make somewhere in the neighborhood of $45k-55k a year For a solid 10 years of schooling. At this point I will be interning for the next five years or so. One company offered me a 12 month internship making $180 per week... Fuck that. I don't want to make $9k a year living somewhere I don't want to live not even able to enjoy my weekends. I want to be comfortable and enjoy my time. I don't like having a $40/week food budget. I want to surprise my significant other with nice things. I want to own a home. I want to take a few years and sail around the world. I want to be able to donate to charities without skipping meals. I am the kind of person who will always be able to find a job and be successful, but I want to be financially successful and that is something the will be perpetually be beyond my grasp if I don't do something to change it. 

Fortunately I'm graduating completely debt free. I have no car payments, my education was paid for by scholarships, and I have enough saved to keep me floating for a couple months after graduation. I want to make a million dollars before I'm 30. My questions for the millionaires are: (1) What single book would you recommend I read (something that will either inspire me, give me a thorough understanding of stocks or some sort of investment, or whatever)? (2) What news sources/kinds of sources should I be paying attention too and reading daily? (3) What should I start doing immediately (other than saving, I already do) to help me reach this goal?"

OK, now the rules ...

#1. You MAY ask for a consult on a case in this forum as long as you a. post no personal information about the client (obviously) and b. only accept the consults via private message. There should be no consults posted as threads in reply to the original post. Asking for additional information is fine, but the final consult should go to the OPs private message Inbox.

#2. No bashing the other mental health fields. We all know there is some contention between the fields, but trust me when I say there is room for us all, and clients that work better with a particular one.

#3. Feel free to share research but keep in mind the ethical standards to either link to the original source or put the reference (no, it doesn't have to be in APA format)

I know this topic has probably been discussed before but I feel I might need some custom advice for my specific situation.

I am a recent graduate with a Bachelors and Honours degree in Graphic Design. I live in Auckland, New Zealand and attended AUT (all the kiwis out there should know it).

Since I graduated in November 2011, I haven't been able to find a smidgen of anything that resembles a full-time position at a design firm. I've been hopping around freelance jobs but I want something permanent yet it seems without the right connections in such a small place like Auckland it is impossible to get anywhere. I am even willing to move countries to somewhere like Australia or the U.K for work but don't know the first thing about even taking the first step towards something like that. 

I have even been offering to do unpaid internships at design firms to build up experience/maybe turn the internship into a job but there just doesn't seem to be any places with spaces open or willing to take on a recent graduate.

So reddit, can you please offer some advice about how to break into the industry in a small city like Auckland where the jobs are incredibly sparse. Any help would be incredibly appreciated.

While the work interests me, I know that I've entered a career path where the majority of my peers will have degrees in mechanical or electrical engineering, and I've noticed that most job postings I'm interested in ask for ""mechanical, electrical, or other related engineering majors."" 

While I've found some other chemical engineers in this line of work, most of them got there after getting some experience in more typical ChemE jobs first, while I've started fresh in this industry. I chose to pursue this over more typical ChemE jobs because I have an interest in getting into energy policy and I figured this would keep my options open while getting me some technical experience. My (vague) long term plan is to work a few more years and either pursue an MBA, or a masters in public policy, or maybe a masters in MechE. I'd like to get some idea as to whether my future career prospects in this industry are really as open as I'd like to think, or will my undergrad degree just limit me down the road.

I'd like to hear some of your stories of engineers working in industries atypical of their undergrad majors to hopefully get some insight into my own situation. Thanks."

English isn't my native language so sorry for any mistakes, dont really care. I'm just gonna write whatever comes to my mind. I dont expect anyone to read through it or give a shit, you all probably have your own problems.

Also, I'm 19. If you're just gonna say ""you're only 19, it gets better"" - dont bother. It doesn't. 

I graduated a year ago and am now qualified to work with computers. I've been unemployed for a year and have never worked aside from two internships. My parents are alive, they're not alcoholics or drug addicts, just regular upper middle class people. So I guess I dont have any real problems and am just a whining bitch, that's what people keep telling me.

I spend all my unemployment benefits on gambling because its the only thing that makes me feel alive, as retarded as that sounds. I still bet everything even if I almost certainly know I will lose. I still do it. It makes me looks forward to something.

I dont have a reason not to work and I've been going to interviews almost weekly. I always go in as happy and as optimistic a person can be but never get hired. Lately I've been losing motivation and I stopped sending out applications. There must be something wrong with me if I can't even get hired at Mickey Dees.

I have no friends and never really even talked to a female. I dont see how that would change even if I did get a job, so why even bother. I failed at life and its too late to try and fix it now, I have too much catching up to do. I guess if I had a job and money, I could buy a hooker to get rid of my virginity. Maybe that would cheer me up? Probably not. It seems too fake but its also the only choice I have.

I do everything alone. I wake up, fire up the computer and spend the rest of my day online. I dont like to do it and most of the time I just end up listening to music and staring at the monitor for hours. I can't watch movies or television shows anymore because they remind me that there are people out in the world with friends and partners and I will never experience what those people take for granted. I've been trying to tell myself that I can manage alone but I just can't do it anymore. I guess its just human nature. I still live with my parents and its the only reason I'm still alive because I can't imagine sitting alone in a quiet house for 24 hours a day. I would literally go without saying a word for months.

**Rant**
 
~~I hate how America's leaders are either idiots who don't know what they're doing, or saboteurs who know exactly what they're doing.~~ This is probably true in some respect almost everywhere, so disregard.

I hate the American culture, with God being crucial in every significant thing. 

I hate how sex is still taboo, and knowing that any future daughter of mine may be mocked and bullied for being herself.

I hate the fact that gay rights is even a fucking issue. I mean, why the fuck are people still being treated as second class citizens?

I hate knowing that my future kids will have to either struggle with a shitty public school, or be subjected to the bullshit of a private school. 

I hate that the way my parents raised me (which I honestly can't think of any better way) is considered strange, unorthodox and dangerous. 
All of the positive things that we stand for take a backseat to old and outdated thinking. 

I'm just sick of the mindset. The financial problems of anywhere will blow over, I just want to live with people who aren't ignorant about so many things.

I'm just beginning to look into Grad Schools. My career goal is ultimately to have my own practice, clinical counseling adolescent/adult clients. also possibly to work in a school system as a counselor at some point. 
I don't have a stellar GPA due to one bad semester following a family medical emergency and being a transfer student who has 60+ credits not being calculated into my GPA.
I am doing an internship at a Crisis Center and have about 6 months of volunteer service at the same place. 
The family emergency teamed with some other personal drama made it so I'm damn proud that I've managed to graduate with a 3.0 and landed an internship despite it all, participating in research was not a viable option for me, unfortunately. 

I'm 75% sure I'm going to go the MSW route but have recently taken a second look into doctoral options.
I am definitely more interested in the therapy side of things, so Psy.D has been mentioned to me but I am not sold on it as accredited programs are scarce on the west coast and the expense.

Ph.D is daunting at this point, mostly the application process.  I don't have any research experience beyond Intro to methods of research class.  I don't even know where to begin, how to contact prospective professors at universities, much less what to say I have to contribute.  Again, I don't have some grandiose research idea I'd want to pursue, this is not to say I wouldn't enjoy doing research. 
I'm not sure a Ph.D program would even be an option for me at this point, and I'd have no problem going back later after getting an MSW and maybe finding a niche to research.

Does anyone have any advice?  Would it be a waste of time and money to even apply to Ph.D programs? If not, what's the best way to go about making those connections now?

Although it's difficult to classify any of their work as music (for primarily their songs are composed of barbaric, anguished yelps and bellows), it's certainly chilling and compelling to listen to. Apparently all of the band's members are employed at a psychiatric facility and were granted permission to escort patients to an abandoned factory for ""scream"" therapy, where they were able to record and create their first album. Their cover art was also done by various patients during psychotic episodes.

oq31x,2,2012-01-21,Unhappy with my college major - any suggestions?,whattodo_ta,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/oq31x/unhappy_with_my_college_major_any_suggestions/,"I just graduated from a 4 year private liberal arts university with a degree in graphic design and multimedia. I had no idea what I wanted to do leaving high school, just knew I excelled at art, so I went for graphic design. My teachers talked me into the double major because they felt it was more applicable to the modern age.

Here's the thing - I really was not happy with these things. My least favorite classes were the ones for my major. I did an internship my senior year and it was the most miserable job I've ever held.

I learned that I need to be working with my hands to be happy, rather than working with data or on a computer. I like to be active during the workday. Also I need to be around other people. Not necessarily working with the public, but have a job where I am able to socialize with co-workers, bounce ideas off of them, openly talk during the workday rather than sit isolated in a cube. 

My favorite class in college was sculpture - it was the perfect mix of creativity and action, plus we worked in a foundry where you could do your work while talking to the other artists openly. I loved the blue-collar hard-working physical nature of the job, but it had the need for thought and creativity that I would miss doing pure blue collar work. However, I'm hesitant to take more classes in sculpture, because it seems like a limited field.

Since graduation I've been working in a grocery store kitchen, and it's given me the idea of possibly studying to be a pastry chef? That seems like a solid combination of creativity and hands-on work. With that said, I'm a total outsider to that field.


**TL;DR: I'm looking for a job that combines my desires (hands-on, physical, collaborative work. Not stuck at a chair on a computer for 8 hours a day) with my degree (graphic design and multimedia) and adult work experience (8 months in a kitchen). Ideas?**"

oq115,2,2012-01-21,Should I break up?,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/oq115/should_i_break_up/,"Throwaway for privacy reasons.

Hey everyone (wall of text warning), so I need some advice on how I should proceed in a perilously rocky relationship.

About a month ago, my girlfriend of 3 years (both are 21) left for an internship in Europe for 2 months. Before she left we had a good relationship and only had minor squabbles every 6 or so months that we always resolved maturely. 

Since she left for Europe, she became incredibly distant. I would be the one who would always initiate conversations and skype chats and I would always be the one saying ""I miss you"" or ""I love you"" which she would never say on her own accord. I started to feel that something was wrong, so I asked her about it and she claimed that ""that's how she is when she travels abroad, I barely talk to anyone home"". 

The final straw came when I sent her a text saying ""I love you"" after this conversation about her being distant with no response. I knew something was wrong and didn't want to wait 2 months to get broken up with. So I did something I shouldn't have and feel terrible about, I snooped into her facebook account. In a conversation with her friend I discovered that she was intending to break up with me, because she didn't miss me and was annoyed when I called to talk.

I confronted her about it, at first she was furious about me invading her privacy but after a long and emotional phone conversation she admitted that she wanted to see how she felt when she got back before deciding to break-up with me, because she claimed she felt like a different person in Europe and that might change when she got back. I couldn't believe she would keep me on the hook for 2 months without even considering my own feelings.

I'm still deeply in love with her and during the phone conversation we said we would try put the mend on our relationship but she still couldn't say that she wanted to stay together when we got back.

Reddit this is killing me, I love her and don't want to break up but I can't wait another whole month in maybe land. I don't have many friends and am currently unemployed due to just finishing university. I'm incredibly scared of being alone and this is clouding my judgement. 

Should I just break it off? or are there alternatives to making it somehow work? Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you"

We've been going out for almost three years, and we've been living together from the start. I've been happy with her until I purchased an engagement ring; then I started seeing her bad points a lot more than usual (my perspective changed, not her).""Is she really the right one"" and ""I'm sure there are better ones out there"" are questions that I ask myself a lot, even though I know she is a great girlfriend, and even though my main goal was to answer this one : ""How should I propose her?"".

After a few months pondering on both subjects (how to propose and is she the right one), I started to have fears about whether I would be happy with her.

Our sex drives are very different; mine has always been very high, and hers very low. I've always been the one asking for sex, but I was fine with that - 'cause, hey, at least I got sex. She always enjoys it and is not concerned by her appearance. She takes the pill - some friends told me it lessens the libido; when I tried to talk her into not taking the pill anymore, she replied that it wouldn't change much to her libido, and wouldn't discuss it further. I think she just has a naturally low libido, but I wish it were something else.

Back to the engagement. My own way to suppress my fears is to run right into them, so I did. I proposed her a few weeks ago, and we're now engaged. Of course, the fear of ""will I be happy with her"" is now more alive than ever. Side effects include, but are not restricted to : intense urge to flirt online, fapping to random girls, even higher libido and not being completely happy with the current girlfriend for no good reason whatsoever.

It's getting worse these days, mainly because we both work full-time and have other time-consuming activities when we get back from work. Also, we moved in a tiny room (we had to move for our internship) and I might feel more ""trapped"" than usual because of that. Sex once a week, and only if I ask for it a lot (pretty much like before the internship, now that I think about it).

Finally, I have to admit that I've always fapped a lot. Before the internship, I've been making up for the lack of sex by fapping (without her knowing), and the lack of sex then did not seem a problem at all; but now, in our tiny room and our identical schedule, it's impossible for me to compensate. And sometimes, I dare to think about ending the relationship (silly me!).

At that point, other fears emerge, especially the one regarding cheating. She's the first one who's never cheated on me (and I know she would never do so), and I'm scared of being cheated on by future girlfriends (even though it probably was just a terrible bad luck). Also, how would I end it? And WHO WILL KEEP THE CATS??

More seriously, I will not end the relationship. At least, not during the internship, and I will certainly wait until we move back in our bigger apartment and see if I'm fine with fapping when she's ""too tired"", when she has her daily headaches, when she has to get up too early and and and.

I wish she would just wake up and jump me. Every two or three days.


I've been reading topics with similar subjects but couldn't feel any more better about it - it just made me want to end it even more.
Thanks in advance to everyone who will read this post and give their input."

""The National Science Foundation (NSF) funds a large number of research opportunities for undergraduate students through its REU (Research Experiences for Undergraduates) Sites program. An REU Site consists of a group of ten or so undergraduates who work in the research programs of the host institution. Each student is associated with a specific research project, where he/she works closely with the faculty and other researchers. Students are granted stipends and, in many cases, assistance with housing and travel. Undergraduate students supported with NSF funds must be citizens or permanent residents of the United States or its possessions. An REU Site may be at either a US or foreign location.
By using the web page, Search for an REU Site, you may examine opportunities in the subject areas supported by various NSF units. Also, you may search by keywords to identify sites in particular research areas or with certain features, such as a particular location.
Students must contact the individual sites for information and application materials. NSF does not have application materials and does not select student participants. A contact person and contact information is listed for each site.
DEADLINE INFO: Each program states its own deadline, but I have seen several that are as soon as February 15. 
MAJORS: There are diverse opportunities. While the sciences are overwhelmingly represented, there are opportunities for majors in psychology, sociology, political science, etc.
CAVEAT: US Citizenship or permanent residency required
BOTTOM LINE: Many of these present fascinating, applied experience in addition to a healthy stipend (e.g., $4K plus certain expenses). Some programs offer an international research component, as well, e.g., China, Austria.""

Basically, what happened was murphy's law and just about every bad thing possible happened to me in a very short time frame which really took a toll on me. The school itself is an awful fit; just about everyone is from NYC and there is a very cliquey/ethically segregated atmosphere. The academic are based more around busywork, cheating and gaming the system than actually learning anything. I've had a hard time finding a boyfriend here since most (decent) guys either want a slutty girl for one night or  have a girlfriend already. I can't seem to connect with people. I have a group of “friends” I regularly go out with but outside of drinking we don't have that many common interests outside of that. If I do meet awesome people, our social circles don't overlap and I rarely get to see them.  I absolutely hate it here but transferring out is simply not an option.

I probably sound like a whiner and all but I feel trapped and I'm just counting down the days until I can leave. I beginning to have regrets about wasting 2+ years of my life here. Hell, I'm even acting like a prisoner. I work out 6 days a week, have taken up water coloring and even started writing a horrible novel.  I talked to a counselor about this and they say I have some adjustment disorder that I should just ride out.

I still am uncomfortable with a cold approach, but this progress shows me how easy a cold approach could be.

The only catch was that I ran too hard on Thursday, and that has caused me to be unable to do anything active since then; I'm starting to feel the need to exercise. So I need to keep in mind that I have limits on my working out, and I feel much better if I don't push them. The other thing I'd like to change is instead of going climbing and then running, I'd like to alternate climbing and running days. I'd also like to swim and do yoga, but right now I want to focus on actually getting into the habit of running and climbing, then I can complicate it again. 

Something that didn't go well this week were my new affirmations. I don't know why, but I just didn't connect with them. So instead, I kept my affirmations for fear and happiness, and made up one about not being needy. Those have worked really well. This week, I think I'm going to keep these three, and add one about trusting my subconscious. I love the idea of trusting my subconscious, and I realized that when it came time to pick another affirmation, I was afraid of that one... So I picked it. 

One experience I had last week that really caught my attention was that after my first day of my internship with at risk teenagers, I felt like I truly knew what it means to accept someone as they are. When I wasn't trying to be their friend, I just relaxed, and let them say what they wanted to say. I didn't judge them, but I still got to know them, but all the pressure was gone. This is one thing I'd like to bring into my normal life. So this week when I do my internship, I'll see if that sticks around, and maybe follow up on the idea next week when I have a better understanding. 

My list of things to do this week are below.

+ Journal about fear, boundaries, self care, and happiness. 

+ Exercise – Alternate climbing and running.

+ Affirmations

+ Meeting people in my activities

After writing this post, I realize that a lot of what I'm doing is starting to succeed, but I still have a set back here and there. I can feel everything start to come into place, and I think once it all clicks, I will be back to my full happiness potential."

As a venture-capitalist, Romney's first major business deal involved investing in a start-up office supply company with one store in Massachusetts that sold office supplies. That company, called Staples, now has over 2,000 stores and employs over 90,000 people. Romney or his company Bain Capital (using what became known as the ""Bain Way"") would go on to perform the same kinds of business miracles again and again, with companies like Domino's, Sealy, Brookstone, Weather Channel, Burger King, Warner Music Group, Dollarama, Home Depot Supply, and many others. Got your calculators handy? 

Let's recap. Volunteer campaign worker for his dad's gubernatorial campaign 1 year. Unpaid intern in Governor's office 8 years. Mormon missionary in Paris 2 years. Unpaid bishop and stake president for his church 10 years. No salary as president of the Olympics 3 years. No salary as MA governor 4 years. 

That's a grand total of 28 years of unpaid service to his country, his community and his church. Why? Because that's the kind of man Mitt Romney is."
ore88,12,2012-01-22,"My mind wants to leave, my heart wants to stay",dontknowanymoar,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ore88/my_mind_wants_to_leave_my_heart_wants_to_stay/,"I am a guy in my early twenties, girlfriend through 2½ years is the same age. This my first long-term relationship.

She is from a different country and we met while she was on exchange in my country. After hooking up we quickly fell in love and she got an internship to stay longer with me. After 1 year together, she moved back home and we were long distance for a year, each visiting the other for a month during the long distance period. Then I went on exchange to her country for ½ year (which I where I am now, about to go home...).

The thing is, my stay here was not as good as I had hoped. She has grown a lot moodier and admits herself that she changed and she insists I changed too. Problems typically surfaced whenever I didn't have enough time to spend with her alone and with my full attention, either because I was socialising in my new student exchange environment or I was busy doing homework (had lots of tough classes this semester). We broke up briefly twice (for less than 24 hours), but got back together realising how much it hurt to be apart. Still, the relationship doesn't have the same spark any more.

One of the problems is that we come from different cultures. Apart from the language barrier, I can't see myself fully integrated into her country's culture (an Asian country) and she is really bad with socialising with people of white complexion, which most of my friends are.

For example, when we go out she is almost always totally silent around friendly (non-Asian) people, but has no problem communicating with other Asians - even thoroughly Americanised ones. It's not a language thing, she simply feels intimidated when speaking to non-Asians. When speaking to other Asians she has so much to say, expressing her opinion on everything, politics, music, etc. I always found this a bit strange, but it's definitely become worse after she moved back. She told me that she was like this before and changed a bit while on exchange, but now she's back to the same behaviour again.

She is a nice girl, very clever and quite funny, but these days we don't talk that much. When we see each other, it's mostly for physical comfort. There are no great stimulating discussions, not as much genuine fun in the relationship anymore.

We had a conversation a couple of days ago where I said that I didn't want to continue the relationship after I go home. She cried a bit and agreed and said that she had felt the same way. Then later we went home to her place, talked a bit more about it, both cried, and then we went to sleep. The next morning, waking up with her was wonderful and we had some food together before I went home. Later at night she called me and said she felt sad and I told her I felt the same. She talked about ""regretting the decision a bit"" to break up and I must admit I felt the same way at the time, but I didn't tell her.

Now is the day after and I don't feel any strong regret any more. If I rationalise it in my head I can see why breaking up is a good idea (it's hard to be long distance, we would never be able to fit into each other's lives), but I have a feeling that next time I see her, I might feel differently again, feel like it was the wrong decision. Before she called me yesterday I felt very alone and after talking to her this feeling disappeared.

I don't now if the feeling is a temporary thing or if am truly making a big mistake here. One of the things putting doubt in my mind is that we're not breaking up after a big issue, but rather after a long period of rationalisation - knowing that it's about to get long distance again. I keep telling myself it's the right decision, but at the same time, maybe the fact that I keep telling myself that is making me take the wrong decision. Am I?

Any comments are appreciated.

**TL;DR** My relationship is about to go long distance again. It's not as good as it was before and I am contemplating whether it is worth saving."
ordjf,0,2012-01-22,Almost two years and I can't get over what i've done,athrowawayyoudontsay,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/ordjf/almost_two_years_and_i_cant_get_over_what_ive_done/,"I'm in my early twenties and almost two years ago I had an abortion. 3 years before this I left home and lived with my boyfriend. A bad relationship, we cheated on each other but parted amicably and I left him everything, inc. his inability to keep bills (sent money a few times and we both moved on) and returned to my parents'. I was reckless with my life (oddly not a partier, smoker, or drinker), non-committal to my priorities in life, hopeless at relationships, more carefree, until I got pregnant.

Things hit rock bottom. Some would call it karma but the guy who I'd cheated with (from before) and I got me pregnant. I had stupid moments of not wearing a condom but always took the pill immediately. As proof of potential psych. imbalance I'd wait anxiously hating the day I got pms for the pain but happy to know I was safe. This time I slipped in my stupidity and was 4 weeks pregnant. 2 weeks later I had a medical abortion and haven't been the same since.

4 months later I severed ties with the guy(too alike, and more reckless). I returned to school, worked hard on my grades, saw school counselors, made some friends, re-established myself with old friends, worked on projects like building a computer, aquarium, bike.  Today I volunteer, intern, bike and hike, slack a little but still work hard when i get to it.  I live but I can't get past it. My mother knows but I can't tell anyone in my family. I told an aunt and she blurted it in her mood swing with my other aunt when she was pregnant. It's staying buried but recent developments have made me an aunt to a cousin's (culture doesn't see second cousins) newborn that i didn't know of until he was born, possibly because the father isn't tied to the family.  

 I think my cousin is brave. She's smart and being older than me by a decade she's at the point of having kids, just maybe not financially ready or entirely mentally. she's got supportive parents, going to stand by what she's done and eventually she'll be fine. Me, I'm a pro-choice and I knew if I had a kid at my age it'd be hard to put things together even if my family is decently off. This kid would be stuck with two reckless parents, the possibility of experiencing the childhood of living alright but not being happy because of unstable relations, and a fail mom: me. I'd be uneducated, not under my own roof, financially unstable, and strained to make giving time, being caring and thoughtful first priority. Any children afterwards could be burdened by my choices now. I go to a transitional college and I see these people struggling with school, work, kids, themselves (still acting like kids): I can't put a kid through that. Further I'd be burdening my family when a child should be treasured, it's more than shame, it's hurting everyone. My choice was immediate, without hesitation, I stand by it (if this happens again I will kill myself) but that doesn't mean I don't regret it, or just see cells.

Did you know that an embryo at 6 weeks is a little smaller than the size of the tip of a pencil eraser? I look at this at times. It's important to say that I'm not religious but I try to be very open-minded when it comes to people's beliefs. My opinion is that so long as the belief is not harming someone else and for the most part, you keep it to yourself, you're golden. However because of this I feel like I've breached that. Before this, I'd say pro choice because there are people in terrible circumstances now I just think of what someone else would have to go through and wonder why no one thinks about that. I see a lot of children that need homes or better parents already. Everyday I look back and think of how I could have made that situation. How that baby could have been something more, my little love. There are good cases that come out, heck, my nephew would have had someone his age to play with, something I always wanted.

In the end, I can't forget, can't live beyond it. Someone's been trying to have a relationship with me but he feels like a kid and I'm scared with sex and he doesn't get it or even that we're not in a relationship. (says he does but still clings and I don't want to lose him as a person that I do care about) I'd rather not be in relationships at all for several years until i want a committed one that could progress to getting hitched.  I think I'd be a walking time bomb with it not being a priority, past issues, and not being a whole person, but it's something I crave (paradoxes). I live to make myself better beyond my slacker ways so I can have kids the way I see they should live be the person I'd want as my parent as a person even if I still slip up. To have caring parents that listen to what they have to say and make time for them without so much strain on working to only see them as problem children. It sounds to me putting it like that that's something worth living to, but it effects me down to the point of even keeping friends. You can't say 'you shouldn't care about what people think' until you've been in this situation. I have religious friends and they know because I was so afraid that I'd be like a stain on them (they're good respectable people). But even regular people, even anonymous online penpals I can't help thinking like I'm the stain. I feel like I'm lying to my father when I know this would really hurt him especially the way he carries on about my cousin think of other people like that. I function, but I feel like shit, don't know how to move on, and feel really really alone.

Sorry for the rant and thanks for reading. Beyond counseling, if you can think of anything I'd love to hear it.

tl;dr: I killed my kid, 6week abortion, pro-life, recovered and doing better with priorities, feel alone, don't know how to move on mentally and is effecting me socially. Oh, and I masturbate to vids and feel guilty. There, only time I'm ever bringing that out. If you're going to say something please make it critical, objective thinking and constructive."

However, as an undergrad, I took an interest in the green buildings/energy efficiency industry and got internships in energy efficiency policy and energy efficiency program management. This experience helped me get my first job out of undergrad in energy efficiency and demand side program management. While the work interests me, I know that I've entered a career path where the majority of my peers will have degrees in mechanical or electrical engineering, and I've noticed that most job postings I'm interested in ask for ""mechanical, electrical, or other related engineering majors.""

While I've found some other chemical engineers in this line of work, most of them got there after getting some experience in more typical ChemE jobs first, while I've started fresh in this industry. I chose to pursue this over more typical ChemE jobs because I have an interest in getting into energy policy and I figured this would keep my options open while getting me some technical experience. My (vague) long term plan is to work a few more years and either pursue an MBA, or a masters in public policy, or maybe a masters in MechE. I'd like to get some idea as to whether my future career prospects in this industry are really as open as I'd like to think, or will my undergrad degree just limit me down the road.

I'd like to hear some of your stories of engineers working in industries atypical of their undergrad majors to hopefully get some insight into my own situation. Thanks.

I went into this major thinking I'd do well and be motivated to do the work because I have a deep interest in business, but my grades in these courses don't reflect that. Freshman year I got a C+ and a B- in Principles 1 and 2, respectively. I also ended up getting a B- in Managerial/Cost. Last trimester I got a C+ in Fin. Reporting 1... Before exams, I have absolutely no motivation to actively learn the material as we go along. We are given solutions manuals that have the answers to all of our assignments in them, and I keep convincing myself that just copying down the answers while trying to figure out where they came from, is enough. Our grades in these classes are generally 50% midterm, 50% final, so I have a tendency to cram before tests. Even if I study 40hrs a week before the exam though, I still end up getting a B- on the test... I'm at the point where I'm looking around the classroom at fellow students, and am able to know who is going to get into a Big 4 firm. Their GPAs are high, mine isn't (3.15 cumulative), and you need at least a 3.20 to even apply to Big 4 internships. But I feel that even if I did qualify, if I made it to an interview and got asked a technical question, I'd fail miserably. 

I'm not a math nerd at all, so Finance is probably out of the question. If I get 2 more grades lower than a B- in accounting courses, I'm out of the honors program and would have to take regular accounting courses. The sad thing is, I think I'd still do poorly in those... Is there any hope for me at this point? I can't see myself doing anything besides business, but I've been told that the accounting coursework isn't fun at all, but the work is. Should I just push through it and hope for the best? My main concern is being out-competed to the point where I won't get a job that I'm satisfied with."

I am 26 year old 2nd year CS/chemistry major in Canada and I'm having difficulty deciding whether to keep my summer job as a forklift driver in a lumber yard or to find a programming internship.


Lumber Yard pros:
- more money and its stable (worked there seven years, am wanted for busy season) $16 for 44 hours per week plus 16 hours of overtime per week at $24
- I get a lot of exercise which I don't do normally (don't play sports, hardly ever go out, never work out)
- Its easy and there is a lot of freedom; no supervision. I can listen to podcasts during the night shift and on weekends.
- not much socializing (I am the epitome of Socially Awkward Penguin)

Lumber Yard cons:
- not much learning
- not meeting new people (I know I have to get over my SAPness, but I am scared to talk to others)
- I am embarrassed to still work there because I don't want to be seen as a ""lifer"". I started going to university six years ago (told everyone I wanted to become a doctor) but I am only in my second year because I failed two years, took two years off to save money, and lied about going to university for two years while I played WoW). I told everyone at work I am graduating this year.

Programming Internship pros:
-learning experience
-more interesting and fun; I want to become a developer

Programming Internship cons:
- Would it be very difficult to get in for me because I don't have any personal projects yet and I've never went to a job interview before and I am extremely shy and socially awkward?
-lower pay? I have 0 experience, but I took a lot of relevant math and CS courses. GPAs: semester 1 3.5, 2 3.5, 3 2.0, 4 3.0 estimate. I'm worried about starting a personal project because I'm taking six classes this semester (three with waived prerequisites) and I feel like I can't make spare time even though I know how important a project is on a resume.

I'm looking for any advice. Thank you."

I went to my university's Fall CSE department career fair and had no trouble conveying my excitement about this project, but was wondering how to write this portion of my resume for companies that take only take online applications.

I also did some things off to the side, such as creating the architectural diagram for the group and winning a company-wide hackathon with some other interns (that project is now property of Company X, being filed for a patent, and I'm not allowed to talk much about it either).

I'm a now-former physics grad student ('10 B.S. physics, minors math &amp; French), who left grad school after the fall semester to pursue a consulting career. Why'd I leave? It dawned on me that what I was doing was entirely separated from what I wanted to do, enjoy doing, and am talented at doing, which is consulting. (e.g., I have no passion for learning quantum field theory.)

The issue now is finding and applying for positions. The big guns in the industry obviously are easy to find due to their prevalence on search engines and job boards. But what of the smaller firms? How does one go about finding them and whether they have openings? Location for me isn't the end-all, but outside of searching ""consulting firms [city]"" all over the place and trolling the phone lines / e-mail exchanges, I don't quite know how to proceed.

Unfortunately my contact list isn't large. Through undergrad I tried (and failed, partly due to the horrid economy from '07-'09 and probably partly due to not extending my application range to encompass more geographical area) for internships in engineering disciplines and thus my professional work experience is... lacking. I have just a handful of professional contacts, one of them being in the university department I just left (a professor with whom I'd done some research in undergrad).

That said, it's not hard to find the larger firms and apply to them, but I don't want to limit myself to them either. Any advice?"

Since then, I've just been working as a waitress at the job I held throughout classes. A few months ago I began workout regularly and started watching what I ate.  Until recently (like the last month), I hadn't even thought about a possible career in some field of this sort.

It mostly hit me when I was talking with one of the guys at the gym I workout at and he asked me why I was trying to get in shape.  He said I was in pretty good shape to begin with (5'4"", ~133, ~25% body fat, 28-29"" waist...). It really got me thinking and I was sitting at the computer when this thought hit me: why not be a personal trainer?? People have been asking me about my successes and what's worked/not worked, what I've liked/not liked and I've been doing a lot of research on my own.

I don't regret getting my degree in something other than and exercise science field because I would never have guessed I'd be interested in something like this 4 years ago.

So I guess my point in writing all this is to ask what your thoughts are about getting a second Bachelor's degree. 1) Is it dumb/pointless to get two degrees? I don't think a Master's would be acceptable at this point because I have absolutely no education with terminology or concepts or practice, only my own experience.  Plus my current job (waitressing) isn't exactly related work experience. I'd need an internship or something similar to get credibility established. 2) Would me getting a second degree look better coming from a different university? Or would it be ok/easier to get it from the same place? Because then I could keep some of my credits and hopefully let them apply to the second degree. 3) Is a career in this sort of field even worth the money I'd be investing?? I have done minimal searching on the field and it shows an average-modest salary.

This thought is barely 3 days old, but I'm definitely interested! I'm not making any decisions until after this spring."

My freshman year of college, there was a big poker boom and I was doing extremely well at it. I dropped out to pursue a career as a professional poker player. I made a bunch of money, then went back to school and finished my degree in Computer Science.

I had an internship my last semester. When I graduated, I worked as a programmer at a small state department for a few months. I was then offered a job as a consultant at one of the big three in Chicago.

I worked there for about four months. The 60-80 hour weeks plus travel, along with the monotonous non-programming work burnt me out quickly. The company telling me to lie to clients didn't help either. After this, I went back to playing poker for a living if that is what a big corporate job was going to be.

It's been about a year now and I miss coding. It's extremely difficult for me to even land an interview with my huge resume gap. Honestly, I'm even willing to work for free for a while to get my foot back in the door. I have plenty of savings that can sustain me.

I never would kill myself, I've had family members kill themselves (fuck you, genetics) and the impact it leaves behind is too painful for me to even imagine burdoning others with. I hate it though. I wish I had the balls, because then I wouldn't feel trapped being so miserable day to day....

I graduated from college in May and despite my best (and worst) efforts, still haven't found a ""real"" job (I work part-time) to get me enough money to move out. I'm stuck at home with my parents right now who are incredibly supportive, but continuously badger me with questions like, ""what did you do today?"" or ""did you ever hear back from so and so at that one company?"" And I always have the same answers: I didn't do fucking anything mom, except apply to jobs that I probably won't get. And no, no one called me back, I have no idea why, but I guess I'm going to have to find out who's dick I have to suck to get a job anywhere, because nothing I've tried is fucking working.

Normally I can keep my chin up, but today I can't stop thinking ""whatever, fuck it all."" I was on Facebook earlier and discovered that one of the girls I went to college with (who was a business major) has a job at Nike doing EXACTLY the kind of work I want to do. Why is this so bothersome? I have a degree in mathematics and I'm trying to get a job doing some sort of technical data analysis which I've done internships for in the past. I'm more than qualified to start a job like that, I have the experience and the education, but business major, party my way through college girl gets it instead of me. Fuck it all. I feel like I'm doing something wrong, and I have no idea what it is, so there must be something wrong with me is the only conclusion I can reach.

To top it all off, I'm in a long distance relationship and my boyfriend, whom I love despite his flaws, also suffers from depression. He's not the best pick me up in situations like this, he's still in school, and hasn't really had to struggle for something like this in his life that I'm aware of. I just feel so alone, and although I want it all to end I can't come up with a feasible way to make that happen. I feel trapped, alone, and completely miserable.

I wanted to ask you guys. I am learning about WCF and still trying to get my head around it the main concepts. What I ultimately need to do is use a form I created that will display some *endpoints* in a listbox, then allow the user to upload a selected file by clicking a button.

I was wondering if you guys know any good articles on this topic or have any tips. I watched the 4+ hours of training on Pluralsight.com, ""Introduction to WCF"" already.

If I have time, I'd love to really add that *wow* factor and add some drag&amp;drop functionality in outlook, where users can drag messages from the inbox into the form to upload with the WCF. But I'll have to do the first part before I can mess around with that.

	“So, since you’re starting your third round of chemotherapy, I was - Elizavita? Liz? Hello? Ya’ with me?” Dr. Chargaff looked up, his thick eyebrows with their poly-directional hairs having to move farther up his well tenured forehead to meet my gaze, which had also, a moment ago, been an observer of my spouse’s descent into yet another catatonic state of being.
	“She, uh, done this before?”
	“Yeah, they’ve been happening fairly regularly since the diagnosis. Usually they happen when she’s on the deck. Lately, I’ve just been ploppin’ down next to her, makein’ sure she’s OK, and, keeping an eye out for the grey whales. That time o’ year, ya know. She doesn’t stay in her mini-coma too long. They haven’t worried her, so I haven’t been worried either. But, this is the first episode outside of our home, which I’m aware of.”
	“So…how’s her pain management going…? That Dilaudid  I gave her--pretty powerful stuff.” Dr. Chargaff didn’t usually beat around the bush. Usually he would come right out and ask me anything. Most other oncologists that Liz and I had met with displayed an open condescension for my status as a leading bio-medical researcher, a cancer biologist, no less. First impression of Dr. Chargaff was his smile, namely that he had one, and, even though he hadn’t been in an operating room, or in any room messier than the cafeteria in decades, he still wore scrubs, with the obligatory stethoscope around his neck. All the previous Docs wore the requisite tailored Italian shirt with the equally impressive neck tie. Funny, how oncologists seemed so serious compared to other doctors. If any patients needed a little cheer weren’t they the terminally ill ones?
	“She hasn’t touched the stuff since the first bout of chemo. Gave her bad dreams, she said. I’ve had one or two, though: eat one of those with a whiskey neat, phew, I’m good for the weekend.” 
	“Dr. Avigail, I’m sure I don’t need to play advocate for your liver…” Said Dr. Chargaff with a diminutive, grim grin.
	“Yes, indeed you don’t.” My mind, via its abstract, yet highly pertinent association mechanism, took me back to all the research associates and interns who took so many smoke breaks throughout the day. What was it about studying the machinery of death that made one want to have a smoke so bad? 
	I stepped out from behind my wife to a crouching position beside Dr. Chargaff. I placed my hand on Liz’s shoulder and looked into her green eyes. Her new wig was really quite nice; hadn’t really noticed before, but she hadn’t had that hairstyle since we were engaged. It may be called the “bob” when the hair is neck length and curls in under the chin. Liz was still quite stunningly beautiful. 
	“LIZ, HONEY? ARE YOU IN THERE? YOO-HOO? IT’S ME, EZRA. COME OUT, COME OUT, WHEREVER YOU--“
	“Yeah, I’m here…”Liz’s pupils shrank down and refocused on my face. With a smile she said, ”You are a dork!”
	“Liz, you had me worried there.”
	“Well, Doc, my minds been a little preoccupied lately-sometimes just starts to go quiet for a moment or two. I’ve been running with it, sometimes I get sucked deeper than others. Ezra’s been able to get me out, right, honey?”
	“So far, so good.” 
	Dr. Chargaff walked back to his desk, slowly sat down in his overstuffed leather chair on wheels and intentionally inhaled through his remarkable nose. Looking at me, and then Liz, it seemed he was about to begin to speak, but instead he pushed down on his gold riveted armrests, and, one by one placed both New Balanced feet on his mahogany desk. Liz and I flashed a look at each other; must be bad (worse) news this time. We kinda already knew, though. Dr.Chargaff had one last bout of auto-eye massage, and finally spoke up. 
	“Liz, as I was saying before, I wanna keep you overnight, tonight, for observation when we start this new, and, well, more potent round of chemotherapy.” As I observed the doctor labor with the bad news, I felt a tinge of understanding of why those other doctors hadn’t respected me in my profession. Yes, we were both working to help people, to keep them alive, but never once did I have to communicate to a Petri dish, or even a lab rat, what was being presented to us right now. “This is the last weapon in our arsenal, Liz. If this doesn’t work…” 

	As I walked into my laboratory, I shook my traveler’s mug that previously had been full of coffee, confirming the need for another brew. I headed to the back of the lab, passing the shiny automatic coffee maker, and fired the Bunsen burner. I preferred my coffee made in a Chemex ; my lab assistants had considered it another useless quirk, until they tasted the coffee. Then, they considered it a useful quirk. With my whistling water kettle securely fastened by a clamp above the blue flame, I headed to my office. 
	“Dr. Avigail, our grant proposal was accepted!”
	“What?” This latest proposal was very important, and, no way was I going to let a false alarm dash my hopes against the rocks of denial--or worse--a status of “still pending.” I had written this plea for additional funding so the lab could purchase a neutrino scanning microscope. Previously, and for nearly a century, the highest resolution image was stonewalled at the size of an electron which was procured via an electron scanning or transmission electron microscope(EM) . I felt that the future success of my lab lay in the acceptance of my grant proposal. I had heard nothing for nearly six months from the deliberations committee. Normally, a grant would be accepted or denied within three months, but this was a proposal that was worth many, many times more than anything I had been a part of before. “Bethany, not a good time for joking around.“  I was starting to get a little excited. 
	“There was a manila envelope on the floor this morning when I got here. I’m sorry-but…but-I opened it right away…I couldn’t resist!” She already had donned a pair of safety glasses, and they were getting a little foggy. 
	“Well, where is it, my little researcher?” Beth was many things, but definitely not a practical joker, and she rarely said boo to me before lunch. Beth pulled the envelope out from behind her back, and, as she did so, my water, with the Bunsen burner’s inducement, let me know the enthalpic phase change had occurred and I could finally re-up. I poured the first round of hot water into the open, superior end of the hourglass that was filled with brown gold, watched to make sure the air was able to escape upwards through the pour channel so that the coffee could flow downwards and, with a heavy and expectant sigh, pulled out the documents. To acquire a neutrino microscope would mean the powers that be consider my lab worthy of an $8.5 million check. I scanned the letter, zooming past the first couple of needless paragraphs. We were getting the microscope. I dropped the letter on the floor and embraced Bethany; a true scientist, Bethany was not accustomed to communicating or recognizing human emotion, but, she did hug back.

	 Watching the high-definition monitor that was hooked up to the neutrino microscope, for the first time I saw cellular and molecular activities, in vivo , of a mouse that was in terminal stage cancer. I had set the resolution to a setting only tenfold greater than the standard EM would provide; meaning that one epithelial cell  in the mouse was several thousand times larger than the field. The cancer was literally marching from organ to organ. Stunned, hunched over while sitting on my wheeled lab stool, I watched a cancerous cell destroy, one by one, receptors on the membrane of healthy cells. I thought back to my teenage fascination with the Borg , an alien life form from a popular TV show that demanded assimilation; my right brain protested via issuance of a nerd alert. I couldn’t help but chuckle. I had always owned my dorkdom. The malignant cell was seeking out and destroying receptors on the cellular membrane of the healthy cells that helped control apoptosis.  It was like I was the first person to view an epic battle in real time, compared to everyone before me who had only been able to try and piece together the manner in which the battle was fought, using only smoldering tanks and shrapnel coated craters. On the monitor, the cancerous tumor grew in size and legion. Looking at the mouse, which was in nylon restraints under the neutrino detector lens, and then back to the monitor, I couldn’t help but imagine my wife under the same lens, only temporarily removed from the destiny of the mouse.

My family has basically become a burden like my brother yelling at me about how our grandparents were going to die soon and how I don't have much time with them left and how I was wasting that time(my aunt was right there agreeing and adding to it).

 At work I am not respected and have to deal with completely unprofessional individuals. An example is when I mentioned that I was moving in with some friends who have a year and a half old daughter they started to make pedo jokes about her and me. This affects me specifically because I was a victim of molestation as a kid the kind involving soldering irons and death threats. I feel I had no recourse as this was during my internship and I HAVE to get my degree. 

School is just eating at the back of my mind all the time I'm taking full time classes online so I feel anxious about my ability to get these last 2 semesters finished. My interpersonal relationships have degraded the people who call me friends see me merely as a means to resources.

 I can’t get a girl to actually commit to a date for any reason and I fear that I will become a forever alone because there is something in my appearance which scares others off. I'm really tired in my heart and mind. Bilbo Baggins said it best as feeling too little butter being spread over too much bread. I don’t enjoy videogames, movies, TV shows, music, or reading.  Anything I used as a distraction previously has lost its appeal. What do I do? Any doctors I talk to want to put me on medicine after a 30 minute interview and a boot out the door and any therapy I try turns in to why don’t I go to church and be healed of my mental issues.

The Biology program at my chosen university does NOT offer an internship, since it's a ""general"" program, but all the specializations DO offer internships. Because of this, I'm thinking of enrolling in the genetics program because it's high up on my list of sub-fields I'm interested in. I'd rather take general biology though, because I'm not COMPLETELY sure what I'd like to specialize in yet, and I'd get a broader education in a lot more of the sub-fields, but internships seem kind of...important. I also have no idea if I'm going to go for anything beyond a BSc. 

Are internships essentially necessary? I know they'd look good on CVs if nothing else. I'm in Canada if that matters at all in regards to employment, grad school, etc."

REDACTED TITLE

Police Foundation

1201 Connecticut Avenue, NW

Washington, DC 20036


Dear REDACTED, 

I am excited to be applying for an internship at The Police Foundation. I am currently a junior at the REDACTED University, working towards my B.A. in Criminal Justice and B.S. in Physics. Due to my unique skillset I believe I would be a valuable asset to the Police Foundation as an intern.


Through my studies in criminal justice, I have gained a background in various aspects of the field and would love the opportunity to broaden my knowledge and gain real-world experience in the workforce. I have an especially in-depth knowledge of the subject of mass imprisonment through my research and work on the topic with Professor REDACTED. Through this work I have learned how to successfully conduct meaningful research, a skill, which I believe will be invaluable for this position. Although the focus of Professor REDACTED’s research is the effect of mass imprisonment on prisoners, I have also learned a great deal about the people working in the field and would love to learn more about the police and related personnel by working at the Police Foundation.   

I also believe that my international background has given me a unique perspective on the US Justice System, and would personally be interested to learn how the systems compare on a more detailed level. 

I am highly organized, with meticulous attention to detail, which is particularly advantageous when conducting researchm. When I am interested in a subject, I immerse myself in researching the topic and its context. Even when I am not actively engaged directly in work, I subconsciously commit my focus to the job.

I look forward to hearing from you and thank you for your consideration. 


Sincerely, 

REDACTED

About that, I'm not sure. I've just been contemplating this for a while now and I don't think people in real life would take me seriously.

First things first, let me tell you about myself. I'm a sophomore attending a state college in the Midwest, trying to attain a B.S. in Computer Science. I received a 3.375 GPA my first semester of college - it wasn't bad, but it wasn't necessarily good either. I consequently told myself that, each semester, I would do a little better than before.

Time passed, and in Spring '11 I received a 3.714. In Fall '11, I received my first 4.0. My current cumulative is a 3.674. I started joining different clubs as well, and I'm currently involved in 4 organizations. I have been participating in a leadership program, I'm the secretary of my fraternity, I'm the PR chairman for a large student-led philanthropy event, and a member of the Association of Computing Machinery as well as being a full-time student. I felt pretty successful for a while until some recent events.

A little more than a week ago, I scored an interview with Microsoft about 10 miles away through some connections with some alumni. I went to my interview, and it wasn't at all what I expected. The gist of it was that they told me all about what kind of work they did, but they told me I should look into getting a summer internship there. I was frustrated and worried - *Why did they call me in for an interview if they told me to apply for a summer internship? Did I fuck up? If they're telling me about their program, doesn't that still interested in hiring me?* To be honest, it's really burning me up. I kind of did break down at one point; I'm not really that good at interviews. I was tripping all over my words, and I admitted it to my first interviewer. Yes, I know, huge mistake - **I don't want to hear any of that.** But it's a problem I have, and I **will** work on it, trust me. I felt like I had to apologize for my lack of eloquence. 

But that's not all. I live in a fraternity house with quite a few members members, and a large slew of them recently got internships at Bobcat. I'm fairly sure that I have a better resume than most of the people who were hired, knowing them personally. They had the same connections as I did, but they succeeded. This is what really had me hanging by the throat. Was I not good enough? What could I do to be better?

And the thing that irritates me the most is that about half of these people are complaining about their jobs. Why they complain is beyond me. I'm not sure if it's for attention, if they're bragging, or if they really do hate their job, but for 16 dollars an hour, a hard-working student like me would excitedly embrace that opportunity.

But that's just the beginning of the problem. I really would like to get a summer internship so I don't have to work at the high-paced, stressful seasonal concession stand job in the summer. Thing is, I don't know where to start. I went to the career center at my university, and they showed me different ways I can apply for internships. Unfortunately, the university didn't have any job placement options. The whole ""searching for an internship"" part is just so foreign to me.

Some people have told me that I should be searching for internships with a mental attitude that says ""I can't fail. I will get this job, and there's nothing that can stop me."" But my brain doesn't work like that. My brain is hard-wired to think realistically. I realize that there are chances of success and failure, and there's nothing I can to to shed that from my current line of thinking.

So, I'm lost, Reddit. Any advice you can give me, any at all, I would appreciate it from the bottom of my heart.

I try hard, I really do, but I fail in the process - and that's what I'm worried about. "
ou1v0,5,2012-01-24,Look for advice to get to my goal of being a pentester,SickWilly,IT_CERT_STUDY,https://www.reddit.com/r/IT_CERT_STUDY/comments/ou1v0/look_for_advice_to_get_to_my_goal_of_being_a/,"I first got interested in the idea of netsec when my friend showed me how to crack a WEP password on my neighbor's router. My life has taken several turn along the way, but I've come to the decision that what I'd really like to do in life is be a pentester or somehow work in an offensive security position. I was going to school for a comp sci degree at a state school, but I couldn't start this semester for personal reasons. But during this time I'd really like to focus my free study time that I have towards the pentest goal.
I am going to take the OSCP, but I don't think I have the necessary base knowledge. So my current plan is to use these few months where I have relatively little responsibility to get started on my goal ahead of time.

I've read a lot on the subject already but I'm thinking having a better understanding of networking can only help. And I read somewhere that you should know your own system before messing around with someone else's.

I found a few videos on vimeo which I'm going through. I am teaching myself Python as my first computer language to assist in a pentesting role. Probably javascript/PHP/SQL is next for a web application security, but I want to have a decent grasp on Python so I don't end up just half-assing it.

My question, or area I'm looking for advice is this: Am I going the right direction? Are the Network+ and Security+ certifications worth it? Is my CS degree going to be worth it? And is there anything I haven't thought of and I should be considering? Any resources to help me get there?
Ideally I'd like an internship to help me with real world applications of netsec, and I figure the best bet for getting an internship would be through college. That's my main motivation for going to school, since I can teach myself most of what I want to know through self-study.

Tl;Dr - I need a ""So You Want to Be a Pentester?"" guide or sagely advice."

I got paid well and enjoyed the work. I did a great job over the summer and was invited to intern there again this summer. 

In October my manager emailed me asking if I was still interested and saying that she would start the rehiring process. I quit smoking that day. Finally 3 months later I get the official job offer. Last year I had to take a drug test a few days after the official offer. I was so stoked that I would be able to smoke again in a few days that I went out and bought a new bong and a fat ass sack of bud. I spent like $350 on that stuff.

Today I accepted the offer and was told by HR that I will have to take a drug test a *few weeks before my start date*. I start in about 3.5 months so that could be anytime after about 2 months from now. Last year the piss test happened in March, but that is also when I received the job offer.

I get extremely paranoid and stressed out when it comes to drug testing and always play it as safe as possible so I am going to continue abstaining until the piss test. I may indulge once this weekend just to try out my new bong though.

On one hand I am stoked that I get to work there again this summer and I got a 10% pay raise. On the other hand I am irate about drug testing. I am not so much mad at the company as it has become a norm in society and I believe it might be required for them to get insurance and what not. I am pissed off that Marijuana is **STILL** fucking illegal in the USA. I smoked weed every fucking day after work last summer and they fucking loved me...

My brother, who is 27, did his cooking internship at Grand Teton Lodging Company last summer in Wyoming, and made friends who reside in Denver.  We're both pretty good at snowboarding and plan on having some fun while we're there.
 
Our parents are Thai, and I've essentially never met any other Thai people my age.  Serious question, how do people respond to Asians out there? 

Basically my brother and I are tired of living at home.  We're packing up his car and heading out Wednesday.  We have a hotel booked for one week at Copper mountain, and we're spending another week at Vail. 

My brother has a culinary degree but has no fine dining or management experience.
Dealbreaker: He did his internship at GTLC, which is owned by Vail.  Two days before his contract was up, they fired him (not based on performance).  He can't re apply to any Vail owned company until next year. 

I have a worthless Associate's Degree in General Studies, but I have worked in restaurants since I was 16.  
Dealbreaker: In addition to my brother and I being Ents with 0% chance of passing a drug test without faking it, I got a DUI in June of 2010, received Probation before judgment, and I finished my year of probation back in October 2011.  Really didn't realize it would fuck me as bad as it has.  I would like to find a job where I work for tips, i.e.: serving, bussing, food running.  At this point I would be happy enough washing dishes, delivering pizza, or flipping burgers at McDonald's.  Desperation is a stinky cologne.

We've been sending out resumes left and right, but I believe since we still have a Maryland address, it's not very effective.  A lot of places on craigslist want us to apply in person, so that's what we're going to do.  

What is a more realistic situation for us? 

Find a job first, and then find an apartment?

or 

Find a place to live first and pray someone hires us within 2 months?

Q1) Most sites I've read frame personal projects as the #1 thing that will set an internship candidate apart from the rest (assuming no *relevant* experience). Minus the blog hype, how important are projects vis-a-vis coursework, grades, and so on?

Q2) What sort of project is worth putting up into a github account? I write a lot of code in my spare time, but most of it is automating simple tasks to help streamline my business. Basic apps that produce invoices, organize project schedules, manage client lists, etc. Is this too lame to put on a resume?

I'm a computer science student who is closer to a degree in philosophy (which I'm much more interested in studying). Lately I've been sort of anxious about the amount of time and money I feel like I'm wasting in school for CS with no satisfaction. I love working in programming and solving problems, but the program at my University has me entirely jaded about the going to school for it. I'm a software dev. intern for a small company right now which employs two college drop-outs in the IT department of about 10 people. (One in systems and one in software). One of those 10 is also a college grad with a humanities degree, although he is going to grad school for comp sci currently.

I'm not sure how much of an anomaly my company is in this regard, since it's the only one I've worked for, so I'm wondering if anyone has stories/info about their own workplace.

I'm leaning toward finishing my Philosophy degree, feeling more fulfilled with school, and seeing where it takes me. Perhaps this company will keep me on if they feel I've been doing a good job, or perhaps they will let me go if I'm less of a ""potential hire"" for the future? However, they're also looking to expand so maybe they'd be excited to see me graduate sooner? Out of the two interns they employ, they often give me the more challenging, project-oriented problems.

Anyway, I'm not looking for advice regarding my current employment situation, as obviously (whatever I decide) I'd have to talk things through with them to know for sure what things would be like there. But I'd like to know what you guys think about hiring/working with someone with a degree in non-CS, and my chances of pursuing a career in CS if I decide to finish up my humanities degree instead."

Although I have considerable experience with PHP and Javascript (and I guess jQuery too), I need to get started learning a real programming language well. I'll be learning Java because I actually have an internship set up for the summer and I would apparently be infinitely more useful, and thus more occupied, if I knew Java.

I know PHP relatively well. Not a genius at it, but I know it well enough. Would I be wrong in saying that I'm starting with an advantage because I already know some of the basic, and probably universal, programming syntax? I'm saying this in comparison to having just HTML or something under your belt. I've also spent a good bit of time going through exercises on [codingbat.com](http://www.codingbat.com) and I've done quite a lot of them. Still basics though, mainly beginner string manipulation and a few data structure type things.

Anyways, here's the main question. I want a **really** simple, beginner resource for learning Java well. I feel like a lot of programming tutorials and books are a bit overwhelming for beginners, and I struggled with PHP at the beginning and it took a little bit longer to learn than it should have. Can you recommend a good site/book/whatever that really goes through things in an easy to understand way?

I know programming isn't meant to be easy, because it isn't. I also know that certain people find certain things easier or harder. However, I'm just looking for some opinions here to see if there possibly is a resource that explains things ""better"" for beginners. Thanks!"

First, I could go to Cape Town doing lab research (attempting to sense tiny bits of DNA for diagnosing tuberculosis), much similar to the environment I'm in now.

owp0g,15,2012-01-25,Recent grad - where should I go from here?,bobcatgoldthwait,gis,https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/owp0g/recent_grad_where_should_i_go_from_here/,"Hey everyone.  I recently graduated with a degree in Environmental Science, which included a GIS certificate.  I managed to land an internship with a state agency doing GIS work, but unfortunately it hasn't presented many learning opportunities to this point (most of my tasks involve digitizing data; really simple stuff that anyone could be shown how to do in a few minutes).  I've realized I need to take it upon myself to learn some new skills if I want to turn this into a career, but I have no idea where to begin.

One of my biggest questions is (and this may be a dumb one) - what can I actually DO with GIS?  My college coursework was pretty much limited to making maps, and all my work experience has basically just been digitizing data for the use of others.  To make this question simpler, say I want to work with GIS but I also want to stay in the environmental field.  What kind of job could I get, and what kind of projects might I work on?

My other problem, somewhat tied with the first, comes from my observation that every GIS job seems to have different requirements beyond simple knowledge of GIS.  Going back to my previous question, in such a position as what I'm looking for, what kind of skills might be necessary for me to be a valuable member of a company?  To make answering this a bit easier, here's a general list of what I know and don't know:

* Basic knowledge of ArcGIS, including: digitizing files, editing data, very limited experience working with spatial, network, and 3d analyst, preparation of maps, some familiarity with some of the data management tools, and probably a few other things I can't think of off the top of my head.

* I don't know Python.  How important is it to learn this?

* I have no database management skills.  I've started poking around with Access just to develop some kind of experience, but nothing beyond that.

* I don't know any programming languages, although I'm not at all afraid to learn some (as a kid I taught myself basic HTML for fun; I'm sure if it were necessary I could learn VBA or C).



I've poked around ESRI's site and looked at some of their training resources, but I wasn't sure which would be useful to me (plus I'm certainly not going to pay for any unless I'm sure I'll get something valuable from it).  I feel if I had a better understanding of what I should know, it would make learning those skills a lot easier for me. 

Thanks in advance for any suggestions!"
owob5,4,2012-01-25,Some facts about the boycott of Hollywood,Inuma,boycotthollywood,https://www.reddit.com/r/boycotthollywood/comments/owob5/some_facts_about_the_boycott_of_hollywood/,"Hello folks.  This is Inuma of the Reddit Research team.  I'm talking today about the effectiveness of a boycott and how you might be able to make this far more effective.

Let's be very clear here. I enjoy hearing people try to find ways to take down the multiheaded hydra of Hollywood, but we need ways that are effective to the cause. So I'll explain why a general boycott is not effective and try to help people find ways that might bring the movement to better ways to make a statement.

1)  **Boycotting and asking for personal information is a no-no.** We don't know who will maintain the boycott and there have already been areas where I don't believe this movement won't be effective.  For example, Batman will *always* make money.  Anyone boycotting Batman is missing out on a shared experience.  So saying ""I'm going to boycott for X days"" is useless when people can either opt out or pirate and come to the same effect.  If you don't go to the movie theater, what else can you do?  Pirate?  Not an option here.  We're looking to prove a point and this comes from allowing people to enjoy their Saturday nights.  Remember, Hollywood is a lot bigger and harder to hit than GoDaddy.  Yes, they're dying slowly from making bad movies. But we don't need to check up on people to boycott.  Just send them in a new direction for their movie fix.  Better yet, let's get the movie theaters involved if possible.  Find independent theaters that might be able to get away from the major studios and support them.  Possible area of improvement is finding a way to fund new theaters that compete with Imax and Cinemax.  Remember, indies are your friends.

2) **Hollywood has a lot of licensors, making the boycott ineffective.**  Think about this.  Disney owns ESPN and gets money from sports all the time.  All of the major studios make money from Netflix and the RIAA makes money from Spotify and their own business dealings.  Do you think not spending $10 on a movie ticket will directly hurt their income?  Suggestion: Start cable cutting.  The transition to pure internet might hurt a little, but you have far more variety of content online and this hurt the money from Hollywood the most.

3) **Economics will hurt Hollywood far more than a boycott.**  Why has no one ever put up VODO.com as a viable alternative to piracy?  How about Jamendo music?  Where is the education campaign of telling people ""let's opt for the viable alternatives?""  These may work far better.  Starve Hollywood so it dies that much quicker instead of trying to find a quick solution.  We're in this for the long haul.  Let's find the alternatives that show Hollywood how it's done.

4) **Expose the problems of Hollywood.**  Hollywood Accounting hurts artists.  Piracy doesn't make a lot of money.  The regulatory capture of ICE and the MPAA equates to class welfare.  Copyright laws are supposed to benefit the public.  The public doesn't have enough freedom fighters in the White House.  The CEOs are paid so much money despite piracy, that their workers starve.  Copyright = regulatory capture.  Hollywood has a problem paying interns.  For every $1 spent lobbying, the business gains $220 in tax savings.  The IRS needs to audit all of Hollywood.  There's plenty of ideas.  Hamper and harry our politicians to continuously advance and pressure Hollywood and keep them off balance.  That's the aim of the game.  They have the law, we have the power.

5)  **Target the weakest links**.  I know, it seems hard to go after Hollywood and more people want to fight that.  But it's the politicians that have to listen to us, not Hollywood.  We shouldn't stop at SOPA or PIPA.  We should be pressuring those same politicians to listen to a Reddit made proposal or the proposals of others.  Politicians will always be the weakest link.  Here, they HAVE to listen because the proposals for better dealings in copyright law are ours to demand.

For now, those are the main issues.  If there needs to be more, I can add here as need be.  "

I started with a development internship at a startup while I was receiving unemployment, I eventually took another job and had to keep learning in my spare time. I took a six week class from a longtime developer through Skillshare (http://www.skillshare.com/). Right now after 6 or 7 months I have a very small app I am nearly ready to deploy (it checks weather forecasts daily and sends users an email reminder to carry an umbrella if it's raining in their city). I went to a good college, got decent grades, was generally thought of as at least as intelligent as the other students at my good college, maybe even slightly moreso. I'm good, but not amazing, with math and logic.

I'm still a long way from being a great coder and a lot of the little epiphanies I've had occurred in month 4 or 5 or 6 after RETURNING to coding. **How much can people actually learn about coding in a month?** Am I being unrealistic? Am I actually a stupid person and I'm missing how much a regular person can learn in a month? When I was doing the Hartl rails tutorial I felt like it was at best an introduction to what MVC is, the structure of a rails app and a bit of ruby syntax. Am I missing something here? Am I lazy and not getting how much one can pick up if you really live Ruby for a month? (p.s. this is coming from someone who started his app on Christmas eve and has plenty of git commits at 1 am on weekdays)

Have any of you ever tried to **learn it all** in a month and are now able to reflect back X months later on **what you actually got out of that first month?**"

owk8b,127,2012-01-25,"Tech Support internship, 5 minutes ago I thought my boss was tough but fair, now....not so much.",Shadow250000,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/owk8b/tech_support_internship_5_minutes_ago_i_thought/,"I started my internship in the IT dept of a company a couple weeks ago, and since me and the other intern started, when using the ticketing system, the home page of it has been blank except for the top bar, which is all we use (to get to cases for putting in tickets), so we just thought it was normal. It's not our system obviously, how were we to know.


So our boss came over a few minutes ago, pretty much saying ""do this, remember this, NEVER ASSUME ANYTHING"" then less than a minute later, the boss is helping the other intern get to a plugin for the ticketing system or something, and notices the main page is blank.


The following conversation goes something like this.



Boss: ""If you see a problem with the website, tell &lt;web guy&gt;. How long has it been blank?"" 

Intern: ""uh, it's always been like that."" 

Boss: ""you should have something covering this whole screen"" 

Intern: ""well, it's always been like that, since we started here.""

Boss: ""This is inexcusable."" &lt;--- his exact words ""If you see something wrong with the site you need to tell &lt;web guy&gt;!""

Intern: ""But it's always been like that, how would we kno-""

Boss: ""you should have told &lt;web guy&gt;.""

Me: ಠ_ಠ

So basically it's our fault for not knowing something was wrong, when we had no way of knowing something was wrong.

SENSE, THIS MAKES NONE.


tl;dr I went down the rabbit hole, I was offered tea, it contained cyanide.


EDIT: Since some people think it should be obvious a blank screen isn't normal, allow me to explain.

They just started implementing this new ticketing system last week. There are some pages that don't even work and freeze the browser when accessed. 

This plus the fact that when our supervisor showed us how to create tickets he didn't comment on the blank home page, gave us no reason to think the blank page was abnormal.

Edit 3: Me and the other intern just spent some time looking for the drivers to a couple of old laptops, which are designed for vista but they want xp on it. We downloaded all the xp drivers from the official site, extracted then installed them, but the laptops didn't like the network and wireless LAN drivers. So the boss came over, and we explained how the drivers weren't working, how we got them from the manufacturer's site, etc, and he says the drivers not working is our fault, and that it sounds like ""user error."" He then went on to say he doesn't like how over the past 2 weeks when he says stuff like that, we get ""really defensive"". I was going to refute his claim but I realized if I did, that could be viewed as me being defensive, giving him the grounds to be more of an ass.



Also, I seem to be teaching the other intern more than they are. ಠ_ಠ
_______________________________________________________________________________________________
Well, I left the internship today.

I finally snapped when during a meeting with me, the other intern, and our supervisor, the boss said the internship is ""to the benefit of both of us"" and I started to say ""internships are supposed to be for the benefit of the intern."" but he cut me off and said ""you better not be about to make an excuse"" so I said ""no, not an excuse, just a fact."" and then cut me off again by saying ""before saying anything else, you'd better put it by &lt;the supervisor&gt; first after this meeting""
He then said ""I have no problem calling your school right now, and telling them to move you somewhere else""

So I said ""I'm already going somewhere else"" and he replied ""well then you won't need to come in on monday then"" to which I said ""that's the plan.""


He then told me to leave, and I offered to stay at least for the meeting, me and the other intern were supposed to do a short presentation on the research we had done, and I didn't want to leave him hanging, but the boss just said ""no, just leave.""

So I went out of the room with my supervisor, who said he was really suprised as I was saying that stuff, because apparently it was incredibly bold....or maybe he said it was ballsy....anyway, I didn't see it as bold or ballsy, all I did was state a fact and then tell the truth. We then had a short discussion, at one point talking about burning bridges and such, so before I left I apologized for snapping, said it was nice working there, and thanked him for the opportunity."

owcq3,6,2012-01-25,Actuary career advice,screenname12345678,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/owcq3/actuary_career_advice/,"So here's some background on me:

I graduated in May with degrees in math and English with a 3.92 gpa from a well respected state school. My original goals were always to attend law school but high tuition and poor job market for lawyers deterred me from that. So I wanted to start finding a career in something math related. The professor job market is also terrible and I wouldn't want to teach anything below college level so pursuing higher education seemed like a waste as well. 

I've researched what actuaries do and it seems like something I would be interested in doing. I have a strong math background and am a really good test taker. I self study very well (scored in the 99th percentile on the LSAT through self study alone). I don't have any internships or an actuarial science degree but I'm pretty sure I could pass the P and FM after studying and have two exams done by the end of the summer at least.

Since graduation I've been working part time as a tutor and I have an interview monday for a full time tutoring position that pays 15/hr. I have also been applying to banks and other positions at insurance companies such as underwriting. 

With my background, I wanted to know, is hopeless for me to even try pursuing a job as an actuary?

I don't mind working hard and understand job markets for most jobs aren't great right now, but I wouldn't want to put in all the effort for no chance at a job whatsoever. Also, should I continue trying to find some sort of office job in lieu of the tutoring position since that would look better on a resume especially if it's at an insurance company?

Anything I should put on or leave out from my resume? Anything I could do on my own to boost my chances?

Any feedback would be really appreciated."
owbq8,1,2012-01-25,How does one go about finding consulting openings in companies that aren't industry big guns?,VelocityRD,consulting,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/owbq8/how_does_one_go_about_finding_consulting_openings/,"(I tried posting this a couple days ago but apparently it looks like the post was caught in a filter of some sort. *shrug*)

A bit of background for me... I'm a now-former physics grad student ('10 B.S. physics, minors math &amp; French), who left grad school after the fall semester to pursue a consulting career. Why'd I leave? It dawned on me that what I was doing was entirely separated from what I wanted to do, enjoy doing, and am talented at doing, which is consulting. (e.g., I have no passion for learning quantum field theory.)

The issue now is finding and applying for positions. The big guns in the industry obviously are easy to find due to their prevalence on search engines and job boards. But what of the smaller firms? How does one go about finding them and whether they have openings? Location for me isn't the end-all, but outside of searching ""consulting firms [city]"" all over the place and trolling the phone lines / e-mail exchanges, I don't quite know how to proceed.

Unfortunately my contact list isn't large. Through undergrad I tried (and failed, partly due to the horrid economy from '07-'09 and probably partly due to not extending my application range to encompass more geographical area) for internships in engineering disciplines and thus my professional work experience is... lacking. I have just a handful of professional contacts, one of them being in the university department I just left (a professor with whom I'd done some research in undergrad).

That said, it's not hard to find the larger firms and apply to them, but I don't want to limit myself to them either. Any advice?"

I started to take interest in photography about a year ago, and now I'm looking for ways to improve my photography skills. So I want to do some volunteer work with a pro.

I'm interested in everything, so there are a lot of available options locally (i.e weddings, portraits, etc). Anything that may improve my photography skills will be fine with me. I'm willing to do everything for free (besides perhaps meals and transportation for weddings), and can take any role that is available. One down side is that I have an internship at the moment, and won't be able to do anything from Monday to Friday; and I can only work until the end of April, by which time I have to go back to school.

How should I go about doing this? Just start e-mailing the pros that I found online and tell them my thoughts? I assume that they will want to look at my previous photos, but there's only a few of them that and they are not that great (and most of them are of animals, which is my true passion).

**Education:** I graduated *cum laude* with a BSc in physics from the University of Miami (FL) in 2010, minoring in mathematics and French. I continued to the graduate program at UM, also in physics, but after 1.5 years I found that my passions lie elsewhere. Thus, I've left the university.

**Strengths:** I've found that my strengths lie particularly in strategy / operations / logistics. As such, I am seeking opportunities in those fields of consulting.

**Language:** Native English speaker, with moderate written and spoken proficiency in French thanks to having studied it since high school. I'm in the process of learning Spanish, though at a beginner level due to self-study using what I can dredge up on the Internet.

**Work Experience:** Unfortunately my background isn't extensive. Undergraduate summers were in the midst of the '07-'08-'09 economic downturn and all my internship applications were denied. ('09 was a bit of a blessing in that regard, as my mother was ill and I was needed to take care of many household responsibilities.)

During graduate school I was a teaching assistant, which entailed teaching two lab courses per semester and being fully responsible for them: teaching the material, directing and managing the lab during class time, answering questions, grading labs, creating and administering quizzes... the only thing we were given was the course material, and the lab coordinator was laudatory of my meticulous and accurate grading. I also was a grader for several summer physics courses.

**Other Experience:** I am published as co-author in a chapter of *Mathematical Modeling of Collective Behavior in Socio-Economic and Life Sciences* (Birkhauser, 2010), titled “Statistical Physics and Modern Human Warfare.”

**Additional Information:** A more detailed CV/résumé, etc., can be obtained with a PM with e-mail information."

TL;DR version:

For years Sashi has had excruciating in her abdomen, but doctors have only recently figured out what's wrong. She has large (LARGE) cysts growing around her ovaries which is affecting multiple internal organs. She is dying and needs a surgery which will cost thousands of dollars. Her friends have set up a Tumblr account where you can learn more and perhaps even donate a couple dollars. http://donateforsashi.tumblr.com

From the website: 

“Ever since she was a kid, she’s been suffering from chronic pain on her abdomen, getting worse over the years, getting fucked over by doctors who dis-diagnosed her or flat out told her she was “lying” about her pain just to get pain killers.
After years of awful symptoms, trying to figure out whats wrong, ER visits when she couldn’t bear with the pain anymore, having to rush everytime to the hospital, she has finally been diagnosed with a severe case of Endometriosis, which requires a big surgery that also requires to remove her ovaries that are practically all covered in several tumors the size of big oranges, even she feels the stiffness on her tummy.
Endometriosis consists in cysts (in her case of 8cm) growing around her ovaries and affecting intestines and several organs.
Up-to date, she’s 24, had to quit her job (and therefore having no insurance) because she can barely move anymore. She has developed several other side problems from this disease, she can’t eat because there’s literally no room in her intern organs to proceed any food anymore.
As much as it hurts to type down and as tears well up in my eyes,
She’s dying.
She’s been slowly dying in front of my eyes for the past years of fighting.
After trying several times to get medi-cal, today she got denial again because according to the government she doesn’t count as a “disabled” person.
saving her life is up to a surgery that would cost thousands of dollars, I am uncertain exactly how much, I’m researching that right now, been researching all night, trying to find out some solutions; but if she finally could afford this surgery she’d be able to…start to live again.
Though, is sweet of the person above me that talked about donations, Sashi herself is reluctant of donations because the surgery is really, really expensive and its true, it would require a LOT of work/donations to get to any near goal.

ovlq9,0,2012-01-24,So I finally have an interview..,el-grosso,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ovlq9/so_i_finally_have_an_interview/,"Hey guys. After months of applying and sending out CV's with examples of work, I have finally nabbed an interview with a company called Ash Gaming. Based in London, they deal with gambling sites and online games etc. I had my phone interview last week and I suppose they liked me because I'm meeting them next Friday.

Now here is the ordeal. 

I applied for this [position](http://www.ratemyplacement.co.uk/jobs/1049/ash-gaming/junior-developer). I probably should have applied for this [position](http://www.ratemyplacement.co.uk/jobs/1048/ash-gaming/junior-c-developer). The reason I applied for the junior developer position was because I had more experience in Flash than C++.. at the time. However, midway through my second year of studying Computer Science with Games Development at the University of Hull, we have pretty much covered the groundwork of C++, so I am not too sure what to do. Don't get me wrong, I have programmed in Actionscript before, but the basic stuff. I made [this](http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/461885) when I was 15 as part of a school project, and this [this](http://www.newgrounds.com/dump/item/c046ed08c7da98505e890fb2a894e9dc) during my final year of high school. I also learnt C# in my first year, and other languages this year such as openGL and Prolog (AI), so maybe I am more suited to the C++ developer position? I can always bring it up in the interview and ask what they think seeing as I have experience for both. However.. I'm sure scratching up on AS won't be so hard, and that goes for java too. I hear java, AS and C# are very similar, and this makes me happy.

They have also requested that I bring an example of my work. Seeing as I haven't touched Flash in years, those are pretty much my best pieces of work. Amature, but hey, I was young. I suppose I could bring in a recently programmed game as part of my 2D Graphics module which is made up of C# and openGL as that is fully programmed, where as those flash entries are mostly 'goto and play'. I was more of an animator okay!

Wow, I have managed to go on and on. Apologies.

Also tips. Cover me in any tips you may have. Much appreciated.

TL,DR: I may have applied to the wrong position at a potential internship next year."

I'm a second year grad student looking to get an internship this summer.  Currently, I'm going through that wonderful process of setting up my resume, and I have a question about relevance regarding research from my undergrad.

I have my BA in physics and art and did pretty well in both.  I've opened two gallery shows through independent work, which is still relevant to my interests today.  During my time in the Physics Department, I was able to do some research and have my work published/made (the outcome was a designed machine) and presented at a few big/international conferences.  

How relevant would this information be/is it good to have this on my resume? Will it look out of place since the dates are from 2009?

She automatically assumed I would be buying a Mac, and when I told her I was leaning towards PC (I've always just been more of a PC person) she went on a rant about how it will put me at a major disadvantage when applying for design jobs, and how some students didn't get offered internship positions because they weren't familiar with the Mac OS. Now, at school we use Macs, so I do know my way around them, I'm just a lot more partial to PCs. Any insight?

Thanks in advance :)

Edit: Wow, I did not expect to get this much feedback! You guys have definitely given me a lot to think about. I'm not planning on buying a laptop until after graduation, so I have a few months to think about it. For now I'll just try to spend some more time using the school's Macs for day-to-day things. That way I'll be able to get a better feel for what it would be like if that was the main OS I was using. Thanks again guys, you're the best!"

I'm from Spokane, Washington, and graduated with a BA in Business Administration with an Accounting focus (my school's version of an Accounting degree). I graduated in June 2011, though I was finished with classes by March. Basically, my senior year I got the idea that I wanted to go to law school, and was fully focused on doing that. Took the LSAT, did really well, sent in some applications. Then I changed my mind and decided that I wanted to take a year off, because I was really hesitant about the student loan aspect of a JD.

So I decided to take a year off, and in the process decided, what the hell, I'm going to move to California. So in May of last year I moved to Orange County, CA, where I picked up a job waiting tables to pay the rent. The interesting thing is, I'm making roughly the same amount of money as an entry-level accountant would (despite only working ~35 hrs/wk!), because I work at a pretty nice restaurant. I've moved on from my JD aspirations (the risk is just way too high considering the amount of debt and the weak job market), but now I am considering regular grad school and getting a PhD in something-or-other (maybe mathematics). The other option is staying with my restaurant for a while, but that's obviously not a good long-term plan (I make good money, but it doesn't increase year-over-year). And the third option, which probably makes the most objective sense, is to finally put my degree to use.

I have some strengths and some weaknesses. My degree GPA was somewhere around 3.3, which is pretty weak. My GPA within my major and within the accounting-specific classes in my major was about 3.7 though, which is somewhat decent. I was a member of Beta Alpha Psi, which is good, but I didn't have a leadership role. I worked as a campus rep for Roger CPA Review, so I have a free review course, which means passing the exam should be much easier for me than otherwise, but I haven't even started studying. I do have the full amount of credits that I need already (225 quarter credits), so that's out of the way. Probably the biggest weakness is that I never had an internship and have no industry connections in the area where I'm now living, so I have no idea where to even start. On the strengths side, though, I'm very smart, good with words and with numbers, fast learner, and have a great work ethic (Yes, I should have got better grades in undergrad, trust me I know).

I have a few questions, some of which just stem from me having been somewhat disconnected from the accounting world for the last 9-15 months. What's the job market like in general, and where is it trending? How much is my ""take a year off"" adventure going to hurt me? Where do I even start at looking for jobs, if I do want one? Is Big 4 even remotely an option, or am I looking at a mid-size firm? I figure it's too late to work this busy season, so I'm looking at next year? Should I just focus on passing the CPA exam first so that I can justify my time off, and then apply after that? Overall, where do I stand?

I'm not even certain yet that I do want to go down this route, but having more information would make it much easier to make that decision. I really appreciate any advice or information that anyone can give, thanks in advance."

My job experience includes intern work with a U.S. Senator as well as acting as an internal consultant for a medical device company in the fields of compliance and enterprise risk management.

I want to try to industry shift upon graduation into tech (preferably computer entertainment), so any sort of experience / insight with esports would be valuable for me (and hopefully for you).

As a 20-year-old in a community college, I'm not exactly sure of my plans, so I would appreciate any input.

The Build: 
My goal is to eventually have a career in the tournament organization field. When I finish my General Education requirements at community college I hope to get into the local university and get a bachelor's degree in Business and Communications.

I'm currently teaching myself elementary Korean, and over the next few years I intend to take college courses to become near-fluent. 

After graduating from University, I want to join a program that sends teachers to Asia. I want to teach English in Korea, and while I'm there I'll see if there's any possibility of an Internship at GOM TV.

With the knowledge acquired from said internship, I would return to the United States and hopefully work with MLG, NASL, Blizzard, or whoever else has some major tournaments.

In an ideal world, after a long while in the tournament business I would have saved up a ton of money and be able to start managing my own eSports team. It's not something I think will actually happen, but it's a fun thought.

TL;DR - I want to get a degree in Business, go to Korea, learn the trade, and then work in eSports tournament organization. Any advice?"

Right now I'm about to start my second year, but due to cuts in the budget the funding didn't really work out. I started out with a good number of credits at my school due to AP classes, and I've been able to knock out almost all of my general ed. classes(Math and physics were pretty much all I took because I had credit for all the other courses), and start my major (engineering). My GPA is a little weak (2.9) but I have leadership roles, including a national award and an internship at a very respected organization. Main thing is, if I go to school at an in-state rate it'd be much easier on my pocket.

I know that my chances are pretty slim for being able to transfer because of my GPA, but I guess my questions are how easy is it for transfer students to be able to 'experience' the campus and transition to life at UT? I've always loved Austin and I've been there plenty for SxSW and other events so I know what goes on, but I want to know more about 'student life'.

He is an Iraq war veteran (3 tours) which has resulted in some serious PTSD, anti-sociality, and a drinking problem, he also has Asperger's syndrome. I don't consider him an alcoholic because 1) I'm not an impartial expert and 2) he drinks no more than twice a week. But when he does drink, he gets fall over sloppy drunk. He has 3 boys ranging from 9 months to 5 years old. He and his family are living with my gracious parents but his wife left 2 weeks ago with the youngest child because of a few days of intense fighting that stemmed from him getting laid off. He hasn't really been able to hold down a job for the past year since he was basically fired from the military (he was given an honorable discharge before his contract was up, and the military refused to pay some of his discharge benefits, my understanding is he fucked up but not enough for a dishonorable discharge). His wife is manipulative, bullies him, and what I like to call a psychopath. My brother has been very stressed doing some things to prepare for actually getting a job but I've noticed first hand (I'm home on break from uni) and hasn't really been motivated. He took his 2.5 year old to a friends house tonight, he left around 8:30 because usually the toddler is asleep and was hoping a car ride would put him out. Me and my parents assumed he would come home once the kid was asleep but went to this certain friend's house. For some reason I haven't been able to sleep all night when my brother's car pulls in the driveway at 2:30, I immediately notice his friend is driving. My brother stammers out of the car more drunk than I've seen him since the weekend before he left for his 1st tour. I let his friend bring the sleeping kid inside and put to bed, and my brother passed out on his bed. I immediately took his friend outside and yelled at him for being an enabler and that I said to him that ""if you were a true friend you would have sent him home sober, not brought him home drunk, how the fuck is he going to get (His oldest son) to school tomorrow morning if you have his fucking car? You realize he's heading for a custody battle soon, right? It takes one piece of fucking evidence to ruin a whole argument (I'm in law school so I know a thing or two) and if the court thinks my brother is alcoholic I will never see my nephews again"" So to make this even longer I wrote my brother this letter since I'm heading back to school tomorrow morning, let me know what you think. My parents are meeting with a lawyer tomorrow to discuss the most appropriate legal route to take because the children aren't in any harm right now.

-(Brother)
I realized years ago that snitching on you didn't stop you from making bad decisions, I'm not going to start now. The one word that comes to mind from what I saw last night is disappointment. I'm disappointed that you are so incapable of dealing with your issues that you get stupid drunk. I'll never comprehend what you've been through or what you are going through, I wish you were strong enough to NOT resort to alcohol. Mom, Dad, (our sister) &amp; I have always been here for you, but you refuse to be okay with it (I have no idea how to express what I'm trying to convey here, but w/e wrote it in ink). You need to stop convincing yourself that things will work out on their own. Fucking take control, grab it like a life saving rope as you fall off a cliff, cause that's what is happening. Mom &amp; Dad have thrown you a great rescue rope but you have to work for it. Grab the self-control to be a real man and not drink your problems. You need to make the hard choices everyday, I know you're capable. You need to prepare everyday like you are fighting for custody of your three boys, that day is inevitable. It takes mountains of substantial evidence, not Mom &amp; Dad's vouching, to convince a court you are THE better parent. It takes once incident to undermine any evidence you have. You might think I have no idea what I'm talking about or how you feel or I can't understand what you're going through and you're right, but saying so is distracting yourself from what you need to do. I can't try to help you by snitching, but I REFUSE to ""protect"" you if it puts my nephews any closer to not seeing me again. I suggest you find better friends who won't enable piss poor decisions. A real friend sends you home sober. I want nothing more than to see you provide a great life for your boys, but you can't do it with that cunt(pardon the language) wife of yours, and you can't get rid of her AND keep the boys if you fuck up. Getting laid off wasn't your fault, but what happens NEXT IS. I have nothing but love for you (Brother), it's why I decided not to work this break (I was going to work for the company that took me on as an intern this past summer) to help you with the boys, I hope it's the last favor you never asked for. I wish I was man enough to say all this to your face, but your behavior lately has made it clear that you can't be pushed. It's a frustrating paradox that Mom, Dad &amp; I can't push you because it's our instinct to do so when you are in this time of need. When you divorce that parasite &amp; need me to testify in your favor, I want to look in any lawyer's face, especially my own, and unequivocally tell them you never made a bad choice after January 25th, 2012, and that your sons need to be with you and will be fine if it is only you. Do me a favor and act like you didn't read this around me until I know the time is right, I hope I get to do so sooner than later.

Also, put this letter somewhere your wife won't find, like a high shelf, or in a book. (She's super short, and super dumb)

Love-(Me)"

I triggered a chain reaction that made him realize so many things-- what he can accomplish if he focused harder in school and strived for internships. He's so smart; charming; knowledgable; and genuinely kind.. whereas, I'm at a lost to where I should stand. I know I maybe young, but I have every reason to remain in love with Kevin Nicole Angeles Sison. He's the one that I can picture marrying, raising children with, and growing old together. I was so blessed to have him in my life, and I took it all for granted in a single instant.

First draft, would greatly appreciate the proof reading!",MoMoFoSho,Proofreading,https://www.reddit.com/r/Proofreading/comments/oxadv/my_application_to_my_schools_honors_program_first/,"**Promt:***	Explain why you feel you would be a good asset for the UNF Honors Program*

Thank you in advance!

**First Draft**

Experiences are what make us who we are. The experiences we have teach us our values and customs. I believe that the experiences I had have prepared me for the affairs that will come my way. One program I would like to be a part of is University of North Florida’s Honors Program. I believe that I will benefit from the program through the exclusive classes available to Honors Students and the duties that will be presented to me. I believe that I will make a quality addition to UNF’s Honors Program for the following reasons. 

One of the most fulfilling experiences I’ve had so far was when I volunteered as Technical Director for my high school’s drama program. The Technical Director has duties such as keeping schedules, managing people, and fulfilling the director and producer’s visions for the production. As Technical Director, I oversaw everything during production that was behind the scenes. I motivated and assigned people to projects. Being able to manage these people effectively to fit our tight schedule took leadership. I also gained practice in teamwork by helping crews accomplish tasks such as building a platform, painting a set piece, or ironing costumes. 

As Technical Director, a lot of issues fell on my shoulders. I needed to be quick on my feet and have a sharp mind to fix problems. These instances where I managed crises tested my critical thinking and problem solving skills. Once during production, we had used the last of our budget for building the set, but we needed at least $150 worth of lumber. I found a local lumber dealer and made an arrangement that he would trade us some lumber for ad space in our play’s program. There was also an issue where our costume mistress was threatening to quit the production and take all of the male costumes she made home with her. I presented at the parent booster meeting our need for donations, and even though our costume mistress didn’t leave, we received enough donations to add another costume change between scenes. 

A successful person starts any job, assignment, project, or resolution with determination, devotion, and a sense of enthusiasm. This can be reflected in my academic experiences at UNF. After I toured the campus with my father in August of 2010, I heard that there was a deadline about 2 weeks later to have my application reviewed and find out if I was accepted the following October. I gathered what I needed and ordered my transcripts by the application deadline. On October 2nd, I received my admission decision, I had been invited to start the upcoming summer, but if I brought my overall high school GPA up, I could change my start date to the fall instead. I finished my first semester of my Senior Year with six As and one B. This improvement allowed me to change my start date to the fall, and I continued to do extremely well in my classes during my second semester also. 
This determination still hasn’t faltered now that I am actually taking college level classes. I completed my first semester with a 3.7 GPA. My enthusiasm hasn’t faded either. It’s the beginning of my second semester and I walk into every class eager to learn what my professor has to offer next. I look forward to the classes that I will take next fall, and the spring after that. Thanks to this zeal, I am able to complete homework easily for near perfect grades.  

I recently declared my major in Health Administration. Before declaring, I thought I wanted a degree in business, but I knew that I wanted to work in healthcare, but didn’t know how to without taking up nursing. My mother was diagnosed with invasive breast cancer September 2009. I wouldn’t be able to count the number of times I witnessed her experiences with the health care system. I realized that there was someone behind the hospital and insurance companies that helped my mom gain her health back, and I decided that that’s the job I want. My dream job would to become a Hospital Administrator. I want to be able to manage doctors and procedures most effectively to provide a comfortable experience for patients on their road to recovery. To reach my goals, I look forward to completing internships that will let me apply skills to a job I want to make a career. I also have applied to live in the Brooks College of Health Living Learning Community for next school year. Through the living learning community, I hope to meet professionals in my field who will give me insight and advice for my advancement. I will also be in pursuit of a Leadership Certificate from the Institute of Values from UNF. I have not taken Introduction to Leadership yet, but plan to this coming fall to begin my documentation of all my leadership experiences.  

University of North Florida’s Honors Program will help me polish and develop the skills I have and I expect to learn additional talents also. I am an earnest applicant who wants to grow and develop within my university. The experiences and goals I’ve written about show why I would make a good asset to the program. Lydia Maria Child, a woman’s rights activist of the 1800’s, once said, “Belief in oneself is one of the most important bricks in building any successful venture.” I believe in myself, and I know that I will prosper at University of North Florida, and will prosper in University of North Florida’s Honors Program.

I was lucky enough to spend the fall semester in D.C., and I had a great experience (lived with a whole lot of other college students and had a good internship on the hill). Based on that, I want to be back there, but I want to do something different.

So I was wondering - what's the coolest internship you can think of? I'm looking to do something related to social justice, or potentially in Democratic/progressive politics, but I'm open to any and all ideas. Ideally in the city, and paid is better (but I understand that there aren't too many of those), but anything unique is awesome. Maybe you really love your job and have an internship opening, maybe it's somewhere you've worked before, or maybe you've heard from a friend about a great experience.

Any suggestions are appreciated. Thanks! In return:

I spent the next six or seven months dealing with everything from snide remarks and prank calls in the night to death threats and vandalized property (the same thing happened to my girlfriend, which was just as painful for me), because of the stress I began having severe problems sleeping, often going days without restful sleep, had to change my phone number, and was told by the police there was nothing they could do for me.

* His Personal Site: http://yourjustlucky.com/
* His popular Idea: http://phraseologyproject.com/

I spent about 5 hours today with Drew Milton, both in a lecture setting and Workshop setting. I have information on where he gets his information/inspiration from. What his process is from start to finish. 

To start: Drew is a young typographer, who is already making quite a name in the world of hand-lettering. He grew up in Michigan in a home schooled setting, in which he worked with his dad as a intern grunt for his web design company. While there he developed connections and base design understanding. When the time came he went to Kendall Art College for 3 years. While there he worked with a local non-profit group named xxxchurch.com. It was a small organization and he was the lead designer at the company. He was given the opportunity to have full creative freedom for all the companies design needs. After about 3 years into Kendall, he had enough passion for the subject of design and was starting to get burned out from all the academic work. He left Kendall to start a company called  ""justlucky"". He created his own studio company and hired an illustrator and photographer and rented a studio. He all kinds of work and struggled the most with pay the bills as well as student loans. His most successful pieces from this time was his T-Shirt designs for Bands. He did work for the academy is, and fall out boy. Unfortunately he had to dismantle the studio and his staff. He now works a freelance designer, but he really started to get noticed when he released the Phraseology project. He created this site where people could submit words or phrases and he would illustrate them. This served as a community building thing as well as experimental phase. The site now has expanded to include two other typographers, and has over 20,000 submissions for phrases/words.

When asked where he gets his inspiration from, he offered a list of the books he found most helpful. He believes that having a library of resources is extremely useful. He also suggests that you travel looking for inspiration in cities, antique shops. 

He also loves to look towards the San Born Map Company for inspiration.

* Hes a List of the books he suggests:
* Scripts by Louise Fili

I've had CRPS (or Complex Regional Pain Syndrome) for about five years now. I have a spinal cord stimulator to control the pain, but occasionally it does go numb (due to swelling) or starts hurting. I have painkillers, both ones I take regularly (Gabapentin) as well as stronger ones (Vicodin) that I rarely take. I've started an internship with a company that, with luck, will turn into a job. It's software development, so it's in an office. However, today my leg went numb, and I haven't spoken with HR about accommodations yet, so I had no way to alleviate the numbness. 

So, I ask you good people of r/ChronicPain what you think I should ask for. I obviously can't ask to work from home due to the fact that there are meetings to attend (they made that explicit), but they had unofficially said they could do things like get me a better chair. What else can I ask for? They'll want me to tell them and, while I don't want to be too needy, I do want something that will work. What have you guys asked for? What's worked for you? I don't want to have to give up this internship all because of my pain, but I don't want to have to go through what I had today. 

(Just a note, but I cried like a baby when my leg went numb. It took me by surprise, and it was a long day. I'm not even entirely sure I'll have a job after I reacted so strongly to it. I usually don't react like that, though, and will probably retain my composure in the future.)

Finally, if you guys think that I probably shouldn't go further with this, and simply get a job where I can telecommute, I'll consider that possibility. I do have time to find a job like that, due to the fact that I'm on disability, though it'll be much harder due to the fact that I have zero experience, and I'm just out of college. I know that my pain will hold me back and, while I made it my New Year's resolution to not let it do that to me, I do acknowledge that life doesn't bend to resolutions.  "

* His Personal Site: http://yourjustlucky.com/
* His popular Idea: http://phraseologyproject.com/

I spent about 5 hours today with Drew Milton, both in a lecture setting and Workshop setting. I have information on where he gets his information/inspiration from. What his process is from start to finish. 

To start: Drew is a young typographer, who is already making quite a name in the world of hand-lettering. He grew up in Michigan in a home schooled setting, in which he worked with his dad as a intern grunt for his web design company. While there he developed connections and base design understanding. When the time came he went to Kendall Art College for 3 years. While there he worked with a local non-profit group named xxxchurch.com. It was a small organization and he was the lead designer at the company. He was given the opportunity to have full creative freedom for all the companies design needs. After about 3 years into Kendall, he had enough passion for the subject of design and was starting to get burned out from all the academic work. He left Kendall to start a company called  ""justlucky"". He created his own studio company and hired an illustrator and photographer and rented a studio. He all kinds of work and struggled the most with pay the bills as well as student loans. His most successful pieces from this time was his T-Shirt designs for Bands. He did work for the academy is, and fall out boy. Unfortunately he had to dismantle the studio and his staff. He now works a freelance designer, but he really started to get noticed when he released the Phraseology project. He created this site where people could submit words or phrases and he would illustrate them. This served as a community building thing as well as experimental phase. The site now has expanded to include two other typographers, and has over 20,000 submissions for phrases/words.

When asked where he gets his inspiration from, he offered a list of the books he found most helpful. He believes that having a library of resources is extremely useful. He also suggests that you travel looking for inspiration in cities, antique shops. 

He also loves to look towards the San Born Map Company for inspiration.

I'm fucking up my life.  I made a very good friend on New Years and we've been immediate great buds ever since, playing music, small trips, hanging out with my friends, challenging him to tetris at a local dive, helpin' each other out. I care about him very much but...you know. My drinking is miserable for everyone but me and whoever else is drinking. Last night I accused him of just wanting to hang out with me to hang out with my friends, *that he was bored and had nothing better to do*, saying ""no one actually likes me and i know it, it's okay, it's normal"" etc. He finally got angry and left. Silently angry, chucked his water cup in the yard. Didn't want to see him angry, it took some function out of my throat and chest like a punch, just wanted him to want to leave me.

Last week after I drank til I probably should have thrown up (and I was very regretful and apologetic for ruining the night and a movie,) I think we shook or pinky promised on being ""no drinking buddies"" for 4 days at least and I only lasted one. night.  Yeah.  But I feel like I totally have excuses is the worst. Then last night...his texts say ""Give up the alcohol, that's the only times I've ever not liked you"" ...tells me it makes me bratty, confusing, manipulative, expecting, unpleasant (ow ow) ""and I'd never think of you that way any other time"" ... ""i can't understand a drunk, nor do I want to... ugly, ugly... I will never have that in my life again...if you want to be with me give it up, there's no way around it""

So I'll stop, that's probably more than enough to make it clear that my heart is in the gutter right now. I feel so desperate to prove to him, anything to him...**I feel like I've blown it and I should just leave him the fuck alone.**  I wanted him away from me last night because I didn't even want him to come over and see me like that in the first place, but he did, and stayed around hanging out.  I don't see why he ever did in the first place, what my life is and the huge problems I deal with are fucking obvious.

I want to go over to his house but damn maybe I shouldn't do that.  His last text let me know he was turning his phone off for awhile and goodbye.  **I feel like throwing up from the anxiety that the sudden realization of what's happened creates.  I'm so sorry, but I have no one left to say I'm sorry to.** And even now you guys, I just wanna walk down the road and get some wine or beer because this sucks, but I won't, I'm trapping myself in my room. I'm very useless.

There's a photobooth snapshot on my computer from last night of me messing around with him, trying to get his picture with me.  It's just me in blurry laughter trying and failing miserably to pull him back over in front of the computer.  First and probably last photo and he's not even in it.

What should I do? What can I say? What the fuck can I do??? Should I leave it all alone and walk away? I could do that if it's the good thing. I didn't even drink all summer and then bam, I moved back to my college town from an internship and in with my alcoholic (now ex-) boyfriend. Now what the fuck is even...I don't...I...would really like any advice.


**tl;dr** new friend doesn't drink like other friends, I really like and respect this new friend, I've fucked up and acted like a tragic cunt.


EDIT: I'm 24 and graduated and frustrated with where I'm going, that I'm a waitress, life things.  He's 21 and wiser and calmer than me, and all-around sweet and genuine and good-natured. And I really just wanted to have positive encouraging effects on him, not make him miserable."

ozpcx,1,2012-01-27,Do you think people would be so quick to forgive Paterno if Sandusky had murdered a kid?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ozpcx/do_you_think_people_would_be_so_quick_to_forgive/,"This last week I have read/listened to so much shit that I just can't stand it. Here is how I feel, and I have had a lot of time to distill my thoughts down to the point where I know what I believe, and it ain't going to change:

Paterno made a horrible choice. A indefensible choice, and he didn't make that choice once, he made it every day that he didn't do something. For people that are still confused, or apologetic, let me try a thought experiment.

I submit that about the worst individual crime I can think of is child murder. Child rape isn't far below it on the scale of evil. If Sandusky had murdered a kid in that shower, and Paterno later found out about it, and then did nothing (and telling your boss is next to nothing), would there be any ambiguity about how we should treat or remember him. And the whole ""it was just McCreary's word"" argument holds no water with me. What organization would hire (he was an intern at the time) and promote a liar of that magnitude (and then make attempts to distance themselves from the accused)? They believed him.

So, back to my point, if we were dealing with a dead kid, instead of just a profoundly damaged individual, an individual that no one made any attempt to find and offer any sort of help, then I can't imagine a single sole coming to anyone involved's defense. So this is what I would like to know: if you wouldn't forgive overlooking complicitness in a child's murder, how can you so easily in the case of rape?

I get that the guy did good things, and I will admit that he probably wasn't an evil man, but I think he is being let off awfully easy by people that want to characterize him as someone who ""made a mistake"", or had flawed judgement. Dinging a car in a parking lot and not leaving a note is a mistake. Never tipping a waiter is a character flaw. Ignoring the rape of a child (and we all know someone who raped a child isn't going to just do it once) isn't a mistake, or a flaw, it is a gross negligence to our society as a whole. And as I said earlier, he isn't guilty of doing this once, he is guilty of doing it every day. And he most definitely had the power to stop it. He found a way to live with it, which means he made a sort of peace with the knowledge. That is more than a flaw. And it takes more than a lot of good acts to wash that away. How many good deeds would you weigh equal to the innocence that Sandusky ruined because others with the power to stop him didn't? To be sure, there are several people that share Paterno's blame, but he had held the most sway and respect in that small community. He had climbed high on a legacy of honor, that is why his fall was the farthest."

I've been reading for a while, and I just wanted to get some feedback/advice: 

I graduated with a Masters in HCI (from an interdisciplinary program) last year. I'm trying to break into the UX research field, and have had a terrible time with it. I've been applying and interviewing for 8 months now, and I still haven't been able to secure a job. There AREN'T any junior/entry-level UX positions...what's an entry-level type person supposed to do? 

I've got enough projects that I think prove my worth, breadth and depth [they've been reframed so as not to seem too much like academic projects], and a couple of decent internships [*side tangent*: when I applied for the big internships, they said I wasn't experienced enough. Now that I've graduated, I'm ""too experienced"" for an internship, but not experienced enough to hire]. 

I'm not *the best* designer (research/analytics are my strengths), but I can do some wireframing and web design. I also code some (though I'm not a confident coder, but I'm working on it). I also have a lot of social media management/marketing experience at employed jobs (not a business person either; and I don't want to get stuck in that area). I'm well-versed in design theory and application (I also have an undergrad background in psychology, lots of traditional research and statistics). 

There are a few interviews that I've botched, for sure, but there are many more where, after being referred or knowing someone at the company, I interview, apply, and can't seem to get to the next stage. 

How *do* people get these jobs? Is it a close relation to a ""UX ninja/rockstar""? Am I supposed to be positioning myself to be seen and well known (the other students who graduated with me who are UXRs at the big companies didn't have to do that or go through most of what I have, and they're not very forthcoming about why they've had different experiences). 

I've talked about my frustration before, but I wanted to get a different perspective from people who are actually IN the field working. All I want to do is conduct usability testing, and brainstorm/design digital and technological innovations that make computer interaction easier and/or people's lives better. 

I've gone to NPO and other organizations locally for freelance/free portfolio work, but they're pretty well covered by ad/design agencies - and those guys aren't looking for people like me (it's an elite crowd - if you're not friends with them already/are ""like them"", then you won't get hired). 

Well, I think I've very thoroughly ranted. Hopefully it made some sense. Thanks.

**TL;DR** - Masters grad; been trying to find a job as a UX Researcher for the past 8 months. What's going on with the UX Research field? Is there some secret to getting in that I'm missing? 

P.S. I know that networking has a lot to do with it, as with most jobs. My network is...decently okay, but definitely could be stronger. I just don't have that much to offer in the relationship as a recent grad w/ little experience doing the kind of work they do, so it's pretty one-sided. "

Actually there’s an option [C](http://nhsc.hrsa.gov/loanrepayment/index.html), which will repay ‘x’ amount of my loans per ‘y’ years of service in an underserved area. 


Assuming option B: Over the next 20 years my income will probably begin around 50k and make its way up to 70k. Let’s average and say 60k. $60,000*10%= $6000 per year. Multiply that 6k over the following 20 years and I’ll end up repaying approximately $120,000 (whether I owe $170k or $200k). So, why not max out my loans over the next year? 


I still have an internship year remaining, during which I am considered a full time student. I can take out loans during this time—unsubsidized, subsidized, and PLUS loans. It appears that there would be no repercussions (other than potentially affecting my credit) to taking out the maximum amount of loans during this time. I do not need this money, as I will be receiving a stipend of approximately 22k. However, I could take out loans and begin a retirement fund, purchase a much needed car, to simply retain the funds for an emergency, etc.

I've been reading for a while, and I just wanted to get some feedback/advice: 

I graduated with a Masters in HCI (from an interdisciplinary program) last year. I'm trying to break into the UX research field, and have had a terrible time with it. I've been applying and interviewing for 8 months now, and I still haven't been able to secure a job. There AREN'T any junior/entry-level UX positions...what's an entry-level type person supposed to do? 

I've got enough projects that I think prove my worth, breadth and depth [they've been reframed so as not to seem too much like academic projects], and a couple of decent internships [*side tangent*: when I applied for the big internships, they said I wasn't experienced enough. Now that I've graduated, I'm ""too experienced"" for an internship, but not experienced enough to hire]. 

I'm not *the best* designer (research/analytics are my strengths), but I can do some wireframing and web design. I also code some (though I'm not a confident coder, but I'm working on it). I also have a lot of social media management/marketing experience at employed jobs (not a business person either; and I don't want to get stuck in that area). I'm well-versed in design theory and application (I also have an undergrad background in psychology, lots of traditional research and statistics). 

There are a few interviews that I've botched, for sure, but there are many more where, after being referred or knowing someone at the company, I interview, apply, and can't seem to get to the next stage. 

How *do* people get these jobs? Is it a close relation to a ""UX ninja/rockstar""? Am I supposed to be positioning myself to be seen and well known (the other students who graduated with me who are UXRs at the big companies didn't have to do that or go through most of what I have, and they're not very forthcoming about why they've had different experiences). 

I've talked about my frustration @  [/r/jobs before](http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/lk0kw/rantjob_rejection_second_time_applying_with_the/), but I wanted to get a different perspective from people who are actually IN the field working. All I want to do is conduct usability testing, and brainstorm/design digital and technological innovations that make computer interaction easier and/or people's lives better. 

I've gone to NPO and other organizations locally for freelance/free portfolio work, but they're pretty well covered by ad/design agencies - and those guys aren't looking for people like me (it's an elite crowd - if you're not friends with them already/are ""like them"", then you won't get hired). 

Well, I think I've very thoroughly ranted. Hopefully it made some sense. Thanks.

**TL;DR** - Masters grad; been trying to find a job as a UX Researcher for the past 8 months. What's going on with the UX Research field? Is there some secret to getting in that I'm missing? 

P.S. I know that networking has a lot to do with it, as with most jobs. My network is...decently okay, but definitely could be stronger. I just don't have that much to offer in the relationship as a recent grad w/ little experience doing the kind of work they do, so it's pretty one-sided. "

I'm an undergraduate student who has net income *(income from summer internship and scholarships - taxes, housing and school)* of ~$9,400 per year. I recently opened a new [Bank of America secured credit card](https://www.bankofamerica.com/credit-cards/marketingdetail.action?context_id=marketing_detail&amp;offer_id=ECOMM0908AYB00406800151520EN000|2072218|6E) to start building up my credit score. 

Here's a question that I've been wondering for quite a while: is there any relationship between my credit score and my credit card bill? In other words, will I be able to accumulate more credit score if I spend more on my credit card? 

Like many other financial institutions, Bank of America gives a tiny bit of interest for using their debit card. It's small but seems to be a better one than WorldPoints that I can accumulate through the credit card. So I'm considering using my debit card if there's no relationship between my credit score and my credit card bill. If it matters, I'll potentially be using my credit card for all my purchases.

Thank You!"

One way would be to only list my Grad school, and show off my 3.56.  I would kind of like them to see my math degree though (my masters is in CS).  If I only put one gpa though, it would probably be pretty obvious that the other one sucked.

TwoX, today I got out of counseling, and I can't stop smiling. In December of 2010, I was raped. It wasn't a violent rape, and I thought I was fine. In the summer of 2011, I was in a car accident. And almost like the truck hit me, so did the trauma of the rape. 

I would wake up screaming in the middle of the night, I had terrible nightmares, and would be so scared sometimes that I would be sweating and shaking/crying until 3 a.m., when I would finally collapse.

I couldn't get anything done. I felt like a prisoner in my own mind, and no matter what I did I just couldn't ""shake"" it. I am a psychology student, and I know everything to say to myself, but somehow I felt a failure for it not working. I got a [dog](http://i.imgur.com/jbcF4.jpg) (Jax/Jaxie) during the summer, and he and JK Rowling (see below) saved my life. No matter how hard I was crying, my baby would come over and lick my hand and lay by me, and he wouldn't leave my side for anything. He growled at the opposite sex when they came near me, and he wouldn't let me out of his sight (he knocked down the bathroom door once because he couldn't see me). It breaks my heart into a million little pieces every single day that I can't have him with me at school. As soon as I got back to school, I got into counseling. It got worse before it got better.

I couldn't listen to music with a male singer, I couldn't make eye contact with the opposite sex, forget about touching or hugging them. I was extremely irritable, anxious, and depressed. Sometimes I thought that it might have been more merciful had he killed me. Because if he had killed me, then it could be put to rest - I was gone. But it wasn't like that. It was always there, lingering, making me hate myself and everything I did.

I couldn't watch movies, because something in them would remind me of my rapist, or possibly the professor that took advantage of me when I confided in him about what had happened. In fact, the only thing I could do and feel comfortable with was Harry Potter. I only got to read Harry Potter while I was on bed-rest from my accident (it fucked up my back), and it changed my life. Watched it, read it, tattooed it. 

Well, this was my life last semester. My counselor and I did [EMDR](http://www.emdr-therapy.com/) therapy, and I can't tell you how it helped. I don't know where I'd be without it.

This year, it's like someone flipped a switch. I've applied to four summer internships, with 2 more applications on their way, as well as a scholarship application. I'm the president of the Quiz Bowl team here on campus and we're on television, we've been invited to a dinner party with the university president and his wife, and we're going to nationals in Chicago later this semester. I'm putting into motion my own psychological study, I'm adding to my tattoos, I'm confident in myself and who I am again, and I'm happy single. These few weeks of the new year have been better than the entirety of last year.

But today, TwoX, I am out of counseling. I'm doing what I need to do to take care of myself. I'm so excited to be out of counseling TwoX, that I can't possibly put it into words. At the same time, though, I know that I've fought tooth and nail for this. Blood, sweat, and many tears went into feeling normal again. I fought every single second for myself, convinced that this man who violated intimacy to the highest degree would not ruin me, and it's been the hardest thing I've ever done (and I've raised $527K in a week before). 

And I'm very, very proud of that.

If I can do this, I can do anything. That will be my new battle cry.

Edit: And I just ordered a whole bunch of cake decorating supplies from Amazon. I'm going to master a new skill, and something I've always wanted to do!

Edit2: **WOW.** Front-paged! You ladies are amazing, truly. It seems I keep just saying ""thank you"" over and over, but I mean it each and every one. You guys made my day a million times better. I can't thank you enough."

I started an internship 2 weeks ago in the creative field. The internship is 8 weeks long, and is pretty easy and enjoyable. I am overly qualified (not to sound egotistical or anything) and what I am doing is easy as pie. With my experiences and credentials, I should be working a paying gig, and need to work a paying gig, even with freelancing. So, I'm going to approach my boss today and tell her that I've been offered a paying job full time (which is true @ $10/hr) and give her the chance to hire me first (as she knows pretty well what I'm capable of and what I add to the team). I get along really well with everyone, am always on time and produce high quality material quickly.

Slight curveballs: There is only one other person in my department and he completed the entire 8 week internship. And there was another intern that started on Monday (a week after me) and he resigned this morning because he found a paying gig and ""didn't think he fit in"" (which I'm not sure helps or hurts me right now.

So Reddit, do you have any suggestions on the best way to approach this? There is no way I can continue working here for no pay (especially because it's about 10 dollars a day in gas just to get here). And I don't want to work for less than $10/hr."

Seeking non-sales position in south-central PA.",[deleted],forhire,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/oz3ck/for_hire_management_graduate_internship/,"I graduated with my Bachelor's degree in Business Administration (concentration in Management) in May, and have since been looking for a job daily. Though I've had a few mediocre interviews and offers, I'm waiting for something that I feel will be a good fit; I'm looking for a career with a good company, not a job or company that will act as a stepping stone.

In late 2009 and early 2010, I interned for a local (but large) insurance company in the Marketing department. Through that internship, I met a Financial Advisor for Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, who offered me a chance to work as an Investment Analyst. I took that opportunity and spent the next 15 months working with his top-notch team analyzing portfolios, making optimizations/recommendations, and learning whatever else they had to teach me.

I've also worked at the same restaurant for 6 years now, and I'm working there until I find a job. I'm still there because they treat me well and I enjoy the job and my coworkers - even though I've made more money at every other job I've worked.

Finally, I also write for a professional for-profit tech blog. I'm a senior editor, which means I write occasionally, but more often operate behind the scenes, proofreading other authors' works and building and maintaining relationships with manufacturers, suppliers, and PR people.

I would prefer a position that does not entail sales - the only sales jobs I'd consider would be ones that operate on a normal 8-5 or 9-5 schedule and are ""soft"" sales. Beyond that, I have very diverse interests and abilities and *love* learning new things, so I'd be up for virtually any sort of desk job. I live in York, PA, so any job within the York/Harrisburg/Lancaster region would be great; obviously closer to York is better, and nothing further than 30-40 minutes commute - I'll work and work hard during the day, but I want to have nights to spend with my family.

Resume available upon request - seems like posting a direct link is a bit of a risky proposition based on other [For Hire] posts.

Thanks!

The real reason I'm applying is that I'm putting in applications to all the branches, but I don't think that's what they want to hear.

So, r/navy, what made you choose the Navy over other branches? ""They had the rating I wanted"" and ""job prospects after getting out"" are great reasons, but they're not helpful to me. What, in general, makes the Navy stand out?

oyxjp,7,2012-01-27,Bad teeth since I was 12.,[deleted],Assistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/oyxjp/bad_teeth_since_i_was_12/,"Here's my story:  I was raised by a divorced mother who was neglectful, partly because she was too busy working and partly because she was kind of crazy.  When I was young, I was very thin because she never bought much to eat, so often I would end up eating a good amount of pure sugar and/or jello powder because there wasn't anything else to eat.  I was also not taught the importance of brushing my teeth daily, so by the time I was around 11 or 12, I had developed over 20 cavities all over my permanent teeth.  Back then I didn't realize how bad the situation was until my mom freaked out when I showed her what they looked like.  She took me to a dentist a few times, but soon stopped before I had gotten all of the cavities filled.  While she was/is poor, I'm pretty sure she had enough to cover the remaining visits, but she didn't do it.  So, from age 12, I've had around 8 cavities that still have not been treated.  I've never actually counted how many there are because it just makes me feel horrible to think about it or look at my teeth.  The worst cavity is on one of my big teeth at the top front of my mouth (one of the big incisors) that's basically a big black hole front and center in my mouth, which has made me extremely self-conscious to the point of frequent periods of extreme isolation, basically ruining most chances of living a normal life while in high school and then in college.  I can't talk normally; I'm always aware of the movements of my mouth, making sure not too much is shown.  I also cannot smile.  I've had to withdraw from my college twice due to the psychological/mental health effects.

I severed ties with my mother once I entered college, taking out as many loans as I can, doing paid internships, and working doing school, but that's been only enough to just get by.  So I've dealt with these slowly worsening dental issues for 10 years (I'm 22 now), very often depressed about how much I've missed out on and stressed over because of my teeth.  It makes me feel like I lost a good chunk of my youth because of my teeth and how much I've had to work.  Even if I could afford to go to a dentist today, I'd feel too embarrassed to actually go have any work done.  And even when I do get this stuff fixed, it will probably feel like too little, too late...  I guess at this point I'm not even sure why I'm posting this."
oyxd3,11,2012-01-27,Getting Closer to the End (Day 10 and some major changes later),poopyfarts,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/oyxd3/getting_closer_to_the_end_day_10_and_some_major/,"Ten days ago I said this was the beginning of the end. It's been rough, but it's been worth it. The first 4 days I didn't sleep. I don't mean like a night of having a hard time sleeping, I mean no sleep at all whatsoever. I stayed up all night with my thoughts: some of them angry, some of them psychotic, some of them hopeful. 

On the 3rd night I was reading about insomnia and how it's best not to think about how you cant sleep, as the thought alone will stimulated you and wake you up. So I felt myself ""let go"" and I surrendered to the Higher Power, and adopted a faith that everything will turn out okay, as long as I commit and stay strong through the struggle.

I went to buy Melatonin, a sleep aide that my doctor prescribed, and I ended up having a conversation that had just gotten out of jail. She told me about how she was addicted to crack for 12 years, and how she just recently got out of jail after doing 17 years. She told me that God would bless me for the decision I made, and told me to stay persistent, to pray and to read the Bible. I accepted her words.

The next day I get a call from MTV to come in for an interview for an internship. I knew I HAD to sleep, so I took a super hot bath with epsom salt, drank a magnesium drink called CALM, to relax my muscles, took a 10mg dose of melatonin, plus a pill of a valerian root/chamomile combo. I slept well enough. Dressed right for my interview.

It was the toughest interview ever. But I got the position. I finally did it. Over the days that have passed I found myself having fewer and fewer psychotic thoughts. My sleep pattern got back to normal as I can now fall asleep around midnight. My apetite came back to normal, and I am now keeping a consistent workout routine.

Honestly, I feel great. I've been keeping myself extremely busy as to not have any time to think about negative things, or to get bored and start craving weed again. I've been to a couple Marijuana Anonymous meetings. Although they're boring, I do drive home with a stronger sense of self-support and remembering why I stopped smoking in the first place.

For the first few nights I was unable to sleep, I made a blog filled with nothing but motivating and uplifting content. I have been updating it every day. You can check it out here if you'd like at [EXPLODE INTO LIGHT](http://explodeintolight.tumblr.com). I look at it every day, and honestly it's been motivating me to make changes. I guess you can sort of say I've been getting high off my own supply.

Working out, not running, but doing heavy weights and going super hard when I choose to do cardio, has helping me get rid of any excess energy or jitteriness.

My social skills have also gone up a notch as well. I actually listen to people when they talk, and am actually interested in what they're saying. Usually I'm just waiting for people to finish talking so I can go back to doing my own thing or just being high and spacing out. I don't space out when I talk to people anymore, and I have a lot more social initiative than before. I find just asking people ""How is your day going?"" to be one of the strongest phrases against loneliness.

I didn't play Pc games too much as I worried it would be a trigger to smoke as I often time have fun with the  *smoke-playgames-surf-jackoff-nap-repeat* cycle. 

I love actually being able to remember things, and having a broader view on life. I feel like less of an immediate-satisfaction stimulation junkie, and more eager to endure long term commitments and reach more meaningful goals. I'm less doubtful of myself, or my life, and honestly, I have more faith in God and in my reality as a whole that as I commit to bettering my life, my life will commit to bettering me. 

I also have a problem with rage, and I've not raged at all since I quit, except for a few small expressions of anger, but nothing crazy. I'm surprised that I'm not experiencing the extreme violence and aggression I got when I had quit before. Maybe being focused hasn't given me time to think about shit to piss me off, and doing heavy lifting has made me too sore and tired to want to get too wild.

One thing that is still bothering, though, are digestive problems. I've only been shitting once a day and it's not even a good shit. My diet has been fine, better than it has been in almost a year actually. Food's going in but hardly any poop is coming out and it's starting to agitate me. There's nothing more important to health than a good digestive system.

Last Sunday I went to Church. The pastor was speaking, and as I stood up, inspired and filled with uplifting inspiration, I felt an amazing sensation. I felt a deep peace growing withing my soul. My heart was beating hard, harder, even harder and faster as I embraced the feeling. I felt the anger and bitterness that I was carrying around for so long begin to have no weight me. The worries of the future became meaningless compared to the opportunities of the present. My loneliness began to feel like a time of glorious solitude healing. The emptiness I felt in me from my breakups, lost dreams, missed opportunities, began to be filled by a force that illuminated my thoughts. I broke down and started to cry, I raised my hands in the air, and felt a surge of energy travel from the back of my skull, down my spine, all the way to my heels. The pastor said he wanted those who needed a change in their life to come down so he can pray for us.

Many time I came to this Church and never stepped down. I wasn't ready to receive the blessings. I wasn't ready to change my life. I still wanted a life of extremes, of highs, of hedonism, of endlessly chasing pleasure and vanity, of revenge and violence and evil thoughts, a lawless lifestyle.

I stepped down to the altar and got ""Born Again"". I was atheist for a few years, but I realized after renouncing my religion, I became more and more sad over the years. I completely respect where atheists come from, it makes sense, but the concept of Meaningless Existence didn't sit well with my consciousness. I always felt there was something greater, whether I understand it or not, agree with it or not, hate it or not.

As I sat there with the Pastor speaking in the prayer room after service, I felt myself almost start to disappear from reality. The peace that was in my heart began to spread through my whole body and thoughts. I completely spaced out, unaware of anything around me. When I came to, the ushers were trying to escort me out because the service was over. I don't even remember what happened.

After I walked out that day I've felt like a different person. I feel like I have a choice. I feel like my mind has shifted, and I have found new patterns of thought, like walking through the woods and finding new trails to follow, or driving around a city and finding new ways to get where you're going. 

I'm ready to face that challenges that will continue to come up. I haven't had any cravings, but that doesn't mean I will. I want to remain humble, rooted, and vigilant of myself. I must commit no matter what happens. *The ships of the sea are driven my fierce and might waves but turned by such small oars* . I wish to stand strong and face the rising sun. There are so many new colors the world is showing me now that the clouds are fading away. The landscape may be rugged and rough, but its something REAL, I can actually get somewhere, I have the choice to do something with my life and not give up!!!

I know it's only been 10 days, and I know I must remain calm and vigilant. Other symptoms may or may not afflict me.

I want to start the NoFap challenge as well. For the 4 days I didn't fap while not smoking, I felt a lot better and I think that also contributed to having a better recovery. I had a 3-nut session last night and today I feel less motivated, tired, have weaker body language, and my balls don't feel as good.

Once my schedule gets more solid, I plan on going to meditation classes, and incorporating yoga into my weekly routine. Even 5 minutes of yoga, positive self-talk, and prayer in the morning has worked wonders for me. Try it!

-Not in PA
-Not above the arctic circle. I like warmth at least sometimes.
-Not in the 3rd world. I plan on doing engineers without borders type of stuff when I have some experience under my belt, but right now I feel like I would just be a pain to have to train."

I am sorry if this isn't the right place to post. I just want to talk to SOMEONE about this. I want SOMEBODY to give me a real, rational picture of how bleak my future REALLY is.


I am a second year Master's student in Electrical Engineering from a top 15 EE school in the US. 


My area of focus is signal processing. My GPA is 3.48/4. I have done courses in image processing, speech processing, optimization, linear algebra (and have TA'd the same course this year), adaptive filtering, pattern recognition and machine learning, estimation theory for comm and channel coding theory. 


I have had plenty of course projects in all these put together. I have also done some projects for my lab, all related to image processing. 


I have been applying to companies since summer, but I haven't had any success at all in finding a job or an internship. The problem, everyone says, is that I only have projects in MATLAB (no C/C++), and no hardware experience. 


Well, NO signal processing student I know in my uni uses C to code. Atleast in academia all of sigproc work is done in MATLAB. And I have not done any hardware because I was only interested in the math-related sigproc stuff. 


I have been applying to major communications and processor companies but haven't got any positive reply. 


Also, I am not a US citizen, so all my options in Defense companies are ruled out. 


I do not know what to do. I never thought liking a particular field in academics could actually be bad for me. I don't know what to do next! I do not want to be unemployed! If I was just not good enough, why did they accept me into the school? Was I accepted only for the extra non resident tuition that international students have to pay? What options do I even have after this? I am so clueless about my future, I have stopped enjoying every single think I used to love doing. I used to love doing crosswords and playing the piano and reading, now all of it hurts. I have even lost motivation to finish my Master's project; it just feels like another pointless exercise, given that the skills I am developing in the course of this project are not valued by the industry at all. 


Please, any help, any suggestions, just about anything would be much appreciated.

Any suggestions are appreciated. Thanks! In return:

Firstly, when I open this in word, it is one page long, mostly because I shrunk some margins and and lowered the font size a tad.

I have sent out a version of this resume to quite a few studios and companies in the Los Angeles area over the past year and a half or so, and so far I've only been able to get two interviews at an advertising company for an Account Coordinator position.  Both times at the same company, and neither time leading to a job, unfortunately.

I feel like it looks inadequate because I don't have any industry experience, and unfortunately an internship is not financially viable for me at the moment.

I just recently added the bit about Spanish and Japanese at the bottom, because I felt that it couldn't hurt my chances.  I ended up taking off a bit about my First Aid/CPR certification because I didn't have room for it and I didn't feel like it was very relevant.

What do you think?  Is there any hope for me?

Hey everyone, My name is Chris (24) (if you couldn't tell by the username) and I'm in a bit of a dilemma..

 My now-fiance (22) and I are getting married in June, we've been dating for about 2.5 years, we both love video games, guns, internetz, and anything that involves being a nerd.

Right now we're living with her parents because we moved down here on a whim that I would score a job at the local school district as an IT Technician.. well.. I didn't get the job, and I had left my previous job since it was about 70 miles away.

My fiance left her job also since we moved and is getting screwed by her unpaid internship.. she's filling a woman's spot at the city jailhouse as an UNPAID internship that THANKFULLY she gets college credits for. Sadly, her getting paid for that isn't looking good, as they're cutting the budget which isn't fair because she's doing EXACTLY what that woman did (and better).

After a few months of job hunting (and getting a job as a pc repairman/salesman at a popular office supply store), I decided that I wanted to join the Air Force, they'd give me the training I need, would help me start my family, and I over all just wanted to be a part of something BIG and serve my country. I've been training for about 2.5 months and have already lost 25 pounds, I've only got about 30-40 more to go before they'll actually enlist me.

To get to the point - I'd love to be able to take her to a place where we can both be happy, we've had a rough 6 months and it really won't get better until I get in the Air Force. I really want to take her to DisneyWorld and Universal Studios, and stay in a nice hotel. That's really all we ask.

Right now, my mom is helping to pay for some of the honeymoon, but I REALLY don't like her doing that. She works for FedEx driving 18-wheelers in a city environment and she works DAMN hard for her money. SHE deserves that money. My mom is the type of woman who would give me the shirt off her back if it meant I could sleep warm.

All I'm asking is a few dollars to help pay for this honeymoon. It would mean the WORLD to us!

I've been trying to think of ways to thank people for donations.. and I think I've got a Reddit-Solution.

For every donation 20 dollars or more, we will take a picture (not nudes :) ) of your choosing. Whether it's us kissing on a ride, me giving Mickey Mouse a high five, or shanking a mascot and blaming it on the janitor. We'll try our BEST to get every single picture  in. It should be fun!

I'm not sure what I need to do to prove to everyone that I'm not some scammer or douche trying to take people's money. I guess we can take pictures of us holding up a handwritten sign or something. She's sleeping and I'm about to go to bed (have to be at work..on a saturday.. at 8 ) so we can take them eventually. I'll give a link to some pictures of us in text form.

I'll use my PayPal address since it's Business Verified (I used to run my own Game Console Repair business) if anybody wants to throw a few dollars our way. But really any sort of donation will be **SO MUCH** appreciated!

Here's some pictures of us for now until we're both back together so we can take some verified pictures.

I have absolutely head over heals fallen in love with Shanghai even though I have never ever set foot there. I have several friends who went to do internships and they came back glowing with enthusiasm. Add documentaries and stunning imagery and I am sold. 

I was just wondering, I am head of new product development for a Dutch publishing company and if any of you know/want any publication done I would be VERY happy to talk. I specialize in what one might call ""Coffee-table books"" which are essentially big books with gorgeous photographs with the intent to inspire. 

So, if you know of any company that would want to do a company presentation like that, or indeed ANYTHING really as it is my job to come up with new and exciting ideas, PLEASE let me know so I can finally set foot in the city that seems to have captured the imagination of so many.

And also, damn you all for living there. So much jealousy. "
p0ens,63,2012-01-28,Night on the Rig,DenRiley,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/p0ens/night_on_the_rig/,"I can't keep this to myself anymore. I've always thought of myself as the most reasoned, rational, and sane person I know. I've never been swayed by anything that I can't verify for myself. That's why this story bothers me so much, and why I haven't told anyone about it, because I know what it sounds like, and what any rational person would think. So I'll see what you think.

Last summer I charmed my way into an internship for an oil company. As a tech student, I would be doing some computer maintenance/upgrade work for an offshore rig in the Gulf of Mexico, near the Texas coast. I was excited- the exciting and unique work environment was a far cry from the small town stores and offices I was used to. But quickly, the allure disappeared. The work was extremely dull, and the amusements to be found on an oil rig... well, fun was pretty rare. The industrial equipment and computers I worked on was in heavy use during the day, so I took to doing my work during the night, to avoid disturbing any of the regular crew.

Night on the rig was indescribably creepy. The hum and drones of machinery is always there, but during the day it's hardly noticeable among the regular activity of the crew. At night it was impossible for me to ignore. And although we were high enough above the waves so that you couldn't hear them, I could never forget that we were surrounded on every side by miles of ocean.

I digress, but I have to think the description is necessary for what happened to make any sense to me at all. One night, probably near midnight, I was wiping and restoring a group of workstations in a control room. It's mostly a set-and-forget job, so after I start the restore process, I turn to leave and take care of the next task.

Right before I reach the door, I hear a loud resounding clang, like some huge metal object impacting another. At the same time, I suddenly realize that all of the hum of the machines below had stopped- the entire rig was dead silent. I barely have time to wonder what the fuck is going on when the cabin lights cut off. For a split second, the room is lit only by the glow of the computer monitors, and in the brief dim light I saw something. A tall, human-like figure with elongated limbs, and hunched over heavily so that its arms seemed to scrape the floor. In that quick flash of monitor glow, I looked at it and I was quite sure it was looking back at me. Then, just as suddenly, the lights came back on and the room was completely empty. The thin hums and drones of machines rose up again around me, and they never felt so comforting.

As I've said, I'm a logical guy. At the time I shook this off easily, attributing it to the nerves of a strange and unfamiliar workplace and a bored, overactive imagination. But I was fooling myself. Some part of me has never doubted what I saw. And for every night I've dismissed what happened as impossible, I've had another night where I could see that thing again in my mind. And on those nights, I don't sleep."

Hey everyone, My name is Chris (24) (if you couldn't tell by the username) and I'm in a bit of a dilemma..

 My now-fiance (22) and I are getting married in June, we've been dating for about 2.5 years, we both love video games, guns, internetz, and anything that involves being a nerd.

Right now we're living with her parents because we moved down here on a whim that I would score a job at the local school district as an IT Technician.. well.. I didn't get the job, and I had left my previous job since it was about 70 miles away.

My fiance left her job also since we moved and is getting screwed by her unpaid internship.. she's filling a woman's spot at the city jailhouse as an UNPAID internship that THANKFULLY she gets college credits for. Sadly, her getting paid for that isn't looking good, as they're cutting the budget which isn't fair because she's doing EXACTLY what that woman did (and better).

After a few months of job hunting (and getting a job as a pc repairman/salesman at a popular office supply store), I decided that I wanted to join the Air Force, they'd give me the training I need, would help me start my family, and I over all just wanted to be a part of something BIG and serve my country. I've been training for about 2.5 months and have already lost 25 pounds, I've only got about 30-40 more to go before they'll actually enlist me.

To get to the point - I'd love to be able to take her to a place where we can both be happy, we've had a rough 6 months and it really won't get better until I get in the Air Force. I really want to take her to DisneyWorld and Universal Studios, and stay in a nice hotel. That's really all we ask.

Right now, my mom is helping to pay for some of the honeymoon, but I REALLY don't like her doing that. She works for FedEx driving 18-wheelers in a city environment and she works DAMN hard for her money. SHE deserves that money. My mom is the type of woman who would give me the shirt off her back if it meant I could sleep warm.

All I'm asking is a few dollars to help pay for this honeymoon. It would mean the WORLD to us!

I've been trying to think of ways to thank people for donations.. and I think I've got a Reddit-Solution.

For every donation 20 dollars or more, we will take a picture (not nudes :) ) of your choosing. Whether it's us kissing on a ride, me giving Mickey Mouse a high five, or shanking a mascot and blaming it on the janitor. We'll try our BEST to get every single picture  in. It should be fun!

I'm not sure what I need to do to prove to everyone that I'm not some scammer or douche trying to take people's money. I guess we can take pictures of us holding up a handwritten sign or something. She's sleeping and I'm about to go to bed (have to be at work..on a saturday.. at 8 ) so we can take them eventually. I'll give a link to some pictures of us in text form.

I'll use my PayPal address since it's Business Verified (I used to run my own Game Console Repair business) if anybody wants to throw a few dollars our way. But really any sort of donation will be **SO MUCH** appreciated!

Here's some pictures of us for now until we're both back together so we can take some verified pictures.

p02qu,3,2012-01-27,Opinions on my resume and portfolio?,Nadril,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/p02qu/opinions_on_my_resume_and_portfolio/,"Hey guys. I got some critique a couple of months ago and I've recently changed up a few things about my resume and am hoping to get some good critique again. I've also made a few fairly good changes to my portfolio as well.

[Resume Link](http://www.zackcerny.net/wp-content/themes/Zackblog/ZackCerny_Resume.pdf)  
[Portfolio](http://www.zackcerny.net)


**For the resume:**

* Is it fine putting my Portfolio design under experience? I just don't have a lot of job experience and I feel that describing the process a little bit behind my portfolio was a lot more useful. I know you usually put stuff in chronological order so I wasn't sure where I should put it. (I technically did it before my internship... but it's an ongoing thing with recent updates).

* Should you put hobbies on there? I've heard you want to so that you are memorable. However I don't want to put down stuff like ""Digital art"" and ""Gaming"" because I'm not sure how someone is going to take the later. I love gaming (and competitive gaming) but I'm worried about the bias that games are still just for kids. I also don't *just* want to have digital art on there, it seems a bit weird and obvious since I'm a graphic designer.

* Under technical skills... should I mention somewhere that I'm comfortable with both Mac and PC platforms? I didn't really have an area for it, as those aren't coding languages nor really ""software"". 

**Portfolio:**

* The front splash page, does it help catch your eye? I tried to make it explicitly clear that *I designed* the front image in my resume... I'm not sure if people will get that though. 

* I have a lot of different types of work in my portfolio section. Do you think this helps? Again I'm not sure if people understand that the landscapes are done in 3D by me (using [Terragen 2](http://planetside.co.uk/)) and I try and make it clear as much as possible.

* I've been doing some layouts on my own personal time, mostly just mock layouts to get better and to have extra web stuff to show on my portfolio. Right now I'm sticking with a [video game theme](http://www.zackcerny.net/wp-content/gallery/portfolio/doom2concept.png) because I think it lets me explore around a lot with different ideas... but should I just do some kind of ""standard"" business type layouts? 

Thanks for the help guys. I've been looking for some sort of web design/graphic design job for around 3 months now with no luck. I think a hard part is I'm looking outside of my state (there isn't shit here) so I feel I need to just have a really impressive resume and portfolio to be considered. "

The purpose of SchoolTipline is to give every school an anonymous tipline for students to send in tips on being bullied, suicide concerns, drugs, alcohol, etc. We want to keep schools safer! Two boys from a Utah high school were arrested today because one tip allowed police to find their elaborate plans to bomb the school during the assembly. 

In 2011 alone, SchoolTipline was placed in 400 schools in the nation, stopped 41 suicides, and 2 school shootings. Their foundation, the Safe to Talk Foundation, tries to raise funds so they can offer the Tipline service for free to schools. It costs a dollar per student, per year to have the service. Which isn't a lot to keep the school much safer. 

SchoolTipline is a small program though and we desperately need help in getting the word out. I write editorials and post daily news articles on what's going on in the world of education and school safety. We need parents to be aware of this program, and make sure their schools are providing it. 

Can RWB please ""like"" our FB pages? It's the only way we can turns this program into a nationally recognized program, and make sure every student has the opportunity of this being in their schools!

But I have absolutely no idea what I actually want to do. I have interests that range from music composition to database administration, from philosophy to combinatorics, from journalism to political science. My major is in mathematics because for the longest time I was dead set on going to grad school and becoming a professor, but in the last year or so that dream has died and a whole wide range of fields are in front of me; here I am with no idea what to choose.

I love analytics and problem solving (Otherwise I wouldn't be a math major, I suppose). I got my A+ Cert at 16 because I was in love with the idea of working with computers for the rest of my life, and my job right now is officially a student assistant for my university, but I'm building and managing databases in Access (Thus, I'm really good with VBA and have a little experience with MySQL) for the college. 

I'm minoring in statistics, and right now I'm kind of on an actuarial path. But I've heard horror stories of not being able to get into that field... and what if I really miss coding? Helping my friends with computer problems is still a pretty big joy in my life. I'm totally scrambled. My GPA is shit low, too (2.9), and that doesn't help me get internships. One thing I've thought about is becoming a Microsoft certified database admin, but are there jobs for database admins right now? Is that really a certification that people respect, or is it something that college students do when they have no real world experience?

Or try to make them happen now?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/p1wac/put_off_career_goals_or_try_to_make_them_happen/,"**Here’s my problem**: I’m a recent graduate who is unemployed and can’t secure a paying job in my field (one in a million, right?) So far I’ve done internships and freelancing on my own. My technical skills combined with my experience easily qualify me for the entry/junior level jobs I see posted in my field BUT the problem is none of these jobs are in my locality, they’re in New York and I live an hour outside of it.
 
Recruiters seem reluctant to hire an out-of-state candidate, as I’ve been applying like crazy and got only two interviews for all my efforts. One I didn’t get the job for because they went with another candidate and for the other I’m still on the fence.

Of course I have my parents, student loans, and a credit card to pay back too. I was able to put all but one of my loans in deferment till late summer/early fall and got the credit card company to hold off on my payments for a couple months at no additional cost or interest. Mom and dad are letting me stay at home for as long as I need to, but they have their own stuff to take care of and I feel guilty for tacking my bills onto their expenses.

**Here are my two ideas to resolve the problem**:

*Start using a friend/relative’s address on my resume, try to get interviews, tell HR ‘I’m relocating soon’ if they ask, and commute to work every day if I land a job.
(I think:  the most expensive to begin with, but should level out by mid-spring. By then I can probably sort out my finances for fall when all my loans go back into repayment. Plus, I’ll have the industry experience right off the bat.)

Or

*Take a retail or coffee job in my local area, save up money, move to New York, then start my career plans.
(I think:  the least expensive begin with, but will put off my experience for 7 mos. – 1.5 years, by which time my loans will all go back into repayment, will have to use the cash I save to pay them back plus current debts and relocation costs, etc. etc.)


Thoughts on which of these would be the better option? Or would you suggest I do something else entirely?

It's always been kind of understood between us that 'the move' would be made by me...I'm from, basically, the middle of nowhere, and she's from a pretty big area out West that I've grown to really like...it's a little busier than I'm comfortable with, but I've always felt I could get used to it in time.

Our relationship is 'good'. We've never had any major fights, except for her having occasional emotional breakdowns because of the distance. The trust is strong. We've been faithful and spent a lot of time with each other, thousands and thousands of hours talking on the phone, playing games, watching movies and tv, etc. I've always been a little more 'giving' with my time and attention in the relationship, aka I'm constantly editing papers for her, talking her to sleep, my sleeping schedule has been a wreck because I'm the one who has adjusted to West Coast time while living on the East Coast, etc. I'm also facing the fact right now that I've gone MIA and lost contact with a lot of friends because I've spent quite a bit of my time focused on keeping the relationship healthy. I don't want this to sound completely negative against my LDR, because I've allowed a lot of it to happen because I've seen myself slip into being quite a pushover at times.

Compatibility-wise, we get along well and have a good time when we're together. I've noticed in more recent visits that her emotions swing much more rapidly when I'm around, and I often find myself wishing I could leave halfway through a two-week visit but by the end of the visit we're happy and getting along.

I'm really passionate about sports, history, politics, etc, but it seems like whenever I bring these up with her, she falls asleep or changes the subject.

Biggest problem is...I've had trouble facing 'the move'. I've been looking for employment in her area for a long time now, and haven't really succeeded in anything besides an internship which allowed me to spend about 3 months near her. I have quite a bit of anxiety about moving across the country with tight funds and having to find my own place, because she's locked in to an apartment now for another 5 months or so. I'm close with my family at home as well, also, and I've always felt somewhat of a tug when even considering the big move. I'm becoming increasingly tight with money, especially with loans over my head, and she's completely the opposite and tends to be a free spender.

Ugh. I know this is rambling on and on, and I'm sorry for that but that's where my head is right now. Does anyone have any ideas or advice for me? We've just gone through a bit of a blow-up, and the ultimatum is pretty much on the table - if I don't move within in the next 3-4 weeks, the relationship is likely over. But is moving even something I should consider? I feel like I've cheated myself a little in the last 3+ years by losing what made me 'me' - my interests, my personal ambition, friends, etc - in favor of what's best for the relationship - and a lot of that is my fault. But is it worth ending a solid 3+ year relationship for the chance to start all over while I still have my youth?

p1h34,1,2012-01-29,Help building a complete plan from nothing?,[deleted],Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/p1h34/help_building_a_complete_plan_from_nothing/,"I've decided that I want to get in shape.  So far the theme of my semester is self-improvement in a stressful environment.  I'm going to school full-time (14 credit hours), have a campus job that I work 30 hours a week at, and an internship that allows me to work any hours from anywhere I can find an internet connection, i.e. home.  So needless to say, I have VERY little time to really enjoy myself, even on weekends.  

What I need help with is formulating a workout plan on this schedule of free time:
* Sunday: Can probably find free time
* Monday: About 30-45 minutes of free time
* Tuesday: Don't have to be on campus until noon, normally work, but can probably make time to work out
* Wednesday: About 30-45 minutes of free time
* Thursday: Don't have to be on campus until noon, normally work, but can probably make time to work out
* Friday: Free after 4.00pm
* Saturday: Normally work and do homework, but can probably find time to work out.

I don't like going to the gym, at all.  It makes me really uncomfortable, at least for now.  I'm thinking about getting some free weights (any suggestions on a good set?) so I can do this from home.  I just don't know many exercises, what to do in combination with what, how long I should spend, DIETING, etc.  Pretty much from the ground up here.  

If I had the time to really sit and research this I would happily do it, but I really don't.  I also have no idea where to begin and I want this to count.  Every year I try this, but this year I want it to really work.  I know this is a lot to ask, but I'd greatly appreciate any help anyone can give here.  Thanks!"

Unfortunately, I do not have anyone to talk to about how I should think about structuring the second half of my undergrad to best position myself coming out the other side. That's why I came here.

I've got a very solid GPA in and out of major and I'm involved in a relatively small research group (no experience required) right now. Coming in to college I had zero experience in CS so my body of knowledge is probably a bit smaller than your stereotypical CS kid.

Due to circumstances out of my control, this summer is not suitable for internships. It is too short for a full program and I am not going to take a quarter off, so I didn't apply when that time came around. 

My plan right now is to finish up the project I'm currently working on and search for some more serious research positions to buff my resume through the end of this year, the coming short summer, and my junior year. When the time comes to apply for next year's summer internships, I feel like I should have enough practical experience to make myself a worthwhile candidate. 

So that's my plan right now. I'd like to get some input from those who have been in my position though, because I feel like I'm way behind the game due to not being able to take an internship this summer and having a smaller pool of knowledge coming into college. Any insight would be much appreciated, thanks in advance!"
p1ecg,5,2012-01-29,Going in for an interview on Tuesday. What should I expect?,UnhappyHobo,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/p1ecg/going_in_for_an_interview_on_tuesday_what_should/,"So, this interview was really, seriously unexpected. I received a notice about a job through a mailing list at my school earlier this month, so I sent in my resume because it looked like a great opportunity, but I didn't really expect a response. Earlier this week they emailed me and asked for an interview. I'm not really panicking--I've been through interviews before and I know that being nervous doesn't help me any. But I haven't been through enough that I know what to expect from the interviewer. Each time has been a wholly different experience. But my biggest problem is and has always been asking questions. I can usually answer them just fine, but I'm really terrible at asking my own questions. I'm not sure why, I just seem to have to process the things they're saying a bit longer than the interview time-span. I also don't fully understand post-interview etiquette. My last interview didn't go very well, and the interviewer told me she'd call me whether they wanted me or not, so that I wouldn't be left wondering. She never called (it's been almost 2 months) and I never called or did anything because I thought I was supposed to be waiting to be contacted.

Anyway, here's a **tl;dr** list of questions for you:

* **What questions should I ask?**
* What questions might I expect?
* What should I do after the interview?

Also, it's for an IT internship position, if that helps any."

Should I wait till I apply to graduate school for the MAccy program and shoot for one during a spring semester (to which I could get credit for the internship)?

I made an account specifically to ask you folks some questions regarding the profession.  I could do a google search but I feel as if some of the questions may be better asked to people in the field.  

About me:  I have a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from a prestigious school.  After I graduated I worked for about two years as a Project Engineer before returning to graduate school to do a M.S. in Mechanical Engineering.  I'm now about to graduate this coming June with my masters degree.  Since I was an undergraduate I was interested in doing actuary but decided to pursue engineering.  Now I am strongly considering switching to try to pursue actuary as a career.  I feel comfortable that I would pass the math exams.  I looked at the sample questions and certainly feel that it's within reach.  In fact I just took a graduate level calculus based course in Probability and I still deal with a lot of calculus since I'm a graduate student.

Questions to you folks:

1.  Does having work experience in engineering (not related to actuary) help me at all if I want to switch fields?  In my role I was basically responsible for multiple projects at a time.  I was in charge of the design, materials, coordination, all the way through to being built.  Even after the customer received delivery I was still responsible if any problems occurred.  I had internship experience as an undergraduate but obviously related to engineering.

2.  I have a friend in the insurance industry and he's been trying to convince me to come on as an Agent to work with him.  It would be a commission based role so obviously this involves finding clients too.  Specifically he deals with life insurance and financial planning.  I would only consider this if I think it's useful.  Tell me Reddit, do you think this would be useful experience at all?"

p3k7e,3,2012-01-30,Academic/LDR woes,ldrthrowaway2342,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/p3k7e/academicldr_woes/,"I posted this late last night, but no one responded, so I figured I'd try again during daylight hours.

I'm 21f and SO is 22m. We've been together for a little over a year.

I go to an intensive liberal arts college on the east coast. He goes to a large research university in California, in the city affiliated with the suburb in which we both grew up. This semester I've been in our hometown working on a stellar paid, credited internship. I am renting a sublet studio about five miles away from his apartment. 

When I was first offered the internship I was ecstatic, not only for the opportunity but also for the fact that I would get to be significantly closer to him. Though I knew we wouldn't be living together, I'd hoped we would be spending a significant amount of time together, generally taking advantage of the fact that we haven't lived on the same coast for a while. 

We've handled the long distance great - nightly phone calls, sexy skype times, and an overall longing to be together. But now that we live so close, we barely see each other. He has a full course load and is working two high-stress jobs, whereas my internship only demands 40 hours a week. Over the last two weeks we have only seen each other a handful of times. 

I understand that he is incredibly busy and devoted to his studies. I don't want to be a source of distraction in terms of his academics, but at the same time, seeing each other only one or two times a week has left me feeling incredibly unwanted. This feeling is exacerbated by the fact that I don't really have friends in this town anymore - my good friends from high school all attend out-of-state universities, and the people I work with at my internship are significantly older (as in, completely uninterested in going to a bar after work or mingling with co-workers outside of the office). I have been spending a good deal of time with my family, which has been wonderful, but it's painful to explain to my mom that I have nothing to do outside of work because SO is busy.

The thing that keeps me going is the knowledge that I really do love this guy. I want to spend my life with him - he's genuinely the most intelligent, compassionate person I have ever met. I'm just wondering how to deal with the present frustration of conflicting schedules. I've told him I would be willing to meet him for coffee in-between classes on any given day if that's all the time he has, but he seems too busy even for that. Is there anything else I can be doing? Has anyone else been in a similar situation?"

I've dealt with various issues in my past, mostly as a teenager - severe depression, OCD, generalized anxiety, etc. I had a lot of help, took time off school, went part time, etc. I'm just now graduating college at age 23 and had been healthy for quite a while. I had grand plans to find an internship, take some classes, and apply to grad school in a field I'm very passionate about. Maybe find a job in between to save up some money. I'm very lucky in that my parents are willing to support me while I find my footing. I was really excited about this new stage of my life.


The problem is, a few months ago my OCD came back full force. There are days when the barrage of anxiety is 24/7. It's mostly mental (no real physical compulsions) so I become very disturbed, distractible, and sleep becomes more difficult. I know I would feel better if I had a set schedule and some responsibilities. But the OCD struck at the worst time - If I were employed I would have something to force me out of my head during the day. But I'm unemployed, and the prospect of finding a job and doing poorly is very daunting. I was so excited about my future, but now I greatly fear finding my dream job (in research/academics) and being unable to do well because of this crappy disorder. I'm trying to harden the fuck up and go for it anyway, I just desperately want to do well.


**TL;DR**: How do you guys deal with finding employment and staying employed while dealing with your anxiety? Does your job help your anxiety at all? How do you deal with employers? Basically... how the fuck do adults handle Real Life and a mental illness?"

Been mostly a lurker until now and my native language is not English, so I am sorry for my lack of coherence and possible mistakes :).
Okay, so me (23 M) and her (23 F) have been involved in a kind of tumultuous relationship over the past two and a half years. She is the first person I really every cared about in a deep way. We met at driver's school ed class and after that we continued to IM each other on the internets. She was kind of emotionally unstable at that point so I was trying to help her get over her problems, but it seems that I've set up a trap for myself. Four months go by and we start seeing that we feel for each other. It is worth mentioning that she had a boyfriend at that point(I was single), but still, she did not restrain in becoming very close to me and flirting in subtle ways. After a year of strange behavior I finally decided to go for one year to Germany for an internship, as an effort to get over her. After one month of staying in Germany I find out that she started to like my roommate of all people.. (via internet). I did not expect this from any of them both, and it was extremely painful when I would hear them skyping, and, almost always, I would go outside and walk it off. After a few weeks she 'broke-up' with my roommate. 
That Christmas I flew back home and met her, and had an awesome time together. I really thought things were going in the right direction. So I return to Germany only to find, two weeks later, that she got back together with my roommate. I was like 'what the fuck' and decided to completely remove her from my life. I worked out and was in great shape, buried myself in work and it felt awesome!. But it did not last, and when I returned home in August we got together again, for 2 months, and it was great while it lasted. But after she went to college the shit hit the fan again and worse this time.

She is a really unstable person, I dare to say. One day she would ignore my efforts to communicate with her, the next day (when I left her alone) she would complain that I ignore her, and act as the fucking victim, so on, so forth.. I haven't spoken with her at all for about two months, removed number from phone, unfriended her on Facebook, disabled my Facebook account for that matter.. and tried to direct my conscious thoughts towards my work as a student. I have come to the conclusion that a few moments of pleasure are not worth months and months of suffering and I have to find someone who is able to have a healthy
relationship, even though you’re in a world of pain sometimes.

All you heart-aching redditors out there, stay strong, time will heal your wounds.

TL;DR Girlfriend of 2.5 years kept making me feel like shit in a clockwork manner. I decided that she would suck me right back into that shitty state every time I tried to remain friends with her. so I removed her from my life, thus saying 'fuck no' to being 'just friends'. Was I wrong in doing so?

It's too irrelevant for the main sub, so it's being unloaded onto you instead (because this is the internet and I have to put it somewhere, jeez)

**TL;DR: Watch the video, foal. It'll save you from six pages of my life story**

[This video always makes me tear up alittle.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5ELT6aI8fg) But it's a good prelude. Because I think it personifies something I've noticed across my brony friends - we're human. We've fucked up, we have problems. Reading the current AskReddit post about losing respect for people makes you realize - at some point in your current existance, you found out the people you looked up to the most, like your parents or family, are failable. 

And that's the lead in to my cutie mark story. Rarity warning: lots of personal whining ahead. But that's what this sub is for, right? Right. 

I didn't have the best childhood, but it was okay. I never went hungry, I always had a roof over my head. Looking back, I could have treated my parents and teachers and people in general alittle better. I was alittle full of myself. But then again, my parents were too busy being disconnected to totally notice. They loved me individually - but they never really pushed me, or called me or on anything. Instead of pushing me harder in school, my school district claimed I had ADD and 'behavorial issues' because I punched a kid who bullied me for six months on end. I had to go to a school for 'trouble kids' for three years. I drifted through my town's medicore high-school and got a free ride to community college. I had a few friends, but things lacked a sense of meaning. It was alot of going through the motions, drinking too much, caring about material things. I wasn't fulfilled. I didn't fight for anything. 

That kind of hit a climax when I renovated my grandparent's old house close to a college town. It was a long 3 months and I feel like I had accomplished something. I had my friends live with me and tried not to charge them terribly much for rent. Unfortunately, friends don't always make the best roommates. I spent so much time surrounded by their problems, trying to make sure the house was running when they didn't give a shit, and things went downhill. I did terrible my first semester at Rutgers, I smoked way too much weed, I was pudgy and out of shape and lacked a social life. Not enough self confidence. This hit another climax on New Year's Eve 2010 when things were going so badly that I almost completely lost my shit and threw a trashcan through a wall after being unable to talk to a girl. 2010 was a shit year - the stress of moving and transferring and living on my own got to me. My parents getting divorced and my family having some issues got to me. The lack of a social life got to me. Failure got to me, and I found myself in a dark state of mind I never wish to go back to. 

Fast forward to 2011. It's Feburary. Things have gotten reasonably better, but I'm still living on my own and my friends were being shitty roommates. Constant fighting, blaring music on school nights, constant weed smoking. At a point I couldn't keep up and the town claimed their were too many people in the house and I was liable. Finally, I stood up for myself - I gave my friends a month notice and we went our seperate ways. We're still friends; but, I would not want to be roommates with them again. 

It's April and I'm home. Classes have gotten better - I emerged from my second semester with B's and A's. I even played hockey for alittle bit and browsed a few clubs. Things were getting better, but something still wasn't....there. 

I decided to go see a conselor in May after it rained for a week and I found myself sitting around the house doing not much of anything. My office job, while better looking on a resume, was boring and my coworker was a bitch. I still didn't have confidence in myself. After unloading my personal story to this gentleman, he pointed out the obvious. 

*You are not your parents. You are not your friends*. It doesn't matter if your parents fought for 20 years and their physical health wasn't good. It doesn't matter if your friends are more concerned with smoking weed and being in abusive relationships. Ultimately, it's your life. The only way to get better at life is to work at it. 

Shortly after that, I discovered My Little Pony. I found myself sitting for hours watching it. I also found myself emulating Twilight Sparkle and studying better. I finally got past my next-to-last math requirement. I found myself pushing in the gym harder, like Rainbow Dash. I found myself attempting to be kinder to others, like Fluttershy. 

A cutie mark isn't cut and dry. It symbolizes something bigger. Rarity's might be gemstones, sure - but that's not all there is to Rarity. She found something she loved, and she became damn good at it. I wanted to be as excited about my work as Rarity was about her own. I took a leap by going to Rutgers, and took another by deciding to major in Environmental Science &amp; Business instead of Marketing. I already knew how to advertise and write efficently; I wanted to learn something that made me special and fulfilled me. Instead of working a generic desk job, I wanted to use my business and marketing knowledge to fix the energy crisis, to help develop new fuels. I cared about the environment as well as turning a profit, a rare combonation on most college campuses. I'm applying for an internship at PSE&amp;G this summer - but even if I don't get it, I now have both scientific and business knowledge which make me employable. 

You don't have to have a clear cut talent. You just have to be passionate and willing to learn. Those things will take you further then any one talent alone. Anyone can pick up a book and learn to code software, but the innovators are the ones who are passionate and always looking to expand their knowledge. 

My social life also finally took off. On a whim, I went to September's Bronycon not knowing anyone. Five months and several trips to the city later, I find myself with a new hobby, a new passion and new friends. I spent New Year's Eve 2011 with some of the most generous, incredible people it's been my pleasure to meet, and all I could think about looking at the Manhattan skyline was how a year ago, I was in the darkest place possible, going through the motions and wondering why the fuck I even bothered doing anything. My friends who made shitty roommates are still my friends - but now I have a set of friends that share my passion, understand the importance of being kind and non-judgemental. 

My fellow bronies have been wonderful friends and personified what the show is really about. Bronycon 2012 was an amazing experience; and if you've seen all the crap I've posted; I'm trying to help make the June one even better. It feels absolutely amazing to be part of something bigger then yourself with such a positive message. I took a risk and put myself out their going to the September con. I could have wasted a train ride to New York and ended up disappointed. 

But, as they like to say at Rutgers, *without risk, there is no growth*. **You will fail at things**. But if there's anything the show has taught us, it's that when you do fail, your friends will be there to pick you back up. Even as an adult, you learn. You learn from your mistakes, from your successes. 

And just like Rarity the first time Hoity Toity came to town, you feel like shit. The lowest of the low, like a complete failure. I doubt anyone who claims they've never hit that point, for they must have one of the easiest lives possible. 

Then the rainboom comes. You go back to where you began and find yourself and realize what's important to you. You are a special person with things that make you as an individual completely different then the other six or seven billion people in existence, even if it's a single hair on your head or one life experience. The smaller difference still counts as a unique value. And you may never accomplish everything you hoped to - but it's better to try and fail then to sit on the couch and never try at all. 

[At your lowest point, you will see the rainboom and find your cutie mark. I promise you.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5ELT6aI8fg) There's people in the world who care about you. Never take that for granted. You will rise above, and find your place in the world.

I had a few friends, but things lacked a sense of meaning. It was alot of going through the motions, drinking too much, caring about material things. I wasn't fulfilled. I didn't fight for anything. 

That kind of hit a climax when I renovated my grandparent's old house close to a college town. It was a long 3 months and I feel like I had accomplished something. I had my friends live with me and tried not to charge them terribly much for rent. Unfortunately, friends don't always make the best roommates. I spent so much time surrounded by their problems, trying to make sure the house was running when they didn't give a shit, and things went downhill. I did terrible my first semester at Rutgers, I smoked way too much weed, I was pudgy and out of shape and lacked a social life. Not enough self confidence. This hit another climax on New Year's Eve 2010 when things were going so badly that I almost completely lost my shit and threw a trashcan through a wall after being unable to talk to a girl. 2010 was a shit year - the stress of moving and transferring and living on my own got to me. My parents getting divorced and my family having some issues got to me. The lack of a social life got to me. Failure got to me, and I found myself in a dark state of mind I never wish to go back to. 

Fast forward to 2011. It's Feburary. Things have gotten reasonably better, but I'm still living on my own and my friends were being shitty roommates. Constant fighting, blaring music on school nights, constant weed smoking. At a point I couldn't keep up and the town claimed their were too many people in the house and I was liable. Finally, I stood up for myself - I gave my friends a month notice and we went our seperate ways. We're still friends; but, I would not want to be roommates with them again. 

It's April and I'm home. Classes have gotten better - I emerged from my second semester with B's and A's. I even played hockey for alittle bit and browsed a few clubs. Things were getting better, but something still wasn't....there. 

I decided to go see a conselor in May after it rained for a week and I found myself sitting around the house doing not much of anything. My office job, while better looking on a resume, was boring and my coworker was a bitch. I still didn't have confidence in myself. After unloading my personal story to this gentleman, he pointed out the obvious. 

*You are not your parents. You are not your friends*. It doesn't matter if your parents fought for 20 years and their physical health wasn't good. It doesn't matter if your friends are more concerned with smoking weed and being in abusive relationships. Ultimately, it's your life. The only way to get better at life is to work at it. 

Shortly after that, I discovered My Little Pony. I found myself sitting for hours watching it. I also found myself emulating Twilight Sparkle and studying better. I finally got past my next-to-last math requirement. I found myself pushing in the gym harder, like Rainbow Dash. I found myself attempting to be kinder to others, like Fluttershy. 

A cutie mark isn't cut and dry. It symbolizes something bigger. Rarity's might be gemstones, sure - but that's not all there is to Rarity. She found something she loved, and she became damn good at it. I wanted to be as excited about my work as Rarity was about her own. I took a leap by going to Rutgers, and took another by deciding to major in Environmental Science &amp; Business instead of Marketing. I already knew how to advertise and write efficently; I wanted to learn something that made me special and fulfilled me. Instead of working a generic desk job, I wanted to use my business and marketing knowledge to fix the energy crisis, to help develop new fuels. I cared about the environment as well as turning a profit, a rare combonation on most college campuses. I'm applying for an internship at PSE&amp;G this summer - but even if I don't get it, I now have both scientific and business knowledge which make me employable. 

You don't have to have a clear cut talent. You just have to be passionate and willing to learn. Those things will take you further then any one talent alone. Anyone can pick up a book and learn to code software, but the innovators are the ones who are passionate and always looking to expand their knowledge. 

My social life also finally took off. On a whim, I went to September's Bronycon not knowing anyone. Five months and several trips to the city later, I find myself with a new hobby, a new passion and new friends. I spent New Year's Eve 2011 with some of the most generous, incredible people it's been my pleasure to meet, and all I could think about looking at the Manhattan skyline was how a year ago, I was in the darkest place possible, going through the motions and wondering why the fuck I even bothered doing anything. My friends who made shitty roommates are still my friends - but now I have a set of friends that share my passion, understand the importance of being kind and non-judgemental. 

My fellow bronies have been wonderful friends and personified what the show is really about. Bronycon 2012 was an amazing experience; and if you've seen all the crap I've posted; I'm trying to help make the June one even better. It feels absolutely amazing to be part of something bigger then yourself with such a positive message. I took a risk and put myself out their going to the September con. I could have wasted a train ride to New York and ended up disappointed. 

But, as they like to say at Rutgers, *without risk, there is no growth*. **You will fail at things**. But if there's anything the show has taught us, it's that when you do fail, your friends will be there to pick you back up. Even as an adult, you learn. You learn from your mistakes, from your successes. 

And just like Rarity the first time Hoity Toity came to town, you feel like shit. The lowest of the low, like a complete failure. I doubt anyone who claims they've never hit that point, for they must have one of the easiest lives possible. 

Then the rainboom comes. You go back to where you began and find yourself and realize what's important to you. You are a special person with things that make you as an individual completely different then the other six or seven billion people in existence, even if it's a single hair on your head or one life experience. The smaller difference still counts as a unique value. And you may never accomplish everything you hoped to - but it's better to try and fail then to sit on the couch and never try at all. 

[At your lowest point, you will see the rainboom and find your cutie mark. I promise you.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5ELT6aI8fg) There's people in the world who care about you. Never take that for granted. You will rise above, and find your place in the world. 

Thank you for reading my incredibly long-winded and unnecessary post, and excuse me while I get some tissues. "
p2nyx,1,2012-01-30,"LDR Plan, am I doing this right?",[deleted],LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/p2nyx/ldr_plan_am_i_doing_this_right/,"**Backround**
My GF and I are both 23. We met last year in April, and immediately hit it off. I'm not kidding, we were sleeping together on our second day. She had given me her key in the first week and we've shared a bed since. We just clicked. We still do. We argue from time to time like all couples, but we make up really well and really listen to each other. We want the same things in life. The sex is incredible. We approach problems from different directions and meet in the middle. It's a great relationship.

When we met, I still had 3 semesters left until I graduated. She had graduated and accepted a job where she knew she could be sent overseas. She warned me early on about it, and when 2 months in she found out and asked me to follow I couldn't pass it up. I skipped the fall semester, found a great internship in the same city, and spent an awesome six months with her. No regrets, greatest six months of my life.

Now I'm back home, and she's still there for another year and a half. I'm knocking out another semester of school and going back to live with her over the summer. She's got some training in the states in March, so I'll be seeing her very soon. She'll be spending vacation time here in April too.

**The Problem**
I talked to her about me just doing a full year in the states after that, and seeing her when she gets back. She told me she couldn't do that. A year alone and apart was not something she wanted.

I figure what I could do is attend school in the fall of 2012, skip Spring 2013, and graduate December 2013. We'd be 25 and she'd be done with her overseas post.

I've spent the last 5 years in and out of school, paying it for myself and living on my own since 18. I'm starting to feel a real pressure to push through and get my degree the closer I get. My parents are a part of my life again since about a year ago, and they're putting pressure on me too. But whats the big difference between graduating in a year vs two with the economy the way it is? Also, I can do another awesome internship overseas. My last one was the best resume fodder I've ever gotten.

I've made it clear to her if I do this plan, I'd be doubling down on ""US""  I told her she would have to know that I'd basically still be dependent on her while I'm overseas. That I'd really need a real commitment even though we both feel too young to marry.  She likes that plan way better than a year apart. 

I guess I'm asking for advice reddit. Am I doing this right? My father says not to do it that way and to prioritize my education. My gut says I've gotta be with her. (My gut also says my father regrets not ever being able to help, and wants to see me ""finish my education"" above all else) I'm worried I'm just playing this blind.

Trying to do it ""my way."" Usually it's been easy, because aside from a girlfriend I had for two years I've been a bit of a loner when making life decisions. I just plod and move forward. Now I'm playing a weird game.

TLDR - . Feeling pressure from my parents to finish school, but pressure from my girlfriend to be with her overseas. Came up with a plan to satisfy that, but still worried I'm compromising my life for everyone else."

Essentially, we are two students completely committed to our academics. I go to an intensive liberal arts college on the east coast, and he is double majoring at a school out here on the west coast, in the city affiliated with the suburb in which we both grew up. This semester I've been working on a stellar paid, credited internship in our hometown. When I was first offered the internship my first thought was how awesome it would be to hang out with him all the time - I'd already made an offer on a sublet studio apartment, so I knew I wouldn't be living with him, but I had certainly anticipated being around him quite a bit. 

This semester is proving to be a difficult one for him. He is a double major and works two jobs - he's a lab technician at his school and he also works at a local pizza place. Between a hefty course load and his work schedule, he only has time to see me once or twice a week.

This is perhaps the most frustrating thing our relationship has gone through. We have handled long distance just fine - nightly phone calls, sexy skype times, general mutual longing to be together. But now - now we live less than five miles apart and only get to see each other for a few hours each week. I've told him I'm willing to see him for even just a quick coffee between classes if that's all he has, but he has never followed through on my suggestions. 

I want to be with this guy. I really do. I want to be with him for the rest of my life. But I'm having a hard time coping with our conflicting schedules. Does anyone have any suggestions as to how to make this work?"

I interviewed for 17 jobs in my last work term alone. The number 30 is a rough approximation; regardless, I've had a lot of experience with resumes and interviews. Graduated from university 3 and a half years ago.

Also, yes, I am currently employed and doing very well. Again, I can provide verification if required.

I'm completing a M.S. in Supply Chain Engineering from Ga Tech.  I already have my MBA (GMAT Score was 640), although it is from a 2nd tier school.  My undergrad was in Accounting.  (So I'd be applying for an Associate position vs a BA)

I became interesting in management consulting through a classmate who did a summer internship for a MC firm.  I've gone to a few MC workshops as well, which gave a good overview of the industry.  I feel my skills and personality line up well with this type of work, as I love solving problems, have lots of legit leadership experience, and love serving clients/people.  

My question is, which comes first, the interview or the case study practice?  I ask because I see all these unbelievable people (Harvard MBAs, 700+ GMAT, etc) getting MBB/other consulting jobs, and I'm a little unsure if my ""credentials"" stack up to even get me in for an interview!  (Resume here if you care to look (personal info removed): http://imgur.com/X2gwz)

Maybe I'm overestimating others and underestimating myself, but I'd rather know the hard truth than go down a dead end road.  I'd hate to spend 100+ hours preparing for case interviews if it is a foregone conclusion that I'm not even ""qualified"" for an interview.  On the other side, if I do apply and somehow happen to get an interview, then I might not have enough time to learn the necessary case study skills!!  I've been trying to network with MC professionals through my school to get their opinion, but as you all know that is a slow process.  Any insights/advice you can offer would be a huge help.

Or charge ahead?,Cro1son12,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/p2a8v/put_my_plans_off_for_a_bit_or_charge_ahead/,"**Here’s my problem**: I’m a recent graduate who is unemployed and can’t secure a paying job in my field (one in a million, right?) So far I’ve done internships and freelancing on my own. My technical skills combined with my experience easily qualify me for the entry/junior level jobs I see posted in my field BUT the problem is none of these jobs are in my locality, they’re in New York and I live an hour outside of it.

Recruiters seem reluctant to hire an out-of-state candidate, as I’ve been applying like crazy and got only two interviews for all my efforts. One I didn’t get the job for because they went with another candidate and for the other I’m still on the fence.

Of course I have my parents, student loans, and a credit card to pay back too. I was able to put all but one of my loans in deferment till late summer/early fall and got the credit card company to hold off on my payments for a couple months at no additional cost or interest. Mom and dad are letting me stay at home for as long as I need to, but they have their own stuff to take care of and I feel guilty for tacking my bills onto their expenses.


**Here are two ideas I have to resolve the problem**:

* Start using a friend/relative’s address on my resume, try to get interviews, tell HR ‘I’m relocating soon’ if they ask, and commute to work every day if I land a job. (I think: the most expensive to begin with, but should level out by mid-spring. By then I can probably sort out my finances for fall when all my loans go back into repayment. Plus, I’ll have the industry experience right off the bat.)

Or

* Take a retail or coffee job in my local area, save up money, move to New York, then start my career plans. (I think: the least expensive begin with, but will put off my experience for 7 mos. – 1.5 years, by which time my loans will all go back into repayment, will have to use the cash I save to pay them back plus current debts and relocation costs, etc. etc.)


Thoughts on which of these would be the better option? Or would you suggest I do something else entirely?

Thanks!"
p29w5,5,2012-01-29,I think I've reached my breaking point - a healthful rant,werdunloaded,ForeverAlone,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/p29w5/i_think_ive_reached_my_breaking_point_a_healthful/,"Hey, everyone. If anyone has read any of my previous posts, I've been struggling with my current college. In short, it's my antithesis in pretty much every regard. 

Last weekend, I asked a friend's friend out and she rejected me. Fair enough. Yesterday I found out, via the mutual friend, that I've been de-friended in real life (but not on facebook...). They weren't going to tell me, but my friend's friends (I was part of their social circle) agreed that I can't hang out with them anymore. They were just going to awkwardly ignore me. I must have breached their trust or something, but as of yesterday, I've been disowned. My mutual friend told me it in the form of a side joke, but it kind of backfired. 

So here I was doing really well and I was in a good circle of friends who I thought had some maturity. In the end I get kicked out and blacklisted. I'm done. Done. Done. Done. I'm done with this immaturity, this need to belong to feel valuable, and this illusion that being in a constant challenge brings constant growth. Sure, I've learned a few nice skills here, but now I'm just falling apart. I've been attending this college for 5 months and it's already gotten to the point I'm getting physically ill from the tremendous stress (it's the collective stress of being here, not just recent events). I've always told people, ""The moment your (intangible) emotions start destroying your (tangible) body, you need to get the fuck out."" Well, I need to take my advice, or dramatically change the way I do things here. 

As of tomorrow, I'll be seeing a therapist for the first time in my life (I'm 21, almost 22). I can no longer do this alone, and I'm not comfortable opening up to my friends because I'm afraid of losing them, too. I've never lived an easy live; it's been a blessing, really, but this is fucking ridiculous. I really can't take it anymore. I'm not suicidal, just fed up.

**TL;DR: People at college suck, causes life to suck. Broken.**

On a brighter note, I've used my energy productively instead of wallowing in it all day, and I've decided I would enjoy Human Resources as my future long-term career. I've started looking for internships around my college and found one. I hope they get back to me soon.

Thanks for listening everyone. I know there are quite a few of these rants floating around this subreddit, but it really helps those of us who don't have this kind of outlet in real life. "

Currently I'm entering a 15 month paralegal program at CSU East Bay (which promises internships).

Here's my couple of questions for any of you currently working as a paralegal:

1. How realistic are my job opportunities once I finish the program?

2. Is the work worth doing?

3. More a question of insecurity: I'll be 33 by the time I would start. I just picture young kids doing the work. Are there like people in their 40s and 50s (60s?) who retire as paralegals?

4. Are there any opportunities for advancement?

5. Anything else you might like to add.

Thank any and all of you who respond. "
p529i,3,2012-01-31,Bellua (Original Short Story By Me) p.2 Metal,Anyun,shortstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/p529i/bellua_original_short_story_by_me_p2_metal/,"            My scalpel sliced neatly through, completing the first incision. As I gently lifted the flap of skin back, I admired the fragility and solidity of the skull. How could something so dull possibly reveal the beautiful secrets of the organ it housed? I stood aside as the secondary surgeon drilled through the skull. “Which hemisphere did you say I was supposed to remove?” I joked. One of the interns laughed too hard. Ass kisser. 
            “The hemispherectomy went well enough,” I told the parents. “If all goes well, little Tyler should be able to walk and talk a little in about a week.” The look of joy on the parents’ faces should have warmed my heart. Any other surgeon would have succumbed and allowed themselves a grin. I know how I’m supposed to act, and so I feigned a smile, then turned and returned to my office.
            I reviewed the logs and tape from the surgery, before packing it up and handing it to an intern to give to the dean. 
            As I drove home, I wondered if Noah had received the body. I thought back to when I first met Noah. The psycho had been at a bar, where I had only gone to have one drink before going home. He had started ranting about how he was going to burn the entire world down one day. The bartender then made the biggest mistake a bartender can make, and cut the poor bastard off. Noah then had started to bawl his eyes out, and started apologizing to thin air. Something about “why’d I help ‘em?”
            The bartender said he was going to call a taxi, but Noah had mumbled something about not having any cash. Before the bartender said anything else, I volunteered to take him home. That sentence seemed to aggravate Noah even more. “Fuck homes!” he had yelled. I asked him whether he had a place to stay. “Yeah, but that shithole’ll never be a fucking home” he growled. “Does this shithole have an address?” I remember saying.
            Over the course of the following week, Noah and I became closer. “So Doc,” he would say, “I got this fucking twinge in my neck, ya think ya could check it out?” I would gently remind his that I was a neurosurgeon.
            I discovered Noah’s “little secret” two weeks after the night in the bar. Noah had come to the hospital with a broken arm, and it was my day for clinic rounds. I remember sitting awkwardly in the room with Noah for a minute before Noah chuckled and said, “That file probably has it all in there right?” Seeing the confused look on my face, he said, “Why don’t I just tell ya, I’d rather ya hear it from me.”
            He then proceeded to tell me everything. About how he posed as a lawyer to seem normal, but how he was actually a murderer and an arsonist And about how he spent all his money on booze and accelerant. “Well actually, Bellua’s the murderer, I just burn shit,” he clarified. I had no idea who this “Bellua” was, but I didn’t care anymore. This was just too messed up. 
            Yes, technically I’m a murderer, but not to this psycho’s extent. I’ve only ever killed for other people’s benefit. There was the time I prescribed a double dosage of Luvox to a patient who I knew had been skimming money from the school district, and that other time when I had tampered with the drill before surgery to kill a corrupt judge on the table; but these had all been for the good of society. 
            I didn’t tell Noah any of this, I simply pretended he was joking, although I knew he wasn’t, and proceeded to call a nurse in to set his arm.
            Later, I called Noah and told him how I was a murderer too. I realized Noah had provided a golden opportunity to kill and not risk being caught at work. I proposed that I kill, and Noah dispose of the body’s. Noah agreed, and said that whenever I kill something, I should bring it to his house, and leave it somewhere no one else would see it, he would find it.
            This had been my first kill I was going to share with Noah. I had sliced a corrupt policeman across the throat, and let him bleed out on Noah lawn. Then, I covered the body with a hot tub cover, and left.

ME(30M) HER(21F)

Ok I'll start from lastnight.

I've been doing Standup comedy for a while now(about 10months) and have been seeing this girl (21) around one particular spot that I perform at.

Well we talk for a bit as I know one of her mates as he compares a night there, I gave  her my number over Facebook and  told to give me a call or TxT sometime .

So a day and half after that she sends me a txt,end up txting each other about 3 or 4 times a day for about 2 weeks and had 2 two hour phonecalls that felt like they went by in minutes ,til last night .

We met up for a coffee and talked for about an hour then headed to the spot where I perform ( we both know people there). Anyway I get talking to her and honestly I think she is amazing, she works at a expensive pub in central London,
she goes to Uni (and is in the top 5 students in her subjects) and also she interns at a prestigious law firm.
she's extremely well read and funny and clever. Her family are liberal caring and funny (she is also very pretty ,I think most of her guy friends have a crush on her) ,so her upbringing is pretty different from mine.
Well as you can see now I'm totally smitten with her but she really busy only gets one night to herself, I asked her when I would get to see her again and she said probably in two weeks.

 Now let me tell you about myself

When I was 5 I witnessed my father kicking the shit out of my mum ,it's pretty much affected my attude to violence, my father was a scary drink an could turn at the drop of a hat (not on his kids but adults)(also taught me how to handle drunk people). 
When my parents got divorced I would stay with my dad and his gf(who also happened to be my mums sister).between the ages of 6-10 I was sexually abuse by my dad(him touching me when he was drunk) and by an older cousin ( who I had to share a bed with,he would touch me too). I've never had a girlfriend and never had sex ( the closest I've come to sex was making out).I have suffered from depression for most of my life but most people never get to see that,they  me see laughing and cracking jokes all the time.

I think that we are different people who could compliment each other but I'm worried that with all my shit I would fuck everything up.
I'm not sure she even likes me like that, could be just be being nice.
Also could I ever be normal ? 

I mean have a caring loving relationship with someone who I can tell everything too,someone who would love me?
I want to believe that the answer is yes I can be loved and normal but when I get depressed I know that I will never be normal and never find someone who loves.

I often think about suicide but won't do it till my mum dies, and I'm smart enough to make it look like an accident.
So reddit this is the question,
Does this girl like me?
Can I find love and happiness?
How do you get over witnessing domestic abuse and child abuse?
Is life worth living?

Here's a little story

When I was 5 I started school,after the first week I was moved to a different class,I was given a letter to give to my parents explaining why I had to move class (I had trouble with my abc).

So now I'm constantly told by my dad ( who could be very intimidating),that I'm dumb and need to learn my abcs.
So at the weekend my mum drops my dad to work,as he's getting out he tells her ""make sure jestersidiot learns his abc"".
Now in the car my brother and I convince my mum to take us to the park,end up playing football then go home and watch some tv.

My dad gets in after work VIA the pub and see me in the living room watching tv and calls me over to the kitchen.dad is sitting at the kitchen table with my abc book while my mother is doing the washing up. 
Dad starts by making  me read it but due to me being intimidate by him and him being a pretty terrible teacher I start guessing what I'm supposed to be reading rather then actual reading.
So now he gets in to an argument with my mum about her taking me to the park instead of making sure I studying ,mum says to him that jestersidiot is a kid should have some fun.well the argument escalates to yelling and then he gets up out of his chair and starts beating her .
punches to the face ,grabbing her by the throat and throwing her to the ground ,still punching and kicking her.then he gets down on her and starts punching her in the face like she's a man.

while I'm standing there my older brother(7 at the time) walks over to see whats happening with my baby sister(who was 3 at the time)
stand at the door of the kitchen watching all this shit happen. While he's hitting her ,my mother is screaming for her mother till the day I die I'll never forgot that sound.he stops hitting her and moves me and my siblings to the living room where we watch tv,I make an excuses to go to the kitchen(to check on my mum) but she's not there ,instead I find her in the garden staring at the canal that runs past our house,that image still haunts me .

ABOUT ME
I am the darkest one in my family,so growing up I got all the dark/black jokes about my skin tone.I was constantly bullied by people(some times white or black but mainly southeast asians).
It didn't stop when I got home because that's when my brother would bully me.I pretty much wished I was dead everyday when I was a kid.funny thing is if people were to describe me back then they would probably say I was a class clown.
I recently told my mum,brother and sister about the abuse (just about my dad not my cousin). 

I've had to be there for a friend who has been diagnosed with liver damage so I've had to be there for him,telling him to be positive and what he can do(keep getting doctors opinions till he is satisfied,speaking to liver disease groups and ARM himself info about what going on with his liver). Also arranged for a party for him so people could see him.

I'm still fighting depression and so times its hard to get out of bed.
I drink too much and smoke ,eat the wrong shit.
I've been unemployed for a longtime and my CV looks like shit.
But sometimes I have hope.
The thing with this girl I spent so much time alone that, i cant believe that someone could even like me that.

Well I guess it doesn't matter now,I txted her but she never got back to me.
I think I came on too strong Nevermind plenty more fish that don't want my bait. Or maybe she's busy ,or more likely she saw right through me

Here's the thing It's not even about the girl It's about the fact in the firsttime in years someone like me and got to know me ,and now wants nothing too do with me because I'm a loser. I lose at life. Death would be better then knowing you on your own till your last breath never knowing love from a women."

If you're looking for a Marketing Coordinator / Associate Mktng. Coord / Copywriter / Social Media Coordinator who brings strong writing skills and a Master's to the table, look no further.

Most recently, I handled the social media accounts for a web startup that made last year's Inc. 500 list, as well as writing copy for every external communication they made, including press releases, site content, blogs, case studies, a Business Insider article, and email marketing. 

In addition, I consulted the startup's clients on marketing (on request) / best practices for increasing sales and managed workflow for five interns.

I have a Master's in Communications, I love well-done marketing, I'm passionate about writing and good social media practices, and - last but not least - I'm goofy, high-spirited, and easy to get along with.

I don't care where. I can move anytime
At least 15$/h
And I will pay the 300$ once I've been on the job for a month. I'll give you a predated check or whatever you prefer.

My experience:
I finish my trade course in land surveying in April 2011.
I work for 2 months as a team leader right out of school for the first company I worked for. I quit because the boss made me work with an intern and didn't want to pay me the salary that come with the responsibilities and when there was a mistake he would come and yell at me for 20 mins. Even after I told him I needed more experience and at least some people to help me around which there was none I was always answered by : I don't work on the field I can't help you.

After that got a seasonal job as an inspector for a subcontractor of Hydro-Québec. I finished my contract there and have to wait till the end of April for this job to start again. I inspected the wooden electrical post of Hydro-Québec all over Québec. The job consisted of inspecting, taking a gps position of the post and putting in a database all the equipment and what kind of wires was on it.

That being said, will it help me if I use DC or NYC, etc as a location for my profile?

* Additionally, a majority of my experience is in low end retail jobs, service industry type jobs, that I have no interest in. Should that be put on my linkedin? I don't want to leave/have a nearly barren profile devoid of much beyond one internship, and a small amount of college radio/paper exp.

Finally, as a separate issue, what is the best way to go about networking via Linkedin, finding the people in the fields I'm interested in? Forgive the questions if they are rather rote and not helpful, I'm fairly tech and media savvy, but I've never been great at figuring out Linkedin, for better or worse."

 I want to begin by saying i'm applying for an engineering internship with a NASA program. Recently, I became alarmed when I looked at my grades from a bad year during my College Sophomore year. I'm talking about a year where I failed one semester of classes which brought my GPA from a 3.2 to a 2.5. In reflection, I remember a time where i wasn't motivated to do work. I felt shitty when a CERTAIN event took place, and that affected my performance in school. After that incident, I took two years off from school to travel the world so i could forget. 



I signed up with a non-profit organization and helped with projects in different cities in Mexico, USA, and the Philippines. I lead many projects, and became involved with their communities. I loved every minute of it. I helped with engineering related tasks by building wood bridges, and fixing cars, and creating other mechanisms that helped the community, and building homes. At that moment, I reignited the engineer within me. So, I ended up finding all the books related to my major and studied outside of the classroom. I met wonderful teachers who didn't have credentials but were so fucking smart to understand the theories. I learned from them and developed my understanding in those areas. For two years, I traveled and studied. At the end of my travel, I realized that i needed to return to finish my duty as a student. So, I returned home to work as a tutor until i regained enough funds to pay for college again.



Now, i'm back in school. I'm fighting an uphill battle with my GPA. If anyone tells you employers don't look at your grades, they are right until you try finding internships in technical related fields. Anyway, I regret that one year with a passion. Most of the internships that i'm applying to require a 3.0GPA; I have the smarts, but i don't know how to get around this GPA business. What can I do or write that can give me an equal opportunity for a job/internship position? Employers what do you look for and what suggestions can you make for a person in my situation? "

They are putting me through like 4 prereqs before I can get into the the actual grad classes.  

If I take an internship this summer instead of going to school, it will set me back about a year in school, meaning I would graduate a year later.  Is this a good idea?  

Keeping in consideration that I have 2 years left and I have to finish my degree by 2013 or else I will lose a bunch of money because my funds will dry out.  

It is a weird situation that I don't feel like explaining, it has to do with a bunch of weird requirements for a scholarship I have and stubborn family members.  So is it worth it?  What would you guys suggest I do?  


tl;dr

Succeeding at getting an internship will result in me having to extend school for an additional year.  

Which also means that I will not graduate by 2013, and due to circumstances I will lose funding for school and possibly be out a few grand.  

Is it worth it to try and work an internship or just focus on school at the moment?  "

We met doing a college internship about a year ago, and we were inseparable from day one.

The thing is, she's pretty crazy and I should have ended it the first time I realized this.

She would have crazy mood swings over NOTHING, at one point physically assaulting me. (I don't mean like a slap, I mean full on punches)

But I let it slide, because she always got over it shortly.

We ended up moving in together about 6 months in (Because the internship was national, and we lived in different states, but wanted to stay together. I lived in Florida, where the internship was, but she lived in New York)

Thing was, she was supposed to have a job. Turns out, she didn't. I spent 2 months trying to pay for a $700 a month apartment on minimum wage working at Disney World and then Universal Studios. Didn't work. I had to move back in with my Dad, and she had to move back in with her parents in New York.

Fast forward a bit and I had come into a pretty good chunk of money. I spoke to her about it and toyed with the idea of me going to school in New York, since I wanted to study theatre, if I went to Ithaca College, she'd only be 40 minutes away.

She agreed, and so I went and was getting ready to enroll into IC. About 2 weeks into me moving to NY, about to sign a lease on an apartment, she told me I should go home and broke up with me. She told me she didn't need me anymore, since she was in school and doing well.

I. was. destroyed. She contacted all my family members and told them vicious lies about how I was stalking her and I had to do damage control about it while driving back to Florida, having been freshly dumped.


Two weeks later she calls me all teary, apologizing and wanting to get back together. You see where this is going.

I agreed to 'get back together' with her to see if I still felt any of what I did before, but I've realized that she just killed every emotion I had for her. I don't see her as anything more than a friend now, and not a very good one at that.


You don't have to say it. I know I'm an idiot, I know I'm a doormat, though even I didn't realize the extent until I just sat down here and wrote it.

I originally was writing this for advice on how to break up with her and not feel absolutely awful about it, but even just writing out the facts plain and simple helped enormously."

I emailed my adviser and the other professor that had sent in a reference form. My research adviser then emailed me her confirmation email from her reference form, so I know they got hers. I haven't gotten a reply from my other reference. I emailed the internship, asking if they could tell me which reference I'm missing a form for, but haven't gotten a reply.

I know they may have misplaced one, but my other reference is no longer affiliated with the university, so my greatest fear is that she just screwed me over.

p3vgo,4,2012-01-30,Basically my life story (long). In the mood for some cheering up.,kelustu,MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/p3vgo/basically_my_life_story_long_in_the_mood_for_some/,"Hrmm, where to start. I've lived in San Diego my entire life, go to a prestigious school in Boston (that isn't Harvard or MIT) and am currently working at a prestigious internship here in Boston as well.

That's about where the good part ends. So let's jump into some history real quick. My mother runs the only profitable (currently) of many market research arms of the largest advertising juggernaut in the world. My dad is a successful architect. I have one sister. My mom is generally flying and not home very often, but is wonderful. She calls every night when she's away, staying up to ungodly hours of the night to wait for me and my sister to get home from school to say hi. My dad never said a word to me beyond ""take out the trash"" on Mondays. We actually had a very poor relationship for a long period of time. 

So then let's just jump into the rest of it, no? This is going to end up being close to a life story; I'm going to begin with elementary school. In the interest of keeping this as short as possible, suffice it to say that after about 3 weeks of 8 hours of testing multiple times a week, it was determined that I was legally blind out of one of my eyes, and that they were unsure why. They've slowly figured out more and more over time, but still know nothing. I must have been about 8 at the time and was tested for brain cancer. I'm still given a yearly M.R.I. to test for brain tumors yearly and I'm desensitized to it.

I was born with an extra tooth between my baby tooth and my adult tooth (forgive me for not knowing the technical names) which had to be surgically removed in 5th grade. I then had a gap in my mouth, as it was one of my front teeth) for a year and a half, until they decided to surgically pull the tooth down. After realized that there was not enough room, they had to essentially pull my gums up and slap on some braces, which lasted 5 years, which were odd and awkward.

That's about the same time I started at a new school as well. I've always been an adult at heart, so add my social awkwardness to my medical conditions and you have a recipe for a pretty ostracized kid. In 7th grade, at one of my two best (and probably only) friends' bar mitzvah's, I had received a call from the other's dad that one of their three sons, the middle child, had committed suicide at college. This was my first experience with death and it cripples me to this day.

He was an incredible person. He was one of the best fencer's in the country, a well known tennis player in our state, was one of the top rated Starcraft: The Brood War players around, was great with technology and one of the sweetest people I ever knew. I can't even imagine what it was like for his family, but I know that I was pretty shocked. It was, and remains, one of two times in my life I've ever cried above the age of 8 (I'm generally emotionless). 

In the summer between 7th and 8th grades, after complaining about some shoulder pain for awhile and driving me home from my tennis lesson, my dads starts screaming in pain. The next few weeks are filled with expletives and the occasional ""JUST SHOOT ME I CAN'T TAKE IT."" That lasted for about 3 months. It was determined that he'd had a pinched nerve in his spine at about neck level. He spent another 2 months on vicadin everyday and never said a word. It was truly frightening, may I remind you that he was a very quiet person beforehand towards me, not my sister. So roughly 5 months after the pain started, he had surgery. He's now better, but will never be able to do the things he loves again, such as playing tennis and golf on the weekends.

Fast forward through what can best by described, for brevity's sake, as a horrendous few years through middle school, to 9th grade. I start at a high school that consists mostly of the same kids as my high school. 3 weeks into the school year I realize that a song has become popular around campus, by all students and some teachers; the lyrics of which go something along the line of ""Nobody cares about [kelustu], if he died, no one would care."" Repeat for 5 or 6 lines and you about got it.

Two months later, my grandfather is moved to a senior citizens home and my family goes to visit him. I'm a naive child and fake sick to get out of it. They visit again two months later when he becomes seriously ill and I'm genuinely sick this time and plead with my parents to go see him. They say no. Three days later he dies. I neglected to see him once in the previous year. The only other time in my life above the age of 8 that I've cried. I'll never forgive myself.

A few weeks beforehand, my parents had bought a golden retriever. He was legitimately the greatest pet alive. He was outrageously sweet, adorable and essentially a walking carpet. I love him more than anything else alive outside of my direct family, but even then it's close.

10th grade: My mom was diagnosed with breast cancer. She immediately went into surgery and began chemotherapy. She spent 4 months in bed, occasionally throwing up, but never leaving her bed upstairs. The woman that would stay up to 5 in the morning in Hong Kong to call me and my sister whenever she was there. She could not even utter a ""goodbye"" on our way to school in the morning. Her chemo sessions were every two weeks and the only I saw of her outside of her room was my dad taking her to chemo, with her in tears over the pain she knew she would be in for two weeks. She pulled through and is now healthy and back to running her company successfully. 

Weeks after my mom is done with chemotherapy, around December of 10th grade, my dad's Arrhythmia (abnormal heartbeat) begins to flare up. He spends 3 weeks in the hospital and undergoes surgery to electrically shock and kill some of his heart cells. It doesn't work the first time so they do it again. His life-expectancy is reduced by about 5 years because of these procedures, but his Arrhythmia is cured, which could have been much more severe.

Now then, go forward 5 months. My birthday is near the end of May, a week before finals. The day before my last final (English) it starts hailing, movie foreshadow style. My dog has always been afraid of any kind of weather, so we assumed nothing of it, but had been refusing to eat for a day. He's done this before, so again, we thought nothing of it. That night, we realize that he's very slow moving and looks physically weak. We can also notice that the way he looks at us was worrying. I spent the night on the floor of my entry way with his head in my lap just petting him. When I woke up, my mom had taken him to the vet, and I went to take my final. The vet, who we'd called the night before, said it would be no problem to wait a few hours, it was probably just some stomach bug or something he'd eaten.

I come back from my final to my mom in tears. ""where's Jack?"" ""How *over tears* was your English final?"" ""Good, where's Jack?"" ""I'm so proud of you *crying*"" ""Great, where's Jack"" ""I'm so sorry.""

The vet said he'd had heart cancer and it had burst the night before and he was gone in the morning, there was nothing they could have done even if we got him in on time. They assured that he died painlessly and peacefully. I was beyond shocked and sad and I didn't even cry, but it is by far the saddest moment of my life. I would give almost anything in this world to have him back. We have another dog now who's also great, but I can't help but feel guilty because I just can't bring myself to love him as much.

Now back to my eye disorder. There have been steady updates over time, but still nothing really conclusive or substantial. I'm in at least one medical journal for the shear oddity, and for those science-knowledgeable of you out there I will explain it as best I can. I was born with some scarring in my retinal tissue; I have abnormal vascular fluid; the veins in my eye are ""corkscrewed"" and there is a cloud of ""dust"" that's actually visible without any form of magnification if you simply get close (I can see it standing close enough to a mirror) in my pupil. It's obviously tiny without magnification. We find out in about 11th grade that my eye is actually hemorrhaging slowly over time, by popping blood vessels as a result of the twisted veins. The doctors now believe that I will have a stroke and it's only a matter of when. 

I mentioned that I'm generally emotionless, but I hide it very well. I can be sociable and no one will notice. In fact, no one has. Underlying that lack of emotion, though, there's a sort of overlaying sense of depression. I've been depressed for about 6 years, think about death or suicide usually once a day (never about acting on it, however, just how I would do it). 

So where to end up this horribly edited/ramble post here? Well, I guess where we started. My birthday is in May, as stated somewhere in the ramblings above, but I would prefer not to say how old, specifically (20s). I've been single my entire life and have basically given up/accepted it at this point. I'm having an incredibly shitty day and if one of you amazing people could somehow make it through this ungodly post and MMFB in any small way, I would be forever grateful. 

There's no real TLDR that I can post, as it would be almost as long as the original post, other than maybe the title. At the very least, thank you for letting me vent, and for reading whatever you end up reading. Have a great night/day."

Life could be better. I'd love for people to share how their lives seemed desperate at one point in your life, and what you've gotten out of it, or anchored yourself onto to see things in an optimistic manner (or maybe I can suggest something for you to anchor yourself onto). 

I'll start.

I graduated from a top 35 university and I graduated in May and I've maxed out my card to maintain a 9 to 6/7 internship 5 days a week for zero pay and I quit after I wasn't offered a job even though I was constantly praised for my work, because they decided at the end that they're not hiring. I commute 4.5 hours a day via subway + train + car (my mother picking me up/dropping me off).

I'll be working part time in PR ($10 an hour for 2 days per week), the industry my internship was in but I'm planning on taking a job at a coffee shop or banana republic, which I've avoided doing because I felt like I'll be pigeonholed into selling clothes despite my extensive internships at large publications and startup experience (which i thought would amount to something after graduation). Now I don't really have much of a choice.

My mom is barely scraping by with a 20 grand medical bill because of a severe mouth infection, which adds onto her supporting a college student and myself on a 45k salary, which goes into paying off my own debt, not to mention my 30k student loans in the meantime. I did take a freelancing gig but it pays next to nothing. Since my job prospects went out the window, I have no choice but resort to a retail job (if they even hire me).

My long time girlfriend is leaving the country for work, not to mention I just bumped my girlfriend's parent's car today into a taxi, which stopped abruptly. My girlfriend's parents have insurance but I may have to pay for some out of pocket which may amount to ~3k in damages (estimate since it happened today). 

I don't have any insurance. 

I already want 2013 to come, but in the meantime, I'm working on my own startup and have another that I'm currently brainstorming.

Also, if you need recommendations on cheap eats (I survived on dollar pizzas and chicken and rice in nyc), advice on working for free (I've never been paid during an internship -- you'd be surprised at how many large companies offer ""for-credit"" only internships, working on a startup, college life, the reality of public relations, or others, ask away.

I have a interview for an internship as a developer at one of the major banks and just wondered from experience what kind of technical questions are normally asked in interviews? and is there anything any of you would recommend me to read up on, like what kind of libraries are in use in the banking sector and even just industry itself?"

Could I get some feedback again please? =)

*note: I'm aware that everything should be formatted on the opposite side. For some reason my computer reverses everything when it transfers, no idea why it does this.


**EDIT:** Could I also get some feedback on my ""Statement of Intent?"":

In a short paragraph, explain what it is you hope to gain from an internship and why you should be included in the program:

I am applying for an internship because I would like to further develop the skills that I need to establish a career in the human/social services sector. I have a strong commitment and a passion for supporting marginalized individuals and challenging oppressive ideologies. As much as I would love to continue doing unpaid volunteer work for the rest of my life, the reality is that I need to be able to support myself and earn a career if I want to continue helping others. I should be included in this program because I have already developed foundational skills through my work and volunteer experience such as building rapport, communicating ideas effectively, and obtaining measurable goals and my experience and commitment to anti-oppressive work would be an asset for any non-profit. I am hoping to further develop these skills while also working for an organization that embraces the same dedication I have to raising awareness of structural inequity and working to alleviate such inequality.

p3rxm,7,2012-01-30,Summer Funding for Internships,DCtoATX,UTAustin,https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/p3rxm/summer_funding_for_internships/,"Hey UTAustin - 

I'm currently a graduate student at UT and have been able to secure a great internship over the summer but it is unpaid. My specific program will offer a small stipend for unpaid internships but it will not be enough to cover expenses while I am out of state. I've emailed the graduate school office but wanted to know if anyone knows about any other type of funding that I can apply for. 

Does anyone know where I should look? I may have to pass on this internship if I cannot find funding! :("
p3rj4,1,2012-01-30,College undegrad summer internship advice,Synroc,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/p3rj4/college_undegrad_summer_internship_advice/,"Hi everyone,
I/m a second year undergrad student at one of the US's top 10 schools. Since I'm a sophomore, and since most summer internships in finance are for juniors, I was wondering if anyone had some advice as to where I could apply, what I should do, or what should I do instead during the summer? I am still undecided between sales&amp;trading (foreign exchange which I did last summer) or investment banking (advisory or credit). 

I will provide with more information if needed. I have applied to most bulge bracket investment banks already, and a couple of prestigious boutique sized investment banks, but the chances seem pretty slim.
