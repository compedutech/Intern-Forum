Today, she did this.",furbyhooker,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/k1tvc/im_one_of_those_girls_that_doesnt_have_a_good/,"My mother and I have never been the best of friends. I remind her too much of my biological father, she is a hardcore control freak, we blame each other for a lot of shit that has gone wrong in our lives, etc. Basically, we have a very toxic relationship. A lot of things blew up this summer and we went from just walking on eggshells to screaming and fighting and whatever contact (which wasn't a lot) we had was extremely hostile. 

College has been a huge source of fighting for us. I've never felt like she supported my decision to go (I'm the first to do so in the family), and she never took an interest in what I was doing; I've never been completely devastated about her lack of understanding, but there are times when it hurts and I wish she'd be more supportive or encouraging. Today, when I felt calm enough, I called her up out of the blue and told her about an internship I got. Now, this is my DREAM internship. It was exactly what I wanted, and I'm really happy about it. When I called her, her phone had a horrible signal and it cut off so she didn't say anything.

I checked my Facebook an hour later, and on hers, she posted [this status](http://i.imgur.com/awUEr.jpg) about it and I was kind of caught off guard. Then I just started crying like a baby. Like I said before, I don't need her validation, but it was definitely nice to see that she realizes how hard I've been working my ass off and that she was proud of me. So, for those who have less than perfect relationships with family, remember that there can be good moments, and when they do happen, they feel awesome. 

**TL;DR**- Me and my mom don't get along, I get an internship, mom says how proud she is of me, I cry like a baby. Fin."

I'd like to hear what Wikipedia won't tell me, how it's like to live where you live.
For instance I love it when it's easy and very common to go around by bike, with few cars.
Proximity with natural landscapes, mountains, seas, lakes, etc is also really much enjoyed. I like the cold weather as long as it's dry too.

How do people see foreigners, and is it possible to lead a pretty seamless social life ? Feel free to report about your own experience of your city, youth life, activities, sightseeing, etc. Also, how hard is your language to learn, knowing French, English and German ?

Consider as well that I first need to find a internship in IT research, embedded systems, or automation engineering. As such can I expect a wage sufficient to fully support myself there ? And are placements seen as part of a career plan or a single mission by itself ? I'd appreciate any tip on how to find it."

Oink was a generous little piggy. He was so generous, that he would share his ration of slop with all the other pigs! Now normally runts like Oink get picked on by the big fat pigs, but not Oink. He was quite popular with his peers.

One day, Farmer Ferrel came on by and put all the pigs in a big truck and drove far, far away.

This is where they met Monopoly-Pringle-Face man, who was obviously a wealthy individual. Mr. MonoPringFace looked at every pig individually, and nodded his approval. Upon his nod, a 40-year-old intern would shoot it right in the face with the hydraulic tool used in No Country for Old Men.

Oink didn't get a nod of approval, and had to go back to the farm.

That is why you should share, bitches."

* Have a Canon SX20 IS; the zoom is very nice but I find myself not using the full range often, and the pictures aren't as sharp as I would like.  


* Got an internship, so I figured I could splurge a bit on a dSLR and some nice glass when it's finished (mid-December)

* Saw a video on the difference between (cheap glass/expensive camera) and (expensive glass/cheap camera), figured ""oh it can't be *that* expensive"", and wound up looking at a $1500 lens which is significantly out of my price range

Would any of you all have advice for high-quality yet ""inexpensive"" lenses (say, &lt;$650)? I tend to do mostly scenery/landscape photography, with occasional high-speed or low-light photography.

I would probably buy one of those (think it was 50mm  f/1.8) lenses too, since I've heard a lot of good things about their quality.

Also, I'm undecided about the body brand - I like my Canon's design and layout, but my dad use to have a Nikon SLR that lasted decades. I hope this doesn't incite a battle of the brands, but for long-term use, what would you suggest for a body?

Thanks for all your help. Most of the time I go with specs to make my buying decisions, but it's kinda hard to do that with a lens when there's a lot more to performance than that...

EDIT: Many thanks to av4rice for pointing me towards KEH.com and B&amp;H, with their used section. I was looking through it, and it would be just within my budget to get a older camera and a piece of very nice glass (all used). I'm not against buying used, as long as I can still return it if there's a problem!"

k1ded,7,2011-09-01,Just need some advice for a confused girl,throw_away400100,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/k1ded/just_need_some_advice_for_a_confused_girl/,"Throwaway because I have friends and fam on here! Need an outside perspective from the smart people of reddit… sorry if it’s long I just really need some advice.

I (21,f) have been talking to this man (30) since about the beginning of June. I am interning at the office he works at. Since the first time we met I just felt an instant connection with him, and in the first couple of weeks of seeing each other around at work he asked me to grab a couple beers with him after work one day. Since that first time grabbing drinks, we have texted everyday after work (usually all night, and occasionally talk on the phone but I’m not much of a phone person it’s kind of a stretch that we text so much) and see each other usually everyday at work when we’re not extremely busy. We constantly flirt with each other, we hang out about once a week (we both ask each other to hang out) and we constantly discuss our sexual attraction to each other. 

So the problem… In my mind I have been sending pretty clear signals to him that I am in to him, but I’m sure that is not in fact the case because everyone always thinks their actions are clear. I have tried telling him that I am very interested in him (he already knows I’m interested in him sexually) but every time I bring it up he says ‘well you're definitely not too young for me, but why would you want to be with someone who is 30 and already settled in when you have so many goals you want to achieve after you graduate college’ (which will be in the spring of 2012). My response to that (this was about a month ago) was that it does kind of freak me out that he’s 30 but that you can’t help who you’re interested in and if it’s right then everything else will always work itself out. We haven’t talked about it since, but we still act very flirty with each other and discuss our sexual tension. I was tentatively planning on telling him exactly how I felt once my internship was over (he could get in a lot of trouble dating an intern), I never like to plan things out so I just assumed we’d make dinner one night and I would just come out and tell him, very go with the flow type thing. 

Now the real kicker… yesterday I overheard him telling one of our coworkers that he asked her niece out (who our coworker’s been trying to set him up with all summer and he told me about it a month or 2 ago and said he had no interest in asking her out). Then he told me about the date he is going on when we went out to lunch yesterday because it was obvious I had overheard and after work I texted him and told him that I think about him constantly and really just want to get it on with him, and his response was “So when are you going to make a move then?” Do you think I waited too long to tell him how I really feel or do you think I just misread all his signals he was sending me and he actually wasn’t in to me in the first place? My fellow interns and I all got the distinct impression that he was very interested in me, he would go out of his way to ask me to hang out, go out of his way to call and text me, and was overly flirtatious and touchy-feely with me. We have very deep conversations and tell each other things that we wouldn’t tell just anyone. Guys don’t just do that with girls who are friendzoned, do they? I wouldn’t say I’m the most gorgeous girl in the whole world, but I’m definitely attractive with a decent body, have a love for life and I’m pretty laid back and relaxed… I just don’t understand why he would lead me on like that or what it even means that he asked someone else out on a date. 

Sorry if this makes me sound so immature I just have never been involved with anyone who is older than me and don’t know how their mindset works. Another thing that might be a helpful detail… He’s divorced and his wife cheated on him so I think he has some insecurities. I know I wrote a novel already but if you need anymore details I'll be happy to share them. 


UPDATE!!!: well I texted him after work and told him to have fun on his date and that I wish he were taking me on a date instead so we could have a little fun after ;). that text sparked ""the talk"" and it turns out he does feel the same way as I do but didn't have the guts to tell me. Thank you so much reddit for giving me the confidence to make the first move, I have never done that before. Now we are going out on a real date in the near future!!  Your advice was so amazing.

What is going through her mind?? ",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/k155r/i_had_a_one_night_stand_and_now_my_best_friend/,"Background: I knew her (K) for over 3 years. Been infatuated with her ever since. Back then I was this plump kid who everybody liked as a friend, nothing more. I didn't stand a chance with her. I then left for student exchange in Europe, slimmed down, got ripped, became suave, learnt some culture, and overall better rounded individual. I still am pretty much the same guy I was in the past (not arrogant, still warm and caring), I just became wiser, and a little bit more cultured. 
Fast forward 1 year, and I'm back. I start dating, start sleeping around. While all the women I've dated are fantastic, warm, caring human beings, I never managed to recreate the feelings I had for K. I still am infatuated with her. We hung out a bit, worked on a few college projects together, but she never seemed to return my affections; always reacting platonically. I did tell her eventually that I really liked her, but she said she didn't have any similar feelings for me. So I got over it. Went back, and got on with life. THEN. I leave for another country on an internship program. Guess what? She got onto the same program. So here we are, best friends in a foreign country, and a foreign culture. It was weird for me, (I still have the same strong feelings for her); and for her it was her first time alone out of her home country. Then, things got interesting. We started flirting, (but she'd always deny loving me back), but we'd flirt anyway. When I was away, my other program-mates (other people who came on the same program) would tell me that she always seemed irritable, sad, or lonely when I wasn't around. I didn't know what to make of it, so I decided to just go with the flow, and not make any conclusions. Then one night, after a few drinks, we made out. Heavily. She later told me it was the best kiss she ever had (she's a virgin, limited experience but easily aroused). We met up couple of days later, made out again, but it wasn't with the same intensity. It felt like she was holding back or something. So I put it down to just general horniness associated with alcohol and went on with life. A week later, I'm at a beach bar, and I met this amazing woman. She was beautiful, charming, a very witty conversationalist. We hit it off immediately. She challenged me to skinny dip in the sea, and we eventually made love in the ocean. Went back to my apartment for another marathon session, and broke the bed. Couple of days later, K drops by, and remarks on the broken bed. She jokingly says that I ""must have had a marathon sex session"" to which I evasively reply. She picks up on it immediately, and grills me about it. I thought she thought of me as a platonic friend, so I went ahead and told her. She seemed pissed. Then said she'll talk to me later. I asked her ""what's wrong? Are you upset?"" She said, ""its not fair that you're getting so much action and I'm not."" 

BG: She openly drools over hot guys, and tells me so. She's quite hot blooded, (which is incredibly hot to me) but due to her conservative family doesn't get much opportunity to get out and date. My guess is that she wants to use this opportunity away from her family to explore as much as she can. 

TL;DR: I'm infatuated with my best friend; she is not at first. We go on student exchange, get drunk, make out, but not much after that. I have a one night stand, she finds out, gets mad. What the heck is going through her mind? "

k2nsd,24,2011-09-02,"Jobbit, I'm so confused...  What was I supposed to learn from this? ",confusedexintern,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/k2nsd/jobbit_im_so_confused_what_was_i_supposed_to/,"Sorry, I know this is a long post.  Please bear with me...

For the past 3 months, I have been interning for Company 1.  They make household products (this is an important detail).  I've been looking for a full-time job the whole time, and my supervisors knew this.  Company 1 had an opening that I applied to, and they interviewed me for this position.  It took over a month to interview internally as they scheduled me in for a total of 8 interviews before they gave me an offer last Friday.

During the interview process, I applied to other jobs and landed an interview with Company 2.  They make consumer electronics.  They asked me to come in this past Tuesday for an interview.  So, when Company 1 gave me an offer, I asked them if they could wait until Tuesday for an answer as I had another interview coming up.

At the interview, I found out that the hiring manager for Company 2 is an ex-VP from Company 1.  I thought it was neat because it gave us something to talk about.  It took one interview for Company 2 to decide that they wanted to give me an offer.  I had been mulling over Company 1 and Company 2 for awhile, so I knew when Company 2 offered me the job that I wanted it because it fits with my career goals better than the role at Company 1.

So, I told the HR manager, hiring manager, and my supervisor at Company 1 that I had decided to go with Company 2 and that I would be working with the ex-VP.  I told them this at the end of the day on Tuesday because I knew they needed to move forward with their back up candidate.

Well, I got a phone call today saying that yesterday was my last day with Company 1 because they did not feel comfortable with me there.  My internship is supposed to end next week.  They told me the reason was because:

* 1) I am going to go work for a competitor and I signed a non-compete agreement.  I was shocked because I had no idea they were competitors... household products vs. consumer electronics?  Am I missing something?

* 2) They told me I should have been more forthcoming with them about my other interview, especially since I was an internal candidate.  They did not appreciate that I told them about the interview until after the offer.  I also think I'm missing something here... I always assumed that you didn't need to tell an interviewer that you have other interviews until you get an offer?

Anyway, I'm supposed to go in later today to go collect my belongings and turn in my time sheet.  I apologized on the phone because I had no idea they were competitors and the HR manager essentially told me to chalk this up as a learning experience.  But... I don't get it.  What was I supposed to learn?  All the people I talked to at Company 1 didn't know Company 2 was a competitor either.  What good would have come if I was more upfront about my other interviews?

Is there something I'm missing here?

**tl;dr I was told that my internship was being terminated 3 days before my true end date.  They told me to take it as a learning experience because I'm going to work for a competitor, even though they don't compete in the same product lines or market.  What am I supposed to be learning??**"

Any advice is very welcome.",pretendtofly,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/k2ipb/hi_im_new_here_heres_my_story_any_advice_is_very/,"I just turned 21 last month, I'm 5'9"", 200 lbs. and a girl. This is the penultimate semester of my senior year, but I'm not going back up to school. I'm doing a program with totally new people. It starts the first week of October, so basically I have 4 good weeks with losing weight as my focus. My summer job has ended, and I have no major plans other than cleaning/repainting/reflooring my bedroom.

I've been able to make friends being the size that I am, but I'd really like to be a lot more confident, especially around the guys (I've never had a boyfriend, and I don't have many guy friends). After 6 weeks together we will be getting on a research sailboat and sailing for another 6 weeks (studying the ocean). I'm really excited but by that point I'd really like to be at least a semblance of ""in-shape"".

I was really determined to take advantage of this summer, but instead I think I gained a little. I'd like to blame it on my internship being stressful and me not having the time, but in reality I've just been a lazy bum.

Right now I'm trying to cut down on unnecessary (and unhealthy) snacking as well as taking fewer serving of the carbs at dinner, focusing more on the veggies and protein. I've also started some running, basing my regimen on [this](http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml), albeit more accelerated than only 3x a week. My parents also have a work out machine thing, which I want to utilize for working on my arms. My arms are probably the second part I hate most about my body, following my stomach of course. I'd also like my legs to be leaner, but not as much of my insecurities are focused there.

Any advice? I don't really have a particular weight goal in mind, I just want to lose it until I feel healthy and look to be in shape. It's hard to know what to aim for.

Edit: I'm also kind of worried about what I'll do in the 6 weeks before the boat. I'm afraid it'll be hard to keep up with something in a new environment."

This is a side effect of an eye drop I was on between about ages 3 to 6 to correct my accommodative strabismus (crossing eyes).  A few times they have called in interns and younger staff to look at my eyes too, since it is supposedly uncommon or even rare.

What does it even look like, and why is it so interesting?  I've tried Google Image searching that, but only turned up many disgusting images of cats and dogs with huge iris cysts.  Nothing like what I have.

Can anyone give me a good explanation as to what this is and why it's so amazing for me to have the remains of iris cysts in my eyes?"
k227n,3,2011-09-01,Mid-College Crisis,astudentthrowaway,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/k227n/midcollege_crisis/,"Sorry... to preserve some anonymity, I will have to be a bit vague.

I was born and brought up outside the US. Was a shy kid throughout school, and didn't get much attention from my teachers. However, I did well in many national and international science competitions, and a lot of outside learning and side projects outside school. I felt school was hell, and found no point in staying in my home country. I considered it to be a police state, and thought (rightly so) that I'd end up working long and meaningless hours if I remained there.

Fortunately, my parents were liberal enough and had the resources to put me in a top university in the US. When I came, I thought it was great. I took senior and graduate level classes as a freshman, got to learn a lot from professors and some graduate students -- made friends with few of them and helped them out with their research. Also attended many talks and events from companies and learned a lot from some great people, while retaining a high GPA.

Now, when I tried to apply for internships for two summers straight, I got rejected every single time, and this is in a supposedly ""booming"" field. And I know I'm better than the ones who got accepted. It might be because of my ""poor communication skills,"" or in other words maybe they do not feel like eventually having to sponsor a foreigner? I'm scared now, because I'll get kicked out of the country if I fail to get a job after graduating and probably end up in some sweatshop back home.

I've also considered pursuing advanced degrees from other top universities, but I had set my sights on a very narrow field in my major so far, and feel that I should try to do something else in my major, particularly because this ""narrow field"" is a very competitive one worldwide. Just looking at the profiles of the research groups for this field scares me. It is also a very mature one, and I feel like I would make myself more useful working on an emerging field.

I'd like to study everything in my major. But, unfortunately, it seems like there is too much to learn. I was sure I knew what to do as a high school student, and I *am* doing that now. However, I would like to gain expertise in it, and it seems like that takes loads of time.

On top of this, I've got what [r/seduction](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction) would call [oneitis](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=oneitis). (Note: I've never been in a relationship in my life.) During the first class I had at the university, I saw this pretty girl sit right next to me (I never attended lecture again, because I tested out of that class). I used to see her everywhere, but never bothered to say anything. Wasn't all that obsessed back then, though I did somehow find out here Facebook account. But then we were in a class together last semester and I was pleased to find out that she was smart (not super-smart) and really nice. I think she liked me too.

However, that semester has passed by, and during the break I used to stalk her FB profile every day. I saw her once now that the semester has just begun, but I think she doesn't recognize me.

What have I been doing lately? I hang out in the library, around 10 hours a day, working on some projects and learning stuff. It's keeps me hooked at times, but I have been getting distracted due to this ""depression"" lately. I also attend some interesting classes. I also try to get regular exercise and eat healthy. I do feel lonely at times, but I have smart friends I plan to work on side projects with. It's getting increasingly hard to get hold of them though. I also have some saner friends who are drinking buddies, but I would not like to waste too much time partying. About that girl, I have no clue what to do; how to get her out of my head or to get her attention. Either way, I think this obsession is really unhealthy.

I don't know about my future. I'm sure I will graduate a year early. Maybe this whole ""teen entrepreneur"" thing is getting on my nerves. It's like a mid-life crisis -- just more of a ""post-teen crisis."" I do want to make something useful and help others with the skills I have, but I'm not sure how to use this skills for the greater good yet. Maybe going back home would be a better thing to do, but it's incredibly hard to change things there. I always felt the United States is more open to such ideas, though it will take a lot of effort to stay in the country and eventually be able to legally start a business or become a professor.

I can't pinpoint what exactly is the cause of my depression: I'm doing what I want to do right now, something very few people have the fortune of doing. I guess it's probably some combination of what I've described.

TL;DR: Shy foreign student in US, doing pretty well in major and having a deep interest, rejected for internships, scared of getting kicked out of the country, also, girl problems.

An earthquake. Head Archeologist and Chief Preservations Officer Adelina was thrown from her desk chair. Shock and bewilderment - feelings shared not only by those in Adelina's office building but of everyone in Roma, Italy as well. 

From shock came fear. Fear not of another earthquake, rather fear for the Colosseum's state. The Colosseum is but 2 blocks from her building. Adelina got to her feet, ignoring questions and shouts from colleagues, and started to run.

-

Ten long minutes later, the now profusely sweaty Adelina reaches the Colosseum. All staff on hand that she could see were in the same state of shock as she was. All were worried about the Colosseum. Alas, it is still standing. 
Before she could even recover her breath, an intern comes running straight at her. She recognizes him, Jonathan Delacroix, a history and archeology major from America. He was currently working on his own thesis on the Colosseum's gladiators. Wide-eyed and half panicked, he grabs her arm before saying anything. Adelina is quickly dragged in to the Colosseum's grounds. Drawn by the commotion, a small harem of other staff, security guards to tour guides, follow them in. 

There among the remains of the floor of where the gladiators used to do battle, was even more people. No one was speaking. Adelina pushes her way thru to see what everyone was looking at. She stops dead in her tracks and her heart almost does the same. There, at the center of the group, half encased in stone was... Adelina couldn't believe her eyes. It was an M16A4, she recognised it from the news reports on the Afgan war. It was the weapons american Marines were currently using. 

Except something was terribly wrong, not only should it not be here, it was rusted, the metal of its parts fused together and half of it encased in stone. 

Adelina fainted."
k1xnb,5,2011-09-01,Mentally and Physically drained,salamandor,MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/k1xnb/mentally_and_physically_drained/,"never thought I'd posting in here for my own but I don't have very many other places to go.

But I know she loves me too, and I love her like crazy too. She's a young girl and needs this but at the same time it hurts so much. I feel so drained thinking about her. We've mentioned before the breakup that we may get back together again when we're closer together and when the time is better, but sometimes I feel like (or maybe scare myself into thinking) she wouldn't want that when the time actually comes. It scares me because I love her like crazy.

Even more so, I graduated college in May; I had an internship over the summer with a gov't agency but I haven't been able to get any interviews with any companies. I've applied to numerous jobs but I don't know when I'm going to hear back, if I even do. I'm starting my gradschool apps but I don't know if that's really such a good solution.  Just thinking about everything I have to do is shitty.I'd rather be working. Unemployment fucking blows and I'm trying to get through it as hard as I can.

I've also been getting these fairly consistent headaches, a couple times every month. I occasionally think they're related to the pain from my wisdom teeth coming in, but they're not always synchronized. I turn into a hypochondriac and worry that I may have a tumor,etc in my head and that just makes me freak out. I've had one for the last 2 days (with wisdom tooth pain for the last 4) and it's just annoying and painful and I hate it.

I'm not usually like this. I'm usually pretty fucking stable but all of these things just piling up compacts it all into one big punch at my mental health. I went through four years of Engineering school and I feel like this is shittier than all that. At least I had a plan and something to do back then. I need a plan.

She's cool, easy going and really nice. Quickly I found myself with a little crush on her.

We went to a bar after work on day and she spent most of her time talking to me. She has hinted that she wants to go to a local beach town and snuck in the fact she brought her bikini so I'm sure I'm pretty damn sure she likes me back. 

I intend to take her out one weekend to show her around. What I'm not sure if doing is if I should take her out with coworkers/friends of mine in a big group or make it some one-on-one time? I know groups can be much more fun and laid back and social which French girls seem to get a kick from, but she said that if I go to Santa Cruz that she wanted to go too so I'm not sure if that's implying she wanted to go with just me.

I'm 24/m and not a big fan of dating, so its really rare for me to suddenly have an interest in someone. I am realistic about all of this though. I know that anything that forms between me and her will most likely end the moment she returns to France so I don't have that any long term expectations."

For people who don't understand what that means it is about looking at pretty pictures (as much as being a biologist is playing with fuzzy animals and cosmologists are star gazers). It is one of the more difficult medical fields to be accepted into with over 300 applicants per spot. It is even more difficult for foreign people, especially from foreign medical schools, and even more so if they have mediocre board scores. 

My friend is from Nigeria and has USMLE scores of less than 90. While he was doing an observership at my program I took him under my wing and advised him to tail the residency director. I coached him and educated him on the proper questions as well as the personalities he should familiarize himself with. He did this doggedly for over 4 months and walked away with a residency spot and an internship, both of which were obtained outside of the match (Think of it as picking teams for your life). After this, he was very tearful and thankful. He praised god up and down. He talked about how much he prayed. He praised me up and down. Then he asked where I went to church and I informed him that I was an atheist. He was horrified, drew back, and mumbled ""don't say that"". Things changed until he left and he disappeared for his intern year. 

So, this is his first year back after internship. I see him, he runs up and hugs me (Africans are very friendly). He still thinks I got him the spot or something and acts like I walk on water. 

One day he sees me checking my email which is replete with atheist letters and posts. He comments about ""that's a lot of atheists!"" with a giant smile.  One of my fellow co-workers yells over the divider about ""why are you always bringing that shit up"" (meaning that I had said something). My Nigerian friend yells back ""Mind your business!! He didn't bring it up, I asked him a question"". 

He is still VERY Christian and he still thanks me for getting him the spot though I point out that he did all the work. All I can say is that it went better than expected. Hell, now I have a 300 lb Nigerian defending my atheism!!

TL;DR I ""helped"" my very Christian Nigerian friend get a residency spot and now he defends my atheism against other Christians.

I'm new to agile, but I've been doing a good amount of reading on XP, Scrum, and Kanban.

Our company has 2 developers (plus one intern to handle odd jobs, misc requests, etc),  1 designer,  1 account manager, and 1 CEO who is the creative director. 

Our developer workload consists of 50% project work, 50% maintenance and support.  I define ""maintenance"" as small change requests, etc.  If a change request is big enough, we'll define that as a project.

The development team has begun to use a dumbed-down version of Scrum to handle our *project* workload.  We have a task board, with columns for backlog, working, and done.   We use a fibonacci point scale for individual tasks (tasks are basically stories, but we don't define them as strictly as scrum prescribes).  Our velocity is 20, which in ""ideal hours"" accounts for 50% of our time. 

This system works fairly well,  except that it does not account for unplanned work very well.  We have our velocity set to a number that accounts for unplanned work (about 50% of ideal time), however we cannot see the immediate effects of inserting high-priority unplanned work into the workflow.

Who has a similar type of work flow?  How are you using agile to account for planned and unplanned work?"

k3khq,18,2011-09-03,I feel so lost. Bit of a ramble.,[deleted],polyamory,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/k3khq/i_feel_so_lost_bit_of_a_ramble/,"*This post should probably go in r/RelationshipAdvice. I am explicitly posting it here because the second I mention that I have a boyfriend, the focus will be on that and not on my actual problem. There have been a few posts lamenting polyphobia on reddit, and I don't feel like dealing with polyphobia alongside my current issue. Thank you, r/Poly, for being here, and forgive me for bringing my ""regular relationship"" problems to you.*

Fiance and I have been together for 8 years. If you're a reader of r/Poly you've probably seen my other posts, possibly under my other account, and know all this already. We were one another's firsts, and kind of grew up together. We got together in middle school and have been together up through our last semester of College, which is now. Both 22. We've built our lives together and are getting married in two years. And I'm feeling lost and terrified that I have fallen out of love with him. 

He recently came home from a 3 month internship across the country, and while he was gone I tried to enjoy myself and my alone time. Boyfriend and I spent all the time we could together, because we knew we wouldn't get another chance like it, and it was wonderful. Everytime Fiance and I would Skype, I cried a little, because I missed him more than I realized. I felt loving and excited at his return up until the last week or so before it. 

We were both in quite a funk - I think he got something on the plane home - and readjusting to his return. I even made a post about it a while ago. We had very difficult discussions. He's a tall, big guy, and no matter how much I love him, I'm not that physically attracted to him and haven't ever really been. I'm just not. I can't make myself be. But it wasn't always a problem, and I managed. Our sex life before he left was pretty good, actually. We discussed this. He's challenged himself to lose weight, for his own confidence and self image, and I'm glad for that. He's wanted an exercise bike for years, and now he's finally got one. I'm happy for him, because I want him to be confident in himself, and happy with himself. Confidence goes a hell of a long way in attractiveness. 

We discussed getting back on the same page concerning polyamory and rediscussed our boundaries. He's expressed wishes that in the future, we stick to only sexual partners, no romantic partners. He says he's okay and has no problems with Boyfriend and I, but that our relationship made him realize he wants it to be ""just us"" when we get much older. I said that this was something I could do, and while I could not guarantee that Boyfriend and I would break up someday (though it may be likely, as we have different wants for the future), I would not intentionally pursue any new romantic interests. 

So, we've been having good discussions and getting back into adjusting to our old life, before he left (3 months is nothing after all, right?), and yet here I am with a problem. 

I don't feel romantically inclined toward him lately. It terrifies me. I like him, and enjoy his company, and I have no desire to LEAVE him, but I have little desire to be here. I want to be in love with him again, because the consequences of me not loving him are so disastrous to both our lives, it's just not worth it. It's not like I want to leave him FOR my boyfriend; that's definitely not how I feel. But it wouldn't look like that at all, because I DO love Boyfriend, and would still be with him if, hypothetically, I did leave Fiance. But I don't want to do that. I don't want that at all. I want to continue my life with Fiance and I want to feel romantic feelings towards him again. I feel so so lost. I just feel sad at the loss of those feelings. I know it's normal to go through periods in a long term relationship where you don't feel absolutely in love all the time and fuzzy warm feelings all the time... but this just feels like disinterest. It feels worse and it feels scary and I don't know what to do. 

For the past few weeks since his return what I've been doing is just... giving it time. Maybe once we settle into our semester routine, and graduate, and get legit jobs, and all that jazz... I'll come back around. But right now, I'm terrified. I WANT to be in love with my Fiance. I want to FEEL in love with my Fiance. I would hate to lose everything I've built in life and hurt him so very much and have the life he's built with me come crashing down, just because I don't happen to feel a certain little way anymore. I'm hoping that it's just a phase. I kind of just needed to vent. I'm scared. I haven't told him any of this, because what's the point? Why would he be happy or content to continue being with someone who he loves, who says they're not sure if they still love him back? I don't want to do that. I want him to be happy. and I want to be happy with him. And we don't have the time or money right now to go searching for a poly-friendly relationship counselor and I just... needed to get this out. I need someone to tell me it will be okay and that I do or can still love him. We do romantic things together and such, but I just feel like I'm trying so hard and that in the end I'm just faking it. Or maybe I'm just scared that's what I'm doing. I don't know. I wonder if I'm just coming to the realization that I can be happy without him - that I have achieved independence - and choose to be with him, but I worry that he hasn't, that he is co-dependent. The way he talks about the future makes me feel like I'm his only source of this romantic happiness he can get and that makes me feel a little trapped. 

Now I'm just rambling. Thank you so much for reading.

**Update**: Well, J and I broke up last night. It was amicable and void of drama, which was good. We're gonna keep living together and the like, since not much will change, but I took off my ring. Sigh.

She is looking for people who are graduating June 2012 and apparently if all goes well I would do my last year of school and then start working after I graduate.

This is quite an awesome opportunity, but I just wanted to ask you guys who are already in the business some tips to help me out. I've been interviewed for internships before but never for a full-time position, is the process different?

Additionally one thing that does confuse me is the fact that we weren't allowed to email her PDFs of our work, she only accepted them as a website. [I already a website live already](http://markmanalaysay.com/) so that part isn't a problem but during the interview should I also bring my work printed out? I haven't made a book yet (I didn't expect an interview to happen so soon).

What things should I bring up to differentiate myself? I've heard from tons of people that I need to explain that I am able to have a big idea which stretches different mediums. Should I also bring up the fact that I worked as an AD this summer at an agency?

I feel like such a dweeb, I'm sure that there are really easy and obvious questions but the time crunch is quite confusing and any help would be appreciated!"

We spend hour lunches together, she waits for me after work to walk to train, and she is always hugging me/laughing at jokes/smiling.

The other day my co-worker showed me her facebook status update (I am not on fb), which specifically said that she has a crush on me. Last night we had gone out to a company event to watch a football game and she was around me the whole time, often holding my hand and resting her head on my shoulder.

I text her tonight asking her if she wants to go out for the long weekend and she says, ""I don't have date clothes..so you are out of luck. You make the plans"" then one minute later.. ""I don't want you to get the wrong idea"". 

Is this some fucking mind game she is playing, or am I reading these signals wrong.

 First off, some background about me. I just graduated from college and made the unfortunate and necessary move back home to Northern California while I study for the LSAT. I've been working at a winery during the day doing private tastings, tours and sales along with bar tending at night. After I take the test on October 1st I want to move back down to Southern California until I go to law school next August. I have a B.A in History/Legal History from a UC, along with having done multiple legal internships. I also have published work from when I was a staff writer for the school newspaper. I have years of fine dining and food service experience.

 My question to Reddit is where do I look for jobs in either Los Angeles or Orange Counties? I'm not looking for handouts, just some resources so that I don't have to limit my searches to Craigslist. Some help would be freaking awesome, I'm going stir crazy living back home and want to get the heck out of here.

basically, i happened into (via nepotism) this sweet internship this past summer in my field.  they want me back next summer and are really into the idea of ""growing"" me and hiring me after graduation.  the work is super interesting, i love the work environment, and it's awesome to have this life path set out for me so early.

the catch is that a long-term job in this specific area would require that i maintain certain lifestyle habits consistent with...  you know...  what the government thinks is ok.  in order to even start the process of getting cleared to do this work, i'd need to be clean of any illegal substance for 12 months (excluding underage alcohol).  so i thought about it a lot, quit everything mid-summer, and told my employers that i was planning to go for the clearance thing next summer.

but now that i'm back at brown and feeling all ~free and independent~ and shit, i'm already starting to wonder if that's the best choice for me.  i know that sounds kinda pathetic, like i can't live without drugs or something, but it's not like that.  it's just that i'm in ~college~ and ~exploring~ and, you know, this is my chance to do that...  i'd sort of feel cheated out of a couple years of personal freedom if i limited myself.

the company would most likely still rehire me next summer if i didn't abstain from substances this year, but i would feel kind of inconsiderate not making that small sacrifice for them, like i would be making myself an unworthy investment or whatever.  and then i'd face the same decision senior year and who knows what they'd think of my judgment by then and blah blah blah.  in an ideal world i'd just keep fuckin' around for the next two years, quit substances after college, and they'd find it worthwhile to keep me on for another year doing unclassified stuff and then hire me.  but of course i have no way of knowing if it'd pan out that way.

what would you do?

you want to help me brainstorm?",[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/k4rrl/would_i_be_less_depressed_if_i_had_things_to_do/,"Hi, this post is sort of long, and often times all over the place. If you take the time to read it, I'd like to say thank you - it means a lot to me. I know I'm not usually kind enough at the moment to spend time reading other people's long posts.

So I'm on internship on the other side of the country right now - back in the city I grew up in, but very 'friendless'.

Often times on weekends especially, I feel this immense emptiness (and loneliness?). I wish I could be doing great, stimulating things - with other people or just alone. I don't think 20 year olds are supposed to be spending weekends all alone, just Redditing, watching Futurama, and feeling generally depressed.

I spent some time looking for meetups on Meetups.com that would appeal to me - but honestly, I didn't find anything that made me go - ""Oh yeah! This sounds very interesting!"". I was hoping to be able to find something programming/hacking (as in messing around and building stuff) related...but it seems my city doesn't have any meetup groups for that (Vancouver, Canada).

I've definitely started to get into some really bad habits recently that have pretty much come up due to boredom and a feeling of ""why am I spending my youth like this?"". 

I've started cutting myself when I'm angry, fapping when I'm bored (and not even aroused), etc. Unhealthy things all around. I've had suicidal thoughts (not actual tendencies) for a long time - being bored just brings them out that much more easily.

Question: is it normal to want to regular female company (that's not entirely sexual) really badly?

I feel like a big reason why I'm lonely today and not able to spend my time like a lot of my university peers is because I don't drink. I'm not a fan of alcohol, it makes me feel like shit - ingesting stuff that is kind of dangerous scares me, and I'm immensely afraid of losing control and doing something really dangerous and retarded, especially given my already depressed and not so stable condition. 

Also, I find it really repulsive that I *have* to drink (something that you have to admit is not good for your *physical* health in any way - if red wine is good for you, eating fruit is definitely a MILLION times better without any of the other dangerous side effects) to be social.

Anyways, I'm done justifying why I don't want to drink.

So, yeah. Do you guys know of any Reddit threads that have projects going on that might be interesting to particpate in perhaps? Maybe that will give me soomething to do? I'm sorry to say that I'm not in a state right now where I'm able to come up with things to do on my own - I shoot everything down because of my negative state of mind.

I've tried R4R in order to find people...and...I've tried asking people at the local university as to what events I should attend. It seems that people as usual like to recommend drinking nights."

I've been lurking for a couple of months and I've discovered that this is a truly unique community that can achieve great things, besides making you laugh. I've created this account to ask for your help. This is not a life or death situation, but it is really really important to me, and by helping me to find a solution you would be changing my life!!!

Here is the story. My girlfriend Anna is months away from finishing her major in International Relations, she is probably top of her class, surely top 5 %. She is extremely caring and active: she has done internships in my country's embassy delegation in the UN, in NGO's, published two papers, led a magazine and worked in a radio program. 
The thing is that she doesn't just want to take a job, make money and buy stuff. She wants to help people and do something that matters. This is proving to be really difficult. Most of the ""social care"" jobs that we can find ask for specific skills (engineering, etc). Also, we have been analyzing the idea of going to Africa. But all the programs and projects make no sense, they ask YOU for a lot of money just to participate. I've seen 3 months projects asking for almost 70 dollars a day...

I love her so much, she is such an incredible girl, with a heart as big as a fucking mountain, and she is sad and losing faith in the world. Have you ever seen a children realizing that there is no Santa Claus? I don't want her to be depressed and to believe that if someone has the heart and the motivation to help others on a scale that matters, you probably won't be able to do it if you don't have a lot of money.

I work all day, I have an exhausting job that I need to keep and my free time is pretty limited. I want to help her, but I usually find myself having to choose between spending time with her or at the computer trying to help her. I've been searching the web for weeks, and I can't find something that would suit her, that would enable her to accomplish her aspiration of helping, and I'm getting very frustrated.

She speaks English (truly perfect English, she lived in the US during her childhood), Spanish (mother tongue) and German (pretty fluently). She has experience working with children and with all kinds of people. She is all for living with the necessary, in remote areas and helping others all fucking day, every fucking day. She is not ashamed nor reluctant to physical labor or whatever you call it. The thing, she can't, neither can't I, pay at least 60 bucks a day...

**Please, if you know of any project or social work, or venture, or internship, or whatever, that is looking for people that want to help and have the heart to do it, instead of people with lots of money that want to take different holly-day this year, PLEASE LET ME KNOW, ANY HELP WOULD TRULY BE APPRECIATED**

* ** Do help me, it's breaking my heart seeing her like this and not being able to help her. I love her with all my fucking heart and bones, I owe her everything that I love about my life... * **

I've always been fairly confident in my looks. Random people are always telling me I have great eyes and I think I have pretty nice hair to boot. In shape, well kept, etc. As far as looks go from a non dating perspective, I have never had any sort of major insecurities. Except for acne when I was in high school. Fuck acne. 

The problem? I look like I could still be in high school. When I tell people I plan on teaching it I get mixed responses. People have a hard time imagining me teaching in a high school when I look like I could still be in it. 

The last time I went home for the weekend, we had a visit from a grad student who was beginning his internship at my little sister's high school. He was looking to learn more about the community and asked if I was also a student there.  I said ""naw bro I'm a grad student like you."" 

So...how much of a problem is this for me? Am I screwed here or what? I'm also a few inches shorter than the average. I can't remember my exact height as I haven't checked in ages, but I think it's somewhere around 5' 7''.

Here is the deal: 

The Bad: I was undeclared my first two years of undergrad and it brought my GPA down. A lot. When I declared (B.S. biology, minor chemistry) I did very well in my upper level biology courses, and I did great in biochemistry. However, The crappy grades that I received in some courses (the ones I didn't like) brought my GPA down to a graduating GPA of 2.95. 

The Okay: I have not taken the MCAT yet. I will in several months.  I received a 1200 on my GRE.

The Good: I received good grades in my upper level bio courses (A's and B+'s) 

I completed a nine month, intense internship developing RNA aptamers alongside PhD's in a biotech lab (i.e. I did some very rigorous science).

I have several good letters of recommendation.

I volunteer and am continuing to do so with two different organizations.

I have a job interview for a microbiologist position, and I have worked in a pharmacy for three years. I obviously may or may not get hired as a microbiologist, but I thought it would be relevant to include.

Long story short:

I have already been accepted for PCOM's post-bacc program for next fall. I am trying to figure out which sort of program will give me the best shot at a medical school. Other programs I have been looking at are: Drexel's/Temple's/UPenn's post-bacc, Master's degrees at Penn State and/or Penn State Hershey.

I thought to post this at student-doctor, but seeing the level of neuroticism there I decided this was much better.

If you read this entire post, gracias, and I would like to hear your words of wisdom.

I think it started my sophomore or junior year of high school (for reference, I'm 22, graduated from college in June) when people started telling me that all I did was copy my friends or tag along with what they did/said, and that I should try to be myself. We hung out a lot, and it seemed like whenever there was some sort of conversation about us I was always discussed in the context of ""that guy that mainly tags along"". Admittedly, I did a lot of that, but I've always been quiet and withdrawn, while my friends were generally a lot more outspoken - I guess that's what that dynamic looked like from the outside.

Anyway, that happened all throughout high school, there was a bit of drama tangentially related to it but it's not important. It's only when we all go off to college that things start getting worse. I was really worried about college. I thought that I wasn't going to make any friends, that I had no idea how to talk to people, and to make matters even worse, that my old friends from high school would, after going off to college and forming new circles of friends like they obviously could, become more and more distant from me.

This mindset dictates my first two years of college. As it turns out, I was totally right, I was absolutely terrible at making new friends, and when my old friends decided to start playing World of Warcraft, I jumped right in and started playing 8-12 hours a day, for the next 2 years, to escape the fact that I couldn't make friends and saw everyone else around me doing it rather effortlessly. Predictably, my GPA plummeted, and my social life remained completely nonexistent. At one point I had an hours-long discussion with my RA about why I spent all my time killing internet dragons instead of actually going outside and doing things.

After my sophomore year of college, I quit WoW. I'm not too sure why I quit then; I think it was a combination of feeling sick of the game, and my friends (who had already quit by this point) goading me on to quit. My life got better after this, but the damage was done: I still had no friends, and my GPA was pretty terrible. I switched majors, and found that I really liked what I had switched into (it was pretty random to be honest...I just wanted to be able to get out with a degree).

I ended up doing alright academically, but that's really where, in comparison to my friends, I feel most strongly like a failure. Basically, my friends are all roughly at the same point in their lives as me, and they're a LOT better off. Two of them are going to really good law schools, another a really good med school. I have another friend who's going to a good engineering grad school, and one more who's got a good job in New York. Me? I have nothing. I'm planning to apply to grad school this fall (there are a lot of issues surrounding me and grad school, but that is a completely different bag of worms) but I haven't really done anything since moving back home after graduation. I know I should be looking for work, or an internship, or *something*, but...I just haven't.

I guess it's not really enough to talk about ""results"" or whatever you want to call them. For me, the worst part about all of this is a feeling of futility. Whenever I feel like trying to work on something, there's a part of me that questions whether or not there's a point. My friends are already doing these great things with their lives, whatever I could do couldn't possibly compare. Even if I manage to do whatever it is I'm trying to do, I'm just going to stand in their shadow."

I am a personal financial planning student at Texas Tech university. Some of you may know the program here is top notch. I am very enthusiastic about financial planning, fee-only financial planning specifically.

Anyway, I have rather daring aspirations as to where I want to go with this degree. First of all, I would would like to have an internship or possibly a job in Japan. This is a new aspiration of mine so I have not done much research yet. What is their FP market like there? I know Japan has quite the aging population which should help the FP industry. I know this is a long shot, but if there is anyone with any advice about obtaining some sort of position in the FP field in Japan, I'd be absolutely delighted to hear it.

Secondly, my primary aspiration is to get an internship or job in Seattle. I have done a little research, but I've had a hard time finding a bigger firm in Seattle. I did a search through NAFTA's website trying to find fee-only firms in Seattle, but most seemed like very small operations that I'd have trouble getting into. I love Seattle and I would LOVE to work and raise a family there.

Anyway, I want to apologize if this thread is ridiculous or if I lack cohesion. I am about 10 beers in and thought I'd ask for help finally. I still have some time before I graduate, but I want to be prepared. I love financial planning. I love math and I want to be able to help people accomplish their goals and dreams.

Thanks, I'll be editing this post as I sober up."

I'm a community college student in Seattle who has been feeling a bit unfulfilled lately. I'm an introvert as I assume most people on subreddit are, and find it difficult to secure new relationships even with those who have similar interests. I sometimes find it difficult to endure smalltalk and generally don't have the ability to produce it. Along with my relatively obscure interests, you can imagine that this doesn't help me get to know other people very effectively.

I am unemployed and living at home but have been looking for a job for a long time, though I do have a minor internship at a local (non-commercial) radio station as a dj assistant. I spend a great deal of my free time listening to music from French hip hop to Malian folk to Chinese metal. I have a small group of friends and our relationship primarily revolves around talking about music. I understand that music is a natural go-to point of conversation as it is one of the most readily-available forms of art, but if our tastes don't align very well then I'd rather leave it out entirely. I am an open minded listener and don't get defensive and try not to force my listening habits on others, and would appreciate if this was reciprocated when discussing music (or pretty much any form of art).

Parallel to music, I have also been deeply interested in poetry since high school despite learning long ago that knowing a lot about poetry does nothing to help you relate to others in most social situations. Unlike music however, I have nobody to talk poetry with. I remain in touch with some of my old English teachers, but their knowledge of the poetry world outside the canon that they teach is scarce at best.

I have an assortment of other active interests like movies, games, and French, but I'm generally open to talk about anything. We don't necessarily have to share any interests, but I want to talk to somebody who cares about *something*. No interest in idea wars waged without curiosity. Drop me a pm or comment if you want to have some type of correspondence.

k3ypd,2,2011-09-03,Atheism Testimonies,Seanradio,atheism,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/k3ypd/atheism_testimonies/,"So we all know in the Christian church people are encouraged to share with people how the came to be ""saved"" and the wonders god has done in their life since then and so on and so forth. 

I have a few self proclaimed atheist friends whom Ive known for years that have always been atheist or at least agnostic. Nobody ever seems to talk about their light bulb moment when they decided to follow their doubt and become critical thinkers. I am interested to hear how those of you in the r/atheism community came to your individual realizations. Maybe there is someone lurking around who is on the border of belief and they find themselves in a similar situation as we all once were. 

Ill start.

Like most white middle class families in America, I grew up in a semi-christian household. Dad was Catholic (non-practicing) mom was protestant (not really practicing either). My grandmother would take us to the church near her house (Dad excluded) for years until they moved down to Florida. After they moved, we all stopped going. This never really hindered my parents belief system as we said grace before dinner and would still go to church when the grandparents were in town. 

Fast forward to teenage years I started getting into punk music, skateboarding (all the typical things the ""cool"" kids used to do right?) and getting into good ol' American trouble. It was at this point in my life where I wasn't too sure whether or not I believed in a god, but in my mind I had no evidence to disprove it. 

My senior year in high-school a friend of mine was shot walking home from his job at dominos for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. When a tragedy like this occurs, I believe that one can become emotionally unstable and start to either look for answers of the unknown, or start questioning a solid belief. I chose the former after being taken on one of those youth retreats where they play the sad music and tell you how everything is better with Jesus.

After this I was gung-ho, let me tell you. I started going to two services a week, bible club at school, early morning prayer sessions mid week, I was a beast at being a Christian.
My grades werent the best in high school, my SAT scores were shitty and our family was pretty broke. When the time came for me to apply to colleges I thought I was out of luck. I really wanted to go to a Christian university and become a youth pastor. (did i mention I was really good at being a Christian?) 
I found a school finally that wasnt necessarily a Christian school, but did have some affiliation with the Methodist church. It was a liberal arts college, requirements werent to steep and...they offered a scholarship to lead the college worship team. I have always played music, and within those last months of my senior year in high school I knew just about every worship song you could imagine. To make a long story short, I got in, and got the scholarship.
I chose a double major in Religion/Philosophy (i wanted to be able to battle all the non believers in their own game). There were many viewpoints presented to me that first year of school. Viewpoints I had never considered, never thought about and never new existed. As this provided good food for thought i still decided that I needed to pursue what I was already going for, I started to have my doubts again, but none of them were more powerful than the thought of losing that scholarship and not being able to finish my college education.
Part of the religion program was to get an internship or work for a church at some point. I was still pretty gung ho so I decided to go for it the summer after my freshman year. I got a gig at a local baptist church playing standup bass and being an assistant to the youth pastor.
Every couple of summers the youth group there would raise money to go on a mission trip somewhere around the world, and whatever money they couldnt raise, the church would cover the rest. Since I was an employee of the church they paid my full way to go on a trip to Quito, Ecuador. I was pretty excited to say the least. I had never been out of the country, rarely ever got to fly, and now was my chance to bring the word of jeeeeeeeeesus, to a people who I thought needed to hear it.

The Southern Baptist Convention owned a piece of property in Quito in which they built a facility to house missionaries, employ the locals to cook and clean for them, hot running water, warm food, warm beds and electricity for the whole compound. I thought at this point that all of Quito had facilities like this and was starting to wonder why we were here.
Every day we would travel up the mountain to small, poor villages to talk to people about jesus. We had a skit that explained why Jesus came to earth, what he had done for the world and how easy it was to accept him into your life. We would give them candy,cereal and soda when they answered bible trivia correctly and when they came to accept Jesus.
These small villages were in really terrible condition, and here we were, a bunch of young, strong, college/high school students that werent doing anything but talking about how all this will get better once you accept Jesus.
Needless to say, this experienced sparked the need to further dig into these other viewpoints, to study the history of the religion i chose to follow without question and eventually start to figure out the politics of the american church system.
I have been an atheist now for about 8 years but have only been really open about it for half of that time. 
I have managed to lose some friends, gain some friends, have huge blowout arguments and have really connected with some folks who shared my same dilemma out of the same church. 
I have proven to be good without god as some former classmates had no idea that I was no longer a believer but assumed I was based on my actions.

I want to hear some of your stories on how you came to your realizations as I am sure some of you have some great stories.

TL;DR Found Jesus, lost him. "

k5sah,1,2011-09-05,Starting a Morning Workout Regimen,darthluke,Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/k5sah/starting_a_morning_workout_regimen/,"Hello /r/fitness. 


I've always felt weak, and this shows even when I try to wake up in the morning. Sometimes, I try to get out of bed and I'm so tired that while pushing myself off, my arm trembles a little. I can't bench my own weight (about 120 pounds, 5'7), and sometimes when I'm walking, I feel like I'm ""walking weakly"" (whatever that means). I will also admit that my diet is pretty horrible (vegetarian).


Now, I do a hell of a lot of stuff during the day, and am extremely, extremely busy. I don't want to make working out my life, but I do need to do something about this. I know I am physically weak, and all the stuff that I am so passionate about, it seems my body can't handle. Sure, I can go the entire day without eating and get everything done, but it is a bit difficult. 


I have decided to start working out in the morning. I go to college, and we have free access to the gyms there. I'm planning on leaving my house and driving over, reaching there at about 6:30 AM when the gym opens. I look slim as all hell (can even see my abs), but I just don't have the strength, stamina, and endurance. (The trembling.) 

My concerns at this point:

* Being tired the rest of the day after strength and cardio training in the morning. I have a tough academic schedule, extracurriculars, and other meetings. I also drive a hell of a lot.

* Hygiene: Planning on bringing a duffel bag with my day's normal clothes and shower materials, and showering after my workout in the morning. Throwing the old clothes in the duffel bag, place duffel bag back in car, and changing out new non-workout clothes every night.

* What kinds of exercises to do exactly. I can look this up, but generally, I am pretty fucking weak, so it'll look ridiculous if I'm trying to bench like 100 pounds. I also want to improve cardiovascular fitness so I'll hop on an elliptical or bike for that as well.

* Self-conscious. I'm doing a shitload of stuff, when people around me can't even wake up for classes and doze off in class. It just feels like I'm doing too much for my age (this is bullshit, I know. It's those who realize their potential earlier that have the greatest chances to be successful and happy earlier, and contribute to humanity). I need to put these feelings behind me as I know they will surface in the gym when I look ridiculous curling 15 pound dumbbells. 




I've worked at large companies before as an intern, and I know how people go to the gym during their (1-hour!) lunch break, or early morning, or after work. I don't want to do it after work because I have too much stuff to do, and I have no interest in going to an overly crowded gym where some of the people are just there for fun or even picking up women. I always liked the solitude of an early morning gym (used to go to one at 5 AM in high school, don't remember feeling that great from it though.)



Has anyone ever been in this situation? Whether or not you have, can you please offer advice as I am looking to become fit. I don't want to be a bodybuilder, but I want to look fit/muscular, and above all else, have strength and stamina so I don't feel tense, weak, and shivery all the time. 



I am in need of a body that can live up to the brutal amount of work, fueled by genuine passions, that I must complete. Thank you in advance."

2. record my solo acoustic / cover stuff
3. (eventually) be able to record and mix 1 &amp; 2 when we decide that we really want to lay down some tracks

k5ij0,2,2011-09-05,Some musings,darksim905,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/k5ij0/some_musings/,"I've made similar posts to this in the past. I just need to vent and get some thoughts out along with things I am struggling with. I have no idea how long or short this will be; depends on if my mood changes by the time I am done with it. 

I will be 25 soon. I am collecting unemployment. I currently work at an unpaid internship. I should ideally be getting a job making $16/hr or more, full time to make more than unemployment. I feel like there is something wrong with me, or that I am an idiot because I am on unemployment.

I only go to the internship two/three days out of the week because I do not have much money for gas. I feel like I do not ask as many questions as I should, or learn about the environment. I feel like I am letting down the guy I work with. He is insanely relaxed, to the point where I wonder if there is something wrong with him. (I jest, dude!) It makes me feel better to know there are as relaxed people in the world that don't make a big deal out of what everyone else does. It is a small environment. There are a handful of servers. I'm not sure how to get back into the learning-mode streak I had a few months ago.

Up until I lost my last job, I was in a constant learning mode, learning bits and pieces of technology here and there to get certifications so I can have an easier time getting a job. I ran into problems when I lost the job and was told to collect unemployment. My boss replaced me without telling me, essentially, and didn't even give me a second chance or opportunity to rectify the situation. Granted, it isn't like I worked for a large corporation or anything. I wouldn't mind that: A job with a steady paycheck where I get just enough respect for what I do. 

Respect. Do I not get or deserve any, merely because I'm a type B? Yes, I conform to that personality type, and it shows in a lot of what I do. I don't necessarily let it rule my life, but I know my place, what I'm capable of, and what I want. See, you Type A people out there go by silly motto, quotes, and things. One I recall seeing on the blog of someone who spoke at a resume work shop had that cliche phrase: 

&gt; Things may come to those who wait, but only what's left behind by those that hustle.

This quote is allegedly attributed to Abraham Lincoln. I won't get into my skepticism about the quote probably not being from Abraham Lincoln. I'm in the middle-ground, though. I'm not someone who waits. I'm someone who will take part of whatever it is the person who is hustling is after, so even the person who waits has nothing.

Can I *hustle*? Can I do what needs to get done? Sure. But I have no reason or care to. Bust my ass and sweat for minimum wage? For a job that isn't in line with what I've went to school for, or want to do? For just 'any' job, as my father, or other people say to do in this economy? No, there's no point. 

I can hear the yelling now. My dad used to yell at me and think that I **don't get it.** As if I don't understand the larger complexities of life and being an adult. That is if, because I've been let go from one job, or struggle to do things that someone else, who is a Type A or just gets shit done without hesitation, has an easy time doing.

Call me a sensitive wimp, a fucking pussy, or whatever. I get done what I need to, *when* I need to. Is that necessarily so bad? Do I have to do something, or get into a scheme that nets me money while I sleep? What do I have to do to **get it**, Reddit? Do I have to care a little bit more? If so, that's fucking impossible. I care for few things: My girlfriend &amp; her dog, My Internet Connection, My few loyal friends, and my own well-being. 

Everything else is small potatoes. I suppose you could sum up how I handle things by this maxim:

&gt; Matters of great concern should be treated lightly. Matters of small concern should be
&gt; treated seriously.

Everything that's a big deal to my dad, is small to me. Because he doesn't know the real me. He's never seen the real me. He doesn't comprehend what goes through my mind, the thoughts I spill out here on Reddit. The things I talk to my girlfriend about, that her and her dog seem to understand better than most people.

Is this my problem, though? Should I be making a massive stink about things of great concern? Should I be saying ''Oh shit. My electricity got cut off. I have to do something about that now!'' Guess what? Today is labor day. I can't do anything about that till tomorrow. The stress of having such a mentality is useless, wasteful, and a mark of insanity to me. 

Maybe it's because I don't really give a shit, in any case. What? My mom allegedly has cancer, or some kind of disease? I don't care. End result: She didn't have anything, a doctor messed up her blood work, and nothing happened. A massive fucking scare, for nothing. 

What? I get yelled at because my dad says I am selfish, worthless, and stupid? I have problems or am lazy because I didn't wrap a gift for (insert person here), and used a gift bag? Newsflash: I'm not the best gift wrapper, and bags are there for convenience and ease of use.

Every time I say all this someone they just look at me and shrug. Maybe they finally realize why I look so glum, indifferent, and stoic all the time. All these stresses on me. Stresses I hide. I say that things don't bother me, and eventually they get to me, unfortunately. About once every few months I break down and cry, in my room, by myself. It is very hard to get motivated or do anything during this moment in time. I only feel better or 'okay' when I wake up the next day. 

Oh well.

And I've seen people that are worse. I have a friend of mine who struggles, and complains every second of the day about *something*. It's almost impossible to deal with. It's that he's always alone, or has no friends, or has no freedom, or has no job, or has a shitty job, or blargh life sucks, or this TV isn't good, or oh my god this music rules, yours sucks. 

Those types of people drag me down, and most people in life down. At least I only do that once every few months. ;)

Ugh. So much crap to do tomorrow. I have to apply for jobs more. Continue with my unemployment claim. See if someone nearby still needs help with their computer. Pick my girlfriend's brain about what may be wrong with her car, if anything. Get the utilities transferred to my name: this is the only thing I worry about. I'm glad my parents have moved out otherwise I wouldn't hear the end of it. They told me to do it a week ago before they left. If I say anything or they find out, I'll still manage to get yelled at over the phone, guaranteed. 

It's always something. Fuck it."

I work for a games distribution company called GMG. We're looking for an intern to join our London office for the next little while. A month or more would be grand.

This position will include making and editing our product pages, approving and monitoring customer reviews, helping out on our forums, helping the operations team with marketing tasks like creating contact sheets, researching and contacting other gaming sites, helping out with social media, writing blog posts and so much more.

We don't have a really long list of definite requirements: You need to be able to speak and write English really well, and you need to be able to use a computer, Office, FTP and all the usual stuff. A knowledge of gaming is very important as well, obviously.

During your stay, while we can't pay you, we CAN shower you in free games, give you some experience of working for a start-up and working in the games industry, get you some contacts and something to put on your CV. We're fairly flexible with times, but we'd like someone to be able to do 5 days a week for a least a month, preferably a little bit more.

We'll pay £500 a month or so towards your TRAVEL expenses so it won't cost you anything to turn up. Drop me a line at robert.clarke@greenmangaming.com if you want more information :)"

&gt;**Steps for mods to follow before modding someone:**

&gt;**1. Cross-reference with the blacklist:**  The blacklist is on the ModMail, do ctrl+f for it and you'll see the blacklist there. If the name is on there, do not mod them should they request. If you see them on the mod list, remove them.

&gt;**2. Check when their account was made:** If it was made today or two days ago, it is most likely a troll (Do check other factors before deciding on that however.)

&gt;**3. Check their post history:** If their post history reeks of them being a troll, don't mod them. An incident here or there is fine, almost everyone has done that before, but having a constant history of it is a red flag.

&gt;**Feel free to edit the sidebar, but don't delete anything. Just add stuff so that we have an rad sidebar with many contributors.**

&gt;PLANS FOR IF A MODERATOR GOES POSTAL:

&gt;**1. Do not panic** - 93% of people who are murdered die while panicking. Would you rather die calmly or while panicking? If they're going to shoot you, you're dead either way.

&gt;**2. Play dead** - This works not only with bears, but also moderators-gone-homicidal. If the bullets start flying, fall down to look like they shot you.

&gt;**3. Put your arms up to intimidate them** - It's a fact that people are scared of things bigger than them. If you look like you're a 7-foot tall monster, you may scare them long enough to cause them to drive the weapon, flee in terror or have a heart attack.

&gt;**4. Interns are your friends (But only during this crisis)** - And by that, I mean they're the redshirts of the real world. Have Joe cover the door while you make your escape, or have Felicia go get you some coffee if Jacob is out in the lobby shooting everyone. He may think the room you're currently in is empty due to having killed someone, and may continue on. A common mistake that people make is befriending these people, either before, during or after a situation like this happens. Attachment to them will make it harder for you to do the necessary thing and sacrifice them for the good of your own life, and will most likely result in both of you dying.

&gt;**5. If all else fails, panic** - Yes, playing dead didn't work, neither did trying to look bigger to scare him, and he called the bluff because he knew you hated Mark. The only option now is to panic, or hope SWAT (Or your country's equivalent) comes in and saves the day. So unless you're living in a movie where you're the main character and this is the climax of the film, you're dead.

I've been having trouble with friends a bit lately, but found a lot of consolation in a girl I've known for two years now. We've been instant messaging a lot, and I even visited her home, which is quite rare for me to do with most people.

Although we didn't do much, and just talked about school and managing our lives, it was a very nice, open conversation, and it felt like a fresh breath of air. She's very dedicated to her education and career, so she's very helpful about school, and found it sort of a waste we didn't do anything about it (I'm already ahead with most subjects, since I have to redo the year).

I had already contemplated pursuing her because I was in love with her personality and demeanor, but when she got a little tired and laid on the bed and sort of curled up, she looked incredibly cute. So then the physical attraction was there, too.

The only problem I can really think of is that's she's 19, nearing 20, and I'm 16, nearing 17. That makes me just as old as her oldest little brother. So I'm still insecure about pursuing beyond friends. While I am sort of half busy with high school, she's busy getting a internship for her study, so time together will be little, and she's very serious about stuff like that, so she's not online much either. That's gonna be like that for at least a month, she estimates.

I really could use a relationship with a girl like her, and she's my most viable option (sorry if I sound calculating/distant/not romantic here, it's how I say things related to romances, mainly starting them). Since I'm losing friends, more or less, I also could use the mental and emotional warmth a relationship would bring.


**TL;DR** 16m trying to get 19f but 16m is insecure because age, losing of friends and difference in levels of involvement with building a life all tipping the balance weirdly."
k51x6,4,2011-09-05,For RIT Freshmen looking for jobs,The_Admin,rit,https://www.reddit.com/r/rit/comments/k51x6/for_rit_freshmen_looking_for_jobs/,"I know we have a ton of freshmen who are out their who are, lets be honest, being pushed by there parents to find a job on campus and stop sucking them dry ( I kid ). I thought i would repeat which i posted in the comments of another thread what i thought were good ways to get yourself employed at RIT. 

For all the new freshmen looking for the job, they're a few sources for jobs.

**On Campus -**

*http://www.rit.edu/emcs/seo/jobs/oncampus/
 
*ASK YOUR FRIENDS. The best way at RIT to get a job is word of mouth. I know tons of employers that dont do regular interview processes. Maybe they are not even hiring atm, but you are very skilled, they might even be willing to get you in to talk to you. 

*ASK YOUR INSTRUCTORS. Some instructors have pet projects that need students or know people that do. This is also a great way to get co-ops. This can also lead to lab positions, or keeping you in mind for other projects or hard to get classes when showing you go above and beyond. Hint - dont do this to professors that hate you.

*Eat your pride, and join food services they are ALWAYS hiring. If they dont hire you week one, dont despair. I can tell you for sure a lot of kids will quit food services in there first week there because they are too good for it, or another job comes through. May i suggest Catering, they are a lot more selective then they use to be, however you sign up for shifts so you control your hours, and there is lots of room for job growth. Dont forget, you are never too good to flip burgers. BONUS - you get lots of free food, not as much as a few years ago, but it's still a sweat deal.

*Do well in your classes, Most lab/TA jobs at RIT have gpa/class requirements to get them and they are very competitive to get. Plus again these jobs can lead to other jobs. 

**Off Campus-**

*Craigslist again for Rochester jobs.

*http://www.rit.edu/emcs/seo/jobs/offcampus/ for off campus jobs, but that's less used.

*This is rochester, tons of room to do contract work around henrietta and rochester depending on your major. I can promise you doing a year of contract work, starting your own business, or doing volunteer work can look just as good as a year of internships, and it is a great talking point in interviews. 


Good luck out there, and have fun, all your coworkers are RIT students in the same situation you are and you should show respect and help out those around you.

k501k,0,2011-09-05,Luck and networking go a long way,[deleted],lostgeneration,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostgeneration/comments/k501k/luck_and_networking_go_a_long_way/,"I graduated in May with a degree in engineering. My plan was of last year was to get a MS (in engineering, where a MS is actually a very useful degree), but unlike a PhD, funding for a MS is pretty hard to come by, especially in today's economy. Unfortunately, that plan was scrapped only a few months before I was set to graduate. And as a BS in engineering is the professional degree, I should be paid for my work, so I decided to get a real job rather than pay for grad school on my own.

To make a long story short, I applied to any engineering job I could find that I was qualified for and was interested in. Applying to 40 to 50 jobs netted one phone interview that went nowhere despite the fact that I adjusted my resume for each job and was otherwise qualified and interested. This seems to be typical.

Earlier this year I had worked out an internship at a national lab for the summer only. This was supposed to be a bridge between my BS and MS, but I now saw it as an opportunity. I explained my situation to my boss there. He has a PhD in engineering, and he couldn't believe that I wasn't preparing for grad school. He didn't want to believe it, in fact. He first tried to hire me temporarily so I could apply to other schools later, but that went nowhere due to insanity in DC.

He then tried to use some of his connections to get me into a MS program where I got my BS. This, at first, appeared to go nowhere. So he then tried to use some of his professional connections to get me an interview. And this was immediately successful. I interviewed at a company and was offered an excellent salary and great benefits. Their work was fascinating, too.

But around the time that offer came in, I also got an offer for full funding of my MS studies. This was a hard decision, but I decided a MS was better for me right now.

Admittedly, I do have some skills and knowledge that few folks have. That undoubtedly helped me here. But if you're stuck like I was, talk to people and just keep trying. Try to highlight what differentiates you from others. With some luck you might actually be able to turn someone down instead of them turning you down. And don't feel bad if you're not successful (yet) as this is a crappy economy and luck is a huge factor.

TL;DR: Through networking and a lot of luck I got a good job offer and an offer for a fully funded MS in engineering. I'm working on the MS now."
k4ymk,2,2011-09-04,How /r/careerday works,[deleted],careerday,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerday/comments/k4ymk/how_rcareerday_works/,"I'm posting to an empty community now, hoping it works... but:

1. Someone with a cool job offers to answer questions or...
2. Someone wanting a cool job requests a person of a certain occupation.

This is different than IAMA because this is solely about careers -- how to get into a field, how to advance in a field, how to dress for an interview in a certain field, etc.

****
I first got the idea for this when working with convicts in an educational setting. A 25-year-old man started telling me about his interests, and he ended up saying that he really liked animals. I told him there are people who take care of animals at the zoo, and he told me he figured he could never get a job like that. But then I laid out a few simple steps -- applying to a school, financial aid, internships, etc. -- and all of a sudden he realized it was a reachable goal.

Obviously that's an extreme case. But I hope this can be a subreddit that is not just informative and interesting, but also inspirational.

k6nsw,1,2011-09-06,Just some unsolicited advice,[deleted],mizzou,https://www.reddit.com/r/mizzou/comments/k6nsw/just_some_unsolicited_advice/,"Since it is the beginning of a new school year I thought I would share some of the unwritten rules of campus life and some tips on getting by at Mizzou.  Before I start let me give you my background.  I am a Mizzou alumni, current University administrator, and resident of Columbia.  Most of these will be oriented towards freshman.   Last, I must do this under a throwaway so that I can be more honest and frank.

1.	 Look both ways before crossing the street!  Sounds dumb but tons of students don’t do it.  Don’t worry about crossing only at crosswalks; j-walking is fine on campus.  Just make sure you are not stepping out in front of a car.  Also, the middle of the street is not the place to have a conversation or to check your phone.
2.	Always get a second opinion on your graduation plan/schedule.  Advisors have hundreds and hundreds of students and are often not the most thorough and astute employees (read as incompetent).  Most departments/colleges on campus have undergraduate advisors that will look over your plan and make sure it will work.    
3.	You do not need to yield to a car when crossing the street except for emergency vehicles and maintenance vehicles.  Of course you are legally obligated to yield to emergency vehicles but the maintenance trucks are also in your best interest.  If you like having plumbing that works and air-conditioning/heating then get out of the maintenance trucks way and let them do their jobs.  There are around 50,000 people on campus Monday through Friday and less than 100 guys maintaining over 10 million square feet of campus.  Give them a break and wait so that they can drive on.  
4.	Bikes are a great way to get around on campus and in Columbia in general.  A few guidelines for bikers;
	
A)  stop at all stop signs and stop lights

B)  Yield to pedestrians
	
C)  Do not ride down the left lane
	
D)  Lock your bike or it *will* get stolen
	
E)  There is a bike tool stand and pump at the northwest corner of Rollins and Hitt
	
F)  All buses can carry two bikes
	
G)  Klunk (Providence and Broadway) is a great place to buy cheap used bikes
	
H)  Columbia has a rather good network of trails and if you have never been on the MKT or the Katy you should check them out

5.	Want to emphasize the safety concerns behind points 1 and 4 very quickly.  Mizzou averages over one student death every year for pedestrian/cycling students due to the fault of the student.  DON’T BE THAT STUDENT.  I can’t tell you how horrible it is to see a young promising person lose their life because they crossed without looking or blew through a stop sign on a bike year after year.
6.	GO TO CLASS!
7.	Be wary of the Columbia Police Officers, including MUPD.  They have a reputation of being scum bags and for very good reason.
8.	If you are 21 years of age you can buy wine with your easy charge in Eckles Hall.  The dates and times change though.
9.	Also in Eckles hall is the meat lab!  Great cuts of Mizzou ag meat for cheap prices.
10.	Be careful with weed.  If you get caught and convicted you become ineligible for student aid forever.  I have seen a lot of students end their college career early for being dumb with weed.  
11.	Get a job, join a club or find an internship.  Graduating with just a degree and no extras is a great way to become unemployed; especially in this economy.  The University offers tons of jobs to students and they are typically pretty laid back and pay okay.  
12.	GO TO CLASS!
13.	A large percentage of MU students will leave Columbia with a DWI on their record.  It is an expensive ticket and can hurt your chances of getting a good job.  My advice is to live within walking distance of downtown.  You can have all the fun you want and not have to worry about driving anywhere.  Plus you will save a fortune on parking and gas.  
14.	At the end of the semester sell your books on Amazon instead of at the book stores if you can.  You will net *a lot* more money this way.
15.  It seems that just about every year a student gets in a fight with a faculty/staff member near the bars downtown.  Word to the wise, if you get in a yelling match and find out it is a University employee *walk away* before anything escalates.  Assaulting a staff/faculty member will get you expelled even if you are not to blame.  It may not be fair but life usually isn't so get used to it.

I will stop there so the list does not get to long.  If you have any questions or want anything clarified feel free to ask.  Enjoy your stay in Columbia and good luck with school.  Columbia is a great town and has a lot to offer, as does Mizzou.  Try as many things as you can, meet as many different people as you can find, and always keep an open mind.

k6grh,9,2011-09-06,Looking for internships/co-ops,promarkman,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/k6grh/looking_for_internshipscoops/,"I live in the south east attending the best engineering school in the state. I am a sophomore with a GPA of about 2.84. Now before I go into why it is so low, would I even have a chance of getting an internship/co-op as a chemical engineer with that kind of GPA. I know that a lot more goes into an interview such as job experience and activity level with the school and such, but I know that GPA is a big part of it too.

For those that want the story behind the 2.84, I was hit by a car while riding my bike a week before my finals. I finished with B's, a C and a D. All of the grades would be up a letter grade if it weren't for my final grades. I am retaking the course that I got the D in to pull up my GPA, but as of applying to jobs for internships, I would be showing them a 2.84 until the end of this semester.

*Edit* For all those that seem to think that I am using my accident as an excuse, that is not true. I am using it to explain that I am not naturally that low. I had a 3.31 my first semester and am working to pull it up now. Thank you to all those for the constructive advise."

I was working for a large engineering firm for the first two summers of my college career but the economy tanked and they couldn't bring me back for the 3rd year. I reapplied but didn't back on there or anywhere else for that matter. 

I am a good student (3.55GPA overall). I am involved in a hand full of groups and clubs mainly related to engineering. Outside of that I am an amateur programmer and tinkerer. I am taking graduate level classes as an undergrad and I am thinking about grad school.

Last year I worked my ass off looking for an internship. I was in and out of the engineering career center, writing cover letters, and perfecting my resume. I went to the engineering career fair on campus and spoke to the companies I was/am interested in. I sent follow up letters but still came up with nothing, most of them didn't even reply one way or the other. 

I am disheartened, I thought that by doing exceedingly well in an accredited engineering program I would be able to easily find an internship and eventually full time work.

I have tried the conventional way of getting hired for a few years now: what tips do other students or hired engineers have?"

I did an internship after graduation which thanks to the economy didn't turn into a job, soon afterwards I got a job at a call center answering phones.  It's been 2 1/2 years since I graduated and I am desperate for change.  I am interviewing with a company today that I interviewed with in April, but they turned me down for a job, which I was just a tidge underqualified for, however today I am interviewing for a job that I am overqualified for and a job that a classmate and friend of mine from grad school just got and recommended me for.  I have never had a professional job with a career path, and want so badly for this to turn out.  Sorry to whine and bitch, but honestly this feels terrific to write down.  

My interview is at 1PM today, hopefully when I come back this afternoon it will be with good news!

k5wy4,0,2011-09-05,"I'm not sure if you guys will like this, but what was your ""catch"" in admissions? Do I stand a chance?",[deleted],stanford,https://www.reddit.com/r/stanford/comments/k5wy4/im_not_sure_if_you_guys_will_like_this_but_what/,"What was the thing that you really think got you into Stanford? Something you did? Not that I want to replicate it, but I just want to get an idea of what the admissions team likes so I can figure out if I am in line. I wouldn't fake interests just to get into a school. 

I'm currently a Junior in HS and here is everything notable:

* 4.0 GPA Sophomore year and will likely continue through Junior and Senior years. Wasn't motivated Freshman year and got a 3.1.
* Run several self created websites that earn around $200 a month. By the time I would be applying I hope to have 5-10 sites total, and who knows where that would put my earnings at.
* Learning programming in Java. REALLY liking it and hoping to get into a few open source projects in the future. If I can make a nice piece of freeware that gets some decent ratings before I apply, I think that would really increase my chances.
* Internship at a web design company over the summer and now, might turn into actual job at some point.
* If I could get good enough at programming, I could get a more prominent programming internship over next summer, as my aunt has very good connections in D.C.
* School newspaper Editor
* Key Club
* 100+ hours volunteering (required by school though haha)
* Varsity soccer, track, and cross country
* From seeing my results on practice SAT tests, with a bit more work I could score really high, possibly even 2100 or 2200!
* Always in AP classes, but I didn't know the tests helped on anything other than credits, so I'll only be taking my first this year.

Ultimately though, I just really want to go to Stanford. I'll probably major in Computer Science and what better place to be than Stanford and Silicon Valley? If I could get into Stanford, I'd be well on my way to an awesome career programming or perhaps my own startup! That would be amazing and I think Stanford could set me on that path better than any college. Of course, there are other colleges I'd be happy at, but Stanford is the best case scenario.

k5v31,6,2011-09-05,Should I bother finishing my CS degree?,LutraPeregrina,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/k5v31/should_i_bother_finishing_my_cs_degree/,"Basic information: I'm a senior at a local well-known university. I have no student debt, thankfully, so that isn't an issue.

I know that most majors say that your major gets really interesting after you get through all the pre-requisites you have to take around sophomore year.

This has not been the case for me.

The more classes I take in my computer science major, the more I realize it isn't for me. There are little things here and there that I find interesting, but for the most part I couldn't care less about the logic of low-level software or parsing or the big-O running time of algorithms. 

It isn't that I don't want the degree; it's that I hate the subject material, and if I'm already disliking what they're making us do in school, I certainly wouldn't look forward to doing it as a full-time job. Furthermore, my GPA is tanking pretty badly (as in, &lt; 2.0), thanks to lack of interest, and I've only got a year to try to bring it up, so applying for internships or grad school is pretty much out of the question at this point.

I'm wondering if I should try to cut my losses at this point, grab a high-school job, and try to discover what I really would like to pursue while working rather than struggling through a year of working on assignments that feel to me like pulling teeth and graduating badly trained for an industry I'm not interested in working in.

Advice? :)

*edit: Feel free to tell me to take it to r/compsci if you feel it would be better served there!*"

I applied for it half on a whim, and they actually called me to set up an interview. I was surprised, and now realize that I am fairly unqualified for the job.

In the job description it says responsibilities include developing and overseeing a full social media campaign (Twitter, Facebook, &amp; YouTube) website graphics and production, posting on third party websites, managing CSI, knowledge of Web analytics and tracking effectiveness/ROI. 

I know how to use facebook, twitter, and various blogging sites as well as anyone else. I went to a state university for a year then dropped out because I couldn't afford it. I've been unemployed since May, but this summer I followed a band on tour for a few weeks on the road and blogged about their adventures. (Note, on my resume I called this a ""social media internship"" which is why I have the interview.)

So reddit, any advice? Should I show up to this interview Im not qualified for and be honest about my skill set? Or should I bullshit my way through and try to snag a job I honestly dont think Id be successful at? Im confident I could do that, depending on the hiring manager with a little confidence and well placed jargon. OR, should I educate myself on SEO, analytics, and ROI and the like as much as possible before my interview? 

Its starts at 30,000 a year, which is a highly tempting salary as a college dropout.

Edit: The post said the salary would be BETWEEN 30k-45k (USD) depending on experience. Considering I have no actual experience besides messing around on the internet for most of my 20 year old lifetime.

At some point, one of them left, and was replaced by a girl. After a few weeks, some of the emails became borderline flirty, etc. So, I mention that we should do something together sometimes, blablabla. The response was ""How 'bout tonight, come over to my place, we'll watch the fireworks (I live in Montreal there's an firework festival all summer on Wednesdays and Saturdays) from the roof of my condo"".

I graduated from Herp College as a Sport Management major with a focus in Public Relations in May of 2011. Courses such as Public Relations, Strategic Communications, Marketing, and Advertising developed my strong brainstorming, communication, and presentation skills. My ability to take concepts from the classroom and successfully apply them to internships and extracurricular activities earned me the 2011 Herp College Professional Excellence Award.

I sharpened my strong personal and written communication skills with the PROFESSIONAL SPORTS TEAM as a Media Relations Intern. I compiled daily media clippings, coordinated public relations events, and crafted materials for the media. I was also able to forge strong relationships with members of the press, which lead to extended media coverage of community events.

My experiences in public relations, combined with my strong academic background, make me an ideal candidate for this position. I am very enthusiastic about this opportunity with R/resumes and I am available for an interview at your earliest convenience. Thank you for your time and consideration.

For me, its been years and years of post-secondary school, being broke, renting shitty apartments, having shitty roomates, etc. I'm tired and I want to start my life. I know what I want - a decent job, settle down into home, buy a car and get a dog. I'm a simple girl.

My bf and I have been together for a little under 2 years. We have been doing our relationship long-distance for a couple months now because I'm on an internship and its all really stressful. He is a year younger than me and not ready for anything. He's done school and working but doesn't know where he wants to work or live long-term and isn't ready to move in together or take the next step and has made it pretty clear that he doesn't want me to make any decisions based on him.

I spent the last couple of months worrying and trying to plan so things will work out. Trying to nudge him in my direction, fishing for reassurance of our future, hinting about what kind of place we could afford or what engagement rings I like.... and it's not his fault that it scares him but I don't want to do this. I finally asked myself last night....why the hell am I driving myself crazy?

I can graduate and get a job. I can move to a new town and pay back my student loans. I can get a car and eventually buy a house and adopt a dog. I can make my own dreams come true and be happy. I would LOVE to share my life with him - I LOVE HIM - but I don't want to have to force him to do it or hold my breath until he wants to truley make a commitment.

Its a shame that I've already braced myself for a possible relationship expiration date but it feels good to realize I don't have to be a needy and dependant person anymore.

TL;DR Realized I don't need someone else to make me happy if that what it takes to do what's right for me.

EDIT: He read the post and is happy about it. A lot less pressure on him. I still figure I'm going to have to walk away from the relationship when I move in a couple months based on how the long-distance thing has gone these last few months. oh well, if it was meant to be, it was meant to be."

k7m74,0,2011-09-07,WWRD? (What would reddit do) The employment blues.,[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/k7m74/wwrd_what_would_reddit_do_the_employment_blues/,"I’m currently a pleb working at almost the bottom rung on the ladder at a university library.  So, it’s a dead-end job.  The organization doesn’t appear to want to train anyone (inefficient use of money? wasted time?), so basically there’s no promotion from within.  Whatever level you are hired on is where you’ll stay.  Out of 100 employees, about 5-7 are getting to learn new skills and even get financial support to travel to conferences. The rest of us stagnate and worse yet, watch what skills we do have atrophy as the years go by.  If you don’t want to succumb, you have to finance things out of your own pocket and on your own time.

I’m now 47 years old and have been here for 5 years.  I still earn $10.40 per hour, but at least I have health insurance.  For the last 4 years I have tried to grow my skills on my own.  Taking programming and database classes (and acing them).  I also pitched ideas that I thought would be easy to implement while at the same time allowing me to learn new things and create something new for the library. (automating record creation for electronic thesis and dissertations from user submitted metadata using either perl scripts or XSLT crosswalks or creating QR codes that allow a patron to look up journal title changes with their phones while they are browsing the stacks…(simple query of the 780/785 field in a MARC record))  I didn’t think these ideas were stupid or a waste of time.  I really believed in them.  I also thought they’d be well within my skill set as a programming neophyte.  But so far all I hear is crickets chirping in response ….for 3 years now. I’ve only mentioned 2 of my ideas in this post, but I’ve had more.  I can understand why many of them are ignored, but all of them?  This confuses me.  I keep taking a programming class here and there in order to try to keep a semblance of skills.  But really, as a beginner, I don’t’ see how I can volunteer for open source projects that are well beyond my capabilities right now.  

Recently a job came open in our systems dept. that used to be held by a guy who started at the library as a student worker.  I really thought I’d have a chance so I applied.  Yeah, I’d need to be trained a bit, but the only thing on the skills list that I didn’t know yet was .NET and ASP (I know JSP).  Surely after working here for 5 years, and really trying earnestly to grow, showing curiosity, and energy I thought they’d give me a shot.  Instead, they hired someone totally new, but he’s got 6 years of work experience in programming and web development though.  How in the world can someone like me compete when folks like that are playing in the shallow end of the pool?

So, WWRD?  I’ve tried showing that I really want to play the game with them by enrolling in grad school in library science (the curriculum is really weak and I felt self conscious taking it.  I did focus on the few programming/database classes they had even though it was really a repeat of what I already know). I had hoped that as a grad student I would get to pursue some of my project ideas …sort of like a research/coop sort of thing.  Perhaps I could have done a poster session at a conference or written them up as a technical paper.  That wasn’t even remotely what happened.  I was still ignored.  My job was still 100% to grind away editing records line by line; 80% of which really should be done in batches with scripts.  None of the administration or my supervisors created any possibility of my growing my skills for the brief period I was in grad school. So my thought was what’s the point of book learning if you can’t really *do* anything.  How does this make me competitive for a job?  Anyway,  now I have student loan debt and nothing to show for my effort.

Other relevant details:  I live in a small college town in MS where the cost of living is fairly high despite being in MS. I have no family that can help me with things like insurance or any big expenses.  Most entry level work around here seems to be college work-study based, meaning part-time, minimum wage and no insurance *and* limited to students.  Other part time jobs in the community are dead-end; you don’t learn anything that will help you get a future job that could grow into a middle class wage.  I currently have a living wage, but no substantial savings.  I just had to tap into what I did have to pay for 1400 bucks worth of dental care.

I’m considering getting a certification in medical coding instead.  At least that will only cost about 2 grand (yay…more debt!) to get the training needed to sit for the initial certification exam.  But I’ve started to read employment forums and I’m seeing a lot of people who have ponied up the money and gotten the CCA and some the CCS, but they can’t get a job because they haven’t had a job in coding before.  So how in the world are you supposed to get your initial skill set if you can’t live on part-time, minimum wage work (or free internship)?  I can’t think of anything else to do so I’m picking the collective brain of reddit.  Any ideas?

The only issue I have is I don't want my resume turning sour because it looks like I don't have loyalty. My only previous non internship job history is 1 year at a company when I first moved to Texas. 

**TL;DR:** Is it detrimental to one's resume to switch jobs often?

Edit: Also, if you are a hiring manager or someone with experience in woking with people's careers could you note so. Not that I don't value all opinions but people in the business may have exceptionally significant insight.

I’m new to r/cats, so please feel free to redirect me if you know of another thread that might help! But to start I guess I need to give some history to better frame the question. Please bear with me!

I adopted a kitten back in 2008, a male tabby named “Sausage”. For the first six months of his life he lived with my husband, myself, and our spayed female tuxedo in our apartment. In this time, he grew big and fast and very, very manly. We loved him and his big, slobbery ways, and though we got him neutered a bit late (his face had already chunked out) we never had any problems with spraying or roaming.

Fast forward to some family/financial trouble mid-2008, and my husband and I move back in with my widower father-in-law, five acres in the country with room to romp and play and a cat-door to boot. We introduce both cats to the outside slowly, and for the first month or so both are gloriously happy. Sausage, big brute that he is, quickly becomes a star mouser.

Then my husband and I go on vacation for a week. When we return, we find that Sausage has gone missing during that time. Upset, we search the entire property night after night. We do everything to look for him, but hear nothing. Then the following week he just… shows up. He’s skin and bones and yowling. He spends the next three days stuck to me like glue (even following me into the shower). He recovers fine, and, aside from a few cat fights I have to break up between him and the local ferals, there are no problems. He gets fatter. He gets lazier.

Then summer 2010 rolls around and my husband lands an internship out of town. While he’s gone for four weeks I stay with my mom and help her care for my much younger siblings. I drop by to visit the cats frequently, and I make sure they’re being fed. I sit with them for hours to make sure they’ve had their fill of pets.
But only a week into our month-long absence Sausage goes missing again. We go through all the same efforts to find him, but this time we’re not so lucky. No sign of him. He doesn’t reappear. After three weeks without a sighting we give him up for lost.

Then this summer we’re outside barbequing, and who should come slinking out from under the house but a thinner, more toned Sausage. I cried out to him in my surprise. He must have been only thirty feet away, but the minute he saw me he bolted for the trees. I’ve seen him on two other occasions, once more emerging from beneath the house, another stocking through the trees. Both times he’s bolted. I’ve also heard him in the garage yowling (he has a very distinct yowl). I put food out there, but he’s always off like a bullet before I’ve even opened the door.

So my question for you all: have any of you ever had a cat go feral like this? I don’t know whether I should even entertain a hope of coaxing him back. We’re delighted that our worst fears – coyote, car, etc. – turned out to be false, but we miss him horribly, and I find myself desperately hoping he’ll just reappear one day, yowling for food.

(Warning: Text Wall)",Kindred_Soul,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/k772g/i_went_crazy_but_i_came_back_better_than_ever_id/,"I've been through a hard time this past year and I feel like reddit has helped me so much. At the start of this summer I was at the end of my rope, and then I read reddit. I went to r/GetMotivated and I was pumped to deal with anything, I went to r/ihaveissues and r/relationshipadvice and saw ways to overcome problems I had been struggling with for years. I went to r/loseit and r/fitness and I've finally gotten control of my weight. I've even been to r/trees and learned to be the best Good Guy Greg I can be. Thank you all so much! I love you guys. Here is my story:

My mind races with dreams of ways to save this world. Some are childish, some are bold, they all require more experience than I have. A lot of people see me as lucky, someone who was given everything I asked for and was blessed with some greater talent. I’m not. I was never as smart as my friends, I made sure of that. I surrounded myself with people who were much better at things than myself. I only got anywhere because I tried to keep up people who I knew were better than me. After a while, I was being pulled in so many directions of what I wanted to do that I wanted nothing more than to escape to the woods for the rest of my days, to live as a hermit. But my friends convinced me to go to school, for something. I didn’t have to know what, but I had to go for something. I’m glad I listened. I got there, and I had no fucking clue what to do. I picked the first thing that came to mind, Physics, because I liked the class in high school. The college I went to is no fucking public high school, I learned that the hard way. I scraped by while others maintained 4.0s with hard work. I felt like I was too stupid, too lazy to be a physicist. It hurt my pride. I was stupid to have any at all. So, I quit: at the advice of my girlfriend, I became a business major, so I could follow in her father’s footsteps, I guess. I didn’t give a shit about it, but I felt it was what I needed to do in order to accomplish my grand schemes. Then there was the stuff I abhorred in high school, that I was so against. I delved into everything I hated so much before: sex, drugs, weed, smoking cigarettes and alcohol. I’m glad I did. Yeah, it made me a hypocrite to go against my own morals at the time, but it gave me perspective.  It helped me be much more open, more accepting. I went overboard though and it hurt me. It hurt my grades, my relationships, my family and I can’t take that back. I hate what I put them through. It looked as though I would become some greedy, masochistic, asshole business owner that would never accomplish anything more than a failed business or two. I knew I wouldn’t be able to live with myself. So I did what I had to do: suicide of my old self. It wasn’t pretty. I sabotaged every relationship I had; every crush, every new friend, every person who ever saw me around campus.

For the record, I didn’t consciously go crazy; but after losing my girlfriend of 3.5 years, backstabbing my roommate at the advice of my ex, and getting so frustrated at my incompetent manager at my job, who fired one of my best friends who was so beside himself that he wanted to commit suicide because of all the shit that piled up in his life, I gave up. I quit caring what people thought. I spiraled. I didn’t sleep, every thought became reality no matter how absurd. I thought that every living being was a god in their own right and that they had the power to do whatever they wished, so long as whatever it was didn’t impede on anyone’s else’s own world. Crazy, right? I likened myself into some, weird, aeon child that was somehow special, able to see that the world was a beautiful place where rules of social order could be changed on a whim, like some game of tag where the leader picks the rules. Crazy, right? I thought that by training physically each night when the campus was quiet, serene, that I’d be able to become a great parkour athlete that could scale buildings and ignore the boundaries set up by rigid societies. Crazy, right? I thought I could employ a sort of variant of the ubermench sleep cycle that replaced sleep with meditation. THAT IS CRAZY.  The REM cycles are different in meditation than sleep, which I was not skilled in to begin with, and that’s what led me to go crazy. You can’t replace sleep with meditation, it’s not physically possible. That’s when the hallucinations started, that’s when shit got real and I found myself in two different mental institutions sleeping off this nightmare I put myself into. I got out; but I was far-gone until mid January until the drugs started to level me out. By that point, though, I was so fucking embarrassed about the entire situation that I just avoided as many people as I could. They called me “Crazy Kindred_Soul” and I hated it. My last semester, I reaped what I sowed; a miserable commute of 80+ miles a day of driving because the dean was scared to have me with another roommate so I had to live with my parents. I never stayed on campus for very long, and while I had a few friends who wanted to reach out and keep hanging out with me, I mostly stayed to myself. I didn’t party, I didn’t even talk to the people who saw me go crazy. Most of them thought I had burned out, someone who was so full of potential that was doomed to spend the rest of his life as some bum moving from mental institution to mental institution with some strange form of psychosis or bi-polar disorder. I was just sleep deprived, and it affected me for months afterwards. I limped to the finish-line of graduating; I just wanted to get by, without seeing anyone. Everyone saw me as someone who was insane, or someone who would only achieve anything if I was given the option to “opt out.” I walked at graduation, but it was a hollow victory. I wanted my senior year to be the best; it was the worst. I was short a credit to make matters worse. I wanted to just be done with it all, to get the hell out. The start of the summer was still miserable since I was so disappointed in myself that I didn’t graduate on time. Impossible standards given my situation, but I didn’t care. At some point, though, I realized I wasn’t so bad off, I had come through a lot, and managed to pull myself back together. I signed up for a leadership class at my community technical college, which I WISH that my school had.  I knew accounting like the back of my hand, but I didn’t know leadership. Meanwhile, I looked for other jobs, but I did a half-ass job of that because I didn’t think they’d take me without a degree. My parents urged me to apply anyway. I did. It was June. I applied at exactly one place that was an accounting job. I also got a call from Acxiom about an internship, but the interview was a textbook example of what could go wrong in an interview. I didn’t have an updated resume, my clothes were wrinkled, I hadn’t shaved, and my cell phone went off during the interview. Fucking fantastic! I didn’t get the job. I applied at exactly one place that was an accounting job. I didn’t ever hear anything back from it after I put in my application. That was June. I took up selling Cutco knives just to have some excuse for a job to make my parents happy. My relatives and family friends were happy to buy, but I didn’t have the confidence to think that anyone else would. So, I didn’t even try. I took my summer class at my hometown community college, and I loved it. It was bizarre as an exchange student to hear students and the professor talk about parties from my school since my community college doesn’t party or something. Flash forward to August. It’s the last day of class, and as I’m finishing my final term paper for the course, I get a call from the accounting job I applied for back in June. I was ecstatic. At this point, I had my awful interview out of the way, and since then, I went to a public job expo at my community college and got some advice on interviews. It must have come in handy, I got the job. Now, it’s September, and I feel more like myself, more human, more real than I’ve ever felt in my life. I’m done with self-pity, with my own petty problems. I’m working as an accountant at a nonprofit organization whose sole purpose is to provide underprivileged children with quality education and support. I’m mandated by the state to report child abuse when I see it.  love this job, and my co-workers are awesome. It’s weird being the seventh male in a state-wide company, but it doesn’t bother me. I’m where I need I be, and getting the experience I need to start my own nonprofit someday. But I know, for all that I’ve managed, I’m just getting started. And that’s exciting. A few years from now, I know I’ll have to go back to school and get my P.H.D. or some other Doctorate to gain any sort of real credibility for anything. But, a B.A. in Business and Economics is a good start, and I’m glad I stuck with it."

So I've been having a bit of trouble with a security guard at a new job these days, and I was wondering if reddit could help me out. So I'm a college student bicycle commuter who bikes pretty much everywhere, and at this point in my life, I'm totally dependent on my pedals for affordable transportation.

I started a new internship in the city last week, and for the first three days, parked my bike on an isolated-looking handrail tucked away from the busy-looking parts of the office complex. On the third day, I come out of work and find my bike missing. After a bit of telephone tag, I manage to get the phone number of the facility's security guard and find out that he took it because it was parked in front of a different office than the one I was work for. While I was at work, he broke through my lock, wheeled it over to a maintenance closet, and locked it up for four days throughout labor day weekend, without any warning whatsoever.

I got in touch with him this morning and got my bike back, only to find out later that not only am I out of a bike lock, but my crankset is all bent and warped out of shape. It looks like while he was prying my lock off, he was prying it against the crankset. The chain won't feed properly. It's unrideable on any gear other than first.

I can maybe reason with him on taking him off the other office's property-- they were most likely the ones who ordered him to remove it, and he was just doing his job. What I can't understand is him doing it without any warning or communication, even after noticing it happen three days in a row. For him to pry the crankset out of shape and damage it permanently is just ridiculous, and it's gonna cost me anywhere around $200 to get it fully replaced.

tl;dr: Security guard broke my lock, took my bike, and bent the gears out of proportion while I was at work.

Any way I can get him to pay for this?

PS: Here are to pictures of the damage, one with flash, and one without.

A little about me? Well, long story short, I'm a Web Design student finishing up in the spring. Between working to pay off debts and studying, I haven't really had much time to get together as outstanding of a portfolio as I would like to have. That said, I do have one with a handful of front-end web projects, as well as some animation! 

Where is this mysterious portfolio, you ask? Right here: http://zachgod.in 

Why I'm looking for freelance jobs? I'm currently doing an unpaid internship with a local company (as is requirement for my graduating). While I do have enough to support myself for a little bit, there's a long story that I can sum up with saying that a) I need more experience so I can build a better portfolio, and thus get better work... and b) my mother and I are going to be moving from Ontario to Birmingham in England in April, so I figured the more money helps!

**What I Do!**
HTML/CSS (including HTML5/CSS3) / Fluid &amp; Responsive layouts / Flash Animation (I don't do, or believe in, Flash sites, but if you would like one, I'm more than willing to negotiate) / Basic graphic design / Email forms / Light Javascript/jQuery / Light PHP / Adhere to web standards and practices

**What I Don't Do!**
Back-end web development / Setting up servers / Trade sexual favours for divs 


Ideally, updating websites, static pages (though I can work with setting up dynamic pages; I'm not *that* useless!), banner ads, logos, inquiry forms and more of the awesome stuff that just makes your work look good!

I'm very, very, *veeeeeeeeeeeery* easy to negotiate with when it comes to cost. For example, I'd say a static 4 page website with a simple email/inquiry form would run for $150-$175. That said, I'm not going to overcharge you. You need a project done cheap, I need experience and some money: we can help each other out!

If you're interested, fire me a PM or just email me at zachjgodin@gmail.com! Look forward to hearing from y'all!

Cheers,

My GPA is above passing but not by too much (to be fair, it was much better at the start of this year). I won't be able to get an internship this summer due to how low my GPA is. My parents are continuously on my case because I probably won't be able to get a job even when I do graduate. I've tried talking to my counselor here and he's basically brushed it off saying to just work hard.

That's basically the problem. I work my ass off. I don't drink, I don't party, I don't do anything stupid. I have friends bugging me because I haven't spent much time with them in the past year (its hard too when you lock yourself in a room/run away to the library to study). I go to study groups (whenever I can find one), I go to office hours, etc. But regardless, my grades just don't reflect what I've put into my classes. 

So, basically, I have no clue what the heck I'm doing anymore. I have no clue what I should do from here on out. Any suggestions would be great Reddit.

(And just as a note, I have considered switching majors. Problem is, this is what I want to do. Not getting a business degree or something like that)."
k98gk,5,2011-09-08,tips to various engineering majors for getting employment after graduation.,VisIxR,CalPolyPomona,https://www.reddit.com/r/CalPolyPomona/comments/k98gk/tips_to_various_engineering_majors_for_getting/,"* make sure you're active in project-oriented clubs (cpp robotics, that java video game club that existed while I was there, etc. projects really help you talk technical stuff to employers)

* internships are a must. get one every summer if you can.

* study what companies have posted as requirements for employment. for instance willow garage (at the time of this posting) wants FPGA guys, which is a strong skill you can develop at CPP. other companies may have jobs posted with skill requirements - do what you can to get those skills while you're in school.

* some companies hire through temp agencies, like aerotek. Get on file at those companies.

others should post other tips they have in the comments"
k981y,9,2011-09-08,It's been almost 3 weeks since I was dumped but I'm still sad and unmotivated. How do I speed this up?,helploveme,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/k981y/its_been_almost_3_weeks_since_i_was_dumped_but_im/,"I was on top of the world a few weeks ago; just came back from a great summer internship that will likely translate into me going to a great graduate school, in a wonderful relationship that went long distance for the summer, about to move into a house off campus for my senior year with a bunch of guys I like, and I decided to move back early to see my girlfriend who lives in the same area as my school. 

The second night I was in town, we have an argument about the future (she was already worried about me leaving for grad school at the end of the year) and about sex (my fault I guess? despite a lot of signs to the contrary she said she wasn't ready and I got upset). We argue most of the next day and though it's resolved, she's distant the next few days. 

I bring up the argument because I figure she still wants to talk about it, and as a result of the subsequent talk/argument she decides that we're breaking up. The next week is filled with angry text messages, a meeting in which we give back each other's stuff, and the slow severing of contact. (I sent some really angry drunk texts that I shouldn't have. I've since deleted her number from my phone.)

I've given up all hope of winning her back at this point, but despite forcing myself into my work and trying to stay positive, this break-up has radiated into the rest of my life and is really taking a toll. I've gotten less patient with my housemates, straining relations with them as we figure out how to live around each other, it's made me incredibly unmotivated to do any work that i'm not required to do (i.e. lab work towards my senior thesis and my grad school applications), and worst of all I just feel sad all the time. 

How do I move on more effectively? I talked with my friends but I don't want to use them too much because I know they'll get sick of it. She and I have a good deal mutual friends so for the time being people have been cool and warned me when she's going to be at an event but I don't want to play that game for the rest of the year.

So lately I've been working hard to pass the first actuary exam (taking exam P just one week from tomorrow!), and I'm finding it to be a breeze.  My confidence may turn out to be my Achilles' heel, however.  

But then I'll log onto the forums and read all the horror stories about people trying to land a job, and I'll come across posts from high ranking college students from high ranking schools with a couple exams and an internship under their belt asking if they're hireable.  This is discouraging.  I'm 26 now and just about to take *my first exam*.  I have no experience in this profession whatsoever, and have only the rudimentary knowledge of finance I've garnered from my current job (I'll probably double my knowledge within a couple weeks of studying for exam FM).

The one thing I have going for me is that I *know* I'm disciplined enough (and I enjoy it enough) to make it through the exams.  But will I ever get far enough into the hiring process for that to work as a selling point?  If I were to pass, say, three exams, would my application be discarded for lack of any relevant experience?  I figure that if I pass *too* many exams people will begin to wonder why I have so much education and so little experience to go with it.

I'm just a little bit anxious because I've already invested quite a bit of time (at least a few hundred hours), and could potentially invest a *whole* lot more only to discover that it won't work out.  What I want to hear is some reassurance that exams take precedence over anything else, but before I go too much further I really should hear the cold hard truth about it all."

kae43,16,2011-09-09,Girlfriend's dad thinks I am using her.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/kae43/girlfriends_dad_thinks_i_am_using_her/,"Me and my girlfriend decided to get married and in traditional Indian style (we are both Indian) told our parents about it. Her dad is convinced that I am using her for her money and for getting a greencard (I am here on a student visa while she is a citizen of the US). We love each other deeply and genuinely and my girlfriend does not doubt me for a moment. I have also reiterated that my job will be taking care of my immigration issues and I do not need her help for that. 

Her dad is now not keen on doing our engagement after telling my family and his family that he was OK with everything. He wants me to first get my work permit, etc. before he is going to be 100% satisfied with me. He met me once for 2hrs and has decided that I am exploiting my girlfriend for her money and to get a greencard in this country. He went as far as to call me a f****** piece of s*** in front of his family.

My girlfriend has complete trust in me and she doesn't believe any of the accusations her dad is making. But, she lives at home and her dad yells at her and shouts her down and she is afraid to question him or even state her opinion fearlessly. 

In the midst of this I am lost; I spent the last 6 months trying to find a job near her (she is an medical Intern and she is in a position where she can't move right now) and turned down several good opportunities which would put a fair amount of distance between us. I have done everything to be able to be close to her and meet her on her day off (which can be any day of the week). And I don't regret it -- I thought it through and I did what I did because I knew it would make me and her happy. 

But now I feel she is not standing up for me in front of her dad. He basically hates me and is trying to do anything he can to stop this. He likes to control his family and everything they do and can be verbally abusive with them. And living at home and listening to her dad question my character is making her crazy but she is too afraid/too mild in front of him to say anything assertive. Also her mom never has an opinion and always defers to her dad.

All this is driving me nuts. I have done everything I can to be close to her, to be supportive of her, to be there for her through her crazy intern yr (80hr weeks and she used to call me in tears every day for the first few wks) and I have made it clear that my company will be doing my work permits and greencards (I am a S/W engineer) both to her, her parents and her family. Also, her dad does not like my job and thinks I am not worthy of her since I don't work for any of ""big CS companies"" which according to him begin and end with Microsoft, Google, Apple, and Amazon. I feel very bitter about it and I feel like he is controlling her and wants to control our relationship. 

Am I asking for too much when I say that she needs to stand up for me in front of her dad and tell him that this is unacceptable and that the job I do or the money I make or my visa situation is between me and her since we are two mature adults (I am 28, she is 25)?

Reddit, I am very bitter and angry that she is not standing up for me when her dad is questioning my character. Please tell me if my anger is justified? I am at a loss here. I sit at work and all I think about is this situation. We love each other a lot and all her friends know me and like me. I can't understand what I should do about this. It's not the getting my work permit on my own part that's hurting me, it's the fact that she thinks its reasonable on her dad's part to demand that and postpone all engagement/wedding related activities till that happens that feels like a kick in my gut.

TL;DR: Girlfriends dad thinks I am using her for greencard/money; she does not, but is not standing up for me when he is literally insulting my character and thinks he is being reasonable.

ka71y,2,2011-09-09,I'm applying to law school and was hoping someone might take a look at my Personal Statement.,BatmanBeltandBuckle,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/ka71y/im_applying_to_law_school_and_was_hoping_someone/,"The following is a statement that i will be submitting with my applications, it tells of what my past year has been like, let me know if this is something law schools might be interested in and respond favorable to.

I appreciate any and all commentary.

The concept of a yearlong sabbatical from school either between high school and college or college and graduate school has long been romanticized, my relatives wax reminiscent of a time when they spent only a few nights a week tending bar and would travel to the beach to sun bathe or the mountains to ski; literature tells coming-of-age tales of young men wandering “the city” while film portrays their burgeoning love; My experience however, was drastically different. 

Though I had three credits still required of me to receive my diploma I returned from Indiana in the first week of June in 2010, I intended to spend the summer unencumbered; I wanted an experience like that, that had been recalled so fondly by my father and others.  I spent a modest percent of my time preparing to retake the LSATs in October and worked part time in a local retail establishment.  As autumn approached I began to seek more gainful employment so that I might expedite the transition out of my parents’ home; that search would be short lived.

In the early weeks of September, shortly after my brothers had moved into their Rutgers apartment to start their junior and senior years, respectively, I found an intravenous needle among my brother’s things.  My brother John, the second of three, had developed a heroin problem.  Following this revelation my brother moved home, albeit reluctantly, where he began the arduous process of detoxing and recovering from a drug addiction, and at his insistence he did so without professional assistance.  Due to my unencumbered status I was delegated the task of supervising my brother through this period; my part time job allowed for flexible scheduling so that I could attend to my brother’s needs while he was at home and could accompany him to his various engagements: classes, doctors’ appointments and the occasional social incentive.  I would not leave his side, for more than a few hours for over nine weeks.  Due to the duties I had undertaken I was unable to sit for either the October or December 2010 LSATs.

As my brother’s situation improved I was able to refocus on my own endeavors and because the employment opportunities were not numerous during the holiday season I founded River’s Edge Group, a small-business technology consulting group and on-site technology support service.  Following the inception of the River’s Edge Group I was able to distance myself from the part-time retail position I had held since I returned to New Jersey in June.  My continued efforts to expand and develop my business have provided me with invaluable insight into the world of the small-business-man; I have a more profound appreciation of the dedication it takes to grow and sustain a business.  To date River’s Edge Group, Inc. has revenues in excess of $100,000.00 and a client base that, while small, is growing.

With my financial situation better grounded, both with the revenues from the River’s Edge Group as well as the part-time retail position I still held, I was able to dedicate more of my time to preparing for the June 2011 LSATs; I registered for a Kaplan Test Prep course and began my formal preparation the 26th of March.  Preparation for the LSATs however, was not my singular responsibility; on March 19th it was discovered that my mother had a myxoma, a tumor approximately the size of a golf ball had grown in her left atria, she would need open heart surgery immediately.  On March 24th my mother emerged from surgery, healthy.  Although my mother’s surgery had been a success the road to recovery would be a strenuous one; not only would she require constant assistance to compete even the most basic of tasks, she would need transportation to and from countless medical appointments and the duties she had been responsible for over twenty years would need to be assumed.  Once again I was designated the responsible party; my ad hoc schedule allowed for me to manage my mother’s supervision, medical care and numerous responsibilities; her situation would require constant support through May and into the first weeks of June.  My LSATs came and went and I dedicated the balance of my available time to their preparation.

In the first weeks of May I began contributing to a small political analysis website, Global Power and Strategy analysis, initially as an incited consultant now as a contributor.  From May 31st through August 19th I held a full time internship at NAME OMITTED, a full service law firm located in Morristown, New Jersey.  This experience has provided me with a look into the actual culture of a law firm and strengthened my resolve to pursue a professional legal career.

The sum of my experiences over the past year have brought a number of things to light, the most important is that I must, assume responsibility for myself, like I did for my brother and subsequently my mother.  While I may have been able to feign reasonability during my undergraduate career, my brother’s addiction and my mother’s illness required no less than genuine commitment and reasonability.  Starting my own business has made me responsible for myself in real and empirical terms, if I fail to remain committed to my endeavors, surly they will fail.  The past year has forced me to grow in ways I had not as in undergraduate student.  I am committed to attending law school and anxious to assume the responsibilities that will no doubt accompany such an endeavor.

I've managed to land an internship with a ~~popular~~ upcoming startup at Bangalore, and would be arriving there in December this year. Sadly, I don't know anybody in Bangalore (don't have any friends/relatives/contacts) and neither does the company provide accommodation. The internship lasts for 2 months, and I have no idea where to look for space.

I'm a fairly neat and clean guy, and will stay indoors for minimal timings (would spent most of my time working). I'm obviously not in any position to make demands, but I'd prefer something closer to office which is in Jayanagar. Willing to share a room/PG with others and hoping for a reasonable rent expectation.

k9zbl,0,2011-09-09,Honest feedback on my roster please! ,p_U_c_K,fantasyfootball,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/k9zbl/honest_feedback_on_my_roster_please/,"Paid 30 bucks, 10 man league, auction style, $200 a head.

QBs- Brady/Cutler
RBs- Peterson/Gerhart, Michael Turner, Beanie Wells, Marion Barber
WR- Wes Welker, Chad Ocho Cinco, Percy Harvin, Randy Moss, Roy Williams
TEs- Todd Heap, Kyle Rudolph (I'm a vikes fan, and I have a feeling he's gonna be a strong contender for ROY, watch)
K- Mason Crosby GB
D- VIkes

This is a 25 yard per point passing, 4 point per TD QB league. 

What do you guys think? I think I did okay. I'm digging my 1 2 punch with AP and Turner, and think Beanie will surprise a lot of people now that he has the reigns with hightower gone and chester hurt and mainly a third down back (plus, after what he did in CHI last year, or didn't do, I think he is going to be a nonfactor). Barber, while hurt, was tearing it up in the preseason I heard, I would love for him to get back to beast mode, I know people are saying he's done, but fuck man, he's only 28. I'm 27 and despite my love handles I can still rock a 12 minute mile. 

As for Moss, why not, he only cost me 49 dollars (joke, I spent my last dollaridoo on him after some dickface gaffled berrian from me. Holy shit, wow, I just had the worst deva vu of my entire life. Imagine, Brady, with His deep threat (moss) his sideline and over the middle (sometimes, if no one is there to hit him) guy (ocho) and his dump off and run for 15-20 guy (welker), the double point capabilities makes my weiner shift sides. 

As for Rudolph. If anyone here has been watching vikes preseason games they'd know mike mayock would spread his butt cheeks wide open for the dude. I guess he's like the second coming of jermichael finley. A wr in the TE's body in a white commentators buttcrack (mayock). Shiancoe is getting up tehre, and hasn't played a down this preseason, and I know that musgrave likes to run 2 TE sets, and dude has hands and could be a touchdown machine in the red zone, especially inside the 5, I can see a lot of play action roll out tosses to him, since it's well known mcnabb is racist. 

The vikes D was basically a homer move. I don't think we've had an interception since sharper left. But I only had 1 dollar left and regardless of the reality of our LB situation and DB situation, every season preview keeps saying that our defense is elite and going to keep us in games. I don't know how that's possible when one of your LB's is erin henderson, who is no joke a radio station intern and one of your safeties hasn't eaten in a month for ramadan and refuses to touch the football because it's made of a variation of pork. 

Some dudes did auto picks and man, that system needs new code. They ended up with like 5 RB's and still had 65 dollars at the end of the draft. They must've done a number on their rating system. I don't think I have much competition, here's the other squads, let me know what you guys think of them (as in, who is best, worst, etc.)

k9z86,1,2011-09-09,IAmA very unhappy person who had to write this out,[deleted],IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/k9z86/iama_very_unhappy_person_who_had_to_write_this_out/,"I cant sleep, its 4am and i just cracked a beer out of reflex. Hopefully i dont come off as melodramatic in this, but i had to write it all down because im so very confused. I cant really talk to anyone about whats been going on with me, so hopefully the internet will have some fatherly advice/guidance for me.

I got into a relationship that lasted about 2 years, towards the end i started to put some very strange coincidental things together that led me to believe my girlfriend cheated on me awhile back, and was now cheating on me with someone else. This was never made obvious, I could only put odd things together. I dont know how to phrase it exactly- but it was almost prophesied (ask me to elaborate and ill explain why i used that word). I never had the evidence or situation where i could talk about it openly without some sort of backlash about me not trusting her, this drove me insane. I became heavily depressed from here and i began to smoke or drink everyday.

Surprisingly, im over the fact that i was cheated on. I look back with disgust at the class of people i was associating with through her. Nonetheless how it all ended really took its toll on my physiologically. It's made me fuck up a lot of things, so if you get a kick out of that I suggest you keep reading.

I showed up at her place, we were celebrating her sister's birthday. They made sure i was drunk and high for this shit, and i couldn't say no. I was getting strategically fucked with while sedated, i had no idea how to react. They did everything they could to isolate me from conversation, they would speak their language unless they wanted me to hear something. They were trying very hard to convey that i wasn't part of the family. We were eating appetizers, bread; i had my share and i was offered more from another batch and i politely refused. I was told to eat it by my ex'es fiancee, who i considered a brother and vise versa not too long ago. My mouth became so dry i could barely talk. We went down to play ping pong with her father and the fiancee- I played a few then sat out, they began trying to indirectly hit me with the ball. I took notice and i went up stairs; I am then told to start the barbecue. No problem. Turn it on, wait, wait some more. Im outside alone at this point- i briskly come back in; leaving it on- ask if someone is going to throw the chicken on- then i realize they are fucking with me so i turn it back off. The fiancee and the father then tend to it without me, i come back out to see if i can help- and they just walked away pretty much. I get to talking to them eventually, im getting insulted indirectly again; i get fingered by the fiancee who is scratching his face.

I go to the kitchen and idle. I overhear my girlfriend talking about people i dont know. More shit happens, but it ends up with me downstairs and her yelling everything she is saying so her grandparents and her family can hear from upstairs. Her sister comes down to talk to me, im confused as to why the fuck she would get involved- and she has this smug fucking look over her face the entire time that i wil always remember. At this point, I cant talk my way out of anything; my mouth is dry, im high and drunk- and im in a situation where the outcome is going to be bad regardless. The fiancee follows me outside as I attempt to leave, we walk to the park where there is this conveniently placed purple bike in a clearing. Im speechless at this point and leave before a car pulls up to the side of the road.

I leave because I dont want to follow their plan anymore.

The next day I have her over, we talk for an hour, her poorly hinting that the relationship is dead- I rage fuck her for 5 minutes, something told me to do this because i feel like i've been fucked over. We talk for another 10, I blurt out 'im sick of it'. I wish i savoured it more, but she leaves immediately. I never got to tell her how fucking terrible her family is. I never had the chance to express my hate- and because i wasn't a coward about it. Which really gets to me. She puts me through a physiological gangbang that her and her entire inbred family gets to take part in, but I didn't get the chance to put her through her share.

Soon after i find myself interning at a place full of professionals that i respect. I have to learn a program, but i dont learn it enough because im drinking or smoking everyday at this point. A month passes by after a series of awkward introductions and amateur mistakes, im laid off because I kept fucking up. Im very good at what i do, and i got the internship for a reason, but i managed to look like a complete idiot throughout because i couldn't stop thinking about what i would say to my ex.

But in the middle of my internship I was taken out with a friend who introduced me to this beautiful actress. We hit it off and I felt like I was going to be happy soon. We go to the beach, and drink a bottle of wine watching the sunset. We head back to her place, and pick up another bottle of wine, and I pretty much clear the thing.

I black out in her bed, probably for a while. I remember waking up after a series of strange dreams, I somehow still manage to talk myself into a second date but in the morning she changes her mind. This acted as a catalyst for my failure.

From this point on, i've blacked out 2 other times within a month and I dont know my limit anymore.

I get around to hanging out with my friends more, but i fear a few (yes, a few) of them might be gay, because i feel like im getting hit on all the time. If they are gay thats fine- but i sure as fuck dont like getting hit on by my friends because i have no idea how to react. This has only started happening as of recent.

k9yx3,0,2011-09-09,IAmA very unhappy person who had to write this down,[deleted],reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/k9yx3/iama_very_unhappy_person_who_had_to_write_this/,"I cant sleep, its 4am and i just cracked a beer out of reflex. Hopefully i dont come off as melodramatic in this, but i had to write it all down because im so very confused. I cant really talk to anyone about whats been going on with me, so hopefully the internet will have some fatherly advice/guidance for me.

I got into a relationship that lasted about 2 years, towards the end i started to put some very strange coincidental things together that led me to believe my girlfriend cheated on me awhile back, and was now cheating on me with someone else. This was never made obvious, I could only put odd things together. I dont know how to phrase it exactly- but it was almost prophesied (ask me to elaborate and ill explain why i used that word). I never had the evidence or situation where i could talk about it openly without some sort of backlash about me not trusting her, this drove me insane. I became heavily depressed from here and i began to smoke or drink everyday.

Surprisingly, im over the fact that i was cheated on. I look back with disgust at the class of people i was associating with through her. I look down on them in some ways really, they just seem so primitive. Nonetheless how it all ended really took its toll on my physiologically. It's made me fuck up a lot of things, so if you get a kick out of that I suggest you keep reading.

I showed up at her place, we were celebrating her sister's birthday. They made sure i was drunk and high for this shit, and i couldn't say no. I was getting strategically fucked with while sedated, i had no idea how to react. They did everything they could to isolate me from conversation, they would speak their language unless they wanted me to hear something. They were trying very hard to convey that i wasn't part of the family. We were eating appetizers, bread; i had my share and i was offered more from another batch and i politely refused. I was told to eat it by my ex'es fiancee, who i considered a brother and vise versa not too long ago. My mouth became so dry i could barely talk. We went down to play ping pong with her father and the fiancee- I played a few then sat out, they began trying to indirectly hit me with the ball. I took notice and i went up stairs; I am then told to start the barbecue. No problem. Turn it on, wait, wait some more. Im outside alone at this point- i briskly come back in; leaving it on- ask if someone is going to throw the chicken on- then i realize they are fucking with me so i turn it back off. The fiancee and the father then tend to it without me, i come back out to see if i can help- and they just walked away pretty much. I get to talking to them eventually, im getting insulted indirectly again; i get fingered by the fiancee who is scratching his face. 

I go to the kitchen and idle. I overhear my girlfriend talking about people i dont know. More shit happens, but it ends up with me downstairs and her yelling everything she is saying so her grandparents and her family can hear from upstairs. Her sister comes down to talk to me, im confused as to why the fuck she would get involved- and she has this smug fucking look over her face the entire time that i wil always remember. At this point, I cant talk my way out of anything; my mouth is dry, im high and drunk- and im in a situation where the outcome is going to be bad regardless. The fiancee follows me outside as I attempt to leave, we walk to the park where there is this conveniently placed purple bike in a clearing. Im speechless at this point and leave before a car pulls up to the side of the road.

I leave because I dont want to follow their plan anymore.

The next day I have her over, we talk for an hour, her poorly hinting that the relationship is dead- I rage fuck her for 5 minutes, something told me to do this because i feel like i've been fucked over. We talk for another 10, I blurt out 'im sick of it'. I wish i savoured it more, but she leaves immediately. I never got to tell her how fucking terrible her family is. I never had the chance to express my hate- and because i wasn't a coward about it. Which really gets to me. She puts me through a physiological gangbang that her and her entire inbred family gets to take part in, but I didn't get the chance to put her through her share.

Soon after i find myself interning at a place full of professionals that i respect. I have to learn a program, but i dont learn it enough because im drinking or smoking everyday at this point. A month passes by after a series of awkward introductions and amateur mistakes, im laid off because I kept fucking up. Im very good at what i do, and i got the internship for a reason, but i managed to look like a complete idiot throughout because i couldn't stop thinking about what i would say to my ex. 

But in the middle of my internship I was taken out with a friend who introduced me to this beautiful actress. We hit it off and I felt like I was going to be happy soon. We go to the beach, and drink a bottle of wine watching the sunset. We head back to her place, and pick up another bottle of wine, and I pretty much clear the thing.

I black out in her bed, probably for a while. I remember waking up after a series of strange dreams, I somehow still manage to talk myself into a second date but in the morning she changes her mind. This acted as a catalyst for my failure.

From this point on, i've blacked out 2 other times within a month and I dont know my limit anymore.

I get around to hanging out with my friends more, but i fear a few (yes, a few) of them might be gay, because i feel like im getting hit on all the time. If they are gay thats fine- but i sure as fuck dont like getting hit on by my friends because i have no idea how to react. This has only started happening as of recent.

k9x5u,1,2011-09-09,To what kind of jobs should I be applying? (Cross-post from Red Stick),[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/k9x5u/to_what_kind_of_jobs_should_i_be_applying/,"I quit my private school job voluntarily in May (or rather chose not to renew my contract) in an attempt to try to find a better paying one, but teacher jobs in the area are pretty frozen. It is extremely difficult to look for a job while having another in teaching.

Let me give you some background:

I have been looking for work since May. I have applied to literally hundreds of jobs (had a few interviews) and am doing the state job application thing right now. I have taken and passed the Coast and PET, and apply for jobs I qualify for daily. I do everything, apply from Craigslist, local job sites, go in person with my resume, call and e-mail afterward, the whole nine yards. 

I have a degree in Secondary English Education, a teaching certificate, and am highly qualified in the state (PRAXIS I and II).

I have four years professional teaching experience. I have taught high school literature, ESL in South Korea, and 5th-8th grade social studies and ELA.

I have been a political intern for David Vitter (this may help or hinder, haha) as well as a volunteer at an orphanage.

I have excellent office/clerical/communication skills, am female, and in my mid-20s.

At this point I am just looking to pay my bills, but, of course, I would prefer something serious that pays upwards of $12 an hour if I am going to commute 2 hours a day (to bigger cities like New Orleans or Baton Rouge - I live somewhere in between them). I am realistic, however, and know personally how terrible the job market is right now.

I have to stay in the area because my husband is in college. I would prefer to pay in-state tuition. We would consider moving if I could find a decent enough job out-of-state.

A lot of potential employers don't seem to understand that I have skills beyond teaching, and that teaching is also a clerical type position in which multi-tasking is crucial. It seems like they just see ""teacher."" 

If you have any advice it would be much appreciated.

tl;dr Who would hire a former teacher and to who should I be applying?"

A little about me? Well, long story short, I'm a Web Design student finishing up in the spring. Between working to pay off debts and studying, I haven't really had much time to get together as outstanding of a portfolio as I would like to have. That said, I do have one with a handful of front-end web projects, as well as some animation! 

Where is this mysterious portfolio, you ask? Right here: http://zachgod.in 

Why I'm looking for freelance jobs? I'm currently doing an unpaid internship with a local company (as is requirement for my graduating). While I do have enough to support myself for a little bit, there's a long story that I can sum up with saying that a) I need more experience so I can build a better portfolio, and thus get better work... and b) my mother and I are going to be moving from Ontario to Birmingham in England in April, so I figured the more money helps!

**What I Do!**
HTML/CSS (including HTML5/CSS3) / Fluid &amp; Responsive layouts / Flash Animation (I don't do, or believe in, Flash sites, but if you would like one, I'm more than willing to negotiate) / Basic graphic design / Email forms / Light Javascript/jQuery / Light PHP / Adhere to web standards and practices

**What I Don't Do!**
Back-end web development / Setting up servers / Trade sexual favours for divs 


Ideally, updating websites, static pages (though I can work with setting up dynamic pages; I'm not *that* useless!), banner ads, logos, inquiry forms and more of the awesome stuff that just makes your work look good!

I'm very, very, *veeeeeeeeeeeery* easy to negotiate with when it comes to cost. For example, I'd say a static 4 page website with a simple email/inquiry form would run for $150-$175. That said, I'm not going to overcharge you. You need a project done cheap, I need experience and some money: we can help each other out!

If you're interested, fire me a PM or just email me at zachjgodin@gmail.com! Look forward to hearing from y'all!

Cheers,

kbgpo,2,2011-09-10,How do I deal with this woman?!,[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/kbgpo/how_do_i_deal_with_this_woman/,"Hello Reddit - first post and I hope it's in the right sub.

About 8 months ago I started dating my boyfriend online and it advanced to me moving to his city in western Canada to look for work. It seemed ideal since he had the basement suite of his house to himself, which was completely private and separate from the other floors of the house. Was. 

I successfully completed my IT internship in eastern Canada before excitedly booking my plane tickets for the week after my birthday in April. Things were going really well and our communication was really solid, even with it having been online. 

For the first two months or so I got along with everyone great, met the family and some extended family. I did, however, begin to notice that his sister who still lives at home had a few mental health problems which began to get worse but his mother always tried to shush it up or play it off as no big deal. I have no experience with this but having researched online it seems quiet a lot like bi polar disorder, in an extreme case. She would be lovely to me one second and call me a whore/slut/etc. the next. Her mother, who was being very nice to me before this began to go through my personal belongings such as my laptop. Upon not finding anything she proceeded to make things up to my boyfriend about me speaking to other men or keeping my past a secret from him (I was previously married, he knows that). This escalated to a point in August where upon coming home from my part-time barista job I found my boyfriend's grandmother dead on the main floor of the house. I did not panic, I dealt with everything as best as I could that way and supported his mum and his sister through all of it. Including making the memorium, helping to choose location, flowers, clergy, thank you notes. All with no thanks in return.

Despite helping and being supportive, my living situation has got worse. His sister has a habit of opening the door to the suite and shouting obscenities at me as well as making up bizarre lies like ""she was out talking to the mailman this morning you better watch it your girlfriend is such a slut!!"". His mother began gambling again and took me along with her twice as I didn't have a choice being on the other side of the city in a dodgy area without a vehicle. About four years ago she ran into major trouble and gambled away over 430 grand of her inheritance. I didn't want to see that happen again and told my boyfriend who tried to bring it up to her as calmly as he could.

Huge mistake? 

She cornered me on the way to pay a bill about a week ago and started screaming, pounding the back of the car seat, calling me an untrustworthy slut, whore, useless, that I should go die. When the car stopped she got out of the backseat and made a motion to clock me one in the face. Kept screaming about how I've ruined her relationship with her son (insert more batshit crazy stuff here). I'm fully aware that this is not normal behaviour in any person, let alone an adult and since then things have escalated. I don't feel particularly safe on my own in this house. My boyfriend is lovely and has stood by me in everything but we cannot afford to get our own place in such an expensive city until I get a full time job. He is appealing to me to ""just ignore it"" which is extremely difficult.

And so my question is - WTH can I reasonably do ? 

TL;DR : My boyfriends family is batshit crazy. "

kbb4a,0,2011-09-10,Not looking to start a trend but... can I also get some feedback on my Personal Statement???,SisterRayVU,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/kbb4a/not_looking_to_start_a_trend_but_can_i_also_get/,"Very rough first draft. If anyone can help me out with style, content, and grammar, I'd appreciate it. Also xposting to TLS in a bit when I get to my computer. I really need my PS to be as strong as possible to make up for weaker areas (coughGPAcough).


I started as a punk. Going in to university, I had an unflinching attitude about me. Political and impassioned, I wanted to take part in the storied history of campus activism. I would influence my area's politics through sit-ins and direct action, megaphones and placards. But over the course of four years, I matured into something quite different.


As a freshman, I joined the new Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). We worked for leftist causes through flyering, speeches, and very visible protests. The very first project I took part in proved to be my proudest moment with the group. We organized a large protest in opposition to the war in Iraq and I held the responsibility of writing the press packets and contacting the media about the event. Following this, though, SDS fell into what I believed to be self-serving actions. Though I still took part, I grew disillusioned with the prospect of bothering students about eating at Chik-Fil-A. By the end of my first year, I realized that our actions ceased to be effective and became exercises in extremist movements. People actually spoke proudly about shoving a cop simply because he asked us to remain on the sidewalk during a protest. Still, I cynically believed that the 'system' offered me no recourse in achieving my political goals. 


For a bit, I lost touch with campus and local politics. I watched the news, of course, and kept up with the 2008 election season, but I did not keep up my direct involvement. That is, until I started to miss it. I enjoyed talking to people about the issues and working towards what I believed in. The heart of what we did in SDS was pure even if the motives were not. So I did something that my Freshman self would not have done; I looked up candidates for office. I saw an underdog running for Congress that resonated with me. (REMOVED)'s platform was nothing short of relentless. He embodied my ideal candidate and I resolved myself to work for him. In that first election, we overcame the odds in the primary and (REMOVED) won a close general election to become the first Democratic congressman in the district since 1983. 


I rode the high of that victory and, as soon as I had the time, applied for an internship at his local office. Before I knew it, I woke up at six AM, caught the early bus downtown, and put on a tie in the morning. I, who had a mohawk as a Freshman, became 'domesticated'. But in all seriousness, the work we did in the office made me proud. I saw the disadvantaged actually receiving help from a politician. We paid attention to the issues and complaints. We were not this unforgiving and faceless machine; we had a humanity about us that made me optimistic. So when I got the call to join the second campaign in an elevated role, I jumped at it.


Throughout that midterm election cycle, I ran into old friends from SDS at parades or other events. We talked and reminisced but I sensed an air of disappointment, that they thought less of me in working for a politician. To them, the government was inherently unjust and to work with it was tantamount to treason. But I witnessed the people I once stood with still struggling to achieve that which they set out to do. Their goals were too lofty. Their strategy, too inflexible. They resorted to direct action instead of discussion, confrontation instead of communication. Yet, they failed to adjust in the face of adversity.


And this is precisely why I'd not only be a strong law student, but a strong lawyer. I possess the ability to adapt, to assume different roles depending on the situation, to mature and be molded. I have grown from being a brash and young protest kid, hopelessly devoted to some rigid notion of an 'ideal', into a person involved in my area's politics and cognizant of the fact that compromise is not dirty but a necessity. I have not lost my gumption, however. Instead, I have learned to funnel my passion towards productive ends and law school provides me with the best opportunity to meet those ends. I think back through American history and while, yes, some people affected serious change as outsiders, the majority did it through ingraining themselves in the system and working it to their advantage. It is that company that I want to keep and those people I want to follow.



EDIT: In going over the last PS post, I figured maybe it's best to remove the politician's name. It's not hard to figure out but nevertheless, I'd rather be cautious. Also added one sentence in the conclusion."

Info about me: I rarely drink and turn 21 in a 3 months. I was not driving anywhere this night, as it was within walking distance to my house. I'm in ohio. Anyway, here's the story.

Last night I went to a friends birthday party, there was alcohol there. So I had a few beers and a couple of shots. Eventually a noise complaint was called and the police came. I was unaware at the time, but there were minors there and two were streaking so that's what got the cops to start asking questions. There was about 10 people total, we were all polite. 

They made us blow, I received a .099 They gave everyone a citation along with a court date. 

My questions are: how much shit am I really in? Can this potentially mess anything up in my future much? Im in college and do internships. Do I have much to worry about?

kayk2,18,2011-09-10,Life science undergrad to bioengineering PhD. Seeking insight. (xpost to /r/engineering),pills_here,biology,https://www.reddit.com/r/biology/comments/kayk2/life_science_undergrad_to_bioengineering_phd/,"Hi guys, looking for some down to earth career advice.

I'm a 4th year undergrad at Berkeley double majoring in two life sciences. I spent my junior year and the summer before working in a lab doing molecular cell biology work. This summer I did an internship using molecular biology on a biomass project at a major biotech in the Bay Area. Currently, I've found a new lab position working on plant molecular biology and biochemsitry, again for biofuel applications.

Throughout my undergraduate research career, I've found myself interested in the subject matter of biology but frustrated and disillusioned with the approaches. On the other hand, while I am not intrigued by topics in traditional engineering, I find myself attracted to the problem-solving, applications-oriented; goal and solution nature of engineering. They say college is great for self discovery and I've thoroughly discovered that I cannot toil solely for the pursuit of knowledge. My specific interests are to utilize novel molecular methods to address global issues that will hopefully turn into full-fledged industries in coming years (waste recycling, alternative energy, targeted gene therapy, tissue-specific drug delivery, etc.). At this point, I am almost certain I will be applying to graduate school for a PhD in the year or two after I graduate. I will seek an entry level research job in the meantime. My dilemma is whether to go with traditional molecular biology/biochemistry/molecular genetics, or to venture into bioengineering. 

My question to reddit is whether or not the switch to bioengineering sounds like a good move for me or is even feasible. I know I will need to make up many classes during my PhD. If I decide now, I could take engineering related courses at a community college prior to graduate school. How is the job market (assuming the economy recovers a bit in  6-7 years) for bioengineering PhDs with focus on molecular/cellular engineering or synthetic biology? I know from many sources that a bioengineering BS is too unfocused and not very employable in its current iteration. Does the same hold true for PhDs or does the inherent specialization resolve that issue? Is there a lot of stigma related to the unproven fields within bioengineering, such that traditional fields like molecular biology would be preferred? Are these fields what I believe them to be, in regards to taking an engineering approach to molecular biology? I would hugely appreciate any input, especially from anyone working in or with the fields of bioengineering I am interested in, or those who have made the jump from basic life sciences to bioengineering.

And just for fun, do you think the industries I've envisioned will come to full fruition in the next 20-30 years?"

kcd36,3,2011-09-11,On moving out and travelling. Would love some advice on my plans.,SturmD,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/kcd36/on_moving_out_and_travelling_would_love_some/,"I need a bit of help figuring out the next few years of my life.

Right now, this is the plan:

2011/2012: 3rd year of School.
2012/2013: ~14-16 month paid internship
2013/2014: Last year of school + part time job
2014 onwards: Work

I will turn 23 about two months after I graduate school. Right now, I live at home since I go to school at the local university. I want to continue living at home throughout the internship. 

My girlfriend and I plan to move out/get married sometime in the last year of school. Living apart and with parents is stressful, and it will keep getting more stressful as we grow older. With the internship and saved money, we should be able to put at least a $40,000 down payment on a ~$180,000 condominium.

We don't really want to rent if it means paying around the same amount per month, but for someone else's mortgage.

We plan to have children at around 30 years old, so that gives us about 7 more years after I graduate to be child-free. In those 7 years, we would love to travel around a bit.

Now, this is where I need advice. Let's say we move out in my fourth year and put $40k down. I'm not sure how much condo fees will be, nor how much a mortgage will cost. I'm also not sure if it would be a better idea to get a student loan to pay off more of the condo and pay that off instead of a mortgage.

But since we want to travel, we need to save up, too. Especially because we plan to travel for an entire year. So I'm wondering if we should travel right after I finish my last year of school instead. But then we might not have enough to move out. Also, I've noticed that people that take the internship program can sometimes get jobs right after school at the place they interned. I guess that would be cancelled, too. 

So I was considering working for around 3 years. We'd be 26 then, with a condo, and hopefully a bit saved up to go a-travelling. I would be able to quit my job if they wouldn't let me take a year off, but still have that vital experience when looking for other work.

Does this sound like a good plan..? What would you do? Does anyone know if there are specific people you can talk to about this?"

kbzdv,55,2011-09-11,my decision,uivengp,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kbzdv/my_decision/,"I need to stop writing this, just gonna post it.

I'm going to kill myself.

I'm going to fall.

I'm going to do it after seeing my mental health counselor early next week.

It's better that I die.

This isn't my first time planning my end.  I faced a decision when I turned 20 to either kill myself or take action on my transgender feelings which had been plaguing me since… about as long as I can remember.  I went into it knowing damn near everything about the process, having researched it extensively.  I've tried keeping my expectations low knowing how unreasonable expectations can cause problems.

I'm 24 now.  I was on hormones for most of the last four years, making little progress.  At this point I can't even afford them.  I've been taking my expired spironolactone in a desperate attempt to keep my testosterone down.  I don't believe it possible for me to come to terms with my body.

I pick my skin severely, mostly on my right arm, stomach, face, and legs from torso to knees.  This started in high school, which was quite stressful.  I mostly pick in the bathroom, which has been a constant source of stress as long as I can remember.  I have issues pooping, or, well, wiping.  I wipe until I feel clean, inspecting the toilet paper after each wipe.  Typically the toilet paper is blooded by the time I'm done wiping.  Family and friends have noticed this behavior, at one point friends made it a unit of time measurement in school.  I've given this an awful lot of attention throughout my life, developing as efficient a system as I could to minimize it's impact.  I use exactly two pieces of toilet paper per wipe, wrapped around three fingers twice, if it's not terribly messy you can fold it again after the first wipe for a second.  Spitting on the toilet paper also does wonders (for the baby wipes folks or whoever).  I'm sorry about the detail.

I'm incredibly bothered by farting, I make every effort to fart on a toilet.

I have many friends who are wonderful and genuinely care for me.  I can't talk to any of them about any of my problems.  I can't burden them.  I hate to burden anyone.  I'm scared if I don't kill myself I'll end up burdening the people I care about more and more.  I can't allow that possibility.

I've been seeing a counselor person since I was planning on killing myself last, some months ago.  I was talked into going to an emergency room by a suicide hotline.  Misinformed that they wouldn't be able to hold me against my will.  Once I was informed I did everything in my power to fight it.  I don't feel there's any coming back from that point.  I am terrified of loosing control of my life.  With the intervention of some friends they settled on getting me into an outpatient program with a promise that I wouldn't kill myself in the interim.

I don't feel the counselor has helped, or the doctor I've been seeing for meds.  I've never believed much in medication.  They initially had me on citalopram, which has apparently shown efficacy in treating dermatillomania.  I didn't feel that was helping, and didn't particularly enjoy the side effects.  They now have me on lamotrigine.

I hate myself for all the stupid decisions I've made.  From 18 to 23 I've been employed as a web developer, offered an internship with the school district following a programming class which was largely PHP and moving on to better jobs after that.  I was making more than my parents, I had money saved, I felt secure in that aspect of my life.

Then I lost my job.  I wasn't fired, the company ran into financial trouble.  I was told to get onto unemployment by my boss, and I started it the day after.  I didn't collect on any of it for the next 9 months, burning through my savings instead because of my obsession with not wanting to be one of those people who exploits the system.  I was just stupid.  I've been stupid a lot.

I've held a few jobs that didn't last long since then.  It's been very hard finding work.  I wasn't able to handle the stress of my last developer job.  I've completely lost faith in myself as a programmer.

While I hold no love for myself, I've done everything I could for others, to the best of my abilities.  I've been doing an older neighbors laundry for a long time because she has trouble, I've tried to not let her pay me, but she insists.  She is wonderful.  She is concerned for me and frustrated by my behavior, which is entirely reasonable.  This is why I can't share with people, it just hurts them more.

I never know what to fucking say.  I've never shared this much before.  It's not like I haven't tried to get over this… I know I'm weak… but I'm not entirely without hope, or I wouldn't post here in the first place.  (and I like the idea of leaving at least my own written account of myself somewhere, however much not touched on.)

I'm sorry.  Please don't feel pressured to respond."
kbtbt,7,2011-09-11,"Bad grades in first year, can I still manage to get an internship?",[deleted],ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/kbtbt/bad_grades_in_first_year_can_i_still_manage_to/,"I basically spent 3 years doing first year engineering courses, which were general physics, chemistry, mechanics, and some calculus, because I had to withdraw from university and attend community college. I failed most courses in first year, and my GPA in the two college years were pretty dismal as well. Probably in the low 2's.

I am now back in university, finally majoring in EE, and did okay in my second year. 76%, which for us Canadians is around a 3.3/4.0. 

Is there any way to save my ass and get an internship for the coming summer with those grades? I did not join the co-op program last year and that was the deadline, because of laziness and stupidity. I speculate that my grades will be even higher this year, so I'm hoping the fact that I am doing okay in actual EE-related courses will help a little. Any ideas?"
kbs49,6,2011-09-11,Suggestion for this subreddit,TheNoveltyAccountant,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/kbs49/suggestion_for_this_subreddit/,"Lately we seem to be getting a fair amount of people who want advice for Resumes and/or landing internships with big4.

I'm suggesting that we have a FAQ thread which we can link to on the right hand side to deal with these things.

For instance, the FAQ thread could deal with:

- Suggestions for resumes (including a link to [resumes](http://www.reddit.com/r/resumes) and [proofreading](http://www.reddit.com/r/proofreading)
- Suggestions for landing an internship
- Comparison between big4 and smaller firms/private enterprise
- Other regularly recurring topics.

That way people can have a large share of their questions answered in a single thread rather than bring up similar issues on a weekly/monthly basis.

We can always then just update the original thread when we see something new that we'd like to add to it.

Another side suggestion would be to give people a tag with their specialist area similar to what's done in [askscience](http://www.reddit.com/r/Askscience). For instance tax, audit, management accounting, financial accounting etc and maybe also a country (E.g. US, Aus, UK, Canada)."

kdj16,3,2011-09-12,My inexperience is holding me back,needinsomehelp,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/kdj16/my_inexperience_is_holding_me_back/,"So I had been dating a girl for a little over a year and a half (my first girlfriend, 2nd girl I ever had sex with; she had a few short term relationships and had been with quite a few guys). Just as summer was approaching, our relationship started to become rocky, as we both started taking each other for granted. I went away on an internship, and things only got worse.

She started asking to go on an ""unexclusive break"", which to me just sounded like she wanted to fuck other guys. This made me break up with her. It was really hard for a little while, but eventually I got used to the idea of being alone.

When I got back to school, we started hanging out again, and generally started acting like a couple. I love this girl, and want to start dating again, but I just can't. While we were separated, she hooked up with 3 different guys (more people than I've been with including her) while I felt like I wasn't ready to do that. 

She wants to get back together, and I do too, but everytime I'm with her, all I can think about is the other guys shes been with. I don't hate her for what she did, I'm just jealous. I don't think I could ever go back to her without going out and hooking up with other girls, but the thought of her doing the same is destroying me. 

Getting back with her now feels like I'd just be too focused on what shes done, and would eventually sabotage our relationship, but being apart just feels wrong. What should I do?"

Every employer I have worked for has found me to be an asset to their company; before moving to Davis the JW Marriott that I was employed offered to move me to a management position as incentive to stay but I declined because I wanted to attend UC Davis to obtain a degree. I am able to give references from all my past employers.



----

TLDR: Experience as an office assistant, working in a television news station and working for a JW Marriott. Knowledge using Microsoft Office programs, editing video, Photoshop and using HD cameras. Excellent in communicating with clients. I can email you my full resume, a cover letter upon request and references (potentially a letter of recommendation from my current internship.) "

Historic Mount Wilson Observatory  is an astronomical research facility located in the San Gabriel Mountains of Southern California. Located on the summit of Mount Wilson above Pasadena at an altitude of 5715 feet (1742 meters), the Observatory is visible from much of the Los Angeles area.

This is an occasion to meet astronomers in a tour not available to the public. We'll view the historic Hooker 100-inch telescope from the Visitors' Gallery inside the dome. This telescope was the largest in the world at the turn of the 20th century and used by Hubble to observe the expansion of the universe. We'll also visit the CHARA interferometer, where astronomers will answer questions about the universe, life and everything....

This event has a waiting list, but we’ll be doing a larger weekend trip to Palomar Observatory in the coming months.

kd4br,1,2011-09-12,Would it be helpful to have a place that compiles the web sites that Redditors generally disapprove of?,OmegaSeven,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/kd4br/would_it_be_helpful_to_have_a_place_that_compiles/,"What I'm thinking is to have a list somewhere that could give a clue to new users as to what sites are generally frowned upon and why.

I've been here close to six months now and this is what I've figured out so far, I doubt it's an exhaustive list and please correct me where I'm wrong.

* Funyjunk: disliked for users posting unaccredited (sometimes slightly modified) content from Reddit and other sited and then initially refusing to rectify the situation. The Oatmeal seemed to be a major focus of this controversy.

* The ""Cheezeburger"" network: Similarly posting content from other websites without attribution to the original source.

* The Gawker family of websites: The opinion seems to be that the content on these sights is generally poor, the recent layout changes are annoying and that apparently some of the interns they hire have poor dating etiquette.

* Social Networks: I see a growing consensus that screen captures of arguments or funny occurrences on social networking sites (such as Facebook) aren't very popular. I think the jury is still out on this one and it really depends on what community you are posting in.

* Political Blogs: There also seems to be pretty healthy debate regarding certain political web sites. This one's harder to put my finger on and might just be a factor of disliking differing opinions.

The reason I'm writing this post is, if nothing else, is to attempt to generally not piss people off. I know this won't solve any real problems but it might give newer users such as myself a place to look for this kind of information should they seek it. "
kd48u,1,2011-09-12,"To Follow-Up, or not to Follow-Up. That is the question...which I elaborate on herein ",IAM_HenryClay_AMA,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/kd48u/to_followup_or_not_to_followup_that_is_the/,"I understand that 9/10 following up on your application can't hurt.

However, I work in an industry that generally frowns upon calls/drop-ins regarding positions. Almost any given listing will have some variation ""NO CALLS OR DROP-INS."" Most positions in the industry are hired from within (interns fill the bottom rung, and everyone else gets bumped up a level) or from referral by staff; self-marketing is not the norm. 

I've had my resume forwarded to the hiring party by a former colleague in an office the hiring party works closely with. I've also had an employee in a different branch of the hiring office, who knows the hiring party, call to put in a good word. 

Turnaround and hiring is extremely fast in my field -- 6 days to 3 weeks from opening to hire. It has been one week (granted, this includes the labor day weekend) since I applied. 

The listing for this job did not explicitly say to *not* call or drop by, but I'm not sure if that should be an unspoken assumption given the above (or if follow-up is necessary as I've had surrogates talking me up)

tl;dr Should I follow up on my application in an industry where followups are often frowned upon, but at an office that did not explicitly state *not* to follow up  and where I have contacts?

kctfv,31,2011-09-12,Has any engineer found a job with a GPA lower than a 3.0 when they graduated?,whaddddda,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/kctfv/has_any_engineer_found_a_job_with_a_gpa_lower/,"I'm a senior majoring in Electrical Engineering.  Right now I'm freaking out about my future because I'm afraid that I won't find a job with my low GPA. My current GPA is a 2.5.  

I know I'm not a lazy person.  I have a very good work ethic.  I work very hard.  I have a few jobs to help pay for school and I also had an internship this past summer.  Even my professors can say that although I do make mistakes, I work very hard and always put effort in my work. 

Although I'm hard working, I'll admit I've made plenty of mistakes.  The reason why my GPA is low is because I used to major in Mechanical Engineering and Industrial Engineering because I did not know which engineering discipline I wanted to go to.  It was the second half of my sophomore year that I found that Electrical Engineering was my calling.  

Upon switching, I struggled with the courses because my advisor told me to start off by taking the junior level courses instead of taking the sophomore level courses first. Now that I'm a senior, I'm making up the sophomore level courses (which is extremely easy now that I went through the junior level first) and taking my senior level courses (which isn't so bad since the workload is light compared to junior year).  

Anyway, I'm worried that companies won't even look at my resume because my GPA is low.  Having this GPA is also killing my self esteem for finding a job.  

How can I convey myself to these companies that I'm a hard worker and possess other great skills (Interpersonal skill, organizational skills ect)?

Is there anyone who have found a job with a GPA lower than a 3.0?  If you have, then how did you get there?"

Also, I have plenty of money saved up from working both a full-time and part-time job the past two summers as a high school student (OK, the full time one was technically an internship.  A very high paying engineering internship).  I was thinking I could use some of that for our travel expenses (she never worked much in high school, but might be getting a part time job soon), but she doesn't want me to pay for her.  I honestly don't think it's a big deal, since the flight is as much for my benefit as it is for hers.  If she can find a way to get the flight paid for, then I'm OK, unless if it puts her in a bad financial situation, but I don't want it to be a reason to not see each other.

kcr2w,2,2011-09-12,Have any of you been fooled by someone over the internet?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/kcr2w/have_any_of_you_been_fooled_by_someone_over_the/,"Here's the story. Around two and a half months ago I was contacted on AIM by an unknown person. We get to chatting, and it becomes apparent that she thought she was talking to one of her friends. She then exclaims that her friend's screen name is one number different than mine, and she got them confused. Thinking this is a cute coincidence, I decide to continue the conversation. We spoke for hours until I had to go to sleep. She then gave me her number and told me to text her if I wanted. What a cool/random occurrence!

The next day I get a call from her, in which she explains the previous night she went on aim and tried to talk to ""me,"" and ended up talking to another Matt. I then say: ""You realize you're speaking to 'the other Matt' right?"" Another cute occurrence I think (although to be honest I was getting a bit skeptical).

Fast forward two months later, we are talking every night for hours. She knows much about my life, I know much about hers. She tells me she got an internship in NY and that she's moving here (where I'm from) from L.A. I'll be as honest as possible, I thought I was falling for this girl. Now I'm not easily fooled, nor am I an idealist, but this girl was an incredibly good liar. When we first tried to Skype, she turned her video on, and the screen turned green. This then lead her to say she had to get her computer repaired. I believed her..for the while.

Finally I found out she was faking, and it fucking hurt being lied to like that. A couple nights ago I gave her a call and explained that I'm not angry, and it doesn't even matter how I knew she was faking, but what I didn't understand is how someone can be so ashamed of who they are that they have to make someone else up entirely. I asked if the name she told me was real, she replied ""no."" I told her she had a good heart, just with fucked up intentions. I finally said that I hope she finally learns to accept herself, that I am the last person she does this to, and that I hope she finds happiness.

Sorry for the long story, but I need to get this off my chest. Having so much trust in someone and having that trust so completely violated really sucks, and I have trust issues to begin with. I just wish I could find the girl she was posing as and tell her that someone is abusing her personal photos and such.

Anyway, my question: has anyone had something like this happen to them?"
kcqs5,1,2011-09-12,LD issues and a whole bunch of questions.,[deleted],relationshipadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipadvice/comments/kcqs5/ld_issues_and_a_whole_bunch_of_questions/,"This will probably be lengthy, so I apologize in advance, but I feel like it needs to be to accurately describe the situation in order to get helpful advice and opinions.

My manfriend and I have been dating for over 2 years now, but a lot of it has been long distance. We met doing an internship and were together nonstop for 6 months, but then had to separate to go back to our respective schools. We still dated. I had done LD before and he hadn't, but it wasn't too terrible. Then he lived with me over the following summer. We parted again, ended up breaking up for a few months, and then got back together. It just didn't feel right when we were apart, he said and I agreed. I lived with him this past summer and everything was awesome, but parting again was really difficult.

Alright, I have a bunch of questions, I guess.

He's an amazing, attentive, and supportive partner when we are actually together. When we are LD, he doesn't have time for me and sometimes I end up feeling like a burden. He'll call me at night to say goodnight before bed, but really only seems to like the call when I act happy and like I don't have a care in the world. When I have an actual problem, like missing him, I feel like I'm ""harshing his mellow"" and so less and less do I feel like I'm able to share my problems when I have them (not all that often, but this in and of itself is making it worse) with him. Should I kind of fake being happy to keep the calls light and him feeling like he's not making my life more sad? Should I always tell him the truth and sometimes it bring him down?

I'm about to graduate in December and he still has 3 and a half years of school (late to his major, etc.). I'm willing to move across the country to be with him and after a lot of consideration, I think it's what I want to do. I'd be fine living in an apartment in the same town and getting a job doing something that I finally enjoy! Sounds like a good time to me. But every time I try to talk to him about it, he doesn't sound enthusiastic. I feel like I'm the one making a slight sacrifice and he should be happier that I want to do it. Pretty much, he makes me feel rather unwanted and I'm sure it's not what he's trying to do, but it's how it comes across. I've told him that in the past and he told me that he worries that I'll come, not be able to find something, and end up failing. I try to take it as his concern, but in the end, I just feel like a burden. Should I just get over it and try to be okay and just go on with my plan? Or should I reconsider and re-evaluate his investment in the relationship?

Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, sometimes I just need to vent. Almost all of my friends are male and I'm female (I hope that's not a surprise by now). I feel like I can't really talk to them about what I'm going through because every time I've tried so far, one by one they've made it clear that they would rather that he and I break up so that I could date them. That's not really the advice I'm looking for, so should I just stop trying to ever talk about it (even when my guyfriends bring it up)? I've made it clear to each and every one of them that I'm not going to date them, but it seems like they'd rather give me an easy pass out of the relationship than try to actually help me talk through or solve my issues."

I recently broke up with my girlfriend of 17 months, (I am 21[M], she was 19[F]), I was head over heels in love, and i was her first boyfriend and she loved me even more (thats what she used to joke about anyway). We broke up on ""mutual"" terms, as in she thought it best to break up, because she wanted a job in the alps for 6 months and didnt think we would last being apart for so long, and i was supportive, as thats the only thing i could be. But i made it clear, i didnt want to break-up.

Anyway, turns out she never applied for the job but ""looked around"" but she maintains that she doesnt want a relationship anymore, and that i go to Uni too far away to make it carry on working.

Basically, the problem I am having is moving on. I'm not a very out-going person, give me a few beers and i can make a room chuckle and appear to be doing well, but inside i am a complete mess of anxiety and worrying what people think of me, so im scared of trying to move on in the rebound sense.

What also is a problem, is she still wants to be friends, and says she still loves me, and misses me. But she keeps saying she doesnt want a relationship.

Ive tried saying ""I cant do this, i need my space if you truly dont want a relationship, so i can move on"" she appears to understand and we wont text for 12-48 hours but then somehow we always end up talking again.

I loved/love her and dont know how to live without her, I think of her every moment of every day and miss all the little things, the comfort of a relationship etc.

Since i was young ive always struggled with depression, it hits hardest when going through mourning or when im very upset. This past year has been incredibly hard for me, ive lost 2 grandparents, but my girlfriend was always there to help me. However 3 weeks after we broke up, my mother was diagnosed with bowel cancer, and I told my ex, and she is worried about me and doesnt want to not talk to me, incase i do something ""stupid"". Everything in my life seems to be spinning out of control, ive got no motivation to work, and missed out on a Pixar Internship, i had a severe mental breakdown after my mum was diagnosed and missed my flight to a holiday and I just dont know what to do anymore.

I took a big step today, and asked my ex to stop contact completely and remove me from facebook, as i dont have the guts to do it myself. She doesnt want to but says she will tomorrow if is till want her to... The decision to ask her to do this is killing me, and i want to tell her dont lets keep talking, but i also want to move on :( So thats why ive come to you reddit, how on earth do i move on and start getting my life on track?

TL;DR - Broke up with my gf 2 months ago, finding it hard to move on, cant stop thinking about her, lots of rl problems making me depressed and all i want is her to take me back - How can I move on, and get my life back on track?

Thank you for reading x

I thought the interview process went very well and I ended up getting the offer. 

However, due to unforeseen circumstances (family issues), I ended up saying that I cannot join as an intern due to these reasons. And that was it...

I did not hear a single thing from them after that. No confirmation. No nothing. I recall writing that I am still interested in working the following winter of the following summer. Still nothing.

I sent them another email stating that I would still like to be in touch with Silicon Labs (even emailing the interviewer), still nothing. It was as if they hated me passionately.

Is this right? Do other companies treat their rejected interns like this? I know that I don't amount to much, but I feel like I am entitled to some dignity (especially after seemingly doing so well in the interviews).

keqzi,1,2011-09-13,Got a new job. They're trying to screw me out of the only benefit I give a shit about: tuition credits. Any advice on what I can do?,[deleted],reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/keqzi/got_a_new_job_theyre_trying_to_screw_me_out_of/,"I currently attend graduate school at a university in PA. I've worked for them before as a TA where the contract was based on that with no issues for a Masters in Chemistry.

Now I'm going for a Master's in Education so that I can go through the teacher program and become a teacher. Classes started on the 29th of August. In one of my classes on the 30th, the co-teacher announced that there were some staff positions opening up in the department that she supervised. So I contacted her and met with her on the 31st. Then on the 2nd of September I shadowed her and other staff members in what I would be doing. I started work on the 6th.

In the class announcement that the co-teacher made, she mentioned one of the benefits was tuition credit for 6 credits of classes each semester. She mentioned the same thing in my meeting on the 31st. The secretary of the department who handled on the employment papers (with the exception of the offer letter) also continued this expectation on the 6th of September.

The staff member who was supposed to do the employment offer letter was out of the office last week. So I didn't get the offer letter until she got back yesterday (9/12). She also continued the expectation of tuition credit.

So three different people on multiple occasions verbally gave me an expectation of tuition credit for six credits a semester.

The offer letter states this about benefits:
&gt;As a full-time nonexempt employee you are entitled to university benefits available to all Research Interns which includes health insurance, tuition credit, vacation, floating holidays, sick leave/excused absence time.

Granted, this offer letter was not written by HR. Which is where the problem comes in.

So I get a call today from my supervisor telling me that HR will not be approving the tuition credit for this semester because the date that my employment begins was after the first day of classes. Apparently policies recently changed. My superviser and her boss are trying to work it out but I want to know if there is anything that I can do (either within the university structure or possibly, legally) if they can't get it worked out.

I looked on the HR webpage for the policies. It states the following about tuition credit:
&gt;Eligibility for new employees begins after the first day of work however employment must begin on or before the first day of classes and continue through the end of the academic term in order to access the benefit.

However, their handbook for full time nonexempt employees, states this about tuition credit:
&gt;Eligibility begins after the first day of work.

And the handbook also says:
&gt;This document provides summary information in effect on the date it was prepared. For complete policy statements, please refer to the HR web site

Which probably makes the conflicting handbook and webpage a nonissue.

It's just frustrating as hell because I was given this expectation on multiple occasions by different people that I was going to get tuition credit. Two other recently hired employees are going through the same issue and they're pissed too. Granted, at least one girl and I have loans that cover our tuition for this semester so it's not an issue of maybe having to drop our classes (the third girl, I don't know) for the semester. But both of us were planning on taking the loan money and putting it back to the loan (anything to not have more debt) for when we finish.

So, dear reddit, what can I do that will help us out here?

Today I started getting to know more of them and HOLY SHIT.. One person showed me where in the bible it forbids pants for women and she has worn a skirt her entire life (NEVER PANTS ONCE!!!!) and refuses to go to a church where women are allowed to wear pants.. So indoctrinated that she is for repressing  her own gender. (She was not senile, btw) Another told me that because god put sugar on the earth it is okay to have as much as you want and was serious.. and another told me that we have to go somewhere when we die, it only makes sense, and that he hadn't watched the tv or news paper in 40 years.. he just needs his bible. A nun told me I looked ""loose"" after I introduced myself (wtf?) and demanded I put on a crucifix before I speak to her anymore. Finally, when asked if they wanted dentures, they declined, saying if they died with anything artificial God would not let them into heaven. Aside from the nun all of these people are pretty together mentally. Religion isn't helping them, it is just making their lives fucking harder. They are so indoctrinated that I hear over and over that many think saying GOD DAMMIT will send them to hell for eternity. I dont even live in a very religious area, I just think that generation is super religious. Regardless, I love the elderly and I will suck it up and listen to them talk about how much they love Jeebus because it makes their day better and just lawl inside. Just wanted to vent. "

I'll be starting back up with possibly a few applicable classes at CC this Spring, and university the following Fall semester. The more I've read, the more it seems that a B.S. in BioE doesn't put you in the greatest position to find a job and, what I'd be equally concerned about, health insurance coverage by the time I turn 26. I'm really interested in learning about anything biology/science/math related, so BioE feels like it would fit well. I don't have a specific specialty in mind, and probably wouldn't until I take more related classes. 

Is employability really much more of an issue than other engineering disciplines? I live between Baltimore and D.C. where it doesn't seem like there'd be a shortage of companies too far away. But, with BioE being so broad, would it be a safer bet to do Mechanical or Chemical engineering, taking biology classes where I can, and go to grad school down the road for BioE? The goal would obviously be to be more specialized to find a job, but how limiting would it be to do Mech or ChemE (say I go with Chem but end up wanting to do more with creating devices/prosthetics)? My interest is stronger in biology/medicine but I think I would still enjoy another discipline. I've also considered a degree in Biology but I like the engineering aspect, as well, and the job outlook for undergrads there didn't seem any better than engineering.

I'm not really interested in trying to take more classes to finish a degree sooner because I have other interests outside of school I want to spend time on.  If I were to go for a Master's right after undergrad, how much does that change job outlook? It's hard to say with certainty, but assume I didn't just sit on my ass and got an internship, made connections, and tried to set myself up well. As I finish typing this, I feel like I want to go with a B.S. BioE and hopefully get a Master's and find a job because I really think I'd enjoy learning that material the most. I would definitely feel more comfortable with more time to find a job and insurance, but making sure I have no gap in coverage *may* not be the biggest deal. Can't say for sure at the moment. Let me know if more information from me would help you give advice. It's all a bit overwhelming to think about right now so I greatly appreciate any and all input to help me decide. Thanks!"

But I intern at an LGBT non-profit in D.C. and he works for anti-gay Republicans. So, politics inevitably come up when we're both passionate about our issues.

He stated many times that he would support any Republican who ousts Obama from the White House. This I don't particularly mind. Lots of Democrats don't like Obama either.

However, he would even support Michelle Bachmann or Rick Santorum. In fact, he LIKES them. Alot. He even volunteered to help with their presidential campaign during the summer.

I brought up their anti-gay agendas constantly but he waves it off as ""unimportant"" or ""not an important issue right now. Focus on the economy"". He's perfectly aware of their bigotry...but he doesn't care. He supports them regardless.

I finally sat him down and asked him how he could vote for anti-gay Republicans (much less work for them) and he dodged the issue by deflecting blame to Democrats and stating that he's more than ""one issue"" and what matters is ""saving the country from Obamanomics"". 

The height of his hypocrisy was when he came to a LGBT fundraiser I helped organized to support gay marriage rights in other states (particularly in North Carolina). He smiled and chatted with everyone. He even donated $300 of his own money to the charity while he posed with my co-workers for pictures.

He then went to another fundraiser the next week sponsored by the National Marriage Association where he worked with his Congressman to donate money to their organization. He helped both sides donate money to their agendas. I confronted him on this and he just rolled his eyes and changed the subject. 

I don't believe he particularly CARES about gay rights. He likes it when pro-gay rights laws are passed and shrugs his shoulders when anti-gay rights laws are passed. 

He doesn't come from a religious background but he does come from wealthy background as his parents live in Georgetown and have multiple homes on the East Coast. I'm not sure if his economic background plays a role in his political views. 

I DO like him. But I can't help but feel sometimes I've fallen for a snake. My gay friends refuse to associate with him (my boyfriend had an ENORMOUS argument with them that led to thrown beer bottles...) and seem to distance themselves from me for dating him. I've hung out with his other gay Republican friends and they all seem to share his views. One of them works for GOProud. 

I have a terrible moral dilemma. I'm in a relationship with someone who actively supports and backs anti-gay bigots who seek to destroy everything I work for and have a passion for. 

I asked him what would happen if we stayed together and decided to get married and DOMA was passed. He said he'd just hire a lawyer to get the 'equivalent rights' we would have under a normal marriage. I didn't like that answer.

Should I consider breaking up with him or should I try to see past his politics and see the charming man I fell for? 

**TLDR; Dating a gay Republican who works for anti-gay Republicans who are against everything I work for at a LGBT non-profit. **

**EDIT : WOW! So many responses! Thanks everyone for the advice! I'm currently working on the NC marriage debacle in Raleigh so I haven't had a chance to log in recently. I haven't come to a decision as of yet. I will talk to my friends and my bf to settle this once and for all. I'll try to reply to as many of you as po**ssible."

So first off, I am a college student that lives at home but was out of town for an internship all summer, at that said internship is where I really started smoking trees.

So now I am back living at home, brought some trees with me and for a few weeks everything was fine.

But Sunday I find that my stash is gone and I freak the fuck out because I have no idea how my dad feels on subject and I know he is the one that moved them. I leave for the entire day and stay at my friends place. I text though my sister to make sure my dad is not freaked out and then come home.

Now my dad's way of talking about this is though email, really timid for him. He is the kinda guy that gets so angry that he smashes things and shit, so this a welcome surprise. It seems it is actually ok with him as long as I keep my grades up, which seems cool with me. I mean way better than expected. All except my stash is gone and I will need to find someone to sell me some.

But just about 10 min ago I was looking around my room and found it! It was close by but better concealed. What a fucking awesome guy my dad is!

And now I will toke one for him, for being such an awesome father and for letting me choose how I live my life as long as I stay doing as well as I have!"

I am a recent graduate of the University of Pittsburgh's School of Social Work, MSW program. My specialization is with children, youth, and families and child welfare. I've completed 2 internships while attending school one in the preventative services department at Mercy Behavioral Health in Pittsburgh, and the other at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC. I am studying to take my licensing exam for the state of Pennsylvania, and I am looking to get some teaching experience.

For the past 2 years I have worked as a therapeutic support staff for children with Autism, as well as a summer camp counselor for children with developmental disabilities.

I have also coached soccer for the past 5 years for a competitive club in the Pittsburgh area.

Now for the class information:

In my second to last semester I took a class on play therapy and enjoyed the content and the experience of the class. I want to share what I have learned with you.

Class Size:

I am going to limit the number of people able to enroll in this class to 5. Each person enrolled in the class is going to need a partner that is able to participated in recorded video of interventions and techniques each week in order to show progress, understanding, and critiques from the class.

I am limiting the number of people because the the discussion would carry for far too long with any more people, plus it will be my first class teaching so I do not want to overburden myself and give a bad learning experience.

If there is enough interest I will teach the subject again down the road.

Presentation:

I am going to attempt to keep the content as interactive as possible. I was hoping to set aside an hour each week for the class to meet and discuss readings, videos assigned, or recorded videos of techniques practiced the previous week. 

Content:

History, interventions, techniques, critiques. Content is vague right now, but will be refined with interest.

If you are interested please respond here, or let me know through PM.

Thanks!"

kfuha,1,2011-09-14,8 Things I Wish Job Candidates Hadn't Shared,fredddallas,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/kfuha/8_things_i_wish_job_candidates_hadnt_shared/,"Blogger Jeff Bullas recently posted his list of 30 things you shouldn’t share on social media. Some of his suggestions were humorous, and some were serious.

I’ve been going through the process of reviewing resumes and interviewing college students applying for a part-time marketing assistant job that’s open at work, and I wish that every one of them would read and heed a list of things they shouldn’t share on social media.

No, I wasn’t screening them by checking their social media profiles behind their backs. One part of the job we’re offering is posting to our corporate social media pages and blog, so I asked them for work-appropriate samples of their work they wanted to share on a laptop hooked up to a projector in our conference room.

And a succession of candidates – knowing they were in a job interview, and knowing that they were being interviewed for a social media internship – chose to display their personal Facebook, Twitter, MySpace or blog pages.  And nearly all of them inadvertently displayed photos, comments, and content that should never have been shown to a potential employer. 

Some blushed, some giggled, but the worst offenders didn’t comment at all, leaving me to think that they weren’t in the least embarrassed by what they flashed on the wall for us to see.

So here’s my all too serious list of things I wish job candidates hadn’t shown me during job interviews.

■Party photos showing you inebriated or with a hand placed where it shouldn’t be – especially if you’re under the legal drinking age.
■Complaints about your current boss, your job, and the customers.
■Comments about being so much smarter than your boss and your co-workers, or critiques of the weight, age, or appearance of your boss and co-workers.
■Sexually provocative and explicit photos. One job applicant had a huge photo of her Halloween costume on her blog as a featured photo. The costume was a sheer body stocking with thumbnail-sized modesty panels. The 20-year-old was holding an open and half-empty bottle labeled Absinthe Tunel 80 Cannabis, and smiling at an apparently naked guy facing her in a crowded bar or club. Did I mention she’s a student at a conservative church-sponsored university? Or that the drinking age in our state is 21? Or that the Spanish concoction she’s holding can’t be legally imported into the U.S.?
■Photos showing you enjoying yourself at the beach or the lake or some event, with a caption that says, “So glad I called in sick at work today!” (I saw four of those in two days of interviews.)
■Hints about your computer passwords. (I actually saw this on one applicant’s blog: “It’s so stupid that they make us change our passwords in the computer lab every month! I just keep putting my dog Amanda’s name in, only one time I spell it right, and the next month I spell it backwards.”)
These next two weren’t shown to me during interviews, but people I know reported having them shared with them.

■How much money you do or don’t have in your bank account, and the source of the money. (I’m embarrassed to admit it, but according to her boss, one of my grandkids posted this on Facebook – who when he met me said, “Oh, so YOU’RE the one she writes about on Facebook.”  My “little princess” was quite surprised that I got upset. “Went to visit the money machine today – aka grandma. Let’s go party &amp; spend the $250 windfall!”)
■Extreme political, racial, or religious views.  I can’t tell you how many friends and co-workers have told horror stories of “social media experts” or internship candidates who have shown them “work samples” laced with language more appropriate for a late-night comedy skit or R-rated movie than the office.  Or filled with passionate rants about a cause that was not quite politically correct.  (One actually had a screen shot of a neo-Nazi site that a web developer proudly showed as a sample of his design work, noting how he’d taken his inspiration from the architectural and cubist lines of the 1930′s.)
This doesn’t mean you can’t share your faith or your support for a politician on your social media pages. It just means using good sense and remembering that potential employers may see it whether they intend to or not.

At the risk of offending, I will point out here that the use of certain racially charged words may be perfectly acceptable in rap music, but they usually are NOT acceptable at work.  And someone my age who is old enough to remember the days before segregation ended may be more sensitive to them than those born afterwards.  Peppering your blog or your social media posts with them doesn’t encourage me to hire you. How do I know that you won’t use them around the office?

So am I saying that you can’t express yourself freely on social networks, or that I won’t hire you if you say the wrong thing? Not at all. It is possible to exercise your free speech rights and keep or get a job.

I’m just saying that if it’s personal and private, keep it that way. I don’t want to be your Facebook friend if I’m your supervisor. And I certainly don’t want a job candidate to walk into an interview and show me stuff that will make it nearly impossible for me to work with them.

Remember, candidates were told a week before the interview that they should be prepared to show samples of their work, and were given links to our social media pages and blog. Any or all of them had the opportunity to “clean up” a page to display, create a new one, or dodge the question altogether and comment on our pages or their favorite pages instead of showing me inappropriate images and content.

One of them did just that. She prepared a sample blog and Facebook page, along with a list of her favorite corporate social media campaigns. I never saw her personal Facebook page (which she volunteered was not public). Guess who got the job?

I think i need a pair of new eyes to take a look at my situation cause it s going on for a long time and i m quite sick of loosing my time and my feelings on this.

I m 24 and i was with the same girl for 4 years in a relationship, i finished my engeneering studies and i had to move out of our city to find an internship and start working, she had a few years of studies left so she stayed there to finish it. 

We broke up few month later but we stayed very very closed, we continue to see each other, had sexy time and even had hollidays together, i took her for a trip in holland and another time to poland. She was seeing other guys, not seriously though, not even having sex with them, i was seeing other girls as well but still when we were together we were kinda a couple.

A year later she begin a new relationship with another guy, a guy without any ambition, a morron, but a guy wich is fun in partys and living in the same city she was. There are still photos of us in her apartment, i m still invitied to family dinners at her parents home, i sleep at here place, we kiss occasionaly when we are a bit drunk, she called me a few times to say that she still loved me, and made me a big photo album of one of our trips to japan but she is with another guy that she loves obvisouly. 

I loved/love her deeply, i was thinking that maybe later when she finishes her studies we will be back together so i was ok with it, we can make our own experiences on our side and be back together for a serious relationship after it.

But now times is passing and every time i see her i feel bad about it after it, i feel a bit sad.I don t know how to feel about all this any more. 

We call eachother, we talk a lot, she complains often about her bf and stuff but i feel that i m loosing my time here, that i m betting on the wrong girl and that we may never be together anymore and so i have to move on, but i can t decide myself to get over it.

What do you think ? I m not desperate, i have fun with other girls but i feel i can t fall in love anymore. "

I'm stuck. I can't get out. I don't have the grades, the GPA, or the test scores to get into a small cheap state school. I can't afford to move out, because I can't get a job. Even community colleges are too expensive, even with full grants.

But I guess that's my fault. I'm the one that couldn't deal with typical high school. I'm the one that let my grades slip just because I was BORED and SAD. I'm the one that partied the night before my SAT's. I'm the one that transferred to school after school, getting progressively more bored and more fed up with the system. I'm the one that dated the rapist. I'm the one that failed my classes and dropped out because I couldn't fucking handle it, losing the tuition waiver I'd been offered. I'm the one that let myself get so stressed out I failed my first semester of college and now they WON'T LET ME COME BACK. I failed I fail I FAILED AND IT'S ALL MY FAULT!

And that's why I'm stuck here. Because I kept giving up, because I didn't try to at least pay attention and do my work in classes I could've aced with ease. I killed my brain with reckless behavior and self-endangerment and sheer APATHY. I'm living with the consequences and it sucks, it sucks so much, even more so because I know what happened. I KNOW what went wrong, and it was my fault. It really was.

Now I'm just a deadbeat 19-year-old sitting in a corner staring at a screen, day after day after day just wallowing in my own filthy waste. Dirty dishes, moldy dishes, paper, crumbs, empty chip bags, pizza boxes, filthy clothes and alcohol bottles, random shit that I don't even recognize, and it's all piled up to my waist. What the fuck is wrong with me? Why didn't I just brush it all off? The milk on my pants, the words on my lockers, the spit in my food, the bars of soap on my desk, the pushing and shoving and laughing and tripping and books to the face and papers all over the floor and the hands, smiles, hair-pulling, teeth, kicks, punches, blood and blood over and over and over and over god dammit why couldn't I just BRUSH IT OFF and FORGET and get through it? Why couldn't I just get through it? I hate myself. I hate them. I hate ***him***. 

And I envy you. I really do. It makes me feel sick to say it. I wish that you could understand the shit I've gone through, what I'm going through. Death and loss and abuse and pain and apathy and just god DAMMIT why do I sound so EMO?!

But I'm still trying. I'll throw myself into massive amounts of debt if I have to, just to get out of here and remake my life and heal. I am not down for the count. I will get back up and finish this fight even if it kills me. I WILL get into school, and I WILL kick ass and I WILL transfer into Amherst College with a 3.8+. *Even if it kills me.*"

I'm a newly minted college grad who is lucky enough to have found a job as a software engineer at a fairly big company.  One of the other new hires has been repeatedly been insulting and unpleasant to talk to.  If it matters, I'm a guy, and she's a girl.  

Examples:

* She suggested that I get a better face 

I'm not very handsome, but she decided to say this to me in front of another co-worker.  I laughed it off at the time, but obviously I found it insulting.  

* She told me about how she mistook a 40 year old guy for me.  

implying that I look nearly 20 years older than I am.  She thought it was pretty funny

* repeatedly mentions that she dislikes me.  

She has said a few other things while we were interns together.  It's long enough ago that I don't clearly remember exactly what she said, but I remember it was not nice.  


Situation(continued):
We do not work directly together.  Our teams are only tangentially related.  Sometimes we end up in the same lunch group, but I've noticed she's more guarded about what she says to me when others are around.  I do my best to sit as far away from her as possible.  

So these are my options, as I see it:

* talk to her about it.  

This could work, but I'm worried that she will be encouraged by knowing that she 'got to me'

* Talk to her manager about it

He was my manager during my internship.  He's a good guy but I'm not sure how he would handle it.  My best guess is that he would talk to her about it and tell her to knock it off.  

* Talk to my manager about it

I'm not sure what he would do.  I'd guess that he would either recommend that I speak with HR or try to handle it on his own by talking to her manager.  

* Talk to HR

I read the handbook, there is a zero tolerance policy here.  I'm a little worried that this would be making too big a deal of it, and that they might not do much about it since I don't really have any proof.  Other than one witness.  

* Do nothing and avoid her.  

This is doable.  I'm still going to run into her occasionally in the hall or lunch.  


I haven't had any problem like this except for when I worked with some asshole during a summer job in highschool.  Back then I ignored it because I was quitting in a week anyways, but I'm looking to have a long career here.  With my luck she's trying to do the same.  

This is a difficult situation for me.  She's the only fly in the ointment at an otherwise awesome job.  What the fuck should I do?  

edit:

looks like the consensus is that I should either take it up with HR or she is trying to flirt with me (do **not** want).  thanks for the help.  And I'll keep watching this for a while even though It's fallen off the 'new' page.  "

To give a little back story: 

There has always been random family drama in my life, but I never felt like I had the right to get upset or too hard on myself because I wasn't physically harmed, and I know people had it worse then me. Basically my parents went through a bad divorce, my sisters and I were not left out of the drama. I was only 7 at the time, but I still remember screaming, my mom sleeping on the couch, broken dishes, etc. Fast forward a few years... My mom is dating a man who does not know how to deal with girls. For example, he never wanted all three of us over to his house at once. Only two at a time max. Then after a bit my dad started dating a woman who did not get along with us either. Things were bad on both ends, and we were getting shuffled around moving from house to house every two weeks. 

Things really weren't good for any of us. My mom and dad couldn't even speak to each other on the phone, they would give us letters to give each other. Each of them would talk shit about each other to us, leaving us in an awkward position constantly. Anyway, come my 8th grade year, which I will remember as one of the worst years of my life. This is the year my mom got married to my step-dad without telling us, my friends took me to the guidance counselor telling me I wasn't being a ""good friend"", and things got so bad between my step mom, dad and myself that I got kicked out of my house. 

So here I am 13, feeling betrayed by my parents, and my friends abandoned me. 

I'm not going to go into my whole high school years, but basically my dad and I had very little communication that whole time. I remember the first year or so we only saw each other a couple times, and I would be the one who needed to call him. The only time I would hear from him was to email me about my grades (he got email updates). While this was happening my step-dad moved across the country and my mom was spending time in between her house and his. My sisters could go to my dads, but often I would be left alone or with my grandparents. 

Anyway, I graduate from high school and continue on with my life. At this point I have learned to depend on my parents for little, and had distanced myself emotionally. 

I had held this resentment toward my dad for so long, but getting into college and stepping outside of those emotions allowed me to see things from his perspective. My dad had a rough childhood with a dad who showed little emotion, beat him, and kept a strict household. Understanding more of his side of things helped our relationship to slowly grow. 

My dad was always a motivator despite our differences, so I would always do well and that drive to succeed has stuck with me. I have become fiercely independent and I began creating my own personal successes. I was getting internships, getting good grades in school, traveling, meeting some amazing friends. 

In the end, it has only been in this past year that the relationship my dad and I have been working on for so long, finally started to come together. I finally felt like we understood each other. He knew my passions, and I knew his. Anytime we got together we had amazing conversation, and I never had someone to turn to like I did him. 

So like I said earlier he passed away in may due to a pulmonary embolism. Sudden and unexpected. I know this is long-winded and I really am not even sure why I am posting on reddit, but today I'm feeling a little lost. Two weeks after my dad died I moved away for an internship, and now I've moved again 2 weeks ago to another country to study abroad. I am keeping busy, and living life exactly how he would've wanted me to. There are just so many unanswered questions, and this is something I never thought I would have to deal with. I just hope my dad knew how much I loved him and how much he really meant to me, and there was a time where I never thought I would be able to say that. 

tl dr; My dad died in May. We had a strained relationship until right before his passing, and I'm feeling lost. "

I don't see any of them giving me the background in machine design that I feel I should pursue in order to be prepared for an entry level mechanical engineering position.


I have had a few internships, and it's gotten me somewhat on the right direction.  I feel comfortable referencing the machinist handbook for various things, however I can't help but feel this is a huge element of my curriculum that I am missing out on.  

I really don't know much about gears.  I know from transmissions that straight cut gears are noisy (why your car is so loud in reverse) where angle-cut gears are much quieter.  I know if you can make a gear larger in diameter you can remove some material from the center (make it into a donut) to save weight and maintain the same ""strength"", however that's about all I know.

In terms of bearings, I know brass is a common choice, I'm assuming because it's so ductile and otherwise soft, so it can conform to other moving parts without damaging them.  Besides that, I really don't know anything about bearings!

There has to be some resource out there that can give me a better clue.  I want to be prepared should I enter a technical interview regarding this subject, and while my curriculum has otherwise been good, machine design is something that has been glossed over so much, that all my knowledge of it just comes from a materials course, and my hobby of automotive.

Accounting, even with it's meager starting salary in the low to mid 40's, seems like it is in much higher demand than economics.

Here it is. I have been offered a job on the West Coast. Opportunity of a life time. My dream job, so to speak. I just got done with the internship opportunity of a lifetime on the other coast and I'm pretty sure that helped me get this job.

Now, I am back in my home state, getting prepared for my transition.

But I am fucked. I don't have any money. I started the internship immediately after I graduated. While the internship *was* minimally paid (THANK GOD) I was living in an expensive city where rent was practically equal to my paycheck.  No big deal. I was just happy to have been paid.

I've never met my father (Ironically, right before I graduated, I find out he lives in a homeless shelter -- but that's a story for another day, Reddit) and my mom and I haven't seen eachother since May. She doesn't have the ability to help me anyway, but our not-so-close relationship doesn't help.

The only other family I have is my grandma. She is retired and single (the women in my family don't have the best skills in choosing men). So she doesn't exactly have cashflow.  And when I told her about this opportunity, I really thought she would be proud and relieved.  Not so. She said that I need to find a job closer to home and that this isn't in my best interest. She even asked if I could ""just do it online for awhile.""  You could say she...doesn't quite get it.

Additionally, I have had a bankruptcy. Medical bills.  So, while I consider myself a responsible, smart person -- I don't look like it on paper.  So, getting a small loan isn't an option.


So, how do people do this, Reddit?  I can't imagine that I am the *only* talented person who happens to come from NO money.  I understand, and am humbled by, the fact that I overcame a lot of stereotypes to get where I am today. I'm not a religious person -- but I've been blessed by an ability to not fall into drugs, drop out of school, get pregnant, etc. 

But I can't be the only one.  How do people do it?  How do I come up with the...what...$2000...$3000 it will take to get to L.A. and put a deposit and first month's rent down on an apartment before I actually start work and have the income flow?  

I am *not* asking for handouts here. I really just can't figure out how people do this. This is the opportunity of a lifetime. My dream job, really, and I am giddy like a schoolgirl over it.  But then there comes the reality that...shit costs money.  My new employer will be assisting me with the cost of movers and gas -- so that does help with a portion of this.  But, to be real, I have about $400 to my name right now.


Any advice would be helpful.


tl;dr: I have been offered an amazing job on the East Coast. I am broke as shit. How do I make this work?"
kg9zf,2,2011-09-15,"at university. got her number, need next step ideas / show interest",puaxy,askseddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/askseddit/comments/kg9zf/at_university_got_her_number_need_next_step_ideas/,"Met HB7.5 at an engineering students info session (I'm a senior, she's a freshman). I was basically in a high value position at the time because tons of people were asking me questions / about my internships / advice, talking to a lot of girls too.  I meet her and get her name but didn't want to game her then (still during orientation week for the freshmen).

Two weeks later I'm at an audition and she opens me (she remembered  my name). Lots of gazing / light conversation and kino during auditions. She bailed half way through (which I teased her about) but I  didn't have time to # close before she left. So I friended her on fb and sent a message: (about 6 - 12 hrs between each of our replies)
me: ""way to pussy out!""
her: ""hahaha how were the rest of auditions?""
me: ""they were fun! you should have stayed. what'd you do the rest of the day anyway?""
her: ""ummm I don't really know. homework I think""
me: ""you nerd! looks like you need a study break. let's get a meal sometime. btw I don't think I have your number""

so she gives me her number (yesterday) and I haven't followed up yet.

What are my next steps? I haven't texted her yet. 
""getting a meal"" sounded pretty weak but at this point I don't know very much about her so I can't think of any other ideas to hang out. My plan was to get a meal, learn more about her, and then plan something fun. How do I demonstrate interest throughout this though? I'm afraid that just grabbing dinner together is already framing myself in her mind as a friend.  I was thinking possibly meal + then just wandering the city and getting desert?

What did I do right, and what could I have improved on?"

kg7oh,1,2011-09-15,Reddit help me make sense of this breakup ,jimbean21,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/kg7oh/reddit_help_me_make_sense_of_this_breakup/,"Sorry for the length, I just wanted to paint a full picture. 

My ex (let us call her Kate) and are I both 21 year old seniors in college who met during our sophomore year (we would end of dating for 1.5 years). We lived on the same apartment floor and our roommates quickly became friends. She took an interest me first, which I was oblivious to. I was initially skeptical about dating Kate because she was considered by my roommates to be too much of a partier, and a bit wild.  Although this was true, she was actually a very sweet girl. Kate’s roommates insisted that she give up on me because of how slow I was moving but Kate waited it out. We officially began dating in March and both of us were thrilled, I should note that Kate was my first gf.

Throughout the rest of the year things went well between Kate and I. She did have a bit of a drinking problem that made me nervous. When Kate drinks, she will often black out. This has led to some embarrassing moments such as her breast slipping out of her dress, urinating in my bed and so on.  As the semester, ended Kate and I promised to visit each other as often as possible since we only are two hours apart.

The first major incident occurred while Kate was on a school-sponsored trip. She had blacked out and made out with another guy. Her roommates would later inform me that she was so drunk that they were concerned for her safety. Kate called me the next morning sobbing, and explained what had happened.  She told me how sorry she was, and that I had every right to end the relationship. I listened to what she had to say and told her that I would need to think about the situation.  I called her back to let her know that I thought we could still salvage the relationship; she left the trip early to return home.  Once she returned we met up and were able to work past the situation.

Kate texted me on our six-month anniversary, that she wanted to talk. She informed that she wanted to take a break because she felt that I was not giving her enough attention, or showing my love. We didn’t talk for a two days until I finally messaged her on facebook asking how she was doing. She said that the break was had been very hard for her. I suggested that we go on a walk and she agreed. During that walk, we were able to work things out. Kate’s drinking appeared to be a litter milder than the previous year, but she would still blackout and again during the winter she kissed another guy. Apparently, the guy had actually kissed her but Kate hadn’t known until her roommates told her. Kate told me about what had happened and again was crying. I was upset that she got so drunk and put herself in that situation. I eventually forgave her and the rest of the semester went smoothly. Kate would stay at school during the summer for an internship while I went back home, this increased our distance apart to five hours.

The summer was going smoothly and I visited Kate in June. When I arrived, Kate was a bit off, she would describe it as being nervous after having not seen me since early May. We had a great weekend, and again everything was going good. Kate called me saying that she had been thinking and she thought we should break up. She had felt that we were more like best friends, and there wasn’t much passion (despite having and amazing sex life). I was troubled by this but what could I do. She asked if we could still be friends and my exact words were “unlikely” I just didn’t think it was possible after being so close.  Within a week, Kate was back to texting me daily, especially about her brother who had been thrown out of the house. I told her that she needed to make up her mind about us because we were still communicating like a couple. Kate said her feelings were still mixed and she needed time to sort through things. 

A week before school started I visited Kate at her home and we had a fantastic day together. Right before I left she said that she was sure she wanted to be with me, and once again, we were back together.  Our senior year began and things were going good until I looked through her phone and saw a text between her and a friend. The friend had asked how we were doing and Kate said that she thought relationship hadn’t been the same. I brought this up without letting Kate know that I read the text. We agreed to end the relationship despite how close we were. She cried and then we took a drive to a local park where she carved our initials into a wooden gazebo. On the walk back home, I broke down and started crying, this had been my first true relationship and this girl meant the world to me.  She was actually surprised that I cried because I am not emotional but she was relieved to see that I cared so much.

Kate and I stilled talked, a few days later I got a call from her around midnight. Apparently, she had been very upset about our breakup and had been crying for the past few days, her roommates were not supportive. Kate had been crying in a bar and was upset because her friends had left her in the bathroom. I decided to walk her home during which time she sent several mean texts to her roommates. This would lead to a fight amongst the girls and during the weekend, Kate and I hung out and seemed to rekindle our relationship. She talked about how far I thought our relationship could go, and even talked about kids which freaked me out a bit. She would have a long talk with her roommates about the fight on Sunday. On Monday, I received the “can we talk” text again. This time Kate said she wanted to take another break to focus on herself and her drinking. Her roommates (who like me) said that she always has a guy in her life to use as an emotional crutch. Kate believed this to be true and wanted to go through this alone. I accepted her wishes and gave her space until she started texting and talking to me on g-chat after a day or two.  During one of the talks, I asked her if she would want to pick up where we left off after she dealt with her problems; her response was “I would love to.” 

Now here is where all hell breaks loose. Last Thursday I receive a text from one of my roommates that Kate is at a bar dancing and making out with another guy.  Apparently, while a few of my friends were staring at her she made eye contact with them, then grabbed the guy’s face and started kissing him again. I ran to the bar and just stared at her, she looked right back but didn’t even flinch. I was extremely upset and felt like my heart had exploded. I sent her a text saying, “well you got over me fast.” My roommates and a few other friends sat me down once the bar closed and explained how sorry they were. They told me how much they hated Kate for the way that she had treated me in the past, and how they witnessed Kate make out with two guys during the Summer but didn’t have the heart to tell me (technically we weren’t dating). The next morning she responds by saying that I have it all wrong and that we should talk after class. 

After class, we start talking and she seems annoyed to discuss the situation. I asked her what had happened and could not get a straight answer, she said she never meant for it to go that far, and she had been crying all morning. She then says that she’s a disrespectful person and has been disrespectful to me, also that I should have some self-respect and treat her like a “douche” which is what my friends had been doing (roommate texted her fuck you after the bar had closed).  I was at a loss for words and just walked away.  Throughout the weekend, I saw her with the same guy who turned out to be a coworker and not a student at our university. They were dancing very close and kissing while I was dying on the inside. I sent a few text messages asking Kate to talk with me one more time just for closure. She finally responded on Sunday, and we talked on the phone. Again, she was annoyed and asked why I kept texting her (sent 3 text messages), I told her that I just wanted some closure. I told her that the worst part was that she didn’t even seem to care that our friendship/relationship was destroyed. Kate said that it had been hard on her as well but talking about it would only make it worse. She said she had avoided me to give me space so that we both could move on. I would later find out that her coworker had slept over Saturday night. Yesterday, she added him on facebook and defriended me.  This whole situation has left me dumbfounded; I can’t imagine how we went from talking about our future after college and even kids, to this. 

TL;DR Girlfriend and I decide to take break during which she decides get involved with a coworker. 

Well reddit this is my story. Any thoughts or advice would be greatly appreciated.

kg62s,8,2011-09-15,An introduction of sorts/coming out of lurkerdom/acceptance of my status as probably the most nauseating LDR cliché,cynicalquixotic,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/kg62s/an_introduction_of_sortscoming_out_of/,"Hello hello, everyone.  My name is cynicalquixotic, and I'm an American girl (20) who fell in love with a Frenchman (27) while studying abroad in Paris.

I came to Paris last May as part of Boston University's Paris Internship Program, where I was placed working the desk at a dance studio (I'm a modern dancer, so I was beyond thrilled about this).  I've studied French since I was 11, have been to Paris once before, and have always been fairly good at speaking French.  Even though I very quickly realized that spoken French is almost a different language and I stuck out like a sore thumb as maybe not an Ugly American, but definitely Not French, Paris agreed with me--I loved my internship, found a café with a patron who was amused by Anglophones and would correct my pronunciation errors, and in general I just watched people a lot and tried to immerse myself as fully as I could in this culture that was frustrating and interesting and wonderful.  I know I sound cheesy as hell, but I had never been so happy.  I didn't think it could get any better.

The boy and I met over OKCupid in mid-June--I had changed my city from New York to Paris and was browsing it on a whim--and when we got to talking, I knew there was something about him--he was funny and not afraid to gently poke fun of me.  We agreed to meet at L'As du Fallafel in the Marais, since it was one of the only places guaranteed to be open on a Sunday, and it was one of the most awesome nights of my life.  We talked about everything--our families, our likes, our dislikes, and when we got to our favorite memes it was all over.  We proceeded to drink a little too much at a pub in the Bastille, and he kissed me for the first time right outside the pub on the cobblestone street.  We spent the rest of the night walking across the bridges on the Seine, kissing and talking.  From then on, we were inseparable--I spent nearly every night at his apartment, where he played the keyboard for me and introduced me to Reddit.  We held hands and walked everywhere.  He's taught and shown me so much and challenged my worldview in so many incredible and interesting ways. I realized very quickly that this was something incredibly special, and busted my ass to find a way to stay for the rest of the summer--I was originally supposed to leave the 17th of July.  I found summer classes and a place to stay at the Cité Universitaire dorms, and we told each other that we loved each other right before I left for a weekend trip to Berlin in early July.  I even stayed with his family in the south of France for the last two weeks before I had to go back home to start my last year of university.  I was completely shattered when I had to leave him--I sobbed in front of the security line at the Côte d'Azur airport and I'll never forget the look on his face as he watched me go.  I would've done anything to be able to stay, I had (and still have) absolutely 0 desire to return to the US.

I'm now almost a month into what will probably be a nearly year-long LDR: I finish college in May, and after graduation I plan on returning to Paris to start a master's degree to hopefully be able to teach English (if all goes to plan and I get accepted, of course).  I'm hoping we can see each other in December, but I have 0 savings after studying abroad and am having an incredibly difficult time finding a job.  I realize I've painted a very rosy picture of our relationship--we've certainly had our conflicts, and cultural differences wreaked much more havoc than I ever would've expected, but all in all things are pretty wonderful.

That turned out much longer than I expected, so, my apologies.  I'd love any and all comments/advice/what have you.

TL;DR:  Studied abroad in France, loved it there, met a guy, lovey-dovey bullshit, major paradigm shifts, tearful goodbyes, now am in a LDR and have become one of those annoying people who is bitter about living in the US. Also, am really glad to ""meet"" you all!"
kg5zz,1,2011-09-15,"Reddit, I'm having daddy issues and I'm starting to get to a point where I simply cannot endure it anymore. Help. ",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/kg5zz/reddit_im_having_daddy_issues_and_im_starting_to/,"My whole life my dad has had an issue with his anger. He gets mad at the most irrational things and often times chooses to be ignorant toward ridiculous issues. Despite all this, we used to get along well.
However, this passed year he's been on me about all sorts of things. The biggest being that I am unemployed. I really don't know where to start with all this, but I'll try my best to explain it as well as i can. 
As i said, my dad has a short temper. I often get in trouble for things like his computer not working or someone or not going to wanting to do volunteer work in mexico. The list is truly endless.

Now, back to employment. I've never held a paying job. However, I have been looking profusely for the passed year. My luck with finding a job has been laughable, as i have been told by several different places that I had a job only to be told that they are no longer hiring, the manager quit and the hiring process started over, and even the manager avoiding me. It's really another endless list that I can't even begin to describe. 

I have held multiple internships, though. Very good internships too. I was fortunate enough to work with Morgan Spurlock(Super Size Me) at one point. My dad could care less, though. I've never once been congratulated for any of it. In fact, He just puts me down and says its stupid to work for an internship that is unpaid. Remember what I said about ignorance? 

I am also a film major, which he also puts down and says its impractical and that i will ""never amount to anything."" I don't know where all this hate has come from, as it's only gotten THIS bad over the passed year, as said before. 

For whatever reason, my dad now thinks the worst of me when I'm the only one of his three children that has always stayed loyal to him. My brother estranged himself from him and my sister too at one point. My brother even had the balls to come back, out of nowhere, asking to live with him. All he's doing is mooching, and my dad knows it. And yet, I try to do so much to just make him proud and all I get is bullshit upon bullshit upon bullshit.

Oh, did I mention I made Dean's List at my school? Cuz i did. He didn't care and said ""well you should have gotten a 4.0."" 

He thinks I'm a drug dealing pot head/alcoholic too. I admitted to having a medcard and it did not go over well, as you can imagine. It was actually kind of funny how that went down. It ended with me standing over his shoulders as he was on his knees flushing MY weed and me saying ""Go on....all of it."" I called him out on having weed too and he still denies it despite his girlfriend confirming all of it. 

Up until this last month, all of this has just been irritating white noise to me. I cope well and just get over it and move on. I'm a very happy person, but not so much lately. 

The other day, I heard him talking shit about me on the phone. I walked out of my room and just asked ""why?"" He ignored me and I repeated myself. He said ""why what?"" and I asked ""Why are you talking shit on me? What did i do?"" He just laid there on the couch watching the game and said ""I'm not talking shit, I'm talking fact."" Things escalated from there, yelling and whatnot, and he even threatened to cut off my balls, which was definitely a new standard for him. 

Now he's threatening to cut off all financial support (school, the car, my phone, etc), along with my balls, and kick me out unless i go by his plan which is essentially give up my dream of going to USC or Chapman for film and go a different route in life, and I refuse to do that. I have already worked too hard to give up now. 
Reddit, I need help. I haven't even scratched the surface with all that has been happening, but hopefully you have a good idea. I want to move out, but i need money, which I also need to pay to fix the car, which is currently on the fritz, so I can go to said job. I guess now I'll also need it to pay for my own insurance and phone, as well. 

I can't take this bullshit anymore. Communication is absolutely POINTLESS, so I cant have a sit down with him. What can I do? I don't have anywhere to go or any money(im down to my last $20). I'm not even smoking right now. My card just expired and I figured I'd go on a ""tolerance break"" until I have a job and can afford to renew it. 
I'm sorry if this was a chore to get through, but i appreciate it. 
please help. "

I graduated in '07 with a degree in Aero Engineering and have not been able to land an engineering position since graduation. While in school, I did a pretty extensive internship (3 years) with an aerospace company and gained some pretty good experience with satellite communications/telemetry/mission planning/pre launch..etc.. I was not offered a job at the company by the end of my internship though ( I still had a 1.5 years left to graduate). Once I graduated I applied and interviewed for many positions within my field but ultimately was not chosen. So instead of staying unemployed I started to work in IT. Ive worked for a few companies since graduation but all have been in the IT field. 


The problem is that I am getting less and less call backs for engineering positions and I feel its because my resume being full of IT/helpdesk/sys admin work. I recently started grad school and im working towards a masters in EE in hopes of giving me some sort of edge over other candidates (i live in DC so the market is saturated with people who have more years of experience than ive been alive).

Basically because i was too lazy to learn the math required for Computer Science.  I got an internship at a local company doing data analysis for the general manger (access querys, reporting).  I enjoyed this position but then the IT guy left the company.  Thinking this was my dream job i promptly applied and was given the position.  it was a ""jack-of-all-trades"" position (programming, support)  I enjoyed it for a while but found the on-call aspect very annoying.  The programming aspect also became annoying as the software i was maintaing was written in VB6 with an access backend.  I approached the manager on many occasions to try to talk to him about updating to a more maintainable system, request denied.  So i stick it out and try my best but i slowly lose interest in anything IT realated.

Fast forward to a year ago... I had met a girl through a friend that lived 4 hours away.  We hit it off and soon i found myself making the drive every weekend to see her.  We get engaged and I am able to find a job in her area doing web development.  I take the job and find that even though I'm not trying to keep a bad system maintained  (which i thought was why i hated my old job), I still do not get satisfaction out of my career.

I am currently on an internship in Toronto and I want to build a network of references at the University of Toronto, which I have in my top-5 options for grad. school.

I was wondering on how I would go about building this network with professors and graduate students? Where would I be able to meet these people outside my work hours (9-5 weekdays)? What would be the best way to approach them about my goals? And how can I ask them for help when I apply in two months?

Currently, my GPA is above 3.6 and by the time I graduate I will have 20 months worth of coop/internships. Should I mention this when talking to professors? When should I mention it?

Thank you in advance for your help :-)"

To me, that implies one of three things:

1) Only a handful of people are accepted each year, and it is a very competitive program. I don't have the best grades in history (except that my major GPA is pretty damn good), so maybe this school isn't for me.

2) Even though more than a handful of people are accepted, the program is tough enough to weed out all but the top four people. This is terrifying to me, that I might spend a lot of money and at the end still not be good enough to have that money be worth anything.

3) The program has many students, but only a few at a time who are at the internship point.

Those of you who have been through the doctorate process at similar schools, what are your thoughts?"

two years ago I noticed a really attractive girl in a lecture in my university, but she wasn't studying the same thing, just shared that one course briefly, so I didn't see her again after that, and I'm pretty sure she didn't even took notice of me. I did, however, catch her name when admissions to internships were announced by the professor. Pretty sure that's what all guys do with cute chicks :p

Nothing uncommon, but then a couple weeks ago we were on the same train and I'm dead sure she was / wanted to flirt with me, but I didn't make a move, for whatever reason. I probably won't see her again since I'm about to finish my studies.

Do you think it is a valid option to message her on facebook? If so, what the *** am I supposed to say :)? I'm afraid it'd appear creepy to her no matter what I write, given how some female friends of mine talked about how they're turning down approaches like this in an instant or just ignoring them (granted, those were probably douchebags according to what they wrote :))

First, is it better to do internships with a company or to do research? Let me explain this previous summer (freshman year) I did research with my school in environmental science (mercury in peatlands). While I am not going into the environmental sciences, I do have the option of continuing this this upcoming summer. My ideal job is medicinal chemistry or in a more general idea, synthesis chemistry. That is I enjoy making things where as this research I did was a lot more analytic work and very little wet work. Wow...that got wordy.

TL;DR: Is it better to do research (even if it's unrelated to final goal) or to get job experience through internships? I plan on going to gradschool after I graduate.

My second question regards more finding the internships. When is the best time to start looking for internships? I'm poking around right now and I can only find five or six internships near my area (I live in Minnesota, very close to minneapolis) so is it because there just aren't that many or because companies and the like aren't posting them yet?

TL;DR When should I start looking for summer internships?

In the end, this is all for me to gain more knowledge because I just love chemistry so that's fun plus it helps a lot when I apply to grad school. 

If there are any clarifications I can make, please tell me. "

Our office is swamped as it is, we have around 30 people working for Senator Murray and everybody has been working insanely hard with the deficit ceiling fiasco and now this Joint Select Committee (as it is known on the hill). It would be difficult to find time to create this website and relay information back and forth between the JSC and the people in charge of the website, but that being said, it is very important that this committee not be muddled by lobbying and corporate influence. The only way this would be feasible would be to create a separate workforce, independent from any of the 12 member's staff, which may in fact be the best plan to avoid corruption. An unbiased department dedicated to upholding transparency sounds good in theory.
I have my own reserves about her affiliation with many prominent defense contractors and especially the Aerospace Industries Association which many of these contractors belong to. She was recently awarded the Wings of Liberty award by this association, and while it is not unheard of for senators to receive awards from these sort of associations, given the fact that she is tasked with cutting funds from (crossing my fingers that she chooses this route instead of cutting entitlement programs) the Defense budget, it is fishy that they have given her this award. They are trying to cozy up with her and make it all lovey dovey or whatever you want to call it.
That being said, even us interns have been working our assess off, as has Patty Murray. Despite the high workload levels lately, every call that we receive is recorded though, every email we see gets put on a tally. The more emails we receive, the more calls we receive, the better the chance that Patty Murray will receive the message of what the American people want. I implore you, while sitting at your computers, browsing reddit, pick up your phone, open your email and shoot us a line. Say what you want, you can even say more than one opinion and each opinion will be added to the tally.
I can't stress this enough, if you want us to do something for you, contact us and say: ""Hi, my name is ___________. I am calling/writing in regards to the Joint Select Committee. I want to have transparency in this committee, I want to have the Defense budget cut and I want entitlement programs to be protected at all costs"" or whatever your opinion may be. Your opinion will be put on a tally, and at the end of each week, Patty Murray will see this tally personally. If she sees the numbers for certain things jumping off the charts, I promise you she will take notice. She is a politician, but she is a rational human being as well, and this is the MOST EFFECTIVE WAY POSSIBLE TO VOICE YOUR OPINION AND HAVE YOUR OPINION BE HEARD!!!!

I'm completely clueless, guys, and would love some tips so that I know what I'm working with. 

Could you give me some examples or tests I could run? I have complete access so I can get to play around with it. I have a shitload of pres at my disposal so I can really test stuff, with all of them. I'm really good with mics, because I have a ear for EQs, but this preamp thing has eluded me for too long.

kisez,5,2011-09-17,Graduate program related to neuroscience/bioinformatics?,adietofworms,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/kisez/graduate_program_related_to/,"Hi! I'm a neuroscience major in my senior year of college. I'd like to enter a Ph.D. program right after I graduate, and my future goal is to research mental illness. Also, I did a bioinformatics internship this summer and I loved it, much more than wet lab.

Ideally, what I would like to research in graduate school is neuroscience from a computational standpoint, preferably somehow related to mental illness. I'm having trouble finding programs. I've found a couple of programs I'm interested in, but I was curious if anyone out there knows of schools that have programs like this? Say, bioinformatics with a lot of neuroscience involved or vice versa?

Thank you!"

Distance: ~400 miles

I recently graduated from college, found an internship, and started dating an old friend of mine. Due to work she moved home where she could find a job as a nurse, and because of money I moved in with my parents and commuted 120 miles a day to an internship.  She works nights and it has been difficult to communicate with her, shes at work during my free time, and asleep when I'm awake. We text a lot when we can, it We've been together for a little over a year, and things were great at the start but now I feel like I'm just holding on. I just recently lost my internship, and have to look for work, preferably one in my field. More and more I feel like I should devote more time to my career and my portfolio, anxiety is building, and depression is creeping in. It's just been like a slow drain, I don't even want to feel like this.  

I feel like things are not even in the relationship, she makes significantly more money than me, more so now that I lost my work. I'm not happy about my current living situation, and I feel like I need to work towards my independence. I feel like I cannot contribute on an even level and that has always bothered me. The morning before I lost my job, she wanted to know where she should move to be with me. She used to want to become a travel nurse or move away. I feel like we gave up on our dreams. Communication issues I guess. I don't know what to do.

Thanks for listening reddit.
full of anxiety,
SlowMeaux


What if she was closer, could we build back that foundation? Is all hope lost? Am I just an asshole?"

kiowz,6,2011-09-17,This is normal? ,booo_123,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/kiowz/this_is_normal/,"Background on me: I am currently a senior at a pretty well known university in California. I am an econ and CS major. I used to have stellar grades, but with CS. I am down to a 3.4 

This summer, I had the chance to intern for a research institute abroad. My research was in cloud computing. It wasn't what I expected. I did not code or do anything CS related except for reading academic papers and writing my own study paper (it may be published in a local journal). This internship, as cliche as I sound, inspired me. I got to live the life of a native, and I want to continue that.

I will graduate this Spring, and I have no idea what I want to do. I enjoy Econ and CS, but I don't love CS. I can not sit and program. I like learning about the new technology, but not all that coding and debugging. But, I still want a masters because I am interested in A.I and machine learning (yes, I know there is coding involved). As of now, I just do not know if I should go into industry where I will probably have a great job with many perks. But I would rather go to grad school, preferably not the U.S. I loved my international experience, and I just feel I am at the age of exploration and freedom. I been looking at many European grad schools, mostly in England and Sweden. But, I do not feel competitive at all. I know I have to apply just to try. I guess what I am asking is: did anyone feel this way and what did you do? Did you just do what you could or just let the universe kick in? 

tldr: I feel my future is bleak. 

Edit: What careers or paths can a person go into if he does not enjoy coding, but likes technology and has the technical degree. One that I have been informed of is technology consulting. "
kio3r,1,2011-09-17,"Don't pray, THIS is how you can help achieve transparency in the Joint Select Committee (the congressional supercommittee)!!",rastabrah,politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/kio3r/dont_pray_this_is_how_you_can_help_achieve/,"I actually work for Senator Patty Murray (D-WA) as an intern at the present time, and first off, I don't know how transparency would be feasible. Our office is swamped as it is, we have around 30 people working for Senator Murray and everybody has been working insanely hard with the deficit ceiling fiasco and now this Joint Select Committee (as it is known on the hill). It would be difficult to find time to create this website and relay information back and forth between the JSC and the people in charge of the website, but that being said, it is very important that this committee not be muddled by lobbying and corporate influence. The only way this would be feasible would be to create a separate workforce, independent from any of the 12 member's staff, which may in fact be the best plan to avoid corruption. An unbiased department dedicated to upholding transparency sounds good in theory.

I have my own reserves about her affiliation with many prominent defense contractors and especially the Aerospace Industries Association which many of these contractors belong to. She was recently awarded the Wings of Liberty award by this association, and while it is not unheard of for senators to receive awards from these sort of associations, given the fact that she is tasked with cutting funds from (crossing my fingers that she chooses this route instead of cutting entitlement programs) the Defense budget, it is fishy that they have given her this award. They are trying to cozy up with her and make it all lovey dovey or whatever you want to call it.

That being said, even us interns have been working our assess off, as has Patty Murray. Despite the high workload levels lately, every call that we receive is recorded though, every email we see gets put on a tally. The more emails we receive, the more calls we receive, the better the chance that Patty Murray will receive the message of what the American people want. I implore you, while sitting at your computers, browsing reddit, pick up your phone, open your email and shoot us a line. Say what you want, you can even say more than one opinion and each opinion will be added to the tally.

I can't stress this enough, if you want us to do something for you, contact us and say: ""Hi, my name is ___________. I am calling/writing in regards to the Joint Select Committee. I want to have transparency in this committee, I want to have the Defense budget cut and I want entitlement programs to be protected at all costs"" or whatever your opinion may be. Your opinion will be put on a tally, and at the end of each week, Patty Murray will see this tally personally. If she sees the numbers for certain things jumping off the charts, I promise you she will take notice. She is a politician, but she is a rational human being as well, and this is the MOST EFFECTIVE WAY POSSIBLE TO VOICE YOUR OPINION AND HAVE YOUR OPINION BE HEARD!!!! Unfortunately the Senator does not read reddit.

Also, about clothes. Does it get super cold? I read that Danes dress more conservatively and wear more muted colors. Should I bring rain boots? Clothes are pretty expensive and I want to be as prepared as possible. What do you recommend NOT bringing?

kjvp7,13,2011-09-18,"A fat, poverty stricken girl needs help getting motivated and budgeting weight loss on $2 a day. ",FatNSassyAintClass,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/kjvp7/a_fat_poverty_stricken_girl_needs_help_getting/,"I apologize in advance if the details seem too... detaily. TL;DR at bottom.

Bit of a sob-story, please bear with me: 

I'm 5' 10, and have that magical gene that keeps the fat proportioned so well that I could gain 30 lbs and not shift a pant or shirt size. This is a blessing in some ways, and a curse in most other ways, but I'll get to that in a bit.

I've been fat pretty much all of my life, except for a brief dance with adderall in sophmore year that left me at the skinniest I've ever been - 118 lbs. As soon as my doctor took me off of it, I immediately swelled back up to 200 lbs (my lifelong average). I came from a family that swore I would be fat no matter what I did, and I didn't have any friends to tell me different, or the confidence to challenge it.

The summer after highschool, I got a job that didn't require me to go out very often, and when I did go out, it was mostly to meet new coworkers that I would be coordinating online with later. For an entire year, I sat on my ass, and it soon dawned on me that something was amiss. I couldn't fit in my pants. When I went to buy clothes for the first time in forever, the weight gain finally set in. I stopped by the grocery store on the way home because of their $0.25 bathroom scale. I hadn't been on a scale in two years. 250lbs. I went home, and had another twinkie. This was last June.

Skip ahead to December, which was by far the worst month of my life. I had just lost my job while starting an unpaid, work-heavy internship, and had the worst possible miscarriage while on an IUD, that left me unable to function until February. I ballooned from 250 to 287 in a little under two months because of all of the medication, swelling, and crippling depression. 

I can't name the exact moment that I saw the light, but soon after, I pulled the proverbial handbrake and did a total 180. I started exercising, eating better, and generally taking care of myself. I pulled myself out of my funk, and today, I weigh just under 240lbs. 

I should be happy and excited. I've lost 50 lbs. But the glorious gene that kept me from noticing the weight gain, has kept me from noticing the loss as well. I don't look or feel any different. My body looks the exact same to me, and apparently it does to everyone else around me, too. My mom saw me for the first time since Christmas yesterday (when I was at my absolute heaviest). ""I can really see it in your face"" she says.

My face. I've lost 50 lbs, and the only difference it made was in my face.
If most other people lost 50lbs, the end result would be extreme. But not me. Apparently I had the head the size of a 5 year old boy, and nobody had mentioned it before.

So here I am, 50lbs later, and I realized that the savings that were supposed to get me through 2 more months of internship is gone. Without going into the the mindfuck that is Bank of America, I am completely broke and still have about 95lbs to go before I reach a modest weight for my height. The amount of internship I have is keeping me from having a part time job, and it looks like the only thing that is going to get me though the next two months is plasma donation money.



Reddit, I need an attack plan. How do I get by on literally $2 a day, lose weight, and still have the energy for my 50 hour work week internship for the next 2 months? HELP.

I studied Media and Entertainment management in the Netherlands and I specialized in advertising/marketing. Because I’m totally free at the moment (no school, girlfriend, work etc) I can do whatever I want. 

Where a lot of people immediately go into nine to five jobs somewhere nearby, I would rather gain experience somewhere else. I'd like to use all my savings to travel abroad. See different places, meeting interesting people and experience new things.

That's why I'd like to travel to the US, get a decent job and gain work experience while traveling on weekends. I'm looking for someone who can help me one step further. I need a job, contributing to the American economy, or a internship to get into the country. So that's where my focus lies right now. Since I hardly have any connections in the US I thought I'll give reddit a try. A fellow redditor told me that Portland is a great city for my plans. It has al the charm of a major city while all the people still are friendly. 

So, basically, a job in the advertisment/marketing branch would be great. If you can help me with that or do you have other tips for me? please let me know. About me; I'm a 23 year old guy from the Netherlands, I got some graphic design skills and studied Media/advertisment. Feel free to check out my portfolio and resume at [www.jaspersteggink.nl].

kjgve,5,2011-09-18,Girlfriend returned to her country.  Now acting icy at times.,Hyper_Fujisawa,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/kjgve/girlfriend_returned_to_her_country_now_acting_icy/,"I'm 27(m) and my girlfriend(25) of 4 years returned to her native Korea on the 2nd of September.  We had been talking about marriage before she left, so we were very serious about our future together.

**Our Background:** 

We met overseas during study abroad, and after our programs ended we returned to our respective home countries and continued a long distance relationship for 8~9 months.  I was lucky and found employment in Korea as an intern English teacher.  We continued along in Korea until my one year internship expired, at which point we made arrangements to return to the US with her as a student.  We lived together in America for a little over a year and a half.   She ultimately could not afford any more terms at her school here and had to return.  The intern English teacher program in Korea was no longer available so I was forced to remain here.  We had previously planned to return together, but learned too late that the program was gone (which was my only viable option, as I only currently hold an associate's).

**The Problem:** 

Since her return she has been like Dr. Jekyl and Ms. Hyde.  Half the time she's the same adorable girl I fell in love with, the rest... she seems annoyed by me.  I don't think I've been clingy.  In fact, she had been prodding me to contact her more often.
During her bad moods, she wouldn't have much to say on the phone, and asking about her day, or pry other details seemed to annoy her further.
About a week after she got back, she wrote me an email saying that she wanted to break up, but after about six hours she did an about face and was back to normal.
Since that it's been back and forth with her Dr. Jecky and Ms. Hyde.  It's like she's two people, and I never know which one I'm going to get on the line.
Two days ago I told her about a stressful day of mine, and said I could use some cheering up.  She sent me a cheery email saying ""call me call me.""  I called her up and we had connection issues, so I dialed her again.  Even though she had (happily?)asked me to call her, she didn't have much to say and quickly became noticeably annoyed at me.  She said she wanted to hang up, and I said ""okay, I'll call you one more time to say good night before I got to sleep.""  About a minute later I get an email telling me that she doesn't want me to call her one more time before bed, that I'm ""bothering her.""

That was two days ago.  She hasn't replied to my emails, or answered my phone calls.
Today I tried calling her but it didn't even ring and went straight to a recorded message.  I don't understand enough Korean to know what it says.  I *think* it means that her phone is off... but a crazy part of me thinks she might have changed her phone number so I couldn't reach her.

**The Kicker:** She owes my family about $1,500;  Flight to and from the US, and some of her school tuition.  We (my family and I) thought her father with a rather successful business would pay it back quickly.  The economy is bad over there now and she said he couldn't afford to pay now.  Before she had stopped communication it seemed she was going to try and pay off her debt by herself after finding a job.

**My Questions:**

1.  Should I give her some space, or keep trying to contact her?  If I were to not try to contact her, I feel she would think that I don't care about her anymore.  (That's not me being clingy, she thinks that way sometimes.)

2.  What kind of advice can you give me to weather the storm?  If my relationship isn't FUBAR, were looking at at least 6months of LDR before we can see each other again.

3.  If my relationship is fucked, what should I do about the money?

**TL;DR:**  South Korean GF(25) of four years moved back to Korea because of money problems.  She owes my family $1,500.  In the 16 days she's been back she's been Dr. Jekyl and Ms. Hyde.  She seems annoyed by me, even though I'm not doing anything out of the ordinary.  She hasn't contacted me in over two days, despite having a smart phone and a computer at home.  Afraid she changed her phone number.

Just writing this has helped me calm down a little bit, and I appreciate any advice you could give.


  Please send help."

I am a high school senior that will be 18 in April, so it has been hard trying to find a relevant job or even an internship. I am currently taking college classes during the week as well, and a job is not super imperative for me right now, but if an awesome opportunity arises I would definitely be willing to take the time and effort to do so.

I've had one ~job~ but it was under-the-table, I only earned 5/hour and it wasn't a situation I wanted to stay in. It was at a snowball stand, so I have a good bit of customer service under my belt, but a lot of my skills could really be put to use in an office of sorts. It's likely I can type faster than most adults, and I'm proficient in all of Microsoft Office. I can answer a phone and be places on time. I have a resume with a bit of volunteer work on it and some freelance photography experience, but I would really like to get started somewhere that can really help me in the future.

So, thanks for reading this and if you have any advice (offers possibly?!?!1) I would be so willing to take it!

To clarify, if it's an unpaid internship that can help me in the future, then that is great, and if it's a job that pays minimum and can also help me in the future, then that is awesome, too. However, I am not looking for something under-the-table."

But now I'm having second thoughts. I'm purely interested in going into industry, not research or academia. From what I've read here and elsewhere it seems a MS won't do much more for me over actual work experience. But I'm split since I can get it in one year, and should be able to get my (paid) internship back for the summer after getting my BS. 

Money, as far as student debt, won't really be an issue. Its more of a question of bang it out now, when I can get it quickly, vs go straight into a job and decide later on, but (I assume) then it will take much longer"

kkojx,3,2011-09-19,"Advice for an older applicant with some age cutoffs on the horizon: October LSAT with an OK shot at T1, or June with a small shot at T14?  ",IAM_HenryClay_AMA,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/kkojx/advice_for_an_older_applicant_with_some_age/,"Hi Folks,

I've been considering Law School for about six years now -- it's not a decision I've taken lightly and I've already postponed applying at least one year because of the current market. 

Unfortunately, I'm not getting any younger, and since one of my career goals is to work as a special agent for the federal government (recruiters at FBI/etc. suggested law/language to make me most competitive, since the military is not in my cards). I can't keep postponing much longer because of age requirements.  

Here's the situation: I have great softs (some incredibly competitive and relevant national-level internships, a great personal narrative, about a year and a half work experience in public interest work on K street), 4.0 GPA from a top regional school, including one year at Oxford, great LoRs from respected alums of Yale and UChicago who know me very well

Here's the hitch -- I've been studying for the LSATs for about four months now (all the power score bibles, Manhattan Logic Games, about 40 practice tests) and I seem to have plateaued. At a disappointing 160. I've just never been very good at standardized tests (I got an 1100 on my SATs that preceded my 4.0 GPA). I'll, of course, write an addendum addressing this. Even so, I'd say my chances at T14 are zilch, and T30 only iffy. 

It kills me that the my LSAT performance is the only thing between me and a shot at T14, so I'm wondering whether I should not take the October LSAT and try and bump up my score for June. 

Like I said, because of my specific goals and my age, it would be difficult to put this off another year. My job, while a good soft, is at a dead end as far as turning it into a career (and frankly, I am miserable here). And I'm skeptical I can raise my score much more after how little I have improved.  But I'm open to suggestions, because I don't want to close any more doors than is necessary. 

So, what's your opinion given my circumstances: shoot for a 160 in October, apply early and hope for a T1, or hold out until June?  

Thanks for your input, I really do appreciate any insight

tl;dr: Have a T14 app apart from LSAT scores, which plateau at 160 on my practice tests. Already put off applying several years. Should I take the October LSAT and aim for the 160 or hold out longer, even if that complicates my planned career path? "

kkjru,3,2011-09-19,"Confused about my college and living situation, what should I do?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/kkjru/confused_about_my_college_and_living_situation/,"So this is kind of a screwy situation I've gotten myself into. I really regret not taking a year off between high school and college to figure this out.

My situation is this:

My home state is Michigan. I went to a community college there for a year, and took on a very small federal loan to do so. After a year, I decided I would rather transfer to a bigger university, due to the fact that MI is having some big issues politically and economically, not to mention that there are very, very few computer-related jobs in the state.

So I decided to transfer to a school in Massachusetts. Lots of computer jobs here, more opportunity and it's fared well in the recession. So I go to a university here, which is $10k in federal loans per year. This is my second year, making my debt $20k so far.

Up until now, I've taken on nothing but federal loans, as those can be deferred, forbearance etc, and are generally not as ruthless as private loans. (I would hate to have to take on private loans, because if something happens to me financially, I'm screwed.)

Anyway, that's great and all. I like my school and my financial aid covers my tuition almost exactly. My problem is that I can't afford to live anywhere.

See, right now, I'm staying at my girlfriend's and her family's house. I feel incredibly guilty about this and promised them I would only stay until I'm eligible for dorming at the school. I have no doubt that I would get in spring.

Again, that seems reasonable, and they're nice people. Unfortunately, I feel that I've overstayed my welcome and that I really need to move out some place, whether it's the dorms or an apartment. So providing I get a dorm, they will expect me to move out in the spring.

So what's the problem? 

Like I said earlier: my federal loans just about equal my tuition; that is, I've maxed them out and cannot take out anymore. Room and board is another $4,500 on my bill every semester, for which I cannot get anymore federal loans for.

I have no savings, and am a full-time student, working work study at the school (which pays shit) and an internship, meaning I'm busy Mon-Fri, 8 AM to 6 PM, every week. I could get a part-time job that's nights and weekends, but nothing seems to be hiring, and even if I got one, the pay wouldn't cover half of what it would cost to dorm.

There's also private loans, which I am completely disinterested in. Even if I wanted to get one, I physically do not know anybody with good enough credit to co-sign it.

So yeah. I'm kind of fucked, if only for next semester and the coming years.

What I *really* want to do is take a year off of school, figure everything out and get some serious life experience in. Figure out my loans, figure out my job, living situation, etc. I would, but I'm worried about my loans, especially since I took them out in two different states. How does that work? Is there any way I can defer them for an entire year before going back to school?

Thanks for any advice, and if there is an appropriate subreddit for this post, let me know."

	Work on Quark Xpress : layout on 4 catalogues, graphic research for their cover, creation of 7 posters.


Those Works allowed him to make an excellent use of the theoretical knowledge he had, and to master the software he discovered during his education, as well as discovering Quark Xpress.


During the time Bladle was with us, he had been a serious, meticulous, listening, and good spirited intern. He was autonomic enough and knew when to answer the good questions. Moreover, his work was of high quality, and the work he did with the clients will leave a good memory to them,.


I have no doubt that Bladle has all the necessary abilities and motivation to quickly integrate a dynamic team.


Yours faithfully,


And the other one,

Dear Sir or Madam,


I have been Bladle’s teacher all along the school year 2010/2011, at School name, Graphic Design, Multimedia and 3D section.


I taught the print part : Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign ; as well as the web part : HTML, CSS, Flash (with Action Script 3) ; and the 3D/video part : 3D Studio Max with Adobe After Effects and Premiere Pro.


Being one of Bladle’s class main teacher, I had plenty of time to evaluate his capacities. I noted constent improvements all year long, only to see him master most of the subjects.


Bladle is a serious student, he gives heed, and is always ready to use what he learned. His passion both for design and computing allow him to learn quickly while enjoying it. He is curious, insterested and always want to learn more.


During the group exercises, Bladle showed great leadership abilities, management and organisation skills, and he brought his team to give high quality Works.


His objective to perfect his education in an American college seems excellent. I believe that such curriculum would be good both professionaly and personally. Moreover, he will bring all his energy and learning thurst to the institution that will have the luck to receive him.


Yours faithfully,


Thanks in advance, and thanks thanks for the wonderful work this community does.

I don't know if there will be a lot of interest but ask away.",volunteeroranje,IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/kk9oc/iama_former_borders_employee_ama_i_left_last/,"After seeing the comments on [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/kjygd/things_we_never_told_you_ode_to_a_bookstore_death/) I was rather mad because I worked at Borders and was a damned good employee.  I even got offered two jobs on the spot (not that impressive, one was Verizon, but I think it's indicative of my on the job attitude) and had people ask for me by name.

Basically, the image is pretty spot on.  People say that it's smug or whiny or bitchy but we were basically lied to all day by people trying to cheat the system (like most of retail) and asked either to do the impossible (book by color, did it a few times actually), or just asked really dumb questions.  By dumb questions I don't mean things like ""didn't J.K. Rowling write Lord of the Rings?"" (I don't mind if people are actually trying to figure something out), but things like getting mad and yelling ""Why can't you print the books in a smaller format?!"" - like I made that decision haha.  But, I don't feel like anyone in the 4 stores I worked at over time were ever rude or smug to customers that weren't incredibly rude in the first place (i.e. screaming, insulting, breaking equipment/books/toys/fixtures).  The list in the image that I linked to is mostly born out of bitterness of being forced out of a business that we love.

I really loved working at Borders.  I felt like corporate did a shitty job but it was such a great place to work.  I'm still sad 8 months later (since I left) that I can no longer work there.  Also, because we loved to work there, watching our stores mercilessly picked apart by people (who weren't saving anymore money than what they could have with coupons, at least in the first month or 2) killed us inside and I wasn't even there for the whole shabang.

Also, I was 19 when I started and a student so I was part time.


**tl;dr - Worked at Borders. Loved it. Ask away.  I'm a student with 2 jobs and an internship but I'll answer as many as I can!**

edit 1: haha shit I messed up the title.

Prior to college I was a decent kid, drank a little bit starting my junior year of high school and smoked pot on the weekends. Once I came to uni (one of the top party schools in the U.s.) shit got crazy real fast. I quickly met alot of people and joined the ""drug crowd"" which was rather large at this school. 

Psychadelics, stimulants, opiates, you name it. I used to go around with online-bought salvia (it was legal everywhere at the time) and pack it up for random people at parties just to see their reactions for fun. I fucked (literally) and fucked (emotionally) with alot of girls. Sorority, hipster, emo, sporty. I hooked up with them all for my own benefit. Alot of these girls clung on to me and I would often juggle 2-3 at a time without them knowing. I feel really bad about this now, as some of them were awesome, cool girls but I was just a fucking selfish drugged up, womanizing asshole at the time. I even fucked a grad student teacher when I was a sophomore, word got around somehow and someone posted this on JuicyCampus (used to be a college gossip site). I got alot of angry phone calls / texts/ personal confrontations after that from alot of girls I hooked up with.

I stopped consistently hooking up all the time after all this and my junior year of college started around that time. I had been consistently still expirimenting with all sorts of drugs during all this time, but I got deep into cocaine. Found a large connect from out of town for the white stuff and slowly started getting fishscale (very good purity) coke delivered to me that I could cut and turn into large profits in this college town. Basically to make this shorter, I started making alot of money and being rather well-known around campus for being the dude with the coke. I rarely focused on my school work, but I still managed to graduate this past June. I milked the coke deals and hardcore partying on the stuff until graduation.

The thing is, I had a crazy fucking college career but when I look back at it, I regret all of it. This is because I'm now graduated, never got any internship or work experience during school because I was too busy selling dope, and can't find shit for work. All the girls I hooked up with doesn't mean shit because I never took it to a relationship level with any of them, I was a true asshole. All of the ""friends"" I had I don't hear from anymore because I quit the dope game. No coke, no one calls anymore. I sit here, living with my parents now, trying to find work.

At times I want to call up some connects, say fuck it and get down there and start dealing again. But fuck that, I got away with being an immoral asshole for way too long. I just want to be legit, and be a good person. I guess I just wanted to get this off my mind. If you take anything away from any of this long post, it should be that no matter how awesome all the vices, money, drugs seem at the moment, REAL friendships,relationships and a earning a legit living is way more important in the end.

kk563,52,2011-09-19,I'm still bitter.,NRussiaAccountThrowU,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/kk563/im_still_bitter/,"I was in mental hospitals through the last few years of high school. I went into this one place. I had a doctor assigned to me. Her name for sake of this story is Dr. Sulz. She had a very calming voice at first but that was the worst. It made me feel comfortable until she used it against me. Everything I said. 

I know you may think I am unstable, or I am insane in this way, but I can assure you I am not. She told me my journal was private, and that it was a place for me to talk to myself. I later found out it was a place for the staff to sit around and mock me, as I got a woman coming up to me asking why I called her a bitch. I was alone more so than I have ever been. 

One day I took a wrapper form a pill I was taking. Klonopin. I wanted to save it as a memento to remind me never to come back here ever. She called me into her room. Holding the wrapper, and asking me why I had it. I told her the honest truth. She called me a liar, and told me to tell her the truth or I could never have visits home. So I told her that I was going to put another pill in it so I could sell it as klonopin. She said because of this behavior I could not go home. A constant trail of betrayals. I didn't go home for thanksgiving, or christmas. It was one of the darkest periods of my life. 

I'm not exaggerating, and I hesitate to tell people because they seldom believe me. There were other things that went on, but I'll keep it short. 

I made my life better by me. I did everything to get better, myself. I am attractive now. I am known for being overly productive at my work place. I have a good future lined up for me, and a good GPA. I have done an internship, and I know 3 other languages. I am a smart, good looking, productive member of society.

Yet I can't help to think of my time in those places every day. Usually for about an hour on and off. I think of this woman. Dr. Sulz. The hatred I had for her manipulating me. The lies she told me. How she said that there was nothing I could do unless she wanted me to do it. My hatred never died down for Dr. Sulz.

I thought of what I would do if I saw her. Mind you this has been playing over and over in my head. What would I do?

Would I tell her I am better? People say living well is the best revenge, but I want her to take no credit for what she thought she may have accomplished. 

Would I tell her I am worse? I could curse at her, I could tell her how much of an awful woman she is. What satisfaction would that give her? Would she think she is better than me for walking away, for not yelling back? Would she think I am still not in a good space?

Would I just say nothing? Would I just stand there. Would I be a deer in the headlights and freeze. Making her feel like she could still intimidate me. 

I never knew what the right thing to do would be. 

I saw her at work today. It was me and another cashier at the counter. I did not have any preparation in my head. I was going on my break. The other cashier was helping someone. I walked over and said ""I'm going on my break now."" She responded ""Sure."" I look up at the customer and it is Dr. Sulz. I had always thought people were being poetic when they talked about minutes seeming like hours. As soon as I had realized I had made eye contact with that woman, Dr. Sulz. I broke it. The shortest eye contact I have had with anyone.

I walked away. More numb than I have ever felt. I know she recognized me, and I only hope she does not think I recognized her. I would not want to give her the satisfaction of thinking she occupies my head for even a fraction of how much I do think about everything.

I drove home, questioning if I should just drive into a phone pole for no reason, so I never have to have this confrontation with anyone again. I'm not suicidal, I would not do that, but the thought certainly seemed nice."

Anyone else take an unusual path through college but end up graduating? Any success stories?
I'm a senior graduating in May 2012 and am panicking about my job prospects.

**Here's Why:**
Worked full time for 2.5 years while going to a local CC and paying my own way. It sucked, it was hard, but it ultimately made me a better, more rounded person. Saved up enough to transfer to a local university. Didn't work 1st year (Jr. year) so I could adjust to the workload and living in a new city by myself. During this time I read as many books relevant to business and my field as possible, and in general tried to absorb as much knowledge as possible wherever I could find it. Summer comes, and I had to take care of family member due to events out of my control, so I took more classes (double major) but no internship. It's now fall, companies are circling the herd and making offers, but I feel way behind my peers. 

**I ended up with:**
* 2.98 GPA
* No Internships
* No Extracurriculars 
* 2.5 Years delivering pizza to pay for school. That's it.

My career fair and mixers are all this week, but I feel like I have an awful resume, so I'm considering not going until the spring rolls around. In the meantime, I plan to try and improve my resume. Anyone have a similar experience? Guess you could call it senior year panic. I'm a little older than my fellow students @23, and I'm really feeling the pressure of getting a career going. **Is there anything I can do in the next 6 months to make myself vastly more attractive to potential employers?** I'm already working on the GPA intensely and I fully expect to graduate in the 3.3-3.4 range. I'm in a really high demand major (Supply Chain Management) with excellent job placement from a top ranked program, despite the economy, so I have that much going for me. 

Anyone else an older student trying to fit in with a younger crowd? I'd love to hear from anyone who took a different or difficult route through college."

So, I just got out of a 3 year relationship. The guy was the love of my life, blah blah, we had plans to get married, etc. and then complicated things caused that relationship to end. He ended it. My heart got trampled on, I'm miserable, you get the idea. It's been 1 month. There are good days and bad days. I know that my happiness and ability to move on is my choice, and I'm trying to do just that. I'm a strong person and when I want to do something, I do it. I know I can move on, but... how in the world do I date?

I've had a total of 5 relationships, including the one that just ended. I enjoy long term relationships and I've never ""dated"". Every man I've been with was a close friend of mine prior, and romance developed. I've never been asked for my number or been to dinner with a guy I barely knew or any of that.

Since I was with my ex since our senior year of highschool, I have had NO experience meeting men in college. I am lost. Right now I have 2 male friends - one is gay, one is not my type at all. I have social anxiety issues (that I have been to cognitive behavioral therapy for) that make me really weird about getting to know new people. I don't want random sex so I'm hesitant to go to bars, however, I'm going to go with some girlfriends next week just for the novelty. I have an internship on campus and there's a guy there who I'm interested in, but I'm not so keen on mixing work with relationships considering I have to be at this job for one year. I'm also not ready to seriously try dating sites. 

I know that part of dating is learning to make yourself happy and radiating happiness. Happiness attracts others. I'm working on getting my life back together and doing my own thing. I'm positive in my ability to do this, I just don't know how to date or talk to men once I've got that accomplished. Help?"

I'm french and looking for an internship of one month in UK.
I used [internship-uk.com](http://internship-uk.com) and ,after I called them ,they accept me in Studio-Solution.com.
But a few things are strange:
* internship-uk.com and Studio-Solution.com are the same peoples
* Studio-Solution.com create a lot of ""fake"" websites (just for SEO)
* I will be working with other student

So, it look like a ""slave"" internship. Any thought on it?"

During the two years, I have made it very clear that I would like to work for the company full time.  


About a month ago, one of the VP's said I would likely be hired as a full time employee, then just yesterday I find out that I'm not getting a full time offer, and there is a small chance of my contract being extended.  


The reason why I'm feel like I've been duped is because if they really were likely to hire me as a full time, they would want to hire me once their budget frees up, but it seems like they're just ready to send me out the door.  Also, this isn't the first time this company has talked about hiring temporary workers as full timers, only to let them go anyway due to ""budget concerns"".  


Is this a way for companies to make their temporary workers feel like they did have a legitimate chance of being hired full time even though this is a very remote possibility?  The way my boss and the VP have been acting makes me feel like they're just trying to pull a fast one.


tldr: I am a temporary worker at a company, was told that I would likely be hired, but then a month later I was turned down.  Is this a show and dance just to make temporary employees feel like they were considered for hire even when they're not?"

kl95n,0,2011-09-20,Grad school applications are soon. FML,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/kl95n/grad_school_applications_are_soon_fml/,"Hey guys, 

I'm currently in my 4th year of a KIN program here in Ontario, Canada and looking to head into Physiotherapy, which I'll need a Masters of PT. Currently looking at schools in US and Canada... but don't mind international schools. 

From what I've researched, most grad schools require a MINIMUM of 3.0 in the final 2 years. Now my question is, since most deadlines for applications are between November and April, how will they take into account the grades from the winter semester of my 4th year? Since the winter semester will have commenced during the months of the deadline. 

Will they wait until all grades are in before they start accepting/rejecting people? or Will they use my grades from my 4th yr fall semester and go back until the 20 half courses/10 full courses that make up 2 years are met and used as an initial accpt/rjt line? 

--- 

The majority of the grad schools with a masters in that field will look at the GPA of your final two years. My 3rd year (last year) was 2.54/4.00 and I'm certain by the end of this 4th year, my 3rd and 4th year will have an average GPA of &gt;3.1/B~. 


I screwed up horribly during my first and second year (&lt;2.0GPA) due to a few circumstances and laziness, which I've corrected now and my marks have been improving at a good rate compared to those first two years (want to kill myself for seeing where I am now and how a few tweaks back then could have not brought me those crap marks). 


That been said, because of those early year fumbles, my cumulative GPA is bad and I am heavily relying in my 3rd and 4th yr grades. 


So to get into any Masters of Physiotherapy, I'm currently heavily relying on a 3.0GPA from my final two years, about 200 hours of volunteering as an on-field therapist (internship) with two varsity sport teams, ~50+ hours of volunteer clinical therapy internship, and hopefully good references from profs/supervisors. What are my chances?

Also, if I apply to schools in the U.S, should I do this GRE examination thingy?"

I graduated in June, with a degree in Geography and Earth Science, and a minor in GIS. I've applied to a series of jobs since then with no luck whatsoever.

Part of the problem I feel is discrimination, because I began transitioning from male to female during my senior year. My voice isn't perfect yet and definitely reads male. I'm afraid it's been the reason I've been turned down for at least a few of the jobs that I got to the phone interview stage with. 

 I graduated with honors, and with three semesters of internship experience in GIS under my belt. I thought that with research and computer science experience it'd be easy to find work.

I check GIS Jobs Clearinghouse everyday, but it seems that a lot of jobs demand experience, or a masters. 

If I can't find work within a few weeks, I'm going to be homeless (My parents charge me rent and I'm running out of money). I definitely didn't expect to graduate with thousands of dollars of debt and no job prospects... all the professors told me that the field was so hot that even with a little prejudice I'd be sure to find some work.

I'm a senior in Environmental Engineering and I'll be graduating this spring. I'm starting the job/hunt application process and I have a few questions about my GPA. Currently, I have a 2.78 and I'm really nervous about it. I was told by friends and a few sources online to omit my GPA from my resume because it is below a 3.0. I went to my university's career fair today and after handing recruiters my resume the gpa question did come up a few times. I answered confidently when asked, but I feel like I was disregarded (could have just been me thinking too much) after I told the recruiters my answer.

The thing is, I really don't feel that my gpa reflects how intelligent I am. It tells a story and that story is pretty simple: I wasn't motivated when I was a freshman/sophomore and I didn't realize the repercussions of not building a strong foundational gpa for the future. Once your GPA is a little low and the number of completed credits gets higher and higher it's really difficult to pull it up, even with decent grades.

Last semester I earned all A's and B's in my upper level engineering classes, but a recruiter isn't going to know that while looking at my resume. I have also done internships all three summers since I've been in college so I have that going for me.

I'm going back to the career fair tomorrow to try and land an interview or three, but I have some questions first:

* How should I handle the resume situation? Should I put the gpa back on there?

* How should I answer the ""What is your GPA?"" question from recruiters? Obviously, I'll tell them a truthful answer, but should I try to explain that it's because I wasn't as strong of a student earlier in my career and I've been consistently improving recently? I want to explain, but I don't want to sound like I'm making excuses or over justifying myself.

* Were any of you in a similar situation? How did you handle it? Outcome?

* If you've interviewed college students in the past how would you like to see a student go about this?

I'm a young (read 20) college kid looking to spend the summer in Shanghai for as little money as possible, or even making a little money there. I have been there once before for a few days and loved it so I really want to go back and explore, not to mention that a good friend of mine is from there and talks it up non-stop. I'm looking for suggestions of programs/jobs/etc that can make this possible on the cheap.

I was recently certified as an ESL teacher, so I do have that under my belt, along with some experience. I would love to teach but I don't think the amount of time I'd be able to be there (3 months max) makes it very plausible.

I've also been checking out some internships, but I'm not having much luck finding any in my field (Cognitive Science/Computer Science). They all seem to be  more business oriented.

Any suggestions or pointers appreciated. Thanks!"

* Manage our current Social Media Outlets
* Assist with Managing and GROWING our subscriptions and relationships
* Assist with Managing and GROWING our online presence
* Manage sales / promotions both online and within stores

* Use Adobe Photoshop and or Illustrator for retouching photos and for Media Publications
* Assist in managing our Brand's overall presence in the Industry
* Occasionally assist with various administrative tasks around the office


Sounds good right? 

Anyways they called me today and seemed pretty interested. I have an interview on monday. I asked a bit of questions on the phone and it turns out that they expect me to work 16-20 hours per week for **6 months unpaid!**  

What should I do? They are hinting strongly of offering a full time position after the internship, but 6 months sounds incredibly excessive. I would be willing to do this for 3 months tops. Is this common practice or are they looking to get me to work for free?

This poor recently graduated student would appreciate any advice. =)"

I have a ton of respect for cops (and want to work in law enforcement), but this guy was truly an ass to me for no reason.

I was involved in a bicycle-automobile collision at 16th and Poplar streets at about 9.45am this morning. Prior to the collision, I passed two PPD patrol cars, #934 and #935, stopped facing northbound on 16th at Parrish street, 1 block south of Poplar.
 As I was riding northbound on the right hand side of 16th street, I was struck on my left hand side by a car that suddenly turned right onto Poplar without signaling. When I was struck, I was legally proceeding north through the intersection and had the right-of-way. The car, a black Kia (PA plate # xxxxxx) operated by xxxxxxx stuck me on the left side and caused me to crash into the street, injuring both of my knees and slightly damaging my bike. The vehicle operator stopped and exited his vehicle. A bicyclist behind me (witness xxxxx, information taken by officers) called 911 to report the collision. Approximately 5-10 minutes later, PFD ambulance M-11 arrived and a medic treated the injuries to my knees. It was not until roughly 15 minutes after the initial call that the PPD cars stopped at Parrish (less than 500 feet south and in direct view of the accident) drove up the street to assist me. The first officer to arrive (and the one which I am filing a complaint about) was P/O Lewis, badge #2930 in car #934. He took both of our information and discussed what had happened. Shortly after he arrived, P/O Davis, badge #5330 drove the 500 feet up the street in car #935. P/O Lewis issued a ticket to the motorist for failure to provide insurance information, which is obviously unrelated to the collision.
 My specific complaint is that A) P/O Lewis refused to issue a citation to the motorist as a result of the incident, and B) that he was rude to me and ultimately left the scene without resolving the issue.
 Both myself and witness xxxxx noted that the black Kia did not have its turn signals on when it initiated the turn and collided with me. As per PA Title 75 §3334(b), a vehicle MUST signal their intended movement, either by turn signal or by hand, within 100 feet of the turn. Both myself and the bicyclist who was directly behind me can confirm the fact that this was clearly not done by the motorist. When I told P/O Lewis that Mr. xxxxx broke the law by not signaling his turn (thereby resulting in my crash and injury), he dismissed it and became rude when I insisted that this was the case. He repeated to me over and over again that 'I didn't see it' when I asked as to whether the motorist would be cited for failure to signal, reckless driving, or some other violation. He informed me that if he were to ticket the driver, he would ticket me as well; he gave no basis for this statement, and then decided that he quote 'won't even give you (sic) that pleasure' (presumably of giving me a ticket for lawfully riding in my right-of-way).
 Whether or not P/O Lewis saw the collision (which indeed happened in plain view of himself and P/O Davis) is immaterial as to the actual violation that occurred. For example, if a motorist runs a red light and crashes into a lawfully driven vehicle, will the offending driver not face a citation for breaking the law if an officer 'didn't see it'? This explanation is obviously insufficient, and he made absolutely no attempt to find out whether or not Mr. xxxxxx violated the law by not signaling within 100 feet of his turn, and asked 'what's wrong with you (sic)?' and also laughed at me when I reiterated that Mr. xxxxx injured me by breaking the law.
 He again ignored me when I asked if there were other options for having the driver cited or made liable in any other way for injuring me. As a former intern for the DA's Office, I am aware that one can file private criminal complaints somehow; however P/O Lewis again ignored me when I asked about this option. I also asked if I could have a copy of the 75-48 incident report, and he refused, saying 'I ain't gonna help you (sic) out' and instead gave me a DCN number on a scrap of paper. He then ignored the other questions that I had, and instead told me that he didn't like me and walked to his patrol car and left.
 I feel that the attitude and response of these officers, particularly P/O Lewis was utterly ridiculous, and that both P/O Lewis and P/O Davis failed to even attempt to enforce the traffic law. Furthermore, it is absolutely ridiculous that I was treated with such negativity and rudeness as a victim of an ignorant driver."

officers could care less.",orvisdriver,philadelphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/kn2zz/driver_hit_and_injured_me_while_biking_to_class/,"A copy of a complaint I wrote to the PPD following the incident this morning. I have a ton of respect for cops, but this guy was truly an ass to me for no reason.
 
I was involved in a bicycle-automobile collision at 16th and Poplar streets at about 9.45am this morning. Prior to the collision, I passed two PPD patrol cars, #934 and #935, stopped facing northbound on 16th at Parrish street, 1 block south of Poplar.

As I was riding northbound on the right hand side of 16th street, I was struck on my left hand side by a car that suddenly turned right onto Poplar without signaling. When I was struck, I was legally proceeding north through the intersection and had the right-of-way. The car, a black Kia (PA plate # xxxxxx) operated by xxxxxxx stuck me on the left side and caused me to crash into the street, injuring both of my knees and slightly damaging my bike. The vehicle operator stopped and exited his vehicle. A bicyclist behind me (witness xxxxx, information taken by officers) called 911 to report the collision. Approximately 5-10 minutes later, PFD ambulance M-11 arrived and a medic treated the injuries to my knees. It was not until roughly 15 minutes after the initial call that the PPD cars stopped at Parrish (less than 500 feet south and in direct view of the accident) drove up the street to assist me. The first officer to arrive (and the one which I am filing a complaint about) was P/O Lewis, badge #2930 in car #934. He took both of our information and discussed what had happened. Shortly after he arrived, P/O Davis, badge #5330 drove the 500 feet up the street in car #935. P/O Lewis issued a ticket to the motorist for failure to provide insurance information, which is obviously unrelated to the collision.

My specific complaint is that A) P/O Lewis refused to issue a citation to the motorist as a result of the incident, and B) that he was rude to me and ultimately left the scene without resolving the issue.

Both myself and witness xxxxx noted that the black Kia did not have its turn signals on when it initiated the turn and collided with me. As per PA Title 75 §3334(b), a vehicle MUST signal their intended movement, either by turn signal or by hand, within 100 feet of the turn. Both myself and the bicyclist who was directly behind me can confirm the fact that this was clearly not done by the motorist. When I told P/O Lewis that Mr. xxxxx broke the law by not signaling his turn (thereby resulting in my crash and injury), he dismissed it and became rude when I insisted that this was the case. He repeated to me over and over again that 'I didn't see it' when I asked as to whether the motorist would be cited for failure to signal, reckless driving, or some other violation. He informed me that if he were to ticket the driver, he would ticket me as well; he gave no basis for this statement, and then decided that he quote 'won't even give you (sic) that pleasure' (presumably of giving me a ticket for lawfully riding in my right-of-way).

Whether or not P/O Lewis saw the collision (which indeed happened in plain view of himself and P/O Davis) is immaterial as to the actual violation that occurred. For example, if a motorist runs a red light and crashes into a lawfully driven vehicle, will the offending driver not face a citation for breaking the law if an officer 'didn't see it'? This explanation is obviously insufficient, and he made absolutely no attempt to find out whether or not Mr. xxxxxx violated the law by not signaling within 100 feet of his turn, and asked 'what's wrong with you (sic)?' and also laughed at me when I reiterated that Mr. xxxxx injured me by breaking the law.

He again ignored me when I asked if there were other options for having the driver cited or made liable in any other way for injuring me. As a former intern for the DA's Office, I am aware that one can file private criminal complaints somehow; however P/O Lewis again ignored me when I asked about this option. I also asked if I could have a copy of the 75-48 incident report, and he refused, saying 'I ain't gonna help you (sic) out' and instead gave me a DCN number on a scrap of paper. He then ignored the other questions that I had, and instead told me that he didn't like me and walked to his patrol car and left.

I feel that the attitude and response of these officers, particularly P/O Lewis was utterly ridiculous, and that both P/O Lewis and P/O Davis failed to even attempt to enforce the traffic law. Furthermore, it is absolutely ridiculous that I was treated with such negativity and rudeness as a victim of an ignorant driver."

Sounds good right? 

Anyways they called me today and seemed pretty interested. I have an interview on monday. I asked a bit of questions on the phone and it turns out that they expect me to work 16-20 hours per week for **6 months unpaid!**  

What should I do? They are hinting strongly of offering a full time position after the internship, but 6 months sounds incredibly excessive. I would be willing to do this for 3 months tops. Is this common practice or are they looking to get me to work for free?

Advice?

kn08q,6,2011-09-21,What are my options?,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/kn08q/what_are_my_options/,"Here are the facts:
I will be graduating with my BBA in accounting this December. I have a 3.13 cumulative GPA and my major GPA is 2.75. After this last semester those will both go up slightly (hopefully).

I haven't been able to get an internship while in school, not for lack of trying. And I won't be CPA eligible upon graduation. I'll have the 150 hours requirement due to switching majors several times, but I'll still be short on accounting hours. 

So my question to r/Accounting is what are my options?

I want to work as an auditor, but I lack relevant experience and CPA hours. I'm considering applying to Masters programs to get the hours, but I'm unsure of my chances to get in. My GPA isn't great, but I have a decent GMAT score. However, I don't really have an professors I could get a recommendation from. Basically, I wasn't the best/most involved student for a lot of my time in school and I've been realizing this past year how much that has hurt me. 

I'd appreciate any tips or advice.

TL;DR 
I'd really like to get a MAcc degree and work as an auditor, but I was a lazy student until recently and I lack experience. What would you recommend?

kmyul,8,2011-09-21,Depression at work,binary_despression,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kmyul/depression_at_work/,"I have been suffering from depression and anxiety for about 10 years now. I first went to a few therapists in the beginning. They all told me the same thing- you need to be on medicine, off to the psychiatrist. I have had mixed success with various meds over the years but recently I seem to have a good combination going.

My home life is absolutely awesome. I have a wonderful wife I absolutely love, two great dogs, great family, nice house, my dream car and no financial problems. I absolutely hate feeling depressed knowing how good I have it compared to some other people.

Work. This is where it breaks down for me and the medication becomes nearly useless. I love what I do, I am a programmer and I think I am pretty damn good at it (at least until it comes to considering finding a new job). I feel absolutely trapped and bored at work. I randomly start crying, I have gotten in trouble with HR for being ""overly to the point"" with people and now one more silly comment and I won't have a job and I feel like most people dislike me now.

Due to the crying and anxiety I used the ADA to request reasonable accommodations. I wanted to work from home, but instead they put me in an office. This is rare as we have this standard huge, open, noisy areas with groups of half cubes everyone sits in. I have gotten comments about me having an office but I try to brush it off. As a 5 year mid-senior level developer I ""shouldn't"" have an office. The office is great otherwise, I get tons more work done without the noise, distractions, and other people around making me nervous.

As soon as I walk in in the morning it is like this black cloud appears and the dread starts. Why? I know I am bored and feel trapped. Nothing about this job is challenging anymore. We do nothing cutting edge (bank / loan software) so there is really no opportunity outside of my coding at home to learn much or work with anything interesting. The corporate culture is very reactive. I am passionate about my work, the way bugs, customer issues and new features are handled I wonder why we have clients, and that disgusts me. Hell, it makes me feel dirty in a way.

I want to go hand my boss my letter of resignation but I can't bring myself to do it. I didn't finish college. I started out as a developer intern and worked my way up. I feel like not finishing college was a mistake and now my chances at employment outside of this hell are slim. Also my physical location- no programming jobs and telecommute jobs are hard to come by. I'm also worried I will just fall back into the same trap. I just can't be around so many people in the open floor ""hive"" concept.

At work, or at home after a particular nasty day, I can't shake the trapped feeling. While I would never do it, the idea of the sweet escape of death just sticks in the back of my head like this cathartic release just waiting for me. I hate thinking that. I hate living like this. I am afraid it will eventually start wearing on my wife.

I have my resignation ready to go. The only problem is I don't have enough saved to survive long without a job lined up. I also feel like quitting is the only way I will be forced to settle on another employer. I'm to the point where I would prefer living in a card board box (with an internet connection and electricity for my computer) to staying, but I can't put my wife through that.

I don't know if I need advice, or just needed to get this off of my chest, but being able to post this here is already helping. I apologize that this feels so ""first world problem"", it definitely makes me feel silly.

TLDR: Depressed, hate job, some suicidal ideation I won't act out on, feel trapped at job."

So far I've had an interview with her, sent her numerous emails with information on the internship, but I'm finding it hard to break out of the professional setting without being a creep. Also please note that the age difference between us is only a few years.

So question is: How can I ask this girl out for coffee or something without seeming to take advantage of my position is hiring an intern? I don't want to seem creepy, but I really want to find out more about this girl.

It was wonderful, I traveled to 18 countries and lived a great life. But now it is gone. Because of my poker, my resume is ugly; a BA in PoliSci from the U of MN and a crappy internship. The best part of it is some pretty extensive volunteering I've done.

Now, I hate to sound conceited, but I am not exactly entry-level talent. Being as good at poker as I was doesn't happen on accident, I studied the game, used extensive statistical analysis, a lot of math, logic and some game theory. I also am able to multi-task on a computer better than almost anyone. Further, I am quite personable, friendly and get along with nearly everyone. I have been really good at nearly everything I have ever done in my life. But, again, my resume is essentially shit.

I haven't been putting it on my resume. Is this dumb? I am afraid of scaring HR types away. Should I be? Is it worth the gamble that 60% of the people looking at my resume will throw it out immediately? How do I make it sound good?

I mentioned it in a job interview to the owner of the company, who seemed pretty savvy, and didn't get the job. 

Oh, and my job search is very broad. I have been sending resumes out to anything that's entry-levelish and not requiring specific skills.

Sorry this isn't too specific, but any thoughts are greatly appreciated."

He is also the leader of a robotics club and of a national engineering honors society!!!

I really feel for him though. He can't do any internships and has to keep everything off the books since he's illegal. He can't work, can't get financial aid, can't leave the country and STUDY ABROAD...how is he going to get a job once he graduates?? It's so unfair that such a smart person who practically grew up in the U.S. has such a hard time getting his citizenship.

I encouraged him a few months ago to apply for his green card, but he came out empty handed. He applied, but the process is so backed up they're now processing applications that were filed in 2004!!!

How sad is that? A country founded on immigrants is making it so hard for illegal immigrants to get their amnesty and give back to their state. I felt so bad for my friend that I told him I would donate my vote for him in the 2012 election.

I just really don't think I can survive in the typical office life for the next 35 years. 

Don't get me wrong, these jobs pay well. Really well, but my goal for my career is not to make a ton of money, but to not hate my job. My dad hates his job (but making bank) and I grew up thinking I really don't want to be that. So my idea right now is try something exciting. Join the army. I don't believe for half a second I'll be some guy on the field with some crazy awesome rifle doing all the badass stuff I see on TV. I've read about it and think I have a realistic perspective of the army and fully expect to join as a commissioned engineer working in my field, but I'm sure it would be more interesting and dynamic than a industry job. 

The few friends I've mentioned this to think I'm crazy. No one here joins the army. My career adviser laughed at me. I've never mentioned this idea to my parents.. I need some real advice. Not the advice from people with a skewed perspective of the world who think everyone in the army dies in 5 minutes. That's you reddit. Help me! Should I do it?

How important is getting a job with a big name company? If I get a job with Microsoft or Google, would I pretty much be set? Is considering smaller companies a good idea for a first job?

I saw her for 4 weekends now that school has resumed, but each time i missed her immensely once she left. Then she started an internship and got a job, in addition to already being the president of her school's chapter of a national organization.

But even as i type this, it seems more sensible that maybe we should just be friends because how can you have a relationship with someone you can see only occasionally? Even when her internship ends next semester, maybe we could be together two weekends a month. And honestly, we don't have a great amount of things or interests in common, so maybe this is for the best.

I think I need to just give it more time and i'll adjust.  This was actually my first significant relationship. It was really therapeutic just to type this out so thanks."

* drop your GPA if it's below a 3

* keep it clean and concise, leave the frills to the design majors

* put your most recent achievements at the top, reverse chronological

I'll be spending 2 weeks in Kathmandu for a medical internship, so I should have plenty of time to explore the Kathmandu Valley.  But after my volunteer work I will have another 8-9 days to check out the rest of Nepal.  I know this is little time to fully experience Nepal in all of its glory, but unfortunately, it's all I have.  Any suggestions for how to spend this extra time?  I would love to do a short trek (maybe 3-4 days) and would also love to visit Chitwan National Park.  Here are some specific details.

-I LOVE to hike and though I'm not an experienced trekker, I am more than willing to rough it, and would love a challenge.  I've read a lot about the Annapurna Circuit, and that perhaps there is a good 3 day trek on this loop.  Has anyone done this?  Great views are a priority.
-I really want to visit Chitwan National Park but am concerned about time.  Everything I've read has stated that 2 days is not enough for the park, is this true?  And do I need to purchase a package or can I get by staying in one of the local villages and just coming and going each day.  Honestly, the more native the experience, the better.
-Any suggestions of good places to eat.  I've purchased a Lonely Planet Nepal, but I'm sure all of there suggestions will be packed with tourists.  I'm vegetarian, but that's my only restriction.

Although these are specific questions, I'll take any advice.  Great outdoor activities, experience with transportation, the people, anything and everything!  I'm pretty adventurous.  I've done a TON of research, but honestly, I trust Redditors more than I trust pretty much any other forum and travel guide.  Thanks guys!"

You guys had a number of comments and did my best to craft a different essay that better suited what personal essay should (hopefully) look like.

The following is a Draft of my new statement, comments and criticisms are once again appreciated.

--------------------------

I was a geek in high school and though I intended to study Physics and Computer Science in college I quickly became fascinated by government and politics so while at Purdue University I studied Political Science.  When I graduated however, it was my history as a geek that provided me with a foundation for employment.

I had been living at home during the fall of 2010 and tending to a number of family responsibilities while looking for a job however, there were few opportunities available for someone with my background and education.  So relying on the skills I had already had developed I struck out for myself as a technology consultant and after a few independent engagements I established a business of my own.  In December of 2010 I founded the River’s Edge Group, Inc. a technology consulting and support firm, specializing in small business &amp; individual end user consulting and support.  

I was very excited to be going into business for myself and optimistic about my future prospects. I would be accountable to myself and involved in a field in which I was both capable and interested.  When met with challenges I would view them as educational opportunities and do my best to keep my anxieties about said challenges at bay.  I would have a number of such opportunities over the coming months.

Of the obstacles I had to overcome in the initial weeks and months the most challenging was exposure.  Although I started in my home town and had a reputation as a “polite young man”, manners do not correspond to competency and if I wanted to generate business I would have to build a solid reputation and make my business know to the surrounding communities.  I made my services known by visiting local retail establishments, restaurants and residences and speaking with proprietors and managers and letting them know I had both a more extensive knowledge base and more economical pricing schedule than my competitors.  This was a trying task, not only because the process of door-to-door solicitation was undesirable but also because I had to convince small business owners that their businesses technology and their own livelihoods in would be safe if entrusted to my services.

Once I had been hired, it was imperative that I performed to the best of my ability.  It was immediately evident that much of my business would be generated via word-of-mouth referrals and if I hoped to grow my business I would have to build and maintain a sterling reputation.  I have built and maintained River’s Edge Group’s reputation by providing excellent service whenever enlisted and always providing the service promised in the time frame established and either at or under budget.  This has taken dedication, more so during the summer months following my acceptance of a position as a full time summer intern at an area law firm.

During the summer months, in addition to managing my client’s accounts as well as servicing a number of end users, I maintained a full time position as an intern at NAME REDACTED, a local full service law firm.  My full time position at ABREVIATED NAME REDACTED meant that I had to strike a delicate balance between my responsibilities at River’s Edge Group and the commitment required by my internship.  I was able to find a balance because of the importance of my internship to understanding the reality of the practice of law.

My time at NAME REDACTED exposed me to the interworking of a law firm in the real world, I was able to observe what being a lawyer entailed and the things expected from attorneys.  I saw attorneys both young and old delve into books in order to research minute aspects of the law in order to address the unique aspects of a given matter and I appreciated the academic nature of the profession.  Following my brief time at ABREVIATED NAME REDACTED I find myself rededicated to my academic interests and I am once again I am eager to pursue a legal education and career in the law.

I feel that the range of experiences I have had as both as small business owner and as a legal intern will serve me well during both my time at law school and my future career as an attorney.  I have learned to walk into a meeting and convince people of my worth and ability, I have grown accustom to meeting challenges, both personally and professionally, with grace and perseverance and am undeterred by either opposition or difficulty. 

My experience with building my own business has been an invaluable one, it has provided me with a set of experiences I would otherwise not have had.  In a few short months I have been able to grow a small business from supporting a few end-user clients to consulting for a burgeoning enterprise client, supporting computer systems and web services for a number of small businesses and generating revenues well in excess of $100,000.00.  This growth has taken dedication, drive, ingenuity and balance, I have no doubt that these virtues will both serve me well while at law school and make me an exceptional attorney.

Throw away account, just on the off chance anyone I know sees this.

I am currently working an internship that ends on the 30th of this month. I've spent the last few weeks job hunting, with little success. After at least two weeks without any response from the places I sent my resume to, I was contact by a former employer asking if I was interested in some part time work. I know the nature of the work, but the details (how long would it last, how much would it pay, etc) were vague.

I responded and said that I was interested, but that I was still looking for permanent employment. I said that unless something suddenly comes up within the week, I would be available. My previous employer said that sounds great, and would work on the details.

About an hour after this exchange, I got a call from a prospective employer. She wanted to have a phone interview. I took the interview that day, and I believe it went really well. She said she would try and get back to me on Monday or Tuesday, to let me know if I would have a second (in person) interview. This job sounds really exciting, it's permanent, the pay is good, and I think I would love it.

So, Reddit, what's the best way to ask the previous employer to wait, while I wait to hear back from the potential employer? I think I could just drag my feet in responding until Monday or Tuesday, but that might annoy him. I don't want to just say ""yes"" to the previous employer, and then blow him off if I get the potential job. He has helped me in the past, and I do not want to burn any bridges.

Also important to note, money is tight, so NOT accepting the previous employers offer would be a big gamble that I am not sure I am prepared to make.

-Dragons are REALLY hard to kill (True bosses) 

-They will attack everything in the game, no city is 100 percent safe, some are better defended than others. 

-there are perks that increase your speed

-After 12 hours, he had not seen Maiq, doesn't mean he's not in the game though.

-He mentioned that generally speaking the game contained thousands  upon thousands of little details that you might not even notice.

Brief Overview:
Talent booking agency seeks hardworking, organized junior logistics manager. Primary responsibilities will include booking flights, trains, hotels, driver service and meals for DJs and their tour managers while on tour. This position reports directly to the Senior Logistics Manager. Busy Georgetown office provides a rewarding place to work with opportunities to attend local electronic music events.  Applicants must have outstanding organizational and communication skills and a flexible, positive attitude. Experience booking travel is strongly preferred.


Key roles/activities:
-- This role involves interacting with 4 groups of critical individuals in our business:  DJs, travel agents (contracted through our preferred agency, McNair Travel), event/club promoters, and agents at Bullitt.  For each group, there are a set of complementary responsibilities and expected impact:
  
(1) Interactions with DJ:
    - Prepare full itineraries for tours, including all travel (hotel, airline, car service, meals)
    - Be on call to answer questions or accommodate last-minute travel changes, as they arise (particularly if the tour manager or agent are unavailable)

(2) Interactions with Travel Agent:
    - Coordinate flights with travel agent
    - Be responsible for key travel items as they arise (i.e., upgrades, DJ travel preferences) with travel agent

(3) Interactions with Club/Event Promoter:
    - Serve as primary contact for logistical coordination with promoter, including supplying and discussing travel information, answering questions, serving as “buffer” between agent and promoter
    on logistical issues, as appropriate
    - Serve as liaison to coordinate and approve collateral materials and equipment set-up related to the event/club (fliers, artwork, tech requirements)
    - Manage guest lists— including handling requests and compiling final lists to share with promoter

(4) Interactions with Bullitt Agents:
    - Be single point of contact for all travel-related questions for agent
    - At weekly team meetings, provide an update on all travel/logistics for the team (i.e., keep agents in loop of status of each gig)
    - Help team as necessary on special events (cd release parties, business conferences, etc..)

-- Additional overall duties include:
    - Daily communications with above groups
    - Preparing for weekly team meetings and individual check-in sessions
    - Light office administrative duties (e.g., answering phones throughout the day, helping with team organization)
    - Training interns that may help with workload

Impact will be measured in a few key ways:
   - Feedback from DJs and promoters, through semi-annual reviews and post-gig feedback processes
    - Percent of events that have minimal travel/logistic issues
    - Participation and contribution at weekly team meetings

Skills/competencies required for this role:
•	Client service orientation:  strong interpersonal skills, ability to communicate effectively with others, flexibility in handling difficult situations and resolving them in a service-oriented fashion 
•	Team leadership:  ability to work on a team (“team player”), excited to learn from others (e.g., take feedback, seek personal development opportunities), ability to contribute to the team (even on issues not directly related to scope of work), willing to be mentored and serve as a mentor to others on the team 
•	Process management and problem-solving: can raise concerns and ask for help from the team in a timely manner, is a strong problem solver (can identify an issue, think through options, and make a recommendation on best path forward) 
•	Communications:  Has strong verbal and written communications (i.e., can communicate effectively via email)
•	Superior organizational skills: ability to “stay ahead of the problem” by proactively planning ahead, ability to develop and manage own work plan (outline what needs to be done, activities required to complete a task timeline to complete the task)

kpfa3,4,2011-09-23,How do I disclose my employment authorization status to recruiters and companies?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/kpfa3/how_do_i_disclose_my_employment_authorization/,"So I'm currently a junior at the University of Minnesota, I was born in China and came to Minnesota in 2001 to live with my mother, who was already employed in Minnesota then on a temporary work visa. For all intents and purposes, English is my mother tongue. 10 years without formal Mandarin education has made my Chinese skills worse drastically. I can still read, write and speak, but probably really rigidly and have to pause to think about it for some time.

Her company decided to sponsor her for a Green Card petition in 2005, and from the information she gathers, we have slightly more than a year, but less than two, when we would receive our decision on the petition. She expects a positive decision since she hasn't been laid off and she's worked for the same company all these years. 

My employment status is attached to hers, and so now even though I'm fairly close to the end of the Green Card permanent employment authorization process, I still have to apply for temporary authorization in the meantime. I've talked to a lot of recruiters who do like my major and my experiences, but their job posting information often only include the requirements that US citizens and Green Card holders only apply. For a summer internship next year, my number of options go from 30 companies down to about 6 if I search technically for my employment authorization criteria.

How should I disclose my employment authorization status? I'm different from a pure student visa in that I'm probably less than a year away from my decision, but for now, I'm still regarded as an international student in the technical sense. 

I would like to convince the companies that I can finish an internship in the summer, and by my graduation I would not require sponsorship as I already have my Green Card, but how do I go about doing this? On-campus recruiting and interviews are coming up, and I've heard that it may not be wise to disclose it during an interview, since they are not supposed to ask that, and I only have a limited amount of time to ask individual recruiters out for chats and disclose it that way. (My first interview is in four days.)"

I'm not trying to trick anyone here so I'm putting that out here now. Also, experience with version control systems, especially the distributed kind like mercurial and git, is a plus. That being said, I am more than willing to show people the ropes on some of this. Learning to program in a team environment is always a good experience.

The last time this actually happened got me romantically paralyzed for about 13 months. Innuendos going both ways, strange alcohol-induced stuff at parties, unusual behaviors and all the usual crap got the best of me before I eventually got drunk and decided to go over to the guy's place to straighten things out. I basically texted him asking that he clear up everything as I was in front of his building's door and I didn't even need to go up to his apartment before he spilled it. Something was *still* off but I was pissed so I got to my car and (somewhat still drunkenly, which I still regret but that was at night) furiously drove him, kind of crying as I was reaching my destination, stereotypically listening to Elton John. I got in an actual (not alcohol-induced) car accident a month later where I got severely T-boned by a minivan in an intersection after I missed a red light that was hidden by a parked semi. My friends jokingly poked fun at me for that for a few days and I finally got mad at this specific ambiguous guy as we were alone. He asked why I was pissed at him and not at the others, to which I responded t hat I couldn't take it from him because of what had happened. Basically laid all my cards down on the table and we've been the best friends in the world ever since. He never completely came clean about what happened but I'm ok with this situation. I got over him, was [very] briefly with some guys between then and now.

And it's happening again. It's like a prophecy. It's ridiculous. I started an internship a couple of months ago and it became obvious to me after a few days that I was interested in one particular colleague of mine. He's older than me (27, I'm 19, majority is at 18 where I live), a ghost on the Internet (can't really stalk him or anything, any mentions I find of his name or known email address are his posts as an helper on various Linux web groups. We don't talk a lot as we don't work in the same field, but seeing that we both smoke we have the occasional small talk outside. I've had to set up some things which he helped me with, but that's really not the romantic kinda thing.
He's really the nicest guy. Smiles a lot, helpful, my type both physically and (from what I've seen) psychologically, and we're getting along fine as far as I'm concerned.
The problem is, as I'm trying to dismiss it as ""yet another fantasy that I can never fulfill"", I've been having dreams where he intervenes as the, well, main character. They're somewhat disturbing as those dreams have us together as a regular couple, with the regular house scenes as watching a movie or cuddling or something. I kinda feel shameful about those when I see him the next morning even though I have absolutely no control over it, it really just feels stupid. I remember clearly feeling disappointment when I wake up after those dreams. There probably have been two or three in two months, which is still reasonable.

Advice? Help? Opinions? Anecdotes? Experience? Those would really come in handy."
kp29l,0,2011-09-23,"I wrote an open letter to Elizabeth Warren regarding her ""famous"" internet quote. ",[deleted],republicans,https://www.reddit.com/r/republicans/comments/kp29l/i_wrote_an_open_letter_to_elizabeth_warren/,"Dear Elizabeth Warren,

It has come to my attention that you’ve made a statement which has given you a lot of internet recognition on a number of social networking sites. I congratulate you on your fifteen minutes of fame which will probably be cut short by another obscure person’s witty quote. Before you join the ranks of other internet memes such as Rebecca Black and the “Y U No…” guy please allow me to reply to your call for me to “pay it forward”. 

First off, I went to public school from kindergarten through high school. I graduated with 1200 other people that all received the same education. My parents did not have money for college and I knew that if I wanted a college education I would have to fund it myself. I chose to spend my high school nights studying with the hope that my grades would lead to a college scholarship. I had friends, but we weren’t the cool kids that went out every weekend and prioritize other activities before our education. I graduated close to the top of my class and as a result of my hard work I received a full ride to a state college. Some of the “cool” kids that I mentioned earlier were also from meager backgrounds but their grades were not impressive enough to earn them any type of assistance for college. Some went to community college and others decided to take factory jobs. 

In college I had to maintain a very high grade point average to retain my scholarship. This meant many hours in the library and even the occasional sleepless night. Since my room and board was not covered I also had to maintain a part time job so that I could pay my rent and eat. My friends were limited to my study partners and my romantic life was virtually non existent. I never had the time to attend house parties, go on spring break trips, or attend homecoming football games.

Toward the end of my college education I managed to secure a few internships with some successful companies. Through the impressions that I made at these companies I had no problem finding a job long before I graduated. The work ethic that I had instilled in myself in high school and college carried over and as a result I quickly progressed up the corporate ladder. After a few years I took advantage of my company’s tuition reimbursement plan and went to school at night to get my MBA. 

While in graduate school I met other successful professionals and a few of us eventually decided to quit our jobs and start our own company. Lucky for us the gamble paid off and within five years I was able to buy out my partners. 

Today I provide stable employment for over 1000 people at my factory and solicit the services of multiple other companies, all which employ American citizens. I pay the county, state, and federal taxes which are required of me and assume that those monies go toward upkeep of the surrounding infrastructure, schools, police department, fire department, and US armed forces. In addition, my company donates money and volunteer efforts to the local community as a way of improving the quality of life of our neighbors. 

I suppose I should reemphasize the fact that my company is based in the US and is employing US workers. Maybe you’ve forgotten about the number of companies packing up and moving oversees or to Mexico where they can produce the same products at a fraction of the price. Even the “Big 3” which were supposed to be the last glimmer of hope for the American Dream are more reliant on goods produced overseas then they are on domestic made products. Where are the proposals and cute internet quotes proposing higher taxes and tariffs on them? Last I checked the shelves of the local Wal-Mart were fully stocked with goods made anywhere but the United States. 

I got to where I am today through my own hard work and ingenuity. I understand that there are some CEOs out there that had it slightly easier than I, but they would not still be where they are without a strong work ethic and the knowledge that success is earned. I never received anything I didn’t work for and I find it insulting that you are trying to exploit my hard work for the benefit of those that have different priorities. 

Rather than jumping on the Washington DC bandwagon and blindly calling for more jobs and higher taxes, ask yourself “Where did the jobs and extra tax revenue go?” Penalize the companies that choose to bypass the American worker while trying to sell to his neighbor.  These are your crooks and your criminals. These are the people that exploited the system to increase their profit margin. Why aren’t they being asked to “pay it forward”? 

Regards

CEO of American Company

kowil,2,2011-09-23,Question about an internship becoming a job,PlasticGirl,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/kowil/question_about_an_internship_becoming_a_job/,"Backstory: I got an internship at a tiny niche record label, one of the last of its kind in the US. It's a not-for-credit three month unpaid internship (food stipend + paid parking) two days a week. I got the internship because they were ""impressed"" but I have also been told that they ""don't know what to do with me"". I am trying to create a new position of my own in demographics and writing. One month in, and they're already dropping big hints that they want to hire me. I also found the company $1600 in unclaimed funds.   
  
However... the other employees I work with seem to have side work they do, so I am guessing that it won't pay super well. The other thing is that I am unemployed right now and really hurting, so any money could help. Finding decently paid work around my internship schedule is really hard. 
  
Tl;dr - Should I ask for payment (or partial payment) now or wait out the other two months?"

The closest thing I have had is graduate school and a research position, but I don't think that matters to anyone.  Other people I knew in the program have gotten internships and offers, but I haven't gotten anything.  I don't know how I am supposed to go about finding a job, I apply online many places, but I never hear anything back.  I have tried networking a bit through a couple of people I know from school and similarly have heard nothing.  I went to a career fair recently and one of the recruiters clearly was looking down at me for not having arranged something before graduation despite my attempts.  Maybe if I kill myself I should first Boeing, Lockheed, and Orbital a letter telling them to fuck their application system and I hope they see what it does to people.

I live in a relatively rural suburb type area and nothing, of what little there is around, interests me here.  Not that it matters, I suck at getting involved in people's lives.  I'm a virgin at almost 24 and never even kissed someone.

To top it off, my knees hurt because I hadn't properly exercised and I can't get myself to do it anymore.  I'm getting fat and hurting more.

In short, there is absolutely nothing in my life.  I have no reason to live and I hate every moment of it.  I yelled at my mom the other day because of a stupid little thing I was having trouble with, and I find myself having a short temper lately.  I'm fed up with my situation and can't do anything about it.

I was okay for several years, but this constant boredom is making me hate existing again.  A couple of times a day I think I should just kill myself, and be done with it.  I worry about what I'll do when I fully realize that I can't be hired, and how much it will suck for everyone else like my family.  I just can't take this though.  I just suck money from my already hard pressed parents, and provide nothing in return.

I don't know how seriously I am about this, but as my bank account slowly drains it gets worse and worse.  It just gets worse every day from the pressure of boredom and uselessness.  Also, I am currently unable to sleep because I worry so much about this.  Wondering why no one ever wants me.  I must just be an all round worthless person, no one will hire me, be my friend, or fuck me.  School and jobs have always been the only thing in my life, and now I have neither to make up for my lack of meaningful existence.

I mean what am I supposed to do?  How are people actually supposed to get jobs and meet people?  I clearly missed a class on how to matter to anyone.  I can't even make a coherent plea for help.  I have been on the other side of these, but none of that helps, and all my advise was probably shit to them too."

kopqp,0,2011-09-23,A salvo from a 30 year-old man,madashellnotgtiam,politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/kopqp/a_salvo_from_a_30_yearold_man/,"I've always worked hard.  Though I came from parents who could provide wonderful things like a private school education, college tuition and rent for an apartment when I wanted to do an internship after my freshman year of college, I've never taken their help for granted.  I've always busted my ass to make sure that their investment in me paid off.

While attending a prestigious boarding school in the Northeast, I begged a pleaded for permission from the administration to work for the food service provider at the school to work for them part time at night.  I desperately wanted to make my own money so as not to have to call home to ask for cash when needed.  They obliged.  

Months after my internship during my freshman year of college, I was offered a full-time overnight position at the company.  I accepted - and did not reduce my course load or full time status in school.  

Two months before earning my degree, I was offered a paid position with a very well known national news network - which I accepted.  

I bought a house.  I found a wife.  I had grandiose plans of starting a family.  

Then the recession came.  

I had to move to take a better paying job - and I couldn't sell my house.  I started a retirement account, which virtually dries up every six months.  My annual pay increases are a fraction of what they should be - and they don't keep up with cost of living expenses - and I  am not living that large.  

Tonight I watched the floor of the house on CSPAN as they debate the CR to fund the government.  I feel someone needs to say this:

""WE ARE SICK OF PUTING UP WITH THESE GAMES!""

I am a member of this generation being affected.  We did the right things - we worked hard - we pulled ourselves up by our bootstraps - we registered to vote - we showed up to vote - we paid as much attention as we could - we donated to political campaigns that we believed in - we were active.  And now, the congress of the united states is fucking us.  

We can't sell our houses.  We can't find better jobs.  We don't have the security we need to start a family - because we don't know where we are going to be financially in a year.  

So to you, members of Congress, PLEASE, PLEASE, stop fucking around.  Stop making power plays - threatening to shut down the government and raise debt ceilings.  You think you're scoring political points.  You think all that matters is some stupid election in more than a year from now.  You think that all that matters is the narrative playing out on cable news and on editorial pages.  

IT DOES NOT.

What matters is my freedom.  All of our freedoms.  We should be free to refinance a house.   We should be free to save for a retirement without fearing that it will disappear overnight.  We should be free to not worry that our OWN AMERICAN GOVERNMENT will act like a group of spoiled children and play chicken with our collective future.  

So stop your debating.  Stop running your mouths.  Walk away from the cameras.  Work it out.  DO it WITHOUT hurting us, because that's what we sent all of you to do - and you're letting us down."
kopdi,1,2011-09-23,Advice for a freshman,[deleted],lostgeneration,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostgeneration/comments/kopdi/advice_for_a_freshman/,"I'm an avid fan of this subreddit (mainly as motivation for study sessions, with these dire headlines). I found [this article](http://www.mint.com/blog/how-to/graduate-college-01252011/) that's pretty related. TL;DR -- taking longer to graduate means more opportunities to intern and network. 

I'm skeptical. If I were to graduate early (by studying over summer semester), I could compete for those same internships as undergrads. Wouldn't I make a better applicant? This is assuming that I could hold down some kind of related internship or volunteer experience while studying. 


----------------------

**Confession**: I heavily based my cover letter off something I found on Google. Probably not the best way to go, but I have no idea. OTL Perhaps some suggestions on how I can make this more ""original"" and to the point? I feel like this is too lengthy and generic and does not exactly make me an appealing applicant at all.

Nobody had signed up for this week, so just my thoughts on a particular section of this weeks parsha.  Please sign up on the spreadsheet in the sidebar.  We want to hear from all of you.

יא כִּי הַמִּצְוָה הַזֹּאת, אֲשֶׁר אָנֹכִי מְצַוְּךָ הַיּוֹם--לֹא-נִפְלֵאת הִוא מִמְּךָ, וְלֹא רְחֹקָה הִוא.  יב לֹא בַשָּׁמַיִם, הִוא:  לֵאמֹר, מִי יַעֲלֶה-לָּנוּ הַשָּׁמַיְמָה וְיִקָּחֶהָ לָּנוּ, וְיַשְׁמִעֵנוּ אֹתָהּ, וְנַעֲשֶׂנָּה.  יג וְלֹא-מֵעֵבֶר לַיָּם, הִוא:  לֵאמֹר, מִי יַעֲבָר-לָנוּ אֶל-עֵבֶר הַיָּם וְיִקָּחֶהָ לָּנוּ, וְיַשְׁמִעֵנוּ אֹתָהּ, וְנַעֲשֶׂנָּה.  יד כִּי-קָרוֹב אֵלֶיךָ הַדָּבָר, מְאֹד:  בְּפִיךָ וּבִלְבָבְךָ, לַעֲשֹׂתוֹ.

Chapter 30: 11 For this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not too hard for thee, neither is it far off. 12 It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say: 'Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, and make us to hear it, that we may do it?' 13 Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say: 'Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, and make us to hear it, that we may do it?' 14 But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it.  (Translation from mechon mamre)

This little section follows a section about repentance and redemption, and is followed by a section imploring the Jews to choose life over sin and death.  Right before the new year, Rosh Hashana, we see a section telling us that the Torah is easily accessible, if only we follow our mouth and heart.

The parsha this week is telling us, no matter what situation we are in, do not give up.  If  you are having trouble with faith, money, or my new internship (I hate my boss), the Torah and all of its valuable wisdom is right there, within reach.  If we have strayed, you can repent, the torah is not over the sea, it is not in the sky, but on Earth, with us.  We should choose life this coming new year, choose the path that God has set for us.  

The Torah in 30:1 does not say if you will sin but ""it will be that when all these things come to you....""  God knows we are not perfect, and is ok with our frailties and mistakes.  We all have the option to repent, to do teshuva.  

Interesting enough, in order to be near to God and the Torah, we are told to use our mouth and hearts.  I found it a bit strange.  Just my thoughts on it, it is rather what the mouth and heart do, as opposed to other things like sight and hearing.  Seeing, hearing and even feeling to a certain degree are things that we passively do.  If a car shoots by, you can not help but hear and see it.

But speaking is something we can control.  We can ponder our feelings and understand them in the deepest sense.  When doing repentance, or just being a Jew, or an ordinary person, we have to be active in our lives.  We have to make the move to do teshuva, we have to make the move to stop waking up late and missing minyan (cough cough, stupid internship).  We are in control of all that we do, for better or for worse.  So please, take this message with you for Shabbos and Rosh Hashanah.

Have a good Shabbos r/Judaism!

It was an unpaid internship, but it's the best way to put my **Ent**omology degree to good use. That, and it was the chillest job I ever had. Most days I'd have an assignment to go to some certain field or meadow, usually in the fall or cool summer evenings in those waning hours of daylight when the normally beige landscape turns golden. I'd park my work truck on some service road and take a few minutes to collect my thoughts. I'd take a long draw from the flask of gin I kept in the glove box, and take a few hits from my pipe—never getting too high, just enough to put a friendly edge on things. Oh, and since I'd be in the middle of nowhere I'd strip down naked as well. I'd grab my net and step out into the magical sunlight and dive into the tall grass, disturbing all manner of flying insects. To really catch a lot of butterflies, you have to scare them into flying away so you can catch them in the air. If you try to snag them off of a flower or some grass you risk damaging their wings. So I soon figured out that if I bounded about in the shoulder-high grass I would disturb the butterflies upon landing, and catch them the next time I rose above the grass, my long dangling scrotum bouncing against my legs, and itching from its interaction with the plant life. Once I had frolicked in this manner for ten minutes or so, I would have a full net of butterflies and I would sit down in the tall grass to make my observations. Of course I'd eat a few. Who wouldn't? Frolicking works up quite an apetite. It also, when combined with my earlier recreation, worked up quite the horniness. With a mouthful of butterfly parts, I would lay on my back and fellate myself (I'm also a yoga teacher), the guts and cock mingling in my mouth tasted like pure summertime. I would slam my hips into my own face, burying my throbbing prick deep into my throat. Finally, surrounded by grasshoppers, moths, and the carcasses of literally hundreds of butterflies, I would release onto my face, and pass out from sheer pleasure. Now I'm a Kindergarten teacher (Entomology wasn't really my thing), and my days of frolicking in this way are pretty much over. But I always remember my time as a steam boat operator with fondness."

I feel like if i started working there and something better came along, I would have trouble leaving the job because they've treated me well in the past.

I could barely move from my bed due to the body pain. I'm an engineering student (and premedical) and I work part-time. This week was a rough one; I had to pull 2 all-nighters, and the nights I did sleep, I slept for about 4 - 5 hours per night. I sometimes smoke marijuana to relieve my stress (I only started smoking 6 months ago) and to relieve my hyperhidrosis, which has made my life hell (look it up if you don't know what it is). This is my final year at the university.

All of my life I've been a good citizen. My family (single mother + 2 sisters + grandmother) and I have lived in a one bedroom apartment for 13 years, and my family only makes ~22k a year in income. I received outstanding grades all throughout my academic career -- and I was awarded a scholarship to one of the best engineering programs in the country. I have never had any problems with authority, not even a parking ticket. My mom is a single parent, and she told me to always obey the law because it was there for my protection. I believed her.

Today I woke up to police officers banging on my bedroom door. The officers said that somebody had complained about marijuana. My roommate had roughly an ounce of marijuana on him; however, I had none. I had not even smoked the entire week. The officers asked me if I had any drugs in my room, to which I responded that I did not. One of the officers then called me into the room, and asked me to sit down. He asked me again if I had any marijuana in my room. I replied no, but I did have a pipe and I started to speak to tell him about it. He told me to shut up.

The officer then proceeded to ransack my room. He opened all of my dresser drawers, searched my bookcase, my closet, and my backpack. He found no marijuana. In the process he spilled a cup of tea (which was next to my bed). He stepped into the spilled tea, and walked on my bed with his boots still on and soaked in tea. He also wiped his hands on my bedsheets, when there were paper towels right on my work desk. He found my tobacco pipe and called me a liar. He told me I had no respect for authority and that I am a scum. He proceeded to take my hospital ID badges (I work as an EMT and an engineering intern at a hospital lab). He thought me a very bad person for working at a hospital and smoking marijuana. He took my ID badges and told me he will inform my bosses and that my career was done. 

He asked me how proud my parents would be of me. I told him my father had died when I was 6. He asked me if my mother would be proud. I told him she would not, but it did not matter much as she has been working for minimum wage for the past 10 years working 12+ hours a day for most of the 10 years. All she wanted for me was a better life, which I was working so hard for. And it wasn't a better life for only me, it was a better life for my family.

The officer found some incense sticks in a shoebox in my room. He commented about how I use these to cover up the marijuana smoke. I told him that was not so; I am a practicing Hindu and use the incense sticks to meditate and pray. They remind me of morning prayers with my grandmother, who I miss dearly (as I live far from my home). He told me that was bullshit, and asked me if Hindus smoked marijuana. I told him our religion did not say anything against it.

I received a class D possession for less than one ounce of marijuana, when I had no marijuana in my room at all. I live in Massachusetts, and know that marijuana is decriminalized, but have no idea what this means.

 I am scared. I'm scared of losing my scholarship and of having all of my life's work nulled. I am ranked second in my class and intend to look for work and apply for medical school soon. I am afraid of not finding work because of this, losing my current jobs, and letting my family down.

I have lost all faith in authority. I had the utmost respect for police officers before this. I now feel violated and cautious of the law.

I am a good person and a good citizen. I save lives. 

UPDATE: Thanks for all of your comments /r/trees. Its good to know that I'm not the only one who has been through this ordeal. I truly was blind to this sort of situation, but I guess a lot of people are until it happens to them. I have contacted NORML to see what I can do. Looking at all the advice about MA specific law here, I think the best course of action is for me to pay the ticket and not get a criminal charge on my record."

I'm just getting started! ,[deleted],loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/kqd3z/lost_lost_about_4_pounds_in_two_weeks_im_just/,"Hey everybody! I've been lurking here a while before I got up the motivation to post. This is my story.


I've always been on the heavier side of normal. My family was chaotic and unpleasant and I had a nasty habit of stress eating to calm my nerves. I was a pretty overweight kid who just sort of got taller. I weighed around 140 all through middle school and started my freshman year of high school at about 160. As I got taller, I started bicycling and stopped losing weight. In college I held by weight at 160-165 pretty consistently until my last two years. At the end of junior year I worked out a lot, and got down to 153. Then I got an internship in NYC for a semester and got up to 170 from depression/no money or time. When I returned home after New York, I became more and more depressed until I got up to 175 by the middle of my final semester of college. I realized very quickly that there was a serious problem. It took until May but I finally climbed back to 168 and held it there for a while. I started working out again on what was left of my college gym pass. I lifted weights and did cardio for almost an hour every single day for a month, cut back my eating out habits and lost...exactly 0 pounds. I know I was gaining a bit of muscle, but not much, so I must have been doing something very, very wrong.


Boring history aside, I've started again. I've graduated and I'm working in a very demanding office job and as a former English major, I'm lucky to have it so I can't exactly leave for something less sedentary. For almost two weeks I've been counting calories extremely strictly and spending about an hour of my evenings riding my bicycle, jogging, or walking. (I have a really bad ankle so I am trying to find exercises that will accommodate that). As soon as I save up enough money for a gym pass I'm going to start lifting again. After two weeks of eating clean and increased activity, I'm now back at 163!!


Anyway I didn't think to take a proper progress picture so I'm going to start now.

[This](http://imgur.com/zb370) is me two days ago. [Profile](http://imgur.com/MbU7i). EDIT: I realize there isn't any change between the first picture and these two but I just figured I'd post it since it was from before I started.

I'm doing a throwaway and my goals in this are to be totally honest. I'm sorry if I sound like a jerk or if it gets long -- I also want to be succinct -- but I want to just tell it straight.

Anyway, my GF and I are both 21, we started dating senior year of HS. We also ended up at the same college, which genuinely wasn't intentional (but we also didn't fight it). So you've got 2 of the usual issues: we started in HS, and we dating thru college. Except for one mistake night (not sex) about 3 years ago, we've never hooked up w/ anyone else. We lost our vcards to each other.

To get to the point, I'm thinking about ending it. I can cite a few reasons: we've drifted apart, hobbies and interests-wise; I'm feeling intense pressure to 'sow my wild oats' because I've never been with anyone else and because I'm not getting any younger; and (and this is the part I'm not proud of) I don't find super-attractive anymore. She's never been very active, but watches upwards of 5-6hr of TV per night, and doesn't have a job or internship. She has probably gained 30-40lbs since HS. I have probably gained around 10-15 but I go to the gym frequently and bike commute, so I'm losing weight.  She's probably gone to the gym 3 times in the time I've known her - I don't see that changing, frankly, so long-term that's seriously a concern, regardless of how shallow I might be. I have a full-time job (self-employed) and she's unemployed/a student, so tries to get me to work less, etc, and it's probably not helping my performance at work, although I am of course able to control that and I'm my own boss.

I also am not being totally emotionally faithful. I was at a bar with some friends and a girl started dancing on me and I didn't stop her. The truth was I kept going because my GF won't go to clubs like that, and I always try to get her to go. She doesn't want to go because she is uncomfortable about her body, she doesn't like ""club"" clothes, and she hates electronic music, which is something I'm really passionate about.  I find myself noticing lots and lots of attractive girls around town, and...this is inexcusable, I'm a fucking douche...probably 25% of the time I feel self-concious having her with me because I feel she's less attractive than the other girls around me. I don't flirt with them or talk to them, but that's probably irrelevant.

In the past, if I'd finally gathered the balls to go to RA, I'd've talked about how she didn't have any friends, how that was a concern, but that's gotten better. But the kicker here is that we have a very troubled sex life. From about 2 years ago to 6 months ago, we had sex a total of something like 4 or 5 times. About 6 months ago it got slightly more frequent, about once every 3 weeks. We tried again about 3 weeks ago, and it was extremely painful for her, perhaps because she doesn't 'use her bits very often' or because she doesn't like that kind of condom (her thoughts). So, as I was saying about the attractiveness thing, my hypothesis is that I had to shut down my attractiveness to her to be able to deal with the no-sex thing. I'd sleep in bed next to her night after night and I think it just numbed me.

Now I can read any number of threads where guys are bitching about not having as much sex as they'd like to (and they're doing it like 5 times a week), so I feel like an absolute idiot in that department. But remember: I've never known anyone as long as I have her in my life. She's somewhat financially dependent on me and we both know she will be much more broken up about it if we break up -- to compensate for our lack of sex, I've honestly grown rather emotionally numb about it. Which has kind of helped keep me in it, because she's fun to be around.

Anyway, any thoughts? So sorry about the length."

I have an extremely light final year of school, 4 courses over 2 semesters, so I've decided to take advantage of all my free time and learn as much as I possibly can on my own time before I graduate and (hopefully) find work. 

I had planned on obtaining my Security+ cert before I graduate in the spring, just an entry level security cert showing I have some knowledge and interest in the subject. But I've come to assume I won't be working in a security-related position right out of college, so I was looking for some suggestions as to what certifications I should get instead. I've have had multiple internships and have a decent GPA, so I think adding a few certifications would really round out my resume for a recent graduate.

I don't want to be someone relying on certifications achieved by regurgitation, I don't want to rely on knowing people, I don't want to rely on a GPA, I want to know my shit pure and simple. So help me out SysAdmin, I'd really appreciate it.

kq41t,13,2011-09-24,Student Resume for internships,[deleted],engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/kq41t/student_resume_for_internships/,"So as I'm sure most of you are aware, this next few weeks seems to be the time when all the big companies are accepting applications for summer internships and Co-ops. 

That being said, I am a sophomore mechanical engineering student and obviously do not really have much to put on a resume. I worked as a ""fitness attendant"" at a country club over the summer and work at my college's fitness center for my work study. Obviously this is not at all relevant to engineering so should I include these kinds of things on my resume?

I have taken a couple core engineering courses; statics, materials science, graphics and CAD. By the summer I would have taken much more including dynamics, computer science, thermals and fluids, engineering design. How can I let an employer know that I will be much more qualified by the time the job starts but do not have as many classes under my belt at the time of applying.

Any advice is greatly appreciated! I will definitely be going to my career center for help as well but I just need a framework to bring them.

TL;DR any resume advice for a Sophomore in college?"

kpvxw,3,2011-09-24,advice on transferring?,alecbenzer,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/kpvxw/advice_on_transferring/,"I feel somewhat unhappy with the school I'm at. In high school I got in to 3 of the 9 schools I applied to. I ended up going for the one that I thought would be the best fit, primarily based on its rankings and reputation for my major. I've been here almost a month and I'm feeling like I'm not loving it here. It's not awful, but it's not great either, and I feel kind of like an idiot paying so much for something that doesn't feel all that right. I'm considering transferring, but my issues are that, for one thing, there are only a few schools I can think of that I want to transfer to. While I have issues with my school I don't want to sacrifice the quality of my particular department too much. This leaves me mostly with choices that all have very low transfer acceptance rates (all &lt; 5%, I think). Even a bit further down the list, things don't look so hot. The schools are all either difficult or not much different from my current school (and so not really worth transferring to). I haven't really looked at LACs, which might be an option, but I'm not sure if I'd want to go to one. I'm also wary of going through the emotional stress of applying, and especially of being rejected yet again.

My grades in high school were good, but my SATs were a little weaker (didn't really study for them). If I decide to transfer I would probably work on getting them up. I've also had (well, had/have) two internships at relatively high-profile companies since I applied (whereas before my only work experience was at a summer program my school ran).

Anyway, any advice, /r/college? Should I transfer? Ideas on figuring out where to?"

I have a new job now but it pays less and has less hours than my previous job. Three weeks after starting this job, my car caught fire. The power steering pump overheated and ignited.

kr8um,8,2011-09-25,Need to get over the fear of seeking help... no clue what's wrong with me.,allusernamestakenwtf,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kr8um/need_to_get_over_the_fear_of_seeking_help_no_clue/,"I'm not at risk of killing myself anytime soon (I hope), though I do think about it a lot, and whatever is wrong with me, it's ruining my life. The worst part? It feels like it's all my fault, like everything's in my control, I just can't do shit about it. I can't help but think that my problems aren't real, that I'm just a lazy bitch, who's got all the odds stacked FOR her, but is just letting everything crumble away.

I'm in my 3rd year of college and on academic probation, and it's only the 3rd week of classes and already I'm missing classes, homeworks, quizzes... though at this point it requires so little effort. I mean getting up in the morning, how fucking hard can it be? I just think ""oh I'll get the notes from someone else later"", or ""oh I'll just do the other homeworks this term and my grade won't drop by much"", but the thing is I thought these same things last term, didn't actually do it, and ended up failing 2 classes and getting on probation. Right now I should be catching up on everything I missed, at least doing the reading... but that's the thing. I can't do readings. I read maybe two sentences and I'm utterly bored (regardless of how fascinating the material is, I'd rather think about it than read or do it) and I switch over to Reddit or video games. I haven't done any work this weekend, just gamed. Actually doing problems, once I get down to them, is a lot simpler, UNLESS I need help, which requires looking through a book or Googling or asking a friend, then I decide I'll do it later, which never happens. Oh and forget studying... I can't study. For the same reasons obviously. Never read over the day's notes, no matter how many times I tell myself I should...

I held an internship over the summer, and I can't fucking believe how hard I failed at that. I'm surprised they didn't fire me, honestly. The hours were 9 to 7, the first day I came in at 8:30, but after seeing how lax everyone is, I began slipping. First few weeks I came in around 11 or 12, then slowly I slipped further and further until I'd be coming in around 2 or 3, sometimes 4, even missing meetings. I really wonder why no one approached me about it, but they may not have noticed (as I was mostly working on independent work).

Other things that have to be done in a timely manner... paying bills, returning library books, responding to e-mails, holy shit I cannot do any of those things. I have my own apartment and no matter how hard I try to pay rent on time, even when I fucking have the money right there, I just need to click a few buttons online, I cannot do it. Every night when I come home I tell myself ""oh, I'll do it later"" then I'm so tired and I think ""oh, I'll do it first thing in the morning"" then I have to rush to class or work (which I'm probably fucking late to) and the cycle repeats. I can't even count how many final shut-off notices I've gotten from Con Ed until I pay the several months' worth of bills finally. Late in the summer I finally returned books that were due at the end of last semester, racking up several hundred dollars in fees. The library is a few blocks away and open practically 24 hours. Sometimes I can't believe myself.

Oh and cleaning. My apartment is always a fucking mess because each time I say to myself that I'll clean, I end up postponing it. Even after I found and killed a mouse a while ago, I cannot seem to clean more often, unless I'm throwing a party, in which case I'll spend an entire day cleaning because that's how fucking dirty it's gotten because of how rarely I clean. Even though I hate every second I spend in a messy/dirty environment, this does not force me to actually clean... just hate myself.

The anxiety makes all these things snowball, in a way. I think ""oh shit I didn't respond to my professor's e-mail yet"" and I feel sick to my stomach and dizzy, and scared of actually doing it (why!?!?!), and then I get even more anxious... Sigh.

A few weeks before the end of last term, my very first relationship (which dragged on for ~2.5 years) ended. He dumped me, though I no longer wanted to be with him (he had been ""dumping"" me then taking me back the next day over and over) so I consider it mutual... it was mainly due to my low sex drive, he constantly complained that I didn't give him enough oral but as time went on I didn't want to have sex with him either. Somehow my body found it 'gross', and I just didn't want it, and to this day I don't know why that happened. I was on birth control while I was with him, but since he was my first, I don't know whether that's the problem or not. Slowly over the last year or so of the relationship my mood also got considerably worse, I would be in a slump all the time, so that didn't help. It went away a tiny bit over the summer, but now it's back full force.

Ever since I got with him we'd smoke weed together every once in a while, but he grew to dislike it (and become paranoid/anxious whenever he smoked) and seemed to have an extremely negative attitude toward it, and toward me smoking. Over the summer I bought my own and smoked practically every day, it helped with the anxiety a lot (which is probably why my mood problems sort of went away over the summer) and helped me control the constant, 24/7 sick-to-my-stomach feeling. I don't know if I should still keep smoking, as recently (we're still friends, sort of, though he keeps trying to hook up with me) he's blessed me with the news that among our friends and sort-of-friends in college I'm known for being a 'stoner', which of course sent me into another bout of anxiety. It helps so much, though, but I don't know...

Now... I've always been perfectly honest with myself, and tried my hardest to steer away from being a hypochondriac, but I'm beginning to think that maybe I should actually seek professional help, and perhaps medication. I don't know what exactly is wrong with me obviously, and I really really really don't want to self-diagnose, but I seem to match the symptoms for ADHD and depression, and to a lesser extent bipolar disorder. Again, I'm not saying I do have these conditions, as I'm not a doctor, it's just what I suspect the most. However, the idea of seeking help is absolutely frightening. I've always viewed myself as incredibly strong and able to overcome everything, and I'd hate to admit to anyone that I'm seeing a therapist, or taking prescription drugs, or anything like that. I mean, what happens in the future? Will I have to get help for the rest of my life? I'm just so scared... there's such a strong stigma associated with it. Plus, my ex was on anti-depressants as a young child, and thinks that they ruined him, and is generally anti-psychiatry. I just don't know what to think or do.

I don't even know what my question is... I'm sorry for the long post. Just, these problems are actually beginning to SEVERELY interfere with my life, and I have no fucking clue how to stop it."

Just got a small apartment (Or, two small rooms, whatever) on my own and a pretty sweet internship. So far I've already noticed a small loss just from walking to work and home again, and in to the city a few nights (probably just 2-4 kilometers to my job). It might not be much, but it's atleast a huge difference compared to taking the bus directly from my house to school.

But now that I'm living on my own, I'm also having to deal with buying and making food for my self, so far it's been pretty good and I've made dinners that aren't too shabby, but surely not optimal either. The problem on my part is that a frozen pizza and other easy meals are usually far cheaper (atleast it seems so in the store) and alot faster to make, so I'm afraid I'll be tempted to go with that in the long run.

I'm a big fan of chicken and could see myself eating that alot if it's cheap and easy to make. Also a huge fan of pasta, but not sure how good that is (with carbs and all that, I don't know).

Speed reading.
I've started to teach myself how to speed read, and have doubled my words per minute in 3 weeks... (many can do better than that). I am/was a very slow reader, starting at a little under 4 words per second at 200 wpm.

I'm currently at an internship and have 3 more months to spend training myself. The book I'm using
[Break Through Rapid reading](http://www.amazon.com/Breakthrough-Rapid-Reading-Peter-Kump/dp/073520019X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1316966376&amp;sr=8-1) by Peter Klump states that if you drill each day for:

* 20 minutes = 400-800 wpm
* 40 minutes = 600 - 1200 wpm
* 60 minutes = 800 - 1500 wpm
* 90 minutes = 2000+ wpm

for six weeks, that will roughly be your reading speed by the end.

You really have to be motivated for this thing, and if there are classes that you could attend instead of just trying on your own it might work out better. I know for me it's hard to stay on track... but I have about 11 weeks before I hit school hard again.

I am moving with my girlfriend Marie, who is also a student looking to start a master in Political Science. We will come to Wurzburg on October 15th and we are looking for a place to live close to the university. We have been looking in several sites like wg-gesucht.de/ but nobody wants to rent a room to a couple :(. We really need an apartment!!!. 

A little bit about ourselves:
Me, Eliel, I am a physicist but also a freelance web developer and musician, I love literature, music and good beer. I am relaxed and used to live in a collective with many people. I am originally from Venezuela but I have been living in Norway and Sweden for a while.

My girlfriend is Swedish, interested in Political Science and currently finishing an internship at the UNDP office in Oslo. We decided to move together to Wurzburg and she is looking for studying opportunities at Wurzburg University. She loves to read, travel and be around nature.

We are both relaxed but responsible and really looking forward to meet new people when we arrive to Würzburg. 

TL;DR: I will start a Physics PhD in Würzburg, I am currently in Oslo and we desperately need to find an apartment or room to rent for me and my girl!!! PM me if you can help :)

What's Next?,[deleted],sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/kqsht/cis_student_out_of_things_to_explore_whats_next/,"I'm just starting my senior year at a university studying Computer Information Systems with the goal of being a Systems Administrator. I've always been interested in computers and have ALWAYS been leaps and bounds ahead of everyone else in my classes. I haven't learned much from my college courses, but more from exploring on my own. I'm so under challenged in school. I currently have a job working as an intern in a Datacenter. This has given me quite a bit of experience in the physical world of IT infrastructure. I run my own linux VPS where I host a few websites and try to improve that system on a regular basis. I'm quite proficient at programming but it's not where my passions lie. My experience is not worth going into detail about in this post, if you have a suggestion and I've already done it, I'll let you know!

I'm looking for more ""stuff"" to learn. My desktop is powerful enough to run quite a few VMs, and I have a spare laptop that can also be used. I have access to MSDN-AA with everything from Exchange to Windows Server 2008 R2 to Microsoft Songsmith for free. I have quite a few resources where I can get some hardware if necessary. I guess the only limitation at the moment is that my University network doesn't allow students to run certain services (DHCP/WINS/SMTP/etc). If there's a decent way to setup a private VM network which would still have internet access (IE run my own Domain Controller and play with that), I'd love to hear it.

Specific ideas on something to setup would be awesome, but more than that I guess is how should I go about finding things to learn? I've been having this struggle for a while and I feel like I may have peaked my computer learning trend at the ripe old age of 21. Maybe a better way is to ask: What kinds of non-professional experience would an employer like to see on a resume?

TL;DR I don't know what else to learn about computers and systems administration, what should I learn next?

Edit: I want to clear up the above part. I'm familiar with setting up DHCP and Domain Controllers, joining machines to domains, etc. I just don't exactly want to risk getting caught my the university, OR doing something that might actually interfere with other student's connectivity. I also never said that I knew everything, just that I didn't know what else to learn. Who says ""I know everything, what else can I learn?"" That contradicts itself. I don't think I know everything, I know there is a LOT I don't know... I just don't know what I don't know?"

So my question is, how flexible is the IT curriculum concentration? I read on the site that you can make a custom concentration...and I'm really hyped up on the idea of doing a Mobile App Development concentration. I know there's a Native App Dev class offered, and I thought I remember seeing classes for an iPhone development class (anyone have a course title/number?? You'll be my new best friend). I thought I might try for the concentration with the Native App class + possibly the iPhone class (if it still exists/ever existed)/Visual C++ for Programmers, then maybe an independent study and learn Windows Phone 7 app dev since it's the last major platform I haven't actually developed for.

i may have to sign up for a local 5k just to prove i can do it without the program too.

After the second time I told het in 08, she actually vexed at me which caused a 9 month hiatus. She rejected me by telling me that if I had money, she'll date me. Which I guess was her rejection but ironically, she found me a temp job the week before and licked each others fingers during dessert.

Then she had a lame bf for 2 years that she even called him ugly when describing him. She does sound like a bitch right? I believe it is a case in point. Now she's single and going out together again a lot. I go to her house sometimes but never made a move while there. 
I just don't want to gave the rejection again, she's a sweet person but I can never distinguish when a woman is flirting with me or just being 'nice.'

Edit: Thank you all! Damn, I never had my questions answered so fast!


I won't make a move, in fact; I'll keep things a minimum. Now that I step back and look back, when I had lunch with her and her new boyfriend; he remarked of how he woo'd her by meeting her in archery class, giving her flowers not once, not twice, but 3 times. THEN she gave in, went out with him, then I guess sexy time ensued. Fuck her, tired of rejections and a losing record. Asian fever not my forte anymore. Moving on now. "

Write to whoever represents you in government, and even if it only gets seen by an intern or secretary, the sheer volume of mail, were we all to do it, would show them that a lot of people care about the subject.

But don't just repeat the same old arguments about the benefits of legalisation: I'm sure they've heard them all before. Also, I'm sure that there are many people in government who are personally pro-legalisation, but would never admit that. So, when you write, do this:

**Dare** them to make a change.

It seems to me that as soon as one major western country makes the move towards decriminalisation or legalisation, the others will follow suit, or certainly give it proper consideration. So, dare your representative to be the first person to bring about that change. Dare them to stand up against the anti-drug masses. Dare them to speak out against the dogma.

If each and every one of us did this, perhaps just one politician will read and take to heart what we have to say. But that's all we need: one politician daring enough to make a change."
ks1si,0,2011-09-26,Is it wrong that I may have to PAY to work in an internship?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ks1si/is_it_wrong_that_i_may_have_to_pay_to_work_in_an/,"I am going to school to be a Registered Dietician (RD). To be eligible to take the RD exam, you must partake in a dietetic internship (DI) that lasts for approx. 8-10 months.

The thing that has been bothering me lately is that almost all of these internships offer no payment for the interns. No financial help of any sort, which can be a burden, especially if you have to move to another area for the internship and must pay for living and food, etc. (which is highly likely as the internships are very competitive, and a national shortage of them causes students to apply potentially to internships very far away because they will actually get into them).

Some of these internships (I believe it is many of them actually) require the interns to PAY for the internship. That's right, kind of like paying a tuition for a full-time job (they are completely full-time internships). Mind you that these internships are a requirement to be eligible to take the RD exam.

Is this wrong? The more and more I think about it, it almost seems like a scam to me. Being an RD is highly regarded in the professional world, so it isn't a worthless title, but I can't help but think it is wrong what these internship companies are doing.

**TL;DR:** Is it wrong to have either get payed nothing or have to pay the internship as an intern for a dietetic internship?"

My MFLB and more are gone forever.",brandoncoal,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/krw0s/trees_i_had_a_terrible_night_and_need_to_vent_my/,"Last night I was drinking and smoking at a secluded spot on campus that was, on the word of the smoking community and from two years of personal experience, a safe place. Well last night it was proved to me that I can trust neither the spot nor anyone on campus. I had finished a bowl and was passing a 40 back and forth when a campus security van pulled up saying that someone called them in. I was written up for drugs (my second offence; I had stupidly left a pipe in a coat when they did fire safety checks and the smell carried) and alcohol. I also had taken from me my entire cannabis kit. 

Whenever I went out to this spot i would bring the whole smell sealed kit and caboodle so as not to repeat the earlier mistake about stinking up my room. So now i am out the 20 of trees I bought just that night, a glass bowl I found out at the very spot over a year ago (I feel like I took stewardship of the lost thing and have now failed it), a wooden pipe my friend got me in Jamaica, my MFLB!, my papers, my extra baggies, my nicely bent bowl scraping paper clips, my grinder, and the original style DS soft case and a cool vintage looking metal Animal Crackers tin I used to store some of it.

They haven't stopped this poor ent, but they have impoverished him and made his life significantly more stressful and annoying. Trees, I'm a ""productive"" member of their society. I get 4.0s and 3.8s pretty consistently, I don't miss class, I come on time, I take an interest in my education and I take internships. Now all they and whatever immoral asshole who called them have succeeded in taking this honors student's life and shitting on it when he can least afford to buy all that paraphernalia back. I guess I should have told them that I'd smoke soon anyway but they had just taken my budgeted amount for the next week. Though they have taught me a lesson.

Until we achieve our long deserved rights under the law, nowhere is safe. And that makes me feel frightened and violated. Their police harassment solution is working and I hate it. But I can't wallow too much.

I'm going to use this opportunity to take a little break and think about what spots on campus really are safe. From now on I will only roll and I will only smoke those far away from any possibility of sight or smell on the breeze.

And for those of you sitting at home smoking at your desks, free from the oppression in your own home at the very least, I envy you so much.

Edit: I got a cool CSS pineapple thingy next to my name in trees! I'm still not entirely sure what this means but it makes me happy to have it so thanks mods!

I graduated from a good accounting program, but my GPA is weak (3.0) and I forwent internships during college for (failed) entrepreneurship. I'm in the Peace Corps at the moment and have 9 months left in service. I speak Mandarin natively, but I don't know how far that's going to get me.

I've spent the past couple of years really working on my weaknesses and I don't think that my poor GPA reflects my work ethic anymore. I've been spending 3 hours a day after work, every day, studying for the CPA exam. I know I can express these things if I manage to get an interview, but I think a 3.0 with no internships will get my resume easily tossed into the garbage stack.

How do I get connected with a recruiter? There are many questions I'd like to ask and I think a good rapport putting a face to my resume will be my best bet for getting a shot at an interview. How early can I start this process? Is there such a thing as being too early?

Lastly, for those of you guys with experience - is my resume just too bad to be salvaged, even with a stellar interview? What are other things I can do here to make myself more competitive? I'll do *anything* to get my foot (and the rest of me) through the door. Do post-grad internships exist for the Big 4, and are they a good idea?"

Two years of required classes, unrelated to your chosen major. What for? A well rounded education where you won’t remember a single goddamn thing from that Bio 110 class. Well Rounded. Some universities require these required classes for their masters degrees. Or you can just gtfo of america and go to an accredited university without that bullshit. Required. So that wastes two whole fucking years of my life.

Then two more years of classes learning about your interested field with an internship or two (if you’re lucky). Then you find out the only real ‘entry level’ jobs are the fucking bk lounge and miky d’s. Thousands of applications that require two years of in the field experience for an entry level job because the internship is not enough and the employer doesn’t give a shit about the history of the business in your stupid classes. So school gives you a degree that every employer requires but doesn’t actually prepare for the job so you remain unemployed and wasted your fucking life in 4 years.

Are their no schools that give you a degree and appropriate training? NOPE :D Have a nice fucking day you fucked son of a bitch. And if anyone finds out someway around this bullshit PLZZZZ for the love of god tell the rest of us."

(24/F)",furbyhooker,ihaveissues,https://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/krfus/i_pack_up_and_pull_a_disappearing_act_when_things/,"I'm a whole bundle of issues, but this is the one I take most issue with, and the one I feel affects people around me more than I'd like to admit. I've done this 3-4 times in the past 5 years when it feels like I can't handle anymore bullshit going on in my life, relationships, etc. 

5 years ago, I left my home town after a fight with an ex that ended in physical violence from his end. I bought a plane ticket, packed my shit up, didn't tell anyone what I was doing, and was gone. I hated where I lived, I hated my ex because he was abusive, and it felt like I was going no where with my life. So, I disappeared. I did not talk to anyone for a long time from my home town. 

When I got to my new city (Austin), in a state 2000 miles away, I felt a sense of relief. I was starting over, I didn't know anybody, and I felt it was an opportunity to do something different and to better myself. Of course, I met people, got engaged, and I quickly found myself feeling like my life was becoming too settled, and not the way I had planned. Another feeling I've always had when this urge to flee arrives is the feeling that I know too many people, and too many people know me. It's like I'm too 'connected,' and in a way, it makes me feel very anxious and scared. My fiance at the time actually convinced me to move with him to Ohio for work, and I thought of it as a chance to once again run away and start over, to see if I could experience something different.

About 6 months into the move, it became obvious things weren't working out. My fiance and I called off our wedding, and I packed up my shit and took off back to a town close to Austin. This time felt a little different. While I was moving *back* to a familiar area, I kept myself secluded, did not talk to the friends I made in Austin before moving to Ohio, and I felt far enough from town that I could be a stranger again. 

This past year has been really difficult; I went through a bad breakup, a grandparent I was very close to passed away, and I have been very sick, with symptoms getting progressively worse recently. It feels like I know too many people in the same circles, and that I am no longer able to be private or alone because of this. All of these things have made me consider running again and pulling what my family refers to as the disappearing act. I am getting the urge to pack up and cut off contact with everyone again. 

This weekend, I spoke with one of my professors; he talked to me about studying abroad for an internship beginning in December. I haven't told anyone about this, and I wouldn't. I would just leave. The return date was flexible, and I don't have much longer until I graduate. If I took the internship, I would make every attempt to make it last long enough to make valuable connections and to network to find a job upon graduating, so I don't have to return. I want to jump on it, but I know I want to leave for all the wrong reasons. I want to leave to escape, and to run away, because it's the only way I know how to cope with things when they feel too overwhelming. And I know this can't keep going on. I can't keep jumping and disappearing; I don't want to keep doing this, either. 

If anyone has any advice, it'd be much appreciated. Here are some other fun facts about me if it helps you in your response: I'm currently seeing a psychiatrist for a number of reasons, mostly for depression and compulsive habits that have developed this year and have really fucked up my life and relationships. I'm going to see a neurologist this week for testing as I've had symptoms that are causing concern and trips to the ER (slurred speech, memory loss, confusion, tremor in my right hand, etc). If you want to know anything else feel free to ask.

**TL;DR** I run away whenever things become too much in my life and start over new somewhere else. This is becoming a bad habit of mine and I want it to stop. I have the opportunity to 'jump ship' again thanks to an internship, but don't want to take it as I know it's for the wrong reasons. Need advice on how to deal with the urge to flee when things become too much."

I don't really understand how that works I guess. can anyone who has experience explain?

**Secondly, and more importantly**, if investing in stocks is considered ""insider trading"" does that mean I can't invest in ETFs also?

I own a sweet gentle 10 year old rottweiler, that apparently annoys my new neighbor because he --3 times now--has complained about the barking.  My schedule keeps me gone for long periods of time each day (between school full-time, night internship, and work full-time), and for whatever reason my dog doesn't like to do his business when it's just my wife at home.
When I get home for a couple hours here and there, I quickly let the dog out (we also go on walks from time to time). I let him out on his 20' long chain for about 15 minutes 3 or 4 times a day, and sure, some of those minutes he barks. Me being a dog lover, I don't see an issue. With a dog barking for 5 or ten minutes at 1pm or 6pm, for whatever reason twice now this week my new neighbor has complained through the privacy fence that ""that shit is annoying"" and ""you should keep better control of your dog"". The first time I was caught off guard and just quickly apologized, the second I responded ""seriously dude?!"" 

What should I do about this guy? I feel like the point of going to him (which I hardly have time for anyway) and bringing cookies has past. But I don't want some big issue out of my dog going outside.

EDIT: Yeah I guess dogs barking can be annoying, but like I said he is an inside dog but I cannot keep him inside all day. I let him out when he needs to do his business and then in a few minutes I let him back in.

Now I have absolutely nothing to do...a little depressed and haven't found motivation to look for a job. The only thing I know right now is that I would really like to go live abroad again and don't really want to stay here in the states. I feel like I need to study and specialize in something more concrete and useful than what I studied in college just to broaden my skills. I was thinking of studying International Business as I'd like a job living abroad and travelling. 

Would I be going for a Masters degree or another bachelors? I have no experience in business though if i were to go for a masters...

I would like to study somewhere in EU but I feel like I'd be wasting my 2 years of Japanese I've picked up while living in Japan so I wouldn't mind studying in Japan either though I know how expensive it is to live there. Right now my Japanese is so-so conversational level, I can also speak semi-fluent Chinese, and of course English.

I'm also open to working but I know that pretty much out of the question trying to work somewhere in the EU with my skillset...unless someone knows otherwise. Working abroad would mean I would have to go teach English again in Korea or Japan (again) which i'm not completely dismissing as it would take me abroad. I just feel like if I want to pursue another degree, I should do it now as I am getting older and I also have about $20,000 saved up from working in Japan for 2 years.

I ask because I'm obviously going to have to work to pay for rent and food, and assume that, for the beginning, I'll be having to do a lot of work for no pay to start off. I've also heard that it isn't uncommon for shooting to be 12-14 hours a day, so how did you guys make this happen while holding onto a job? I don't know if I've ever read anything on here about this. Thanks.

tl;dr how do you keep a full-time job and do unpaid film work."

kt9f7,3,2011-09-27,My Professor forgot to write my letter of recommendation that is due in 28 hours. What do I do?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/kt9f7/my_professor_forgot_to_write_my_letter_of/,"Hello Reddit,

I apologize if this is the wrong subreddit. I've known this Professor for around four years and have taken many classes with him. I am not his best nor favorite student, but I have showed ambition and dedication to my work and his classes have appealed to me more than any other class (I am a Philosophy student and he is a Philosophy of Aesthetics/Ethics professor). About a month ago I contacted him and asked if he could write me a letter of recommendation for an internship for my last semester of undergrad. He said he would be happy to as long as I sent him all required information. Within the next day I forwarded him all relevant information including the due date of my application. However, when I went to turn in my application today, I received a notice that I was missing a letter of recommendation. I have approximately 28 or so hours to turn in this letter of recommendation or I cannot further the application process.

A couple sentences for clarification.

1) I am assuming he forgot to write my letter of recommendation. He has yet to email me for a status update. 

2) The internship is extremely prestigious and can net me a job in an area that I wish to pursue, if I do not wish to attend graduate/law school.

3) I have sent him an e-mail asking for a status update, however, he rarely checks his email and if so, responds extremely late.

4) I will be visiting his office after my classes today to see if I can catch him in person.

So far I have dwindled down my options to (2) areas. Either A) I attempt to Contact any relevant people I know and see if they can provide me with a letter of recommendation before the due date. I feel like this option can put me in negative light to the individuals I contact and relies purely on someone having a template (which I believe negates the purpose of a letter of recommendation). Or, B) I can write a letter of recommendation myself and forge the identity of an individual.

My question to reddit is as follows, what do I do in this situation?

kt95u,0,2011-09-27,I sold door to door with the Southwestern Company internship and had a good time doing it. AMA,Ironslug,IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/kt95u/i_sold_door_to_door_with_the_southwestern_company/,"I know that there has been a couple of these posts in the past but I have a slightly different story. 

Just a brief history: Southwestern is a company that has been around since 1855 that offers college students a sales and leadership program /internship. What the college students actually do is door to door sales, learn to lead others (after the first year), and also learn a whole about themselves.

Now, a little about me. I am an electrical engineering major at George Mason University. I had first sold the summer after my sophomore year in college (2010). I did well enough my first summer to want to come back and do it again (2011).

I have sold both in Illinois and in the Ft.Worth - Dallas area of Texas. This is the hardest job I have ever done in my life and I would not trade my experiences for the world. I also made enough money to pay a semester's worth of college and little bit more.

Rules are pretty simple Religion, Politics, and Nudity are obviously out. There are 6 categories Creative, Nature, People, Black and White, Animals, and General. I can submit 3 photos, all in the same category or 3 separate. 

I'm looking to have some fun with this, I'm looking for different shoot ideas. If we can push a little controversy and some sexiness that would be ideal.

I'm looking to shoot on Friday as I have off. Not trying to spend a whole lot of money on props. So this is what we have to work with at the moment. I live in an moderately upscale townhouse, with weightlifting equipment downstairs as well as a full size pool table in the loft. There are some nice woods nearby as well as a lake to use. It may rain here on Friday so there is a possibility of some interesting outdoor shots. Body paint and revealing clothing were not explicitly blacklisted and I am personally encouraging them based on the models willingness. 

I'm banking on having some interns being assigned to screen the submissions which could help to get it in past the censors if nothing is too over the top. After that it gets judged by a panel of professional photographers who select the top 6 in each category. The finalists are then voted on in a company wide ballot. I think there is a decent shot to win here with some creativity an interesting theme.

As far as models I'm putting an ad up on craigslist for female models, I also have a couple of possible ones that I know. Looking for ideas ranging from one female to several.

That about covers it. I've got a few ideas myself at the moment but just wanted to hear some people more knowledgeable then myself take a crack at it.

[Demons](http://www.amazon.com/Demons-Special-Lamberto-Bava/dp/B000T28POC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1317134319&amp;sr=8-1) - directed by Mario Bava's son and co-written with Dario Argento, this is a well-known splatter-classic from the '80s. I haven't watched it yet since I'm saving it for next month (shameless plug - come to [/r/horrormoviechallenge](http://www.reddit.com/r/horrormoviechallenge/) and challenge yourself to watch as many horror movies as possible next month!) but I'm really excited to see it!

[Hell of the Living Dead](http://www.amazon.com/Hell-Living-Margit-Evelyn-Newton/dp/B00005R24H/ref=sr_1_2?s=movies-tv&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1317134508&amp;sr=1-2) - Wish I had found the Blue Underground version of this one instead, but I doubt that there is a significant difference between the two editions. That said, this is well known for being one of the worst zombie movies ever - it's chock full of stock footage, and the director even shamelessly lifted the score from Romero's Dawn of the Dead for the movie. This is definitely going to be bad in a bad way.

[C.H.U.D.](http://www.amazon.com/C-H-U-D-John-Heard/dp/B00004Y6BC/ref=sr_1_1?s=movies-tv&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1317134711&amp;sr=1-1) - Did you like Home Alone, but wish there were more cannibals in it? This might be for you - Daniel Stern and John Heard also star in this '80s flick (which stands for Cannibalistic Humanoid Underground Dwellers) which should be great fun - probably double feature it with Hell of the Living Dead for a nice drive-in/grindhouse effect.

[The Bela Lugosi Collection](http://www.amazon.com/Lugosi-Collection-Murders-Morgue-Invisible/dp/B0009X770E/ref=sr_1_1?s=movies-tv&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1317134890&amp;sr=1-1) - Movies included: Murders in the Rue Morgue, The Black Cat, The Raven, The Invisible Ray and Black Friday. This is almost more properly a Karloff/Lugosi collection, since Karloff is also in 4 of the 5 films. I'm really looking forward to watching all of these - word of warning if you are interested, though: Like the Universal Legacy Collection DVDs, there was a problem with the DVD encoding on this release which causes glitches in the movie. I'm hoping this wasn't why I found it for $10 at a used DVD store, but I won't know until I sit down and try and fast-forward through them all (sure way to catch the glitch - the movie will freeze if it's a bad disc).

[The Bava Collection, Vol. 2](http://www.amazon.com/Bava-Box-Set-Vol/dp/B000UVV23S/ref=sr_1_1?s=movies-tv&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1317135186&amp;sr=1-1) - Movies included: Baron Blood, Lisa and the Devil, House of Exorcism, Roy Colt and Winchester Jack, Four Times That Night, Five Dolls for an August Moon, Kidnapped and Bay of Blood. Awesome box set from, so far, my favorite horror director (I still have a lot of movies to go, but I've loved every one of them so far). This collection kind of runs the gamut, from horror to comedy-western to erotic comedy to crime thriller, so there's plenty of variety. Fun trivia - two of the murder scenes in Friday the 13th Part II are nearly shot for shot reproductions of murders in the movie Bay of Blood.

[Girls, Guns and G-Strings - The Andy Sidaris Collection](http://www.amazon.com/Girls-Guns-G-Strings-Dona-Speir/dp/B004HHX9OQ/ref=sr_1_1?s=movies-tv&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1317135526&amp;sr=1-1) - Too many movies to list, but that's OK - these are a special kind of movie. You know the kind of movie that would air at 1:00 AM on Showtime or Cinemax in the mid to late '90s? These are it - 12 movies that feature ludicrous storylines, explosions and Playboy models-turned-actresses. Hard Ticket to Hawaii is the best one I have watched so far - watch [this clip](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd_X-C5g29o) (probably not NSFW, but I don't know where you work so it may be best watched elsewhere) and tell me this movie isn't worth watching.

[Treasure of the Sierra Madre](http://www.amazon.com/Treasure-Sierra-Madre-Two-Disc-Special/dp/B00003CXD5/ref=sr_1_2?s=movies-tv&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1317135986&amp;sr=1-2) - Now for the only recent non-horror or cheese purchase. Starring Humphrey Bogart and Walter Huston, this is a great adventure movie about the search for gold in Mexico and how it amplifies or changes the character of those pursuing it. Can't recommend this one enough.

If you made it this far, thanks for reading - I think this might be the longest piece I have ever typed on the internet!"

ksye5,5,2011-09-27,"Geomatics Professionals, Grad Students and AZ/CA Residents - Help a confused undergrad out. ",RabidCoyote,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/ksye5/geomatics_professionals_grad_students_and_azca/,"I'll try to offer as much information as I can, but I know I'll miss some things. So if there's anything I glossed over and you need me to expand on, I'm more then happy to do so. 

*TL;DR : Thinking of going to graduate school in Geomatics because I hate business and need to do something else. Wondering what the best plan of attack for grad school / professional career is. Also pondering a move from NJ to AZ/CA

I started off my college career, not really sure what I wanted to do. So I took general classes in business administration at community college. I had some struggles - math, mainly - but I worked up through the remedial classes and got up to the required levels. I never bothered getting an AA because it was never really a goal for me, and I needed to get out to avoid getting complacient. So after two years of taking general education stuff like english, sociology, etc. and some basic marketing + business, I transferred out to Rutgers, and I moved out and lived on my own. 

Living on my own sucked, but that's partly because I picked shitty roommates. I got too caught up in their drama and shenanigans to really focus on studying. That, combined with being thrown into the giant pool of Rutgers, being a freshman and lost and confused, I didn't do so hot my first semester. I'm retaking my biology class now, and I repeated Precalc back at Community College this summer, so the lasting impacts shouldn't be so terrible. 

My major at Rutgers has been ""Environmental Science and Economics"", because I wasn't sure if I wanted to go into a business environment or persue something more on the environmental side of things. After meeting the people in business school, seeing the business environment and knowing how corporate culture is, I know I won't be happy on the business end of things. I need to do something bigger, more creative, even if it doesn't bring in the same bucks that business would. As long as there's money to pay the bills, keep the lights on and have alittle left over for fun, I'll be alright. 

I've been learning about Geomatics the past two semesters and it really seems like a field I'd be interested in. While I'm not the biggest techie, I've always been up on computers. Geomatics seems like a good way to apply environmental science, and from what I've read, has many applications and a decent employment outlook. 

The problem is I've only scraped the tip of Geomatics. I'd like to get a master's degree, and I've been looking into Geomatics programs. Rutgers offers a ""certificate"" in Geomatics, but I'm not sure how I feel about that. I'd be more inclined to a master's program so I can go onto the doctorate level at some point and be a college professor. 

The two programs I've seen so far that sound really enticing are Arizona State (a one-year MS for Geomatics) and Cal State @ Northridge (I believe this one is a two-year). There's plenty more, from Maryland to England to New Zealand, but right now I'm in the initial stage of research. I have at least the rest of this year, and possibly an extra semester to finish up my bachelors. If I decide to go for grad school, the extra semester would actually be helpful so I can take GRE prep classes/exams. 

So,

Grad Students: How did you make your decision? What's the financial aid like? Is it worth the extra debt? Are their teaching opportunities to offset the cost? What should I look for in a grad program? 

Geomatics Professionals: What skills do I need to land a job? Is the master's a good idea? What kind of projects do you work on? Any suggestions on internships/jobs I should take while in school? (Right now I'm an intern at a real estate firm...and I loathe it. I'd never want to do this for a living)

AZ/CA Residents (Specifically Phoenix, AZ  and Los Angeles): What do you like and dislike about where you live? Are apartments easy to find? What's the social scene like? Do I need a car? If you moved, was it easy to get settled in?

",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ksxau/is_my_former_friend_a_sociopath/,"I have been referring to this.
http://www.mcafee.cc/Bin/sb.html

My Friend (x)

My circle of friends, have always noticed that he lied immensely, about relationships, storys that differ day to day, details, propositions, and jobs that were coming his way. (x) always said he was doing an internship involving listing movies from a website, on and off. It seemed he had a very hard time keeping friends. He would always gravitate towards interests of others, that were socially convenient at the time.

One day in high school he just disappeared for a week or so, and returned quietly. He never saw anybody, he got a girlfriend that enveloped his life for 2 or 3 promiscuous years through high school. He had an emotional breakdown at a party because someone at it had sex with his ex, years later. I believe that person was of significance too, someone who might have humiliated him.

University. He invents a girlfriend never providing evidence, and one that never comes to parties she was supposed to. He did this at the peak of my relationship with my ex. His ex from high school, who ended up drinking heavily, sleeping around, and chasing a dream in acting, visits sometimes. He had sex with her recently but claims he didn't. His father is an entrepreneur who used to be extremely rich, conveniently he can create a lot of advantageous situations with this.

Lately he gravitated towards me, 

He did things like ask for my stumbleupon account. He said he got proposed a 30k yearly internship working on the production of films in another province. Yet he had no idea what he was talking about, I knew that because that was my industry (or was). We got into a discussion about software. I could tell I cornered him with my questions, because I was trying to develop a website myself at the time. Soon, he spontaneously bought every game I was interested in. 

He went to Europe for the summer, with a close friend and an acquaintance of mine. He came back portraying mismatched stories and exaggerations.

Shortly after, the circle was talking-  him and myself went to talking, isolated from the group. He proposed the question 'what if you could get your dick wet everyday'. Quizzically, I responded- 'depends how hot she was'. I said this, because, at the time I thought my friends might've been gay, because lately I felt like I was getting hit on. The conversation progressed, and in the darkness it sounded like he was weeping slightly. Prior to this conversation, I felt like I was getting hit on a few days ago by my two other friends immensely. One who I believe is actually closeted. I did not know how to react, so I ignored it. I realized he proposed that question because he had set something in motion. 

I had an internship, I failed miserably in a month. I broke up with my ex of two years who got me the internship through her sister as soon as I started. On a side note, my ex and her family, were fucking insane. (x) caught wind of it I believe, through his mother who had connections. I planned to uphold the lie that I was still working for another month, then say it was over. 

One night, he meets up with me alone and mentions that his mother knows of someone who lost his internship, he jokes about it and mentions facebook. My account, was encumbered with embarrassing photos that have been long forgotten, I never did clean it out, but I disabled my account before I started my internship. It was reactivated without my knowing, and I always attributed it to my girlfriend, but now that I think of it- it wouldn't be unlikely that he knew my password. 

That weekend, he called me to come to a party, at 11am. It's too late, and chose not to go because of it. At this party I believe he sold out the one person who understood him, amongst the acquaintance he went to Europe with and friends.

He slandered my name, lied and exaggerated, used me as a joke and projected his insecurities on me to climb a social ladder. I know, he too speculated our friend was closeted as well. I believe he used that to turn him against me. Because that friend was extremely hostile to me the next day. He used my ex to provide a believable backstory  for his insults and lies. I've been around a few friends since, something has changed. 

A few nights later he called me to meet up. The conversation revolved around my ideologies, my idols, me. He then tried to convince me to pay for a ridiculously spontaneous trip with him, his brother, and father. He is in-directly mocking me, im fully aware yet I dont do anything about it.

He has always poisoned people against others now that I think of it. He did the same thing to a friend who was also in a relationship. What is fucked up is that I might have had the opportunity to have sex that friends ex, but I chose not too. A week later, in my drunkenness, I remember him sitting me down, and going to her profile on Facebook. He began writing a message, ""I think you should have done it"". What is also fucked up, the acquaintance he went to Europe with, was best friends with the guy whose ex he wanted me to fuck.

He is trying to push the cycle of what he went through onto others as a way of venting his pain. I dont think he will stop until he finds someone to fuck a friend's ex. Hypothetically, I'd be next in line. (x) still calls me to meet up so he can see my condition, he gets frustrated because im not giving him the reaction he wants. He thinks im still ignorant to it all, so naturally he will keep making it more and more obvious.

I realize, I have traits that he associates with his ex, so he hated to see me being successful and felt like he had to keep pace. When I slipped he saw it as an opportunity to exploit me, something he always wanted to do to his ex. His ex, who has been controlling him through an inferiority complex that has be fostering in him for quite some time.

I've never stopped whats been happening around me because I find it so fascinating to live in. No one knows anything about this, how I think. I've likely been portrayed as an idiot by him, so I have to be cautious with my next move.

I think I know what to do, but I have to know if im profiling him properly before I proceed. Any advice would be very appreciated, thank you reading this.

tl;dr very close friend finds out I got fired at an internship, tells everyone and posions them against me so he would feel better about himself.

I guess I'm a pretty closet anime watcher since I don't go to anime clubs or cons and only a few of my close friends know I am an avid watcher (I absolutely dig any and all sci-fi anime, although I enjoy pretty much any genre). As hard as it to pick favourites in such a varied medium, my top anime shows of all time would have to be a tie between Time of Eve, Evangelion (especially Rebuild), and the Ghost in the Shell films.

ksjot,1,2011-09-26,How do you get USPS to honor an insurance claim?,Epsilon748,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ksjot/how_do_you_get_usps_to_honor_an_insurance_claim/,"Long story short:

I was living in Texas on an internship for a year. I was moving back to school and mailed home a 40lb box of books I'd collected (mostly manga/fiction/etc). I didn't have room in my car, so this was easiest.

I'd mailed them media mail with insurance and signature confirmation to the office my mom works at in PA, hoping to pick it up on my way through.

Three weeks later, I receive notice that the package was ""undeliverable as addressed"" and was being returned to sender. I'd created the label with the USPS label tool and it was a business address - one that receives hundreds of pieces of mail a day. I spent weeks calling USPS, the Texas post office, and the local post office asking about it. They all check it out and say they haven't seen it/call the other place. 

I finally file for insurance and provide receipts for all the books I shipped. Today I find out my claim has been denied.

What do I have to do to get them to honor my claim? They misdelivered my books, lost them, and now aren't paying me my valid insurance. I sent them receipts and have a copy of my shipment receipt AND the original shipping label created with THEIR TOOL for a valid address. How could I possibly be denied when the proof shows that it was a screw up on their end?

I had ~$300 in books in that box plus the cost of shipping and now I have nothing to show for it. As a college student, that's a lot of money to be out. What can I do to get it back? I can maybe charge back for the cost of shipping, but I'm still out the cost of books.

TL;DR: USPS failed at delivering my package, lost it, and is denying my valid insurance claim. What can I do?"

Well, im a php junior by your standard, so im looking for things i may have missed in my first try. 

There is this php project that is for storing data about indicidents regarding Quality Assurement in a Multinational enterprise. 

it was made by 3 different interns, everyone of them write a separate side project, with a separate database, template, set of rules, ideas, everything you can name they did different from each other.

The first one, the users upload/download word files.. and you get lost in version control with this.. its a nightmare for the users (so they tell me) 

The second one, does use a database for store its information, but has this giagantic forms of 60 textboxs that users are afraid of, and refuse to use...

the third one, its like the second but its unfinished... 

I havent seen the code yet, but im pretty sure it would be the same quality as any copy/paste the original programers find in google.

Obviously I need to see the code to know how much i can do, but without it i see several things i can make

1. Unify every sideproject into only one
1.  Put a login system, this thing has NO security
1.  Add a regular automatic backup 
1.  Start monitoring things, logging them 
1.  Make a propper database 
1.  Rewrite probably everything, slowly 


What am i missing?

What should be the orden i do this things?


What should i look at the code when i got it?

While there, she was so mean to me. This sounds stupid but I don't know how else to say it. She bossed me around when it came to the sightseeing we did, she gave me a hard time about the hotel I found for us  and when we met up with another friend back there for the remaining three days she degraded me in front of her. 

I had no idea what was going on. At first, I decided that I would just try to give her some space by trying to go and eat meals by myself but she wouldn't let me by saying that I was being rude to our other friend and that we don't have a lot of time to spend with her. During meals she wouldn't talk to me and roll her eyes when I tried to make conversation. After the seminars for the day were over I would go walk about NYC by myself so I wouldn't have to be in a room with her. After coming back from one of my walks the key to the room didn't work so I knocked...and knocked. I went down to the front desk and couldn't get a new key bc her name was on room. Ends up, I waited in the hallway for 30 minutes until she finally answered the door, annoyed that my key didn't work. The next morning she refused to help me get a  new key. 

At that point I finally asked her what was wrong and why she was acting like this. She turned her back on me and walked away. I was blown away. How could someone I considered a good friend turn their back on me and refuse to talk to me about why they are so irritated. I would have accepted, ""Hormones are raging because I'm pregnant and everything is bothering me."" or ""you're stupid, I don't like you anymore."". But turning your back and completely ignoring the situation helps no one.

A couple weeks after we've been home she calls and asks if I want to teach for her in her studio. I told her I would like to talk to her about it. She doesn't return my call. I ask if she can come over so we can talk and she shows up with a student of hers. I don't find it to be appropriate to talk about it in front of someone else. I end up calling her and telling her I do not want to teach for her assuming she would ask WHY. In that answer I was going to let her know how she treated me in NY was cruel and a friend would never treat another friend like that so there was no way I was going to be her employee. Well, she didn't ask why, she just said ""fine"". 

Since that conversation I've kept her at arm's length. I stopped calling her and stopped ""hanging out"". I used the excuse that school and my internship kept me busy. I met her for coffee 4 months later which was fine, except for her negativity about life in general. I didn't care for her bad energy and still kept her at a distance. 

Fast forward to today and I get a text asking if everything is ok and how have I been. REALLY!? I guess I should know  that subtle hints don't do what you want them to. I called back in hopes of just telling her why I haven't been around and of course, she acts like we talked yesterday.

I am frustrated for two reasons. One, because I don't have the balls to just tell her that she was absolutely horrible and I don't need people like that in my life. And two, because she doesn't realize or is avoiding it. Has anybody else been in a situation like this? Any tact advice would be helpful. Thanks for listening."

The specific field of physics is something I haven't really decided on quite yet, but more to the point:

My (current) dream is to work in Fermilab or CERN, because I've always wanted to do something, or help a cause that will change the world. Also, I do not wish to teach in a high school or college environment(not now anyways). However, my most important question is this: How likely is it, after graduating with whatever degree in physics, that I could get a job in one of these facilities? Also, how much schooling would it require (Bachelor's degree, Doctorate, etc.) 
Also, the university I'm transferring to is quite close to Fermilab, making internship opportunities very likely. 

TL;DR - I want to work in Fermilab/CERN, but I want to know how likely getting a job in one of these facilities would be. 

I ask here because this is a large community. There must be a handful of people here who work in one of these facilities, or a facility similar to them.  "
kshes,1,2011-09-26,"Reddit, I screwed up. How can I resolve the cognitive dissonance and get over the shame of having a criminal record?",IWasntEvenDrunk,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/kshes/reddit_i_screwed_up_how_can_i_resolve_the/,"Throwaway account, obviously. I don't know whether this is an appropriate subreddit - please direct me to a more appropriate one if necessary.

Early this last June, during finals week, I shoplifted from a store affiliated with the state university I attend. Stupid, small stuff - office supplies, less than $50 total. Looking back, I was really obvious about it. I was caught immediately. No police were involved, but I was put in handcuffs and taken to the security office, which was an extremely traumatic experience for me. I spent that entire evening crying and didn't sleep that night. I was so upset that I actually made myself physically sick and threw up the next day (serendipitously; was able to postpone an engineering final). The store is literally next door to the apartment building where I live, and every time I walk past it I want to cry. I am banned from entering the place for 7 years (wtf?), and every time I see something related to the place, or even related to my university, it makes me think of my shame.

Today was my pretrial diversion hearing. In my state, if you have no previous criminal record and you commit a misdemeanor, you can get the charge dismissed if you do 8 hours of community service and go 90 days without any criminal activity. So, I won't have a conviction on my record - but that's not what I'm upset about. 

I'm still deeply ashamed and angry at myself. The other week, I read the police report with a description by the store employees of what they saw, and it just sounded so idiotic and not like something a sane, intelligent, functional person would do. It doesn't feel like ME at all; it read like something out of America's Dumbest Criminals. The only thing keeping me from wanting to crawl into a hole and die is the effort to convince myself that it somehow /wasn't/ me at all; that I was in such a messed-up emotional state from the stress of finals (I do not handle stress well) that I wasn't the person I usually am. I can't imagine myself doing something like that now. The person who did that doesn't make sense to me, and I hate her for leaving me to deal with her crap. 

Here's some demographic information. I'm female, white, middle-class, and at the time was finishing my sophomore year of university and 19 year old. I'm an Electrical Engineering major with no major money problems - in fact, I had a well-paying internship with a major tech company that summer (thank God I passed the background check before this happened). No one in my family has ever had a criminal charge, as far as I know. I live alone in a studio apartment and have a boyfriend who was amazingly understanding and loving through this ordeal. No relationship problems or other sources of crazy. 

I was the only person in the courtroom, besides all the attorneys, who was in the recommended ""business casual"" attire. At the risk of sounding classist, the defendants around me and the people in the probation waiting area were... not like me. Homeless people, aggressive and uncouth people... and I was one of them, and the judge looked at me like I was less of a person.

That's what I feel like - a lesser person. There's just so much cognitive dissonance right now between the person I want to believe I am and the common thief who landed herself in court. I need someone to talk to, Reddit. "

I am a fourth year computer engineering student, and I still have two years of upper division courses to go. I am good at what I do (relatively), and I enjoy engineering. I really have a passion for embedded development-- I'm a sick bastard that actually enjoys assembly programming, etc.

But I also have a strong background in the arts. I've been sneakily doubling up and taking courses in art along the engineering (to keep my sanity), and have been very successful as a fine art photographer, making it into juried shows, etc. 

But I get the feeling that artistic/creative endeavors aren't valued very much when it comes to engineering fields. I want to work for a company where my skills in design and creativity go to use-- more than likely a startup or something small.

I am going out now and hitting hard to land an internship or coop for the upcoming summer, is it worth highlighting my non-engineering side? I feel like it makes me a more ""well-rounded"" and attractive candidate, but am I wrong?"

In college, I dated a girl who was a pre-med major and not long after she started sleeping over she freaked out and said she thought I was going to die in my sleep.  She urged me to get checked for sleep apnea.  It took about 2 years to convince my parents it was a major issue and I needed to get diagnosed, I could schedule later classes but I couldn't come in late for internships.

I was diagnosed at 21 with OSA.  At first my ENT suggested we look into removing my tonsils, but after my sleep study showed an Apnea-Hypopnea Index of 74 (30+ is considered Severe according to my doc); she said surgery would be painful and a method to alleviate the symptoms but not solve anything.

I've been using a CPAP for 2+ years and it's changed my life.  If anyone has any questions or concerns, I hope a young person's perspective may help you out.  AMA

tl;dr: 23 yr old with sleep apnea.  life sucked, now better.  Hope to help someone else with concerns."

It just so happens that it coincides with a very frustrating day of work. I think it is time for a career change and I was hoping for nothing more than a little advice.

A quick background:

I graduated from Seton Hill (not Seton Hall) in December 2008 with a B.A. in Mathematics and a B.F.A. in Graphic Design. I could not decide on a major nor what I wanted to do in life. It took me an extra semester, but I graduated with two separate degrees.

I had taken an internship with a small design firm and began learning web design from the ground up. With my background in coding and a year of experience under my belt, I took another web design position. Fast forward to present day, and here I sit, lost.

I never grew to enjoy coding, but it landed me a job when jobs were quite the commodity. I have begun to care less and less about my work (abnormal), volunteered to fill in for the finance department (data entry), and put one too many things (grad school) on the back burner.

I have always loved numbers. I am very good at solving problems, and even better at completing calculations in my head. I have looked into a few graduate programs and applied to a few government agencies (no luck). I've looked into finance, and even statistics, I just want a challenge. I want to be able to do something more.

I know none of you know me on a personal level thus making it difficult to potentially choose my career path, but any and all help is appreciated. Thank you.

EDIT: Thank you for all of your responses. I was gone last night and have woken up to a very helpful discussion. I hope to respond to everyone."
ku69i,1,2011-09-28,I could really use your advice on my job situation.,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ku69i/i_could_really_use_your_advice_on_my_job_situation/,"This is not a sob story or a ""I'm in trouble"" kind of story, I'm just in a bit of a conundrum on what to do. I could use multiple peoples input.

Some background information. I'm 20 a junior in college studying graphic design.

So I have been working as a paid intern doing graphic design for a company since January of this year. It was a great opportunity to get experience working in the field and helped me a good amount, but now I think I have out grown this place. The company is well known (not going to say what it is) but it does not have the most interesting design work (kind of old school) I pretty much have to make things worse then I really can or else it wont be approved. The office atmosphere is pretty much none existent, nobody talks (for being the creative department its pretty boring) So I really have nothing to look forward to when I come to work. I am also the youngest person here by at least 20 years.

Now I just got called for an interview for a party supply store, I am pretty much guaranteed the job (friend of mine knows the owner kinda deal) But I am fearful that after the halloween season they will cut me loose. Another problem is I will be paid less there then I am at the job I have now. Money isn't really an issue as long as I have some sort of income coming in but more money is always nice. Also with the party store the hours I can work are more flexible with my school schedule since the job I have now is 8-5 and I would be able to work on the weekends at the party store.

Also college is kicking into gear and I have A LOT of work. Junior year is the year they turn up the notch on the amount of work they want and the quality so having more flexible hours or being able to have somebody cover my shift would be nice. Plus doing design work for my job and for my school kinda burns me out after a while.

So Reddit, do I stay at the job I kind of hate for more money and security (even though I'll be quitting in December no matter what) or do I work at a fun party supply store where they might kick me out after halloween? Do I tell them in the interview that I would like to work after halloween? (is that to forward?) 

**TL;DR: Kind of hate my job now, could get a new one, not sure if pros out weigh cons. Help please.**

**I'm sure grammar**

Pretty much just though it would be neat to find some people I might get a long with to work on a project. I don't have any game ideas in mind, but I'd like to just implement a bunch of core gameplay ideas and expand on any if necessary.

Ideal partners would be another programmer (who has a little bit of artistic skill) who has similar/more experience.

I'm also open to working with UDK.

I wasn't sure if this was the right subreddit to post an add like this. If there are better please advise and I'll repost.

ktqa1,1,2011-09-27,"How to deal with having an ""unstable work history""? Advice, please!",likethetrash,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ktqa1/how_to_deal_with_having_an_unstable_work_history/,"I just got off the phone with a hiring manager for an entry-level data entry operator job I applied for. Long story short, I will probably not get the job because of an ""unstable work history."" How does one deal with having such a work history? (I never even really thought mine was unstable, especially compared to people I know.) I can't go back and change the past. Believe me, I wish I could, but I can't.

Here is my work history in a nutshell, with any information that could identify me or the companies withheld:

It starts eight years ago. Parents couldn't pay for college, nor could I get need-based financial aid (parents made too much money, but they were not very good with it), so I took out loans for college (which I was attending in a city away from home). I took a job at a local K-12 school [Job 1] while attending college so I would have money to pay the bills. Sadly, Job 1 only ran through the school year. I took a food service job during the summer months [Job 2]. I went back to Job 1 once their school year started.

The summer before my last semester of college I took a paid internship job. My internship requirement was met before my semester began, so they offered me a permanent job there [Job 3]. Worked the job and graduated college with honors (though the degree is only an associate degree). 

Right after college, I got married and moved 100 miles away from the city I was living in, so I had to quit Job 3.

In the new city I was having a hard time finding a job, so four months after moving I took a part-time job [Job 4]. I still desired more work and money, so I took a second part-time job on top of that [Job 5]. Working two part-time jobs wasn't ideal, but it helped with money.

Seven months into the part-time jobs I found a full-time job [Job 6] which paid more than the two jobs combined. I quit Job 4 and Job 5. My boss at Job 5 was really sad to see me go and told me to keep in touch.

I kept in touch. Four months later, the boss from Job 5 called me and said that they were able to create a full-time job in their (very small) company for me. It paid more than Job 6. I quit Job 6 and went back to Job 5, this time full-time. 

I stayed at Job 5 for nearly four years, even through a very rough patch where the management and structure of the company completely changed. Even after this change it was rough: Now, most people in the company were either related or part of the same church-family (I wasn't part of either family), so there was some favoritism and inequality that was especially apparent in a company with less than 20 employees. Still, I stayed and trucked on. I only quit because the company began suffering major financial problems and I was being ""asked"" to work for decreased or no pay (""asked"" in quotations because had I said no I would have been canned right off). In retrospect, I should have stayed until I was let go or I found something else, but the stress was impacting my health very negatively. 

Quick summary of jobs: 

* Jobs 1, 2, 3: All held during college.
* Jobs 4 &amp; 5: Part-time, held at the same time. Lasted 7 months.
* Job 6: First post-college full-time gig. Lasted 4 months until I was offered a full-time position at...
* Job 5 (again): Former part-time job offers me a full-time position. Stayed there for nearly four years.

Job 5 was in a very specific and uncommon market. To my knowledge, there is not another actual company in my area that does what they did; the others are all Mom-and-Pop or strictly family-run businesses. Many of the skills I gained from that job are so specific to the market I was in that they cannot transfer to other jobs, so I am looking for entry-level data entry jobs (my position at Job 5 did involved a lot of data entry). 

I've been submitting applications and resumes to many companies. I finally got a call back (at 9:00 this evening) from a company I submitted a resume to. The hiring manager I spoke with said that she would ""try to get me an interview,"" but it would be ""tough"" since my work history was ""so unstable.""

I was taken aback. I've worked very hard over the past eight years, especially in the past four years at the company I was at! Meanwhile, I have friends who have bounced around from job to job and have no trouble finding work. One in specific has worked *at least* five professional jobs over the past four years with no post-high school education, yet she has no trouble finding work and never gets told she has an unstable work history. (I asked her how she does it and she admitted to ""enhancing"" her resume for a couple of jobs and putting down a friend's mother's contact information as a previous employer, even though she never worked for her. However, I feel that I don't have the moxie to pull off such a stunt.)

Another friend has suggested that I take a ""blow-off"" job in food service until I find something better, but after this evening I am concerned that doing so will make my work history look even more unstable. 

I am very tired and am retiring for the night (this is actually what I was doing before I got a call from the hiring manager at 9:00 pm)... Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you!

**EDIT, 2011-09-28:**

Thank you guys for the advice on how to handle this. I actually got two calls for interviews today. I just got back from one of the interviews where I was offered the job on the spot (the interviewer didn't seem to think that my work history was unstable)! I have the other interview tomorrow, so I'm waiting to see how that one pans out before I accept this offer I received today. No matter what, I will be gainfully employed next week!"

At the time I was doing very well in school an was active in my fraternity life. One 
Thursday night I decided to trip LSD with some of my brothers very late at night. 
It started with watching The Yellow Submarine
in my room and ended up in county jail with 1 felony account of grand theft auto, 2 
felony accounts of attempted larceny, a felony assault on a LEO, and a DWI (also a 
crashed stolen car in a ditch and a wounded police officer). All occurring within the 
hours of 6:30am and 9:00am.What ensued afterward was an intense year of rehab, 
sober living, community service and hoping for the best. And thanks to a VERY expensive
lawyer, hard work, and generous parents I was able to make it out without doing 
any time. This event still is the main driving factor in my life, and there is still much to do
to rectify this incident. Deep down I'm just a nerdy engineering student. I figured 
my story was worthy enough to be posted; and feel free to ask any questions about 
the incident and wtf is going on now.

Here is a link to the news page where I was featured that day:

http://www.newsobserver.com/2010/10/24/758760/teen-arrested-for-vehicle-theft.html

Thanks for reading. It's been one hell of a trip. I'll be enrolled back in NCSU next Spring.

EDIT:
Just to add some more clarity to the situation, I figured I should elaborate on the circumstances of this incident.
I had experimented with many other forms of psychedelics before this night. As I mentioned below, there were a lot of unknown variables and bad decisions that contributed to such a disastrous result. Around 6pm a decision was made to do some LSD with a couple of my buddies, plans were put into motion and the proper phone calls were made, expecting to start the festivities around 8pm. The night started out like every Thursday at the frat house with heavy drinking. Evan Williams being the drink of choice for a poor fraternity man. One half gallon and 5 hours later, our mutual hippie friend finally shows up. We were a little frustrated and very intoxicated. This guy was known to have pretty weak doses, and even though the sheet we bought was overpriced, we still figured it was rubbish. So an 8th of a sheet of the most potent acid I'd ever done later, and one can imagine that I was out of my mind. I don't remember anything at this point, but I was told I was acting a little out of control. My friends kept me under control at the time, and locked me in my bunk around 3 am when I had calmed down enough to pass out. The alcohol no doubt had a dangerous impact on my consciousness, forcing my mind to black out at full RPM's tripping nuts. After a couple of hours I vaguely remembered ""awaking"" from my dream and entering a state of lucid dreaming, which happened to be a version of GTA: NCSU. I broke out of of the thin plywood encapsulating me, and proceeded to venture out into my ""dream world"" (but not before I smashed my laptop to smithereens.) I walked all over campus in the wee hours of Friday morning, crossing busy intersections with stopping or looking, and contemplating what my next move would be. I felt the sensation of wanting to drive a car more then anything, and this reoccurring thought led me to the parking deck on campus where students were arriving for their 8ams. I managed to find an open manual Jetta (after trying to open several cars in the lot.) I threw it into reverse, dropped the parking brake and coasted out of the spot, fully convinced that the car would drive if only I put enough thought into the situation. When the car stopped rolling. I had blocked the deck traffic. When a good samaritan left his idling truck to approach me and see if I needed help, I wandered over to his vehicle and hopped in. Driving the truck felt like the car was in hyperspace, I flew down a one way street and down a crowded campus road, over a four lane road, and then lost control and crashed into a utility pole. I was totally unharmed, the truck was destroyed, police were on the scene shortly after. I ditched when they arrived, purely in fight or flight mode, I sprinted down a neighbor street, and over a fence where I wound up in a briar patch with a police officer right behind me. He caught a hold of me and flung us both into the thorns, there was a struggle and eventually found myself atop of a badly cut up police officer, surrounded by thorns. It was terrifying. I was apprehended after I surrendered, and taken to the hospital and later jail where I stayed for 7 days, coming out of my daze the next day. I had to be put in isolation because I was actually freaking out the other inmates. Jail was horrible, the food was awful, I almost lost my mind. After getting my $260,000 bond reduced to $25k, I was released to an intense treatment center in North Carolina. After completing two months there I was transferred to a halfway house in Boca Raton, Florida for six months (also a terrible experience). My charges were reduced to 2 misdemeanors and a DWI. Currently I'm on probation, and work as as intern doing CAD modeling. I'm ready to start school in the Spring semester and have since stopped all substance use. 

Shit Happens. Like I said it's been one hell of a trip."

I got this job because I knew someone who worked there and they put in a good word for me.  I've been trying to find a job recently to fill the gap until my clearance goes through (or if I like it there, a place that I can work instead).  

My problem is that I have ZERO work experience.  I've had two internships fall through for various reasons, and have never worked anywhere in the computer programming field.  I've only worked retail and at a hotel.  I graduated top of my class in my computer science courses, but I still feel scared about the working world.

I'm a pretty quick learner though, so I'm fairly confident I can adapt to anything and learn what it is I need to do very quickly, but I don't know how to get my foot in the door.  

I'd like some suggestions as to what I need to do to get my first job in the computer programming world (what I should be searching for, who I should be talking to, etc), and I'd also like some advice regarding what to expect in the workplace.

I posted here a couple months ago, but I guess things are different.  I deleted that post.  Hopefully with this one I'll even get some feedback.  My mind is so full of stuff, as I write this one paragraph may be completely different than the next.

The question I'm trying to answer for myself is, ""Am I doing this right?""

So all I want is to just settle down.  Find a comfy place for myself and do what I want to do where I don't really have to worry about finances. The only way feel I can get to that is to find a full-time job for myself, where I'm able to depend on nobody but myself.  And I really don't know how to get there.  If I can do what I love doing without bothering anyone else or giving someone else problems, I'd be so happy.

So right now, I'm sooooooo sooo lucky my parents are taking care of me still and providing me with a place to live.  If I didn't have them, I would probably be dead by now.  I'm 25, almost 26 now.  I really hate that I still live with my parents and that I have to be financially dependent on them.  I do have a part-time job, but it's not enough to live on my own.

The part-time job I have now is so crappy I hate it.  I work as a server in a family owned indo-chinese restaurant.  I get really low pay.  And the restaurant is understaffed.  That means I have to work front of house by myself on weeknights sometimes.  The restaurant itself is actually doing really bad.  We just don't get a lot of customers.  I kind of know why, and kind of don't.  The location is really bad for the business and the service sucks.  If there's 5 tables that all walk in at the same time, and one person working the floor (me), you're just straight up going to get bad service.  There's no way I can handle seating customers, taking phone calls, bringing out food, attending to whatever thing you need (asking for more napkins/sauce/utensils), all by myself when it's that busy.  I feel like I'm not getting paid enough for what I'm doing.  I don't get paid tip, which is a good thing, because sometimes the restaurant is empty.  An hour can pass by with nothing happening.  And the customers we get, Indian, Pakistani, Middle-eastern, just don't believe in tipping.  For example, 2 dollar tip off a 30 dollar meal or you can give them perfect service sometimes and get 3 dollars off a 40 dollar meal.  My manager just doesn't want to hire more people because it's not busy and she's afraid of hiring people without experience because she things all high-schoolers are lazy bums who just do drugs (as a result of a server that worked there before I started who always came to work high).  So basically I'm doing the work of 4 people.  (Host - seats people, Cashier - answer phone for takeout, Server - takes food orders/serves food, Busboy - cleans tables/packs takeout).  It's so frustrating how poorly managed it is that I just don't give a crap anymore how well the business does, even though it's managed and owned by family friends.  I put up with it because it's the only job I have.  And honestly, it's not worth it, because it's a 45 minute drive for 4-5 hours of work where half the paycheck goes to gas.  I should really find another job somewhere, but don't know where.  I applied to jobs more locally, but no responses at all.

I finished college 2 years ago with a degree in materials science engineering from a prestigious university.  I haven't had any promising job prospects at all.  My GPA out of college was garbage, so it closed some doors for me - something I regret deeply.  But I'm trying my best to find a job in that field. I just honestly don't know how to get one.  I've had two interviews out of all the job applications I've filled out.  I haven't heard any feedback from the second one, but the second one was just weird for me because my classmate I graduated with was one of the people interviewing me. It was like we didn't know each other at all because he’s had a job for 2 years while I’ve had nothing.  It was as if he was a different, more mature, person (he had bad grades in college as well but he did get internship experience while he was in college, which is something I failed to get).
So this semester, I went back to grad school part-time.  So that’s part-time job and part-time school.  Because after 2 years of not really doing anything related to my major, I feel like my college education was going to be a waste.  College was so expensive, that I’m not going to let it go to waste.  I'm currently in grad school, just taking a couple grad classes.  I'm just doing this for two reasons, because hopefully it shows job companies that I'm still trying to remember everything I learned in school, and also if literally nothing happens jobwise, I can set myself up for grad school, still have to take the GRE and apply to grad school.  Grad school is so damn expensive.  I honestly just want to work and get a livable income.  And going to grad school without experience is dumb, because I don’t even know what I want to go to grad school for.

I want to stay in the hometown I'm in right now, but there just aren't any jobs for me here.  Not in my engineering field, I think.  I really wish I thought my college major through more.  I kind of just went to college because all my classmates went to college out of high school.  I didn't really know what I wanted to do with my life.  Well, I did have a plan, but I guess the path I took through college wasn't the right one to get to where I wanted to be.  Maybe it was a result of just bad advising or me not communicating what I wanted to do right to my advisors, or just not doing what I should’ve been doing.  I wanted to work for a medical device company, but the barrier for entry for those is just so high.  The reason why I wanted to was because my dad is a doctor, my mom is a nurse, and my older brother is about to finish his masters in respiratory therapy.  So that would’ve been cool.  I had quite a knack for putting things together from scratch by learning what each component did to make whole part, which is what got me into engineering.

I guess one of my personal problems is that I'm such an extremely shy person.  I'm so introverted and shy, it's really setting me back.  I've tried to break out of it, but it's so hard for me to ask for help.  I'm one of those people that would rather not do anything at all instead of put myself in a completely uncomfortable position.  I just die when I have to talk to someone else about something important.  Like if I had to call to ask about a job.  I just can't pick up the phone to do it.  I know it's setting me back too.  But I just honestly honestly need someone to hold my hand and make me feel comfortable when I make hard decisions or do things.  Or just plain straight tell me what to do, because I really don't know.  It's so terrible, I can't describe the feeling well.  I just literally have trouble talking and asking people for help.

So I guess I'm just depressed because I know where I want to be, but I have zero clue how to get there.  I’m surrounded by friends who have well paying full-time jobs at prestigious companies living by themselves and being able to afford whatever they want.  I know just having a full-time job won’t bring happiness, and I know despite those guys having a job, some of them aren’t happy because they don’t have time for the things they enjoy.  And I just don't know if what I'm doing is the right thing for myself.

If money weren’t an issue in life, I would just sit at home and read books all day.

To other people reading this, where I am right now might not seem so bad to them.  But it’s absolutely killing me.  I suffered severe bouts of depression in high school and college.  I think they're a result of me not know what to do with my life and committing to something.  They occurred both of my senior years, where I stayed at home depressed all day and missed class.  I did really poorly in high school because of it (I failed a class and missed my graduation with all my other classmates).  I dropped out of my senior year of college because I stayed at home depressed and was getting poor grades.  I also attempted suicide that year (which absolutely no one knows about) but I returned a year later to finish my degree.  I have zero suicidal thoughts now.  I think I ended up scaring myself to never try that again, it became something I never want to do again, hence no more suicidal thoughts.

I’ve been cutting out the things I enjoy one by one because I need to spend more time looking for a life-sustaining job and become independent of my parents.  One of my friends told me I’ve become a different completely person over the past 6 months.  I actually just straight cold stopped talking to a lot the people with whom I did hobbies with.  I simply just don’t enjoy doing the things I did before, and I find myself just sleeping a lot a lot instead thinking about what I can do to get a full-time job, which is making me even more depressed.  I realize it too, that if I cut out more of my hobbies and alienate more of my friends, then I’ll have nothing left.  But I want to feel like I’m doing something instead of sitting around at home looking like an unemployed lazy bum, but I don’t know what. If you've experienced depression, you just know that it feels like you have this dark cloud in your brain that makes it so hard to think and you're constantly tired.  I'm starting to feel that again.

That was a lot, I kind of let my mind flow freely and I guess that took 2-3 hours to write.  Tears started to flow out of my eyes as I was writing the paragraph about how shy/introverted I am.  Thanks for reading.  

I guess this is more of a cry for help than anything..."

We've been dating for 5 years, and 2 days before I left for my second year at college, she wanted to take a break. 

Background info: Prior to this year, I've had a year in London when everything was fine. We skyped everyday, where she would stay up till 4am, and it was going smoothly. When I returned back to Singapore 4 months ago I did an advertising internship, and she started her job as well, and we drifted apart slightly. Before she started her job she was finishing up college, which meant that she could stay up late to make up for the 7/8 hour time difference. But with her new job, thats not looking possible. Before my time in London she spent a further 2 years waiting for me when I was in National Service (Military), so I get the feeling she might be a little jaded.

The day before I left we had a talk, and she said that she still loved me, but that we should take a break to really do the things we never were allowed to do as a couple (we dated since we were 17). She also said that she might start seeing other people as well, and asked if I would ever forgive her if she did).

I've always thought that she was the one for me, and she's been a super girlfriend. I admit I might have taken it for granted that she would always been there, so this came as a bombshell. When I'm not physically around back home she does have alot of suitors, and lately they've been getting bolder, especially her colleagues at work. How do I remind her that I'm there but at the same time give her the space she needs?"

kvfzq,3,2011-09-29,I didn't need a dad anyway [TL;DR AHEAD],disposable_durp,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/kvfzq/i_didnt_need_a_dad_anyway_tldr_ahead/,"22 year old, female, recent college grad with a job and my shit together. 

There is so much tl;dr that I will summarize. My mom got pregnant with me in college. My bio-father abandoned me. I've talked to him 7 times since I was born. Five of those were recently, because I'm the only one who went to college. I met him in person once when I was 10. He told me to write him a letter. I did. Then I didn't hear from him for another 8 years. He has a ""real family"" and he doesn't want them to know about me. 

The man I consider my dad is an emotionally abusive asshole, but he was still in my life. He and my mom got married when I was 9. They got divorced shortly after I turned 18, but he still acts like my dad. We call each other every other week. When I was growing up, he used to terrorize me. He'd follow me around, calling me ugly, fat, dumb, etc. He told me that no boy could ever love me, that I couldn't possibly graduate high school and that I'd fail in the real world. Every morning before he left for PT, he'd knock my bedroom trash can across my room.Then he'd yell at me until I got out of bed to clean it up because I was such a pig to live in such filthy conditions. He had a vigorous schedule for when I was allowed to wash my clothes because he said if they weren't washed between 6-10PM, the energy costs would rise. I was in band and worked after school until 10:30 so I could rarely make it on time (he demanded that I get a job so I wouldn't be dependent on my family). If he caught me washing my clothes he'd take them out of the washer and throw them on the ground until they mildewed. I had to wear them to school like that. It might not come as a surprise that I was not popular back then.

Once a boy I liked came over. His mom called him to come home and help her do something. He told me he'd be right back. My dad came into the living room and ridiculed me for thinking this boy might like me. The boy came back and we finished the movie. Nothing happened between us, but I didn't dare make a move after all.

His family would put me down for not being Mexican and just talk shit about me in Spanish right in front of my face, and call my mom all kinds of names. They'd try to coax me into speaking Spanish with them and then make fun of me because I couldn't roll my r's. I stopped taking Spanish after high school because it made me feel deeply uncomfortable. 

My dad only hit me once, and he didn't beat me senseless or anything, he just punched me in the arm because I didn't know how to make a DVD of his family photos play on my grandma's broken DVD player. When my mom stuck up for me, he screamed at her about my bad behavior. She slept in the guest room that night and I heard him assault her from two rooms away. 

He told my mom to stop coming to my school events because if she went to my band concerts I'd just be a big baby ""sucking the tit for my whole life."" I tried to kill myself when I lived at home a number of times but I didn't want to die, I just wanted to leave that house. I have no aunts or uncles, and my grandparents were divorced and in abusive relationships themselves.

He used to get on my case because I was quiet and bookish and not athletic or attractive. Honestly, I have a bit of a durp face and a pudgy body. I'm only a couple of pounds overweight, but he made me feel like I was obese. He'd make me sit at the table while he read every name in our town newspaper's girl's softball ad. After every name he'd ask, ""Is this [my name]? No, it couldn't be, she's too fat for softball."" There were about 32 names. 

There where times where things weren't bad. Sometimes he'd take me out on his motorcycle and we'd go to the lake, just the two of us. We'd be sitting on a rock sharing a soda and he'd say things like, ""I'm proud of you, you're doing a good job. Never forget that you are my daughter."" When I graduated from college he threw my graduation party--an all-expense paid BBQ for my 15 closest friends. I couldn't believe he was doing all of that for me.

I got into a good college and supported myself the whole time. I got good grades, a prestigious internship, and an office job after graduation. My dad became more and more proud of me. My oldest stepsister got pregnant in high school, my stepbrother came out, and my youngest stepsister became a jerk and there was a rumor that she was slutty. My little (biological) sister, who is also not his biological child, was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. As these events unfolded he started liking me more because I never needed anything. I started to believe that all the things I'd buried in myself couldn't have really happened. The things I couldn't deny I convinced myself were just tough love. He just wanted me to be strong, I thought to myself. He can't show emotion and that's just the way he was brought up.

My dad has been with his girlfriend a year and a half and I found out yesterday that they are getting married next month. He wasn't going to invite me. I caught him in a lie about it. He tried to convince me not to go and said that it was a family event and very small and if I wanted to I could go but it's so much trouble yadda yadda yadda. I get along with his girlfriend--we've gotten coffee and hung out several times. I am completely crushed by this. I know I shouldn't care--my dad is a massive a-hole. Why should I? But I feel like once again, I don't matter. I'm an embarrassment. I'm nothing.

My friends and their families are so solid. I wish I had a dad that would love me no matter what, not just when he had no other options. I wish I was good enough for my dad. I wish I had a real dad. "
kvfk0,9,2011-09-29,I can't even think right now,somerandomname000,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kvfk0/i_cant_even_think_right_now/,"Hey everyone, just a random throwaway account, just need to get all this out somewhere. I don't even know where to go with myself right now. So far all of 2011 has just been a constant spiral downward. I've been out of school since fall '09, shortly after got 2 part time jobs to get some money while searching for a full time job. November last year I quit one of the jobs so I could just have a more free schedule, just more time in the week, and more time to put into full time job hunting.

The next month my family found out that my dad had brain cancer. For the rest of december going into the end of January, we did what we had to do with surgerys and everything. Then at the end of Jan. my dad went in for a big surgery, one to try and remove as much of the tumor as they could get. They got a lot, but he wasn't waking up. For the next month, he wasn't exactly in a coma, but pretty close. But he was able to get up from that, literally the day they were thinking of pulling the plug. Following that we went through the necessary psychical therapy and all, he had to stay in a hospital for another month. But in March he was able to come home, he still needed help with pretty much everything, but he was home. That lasted until April 12, when he passed away in his sleep.

Been trying to just keep going from there. I ended up getting an internship in the field I'm trying to get into, animation, worked my ass off up until this month when they said the company was let go and all the work done didn't matter.

So here I am now, one very shitty part time job, almost completely out of money. Still not even a part time job in the area will hire me. That and some problems I've been having with this girl I like, and this weekend I'm leaving for Florida to spread my Dad's ashes at sea. All that gave me, what I assume to be, my first major anxiety attack this past weekend. I was shaking intensely, my face started feeling numb, and the scariest part was my hands pretty much locked up into fists, and I couldn't open them.

Back at the house, it used to be me, my mom and dad, my sister, my dog, and my grandparents. My sister moved out last year to her own place the next town over, my grandparents moved out to different houses, and apparently now they're not doing too great, and my mom has been working more. So lately most of the time it's just been me and my dog around the house. And now I find out this week that my dogs been pretty sick lately, can't eat anything without throwing up, etc. My mom made an appointment for her at the vet today, I'm trying to be as hopeful as I can, but she seems pretty convinced that it might be time.

If anyone does even read this, sorry about being all over the place with this post, I can't really think straight right now. I just don't know what do to right now"

kv7e7,3,2011-09-29,Am I just a fool?,[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/kv7e7/am_i_just_a_fool/,"Preface:

I broke up with my girlfriend of 3 years about 4 months ago. I met her as soon as I started college, while I was on a distance relationship with another girl. Shortly after I met her, I broke up with my by then high-school girlfriend, and was devastated for months (i.e suicidal thoughts, depression, unmotivated, etc). Throughout all this time, the girl that I had met, my last ex, became good friends with me. She always spent time consoling me, buying me food/groceries, making me smile, and so on. During the few next months, I had become, as an effect of the break-up, a much bitter and moody person than before. I had always been a very joyful and jittery person; I used to laugh with anyone about anything silly, always have a smile on my face, and always be optimistic about everything. That part of me had vanished. As time passed, I overcame my high-school ex overtime. I matured. I faced it, and grew up from it.

Now, here begins the real story. The girl, let's call her X, that had taken care of me all this time, turns out, was in love with me. I had been blind to this fact for so long, since I was so deep in my own depression and bitterness to actually realize it. I started opening myself little by little to her. Over time, I accepted the end of my previous relationship and allowed myself a chance at love again. Turns out, she was everything I wanted in a girl. Self-less, caring, happy, pragmatic, innocent, and so on. Of course, she wasn't perfect. She was very high-maintenance, got jealous whenever I would speak with another girl, and mean/bitchy when I needed personal space. I decided that the good out-weighted the bad, and decided to ignore it. 

Fast-forward a year later, and we've been best friends. Note, we haven't dated, but for what it's worth, by this point we had. The only thing we hadn't done was have sex. Then, by nature and feelings, we had sex. We were both virgins at the time. It was truly a beautiful moment. Shortly after, I decided to ask her to be my girlfriend, and she accepted. 

Fast-forward half a year, and things start to turn bad. Her jealousy sparks even brighter colors than before, even when absolutely nothing had happened between other girls and I. And, please understand, I have never, ever had the urge to cheat. Flirt? Sure, sometimes, but very, very limited, and nothing serious/intentional. She insisted we talked on the phone multiple times a day, and texting? Constantly, and if I didn't answer a single one within 3-5 minutes, she would send a second one with reprimand. I grew tired, as this was affecting my sleep, time management (I am an Engineering student, and I was already struggling with time management myself), and persona. I decided I needed a break from the relationship. 

That break lasted about a week. And during that break, she kept sending me occasional text messages. Nothing was accomplished with this. But, trying to weight the good over the bad, we get back together.

Fast-forward half a year. Our first year together had ended. I had lost the sparks in our relationship because of these same issues I had with her. I wasn't perfect either; I was still moody from time to time, I didn't laugh as much as when she had met me, and I was generally anti-social from time to time. Turns out, even though I had moved on from my previous relationship, I was still hurt. It hurt that I couldn't see a way to fix things in my current relationship. So, I broke up with her.

The summer following this, she had changed. A lot. She had lost that innocent side of her. She met friends that changed her a lot, and she started frequenting parties, getting drunk, and loving being the center of attention in hopes of her forgetting about me. I understood the motive, but not the methods. I felt genuinely sad. 

Turns out, she had made out with a few guys over this time. Had sex with one of them (she promises me she was given a lot to drink and she wasn't willing, but to this day she still talks with the guy with ONLY slight disdain, and are Facebook friends, etc, so I have reasons to not believe her on this), and had generally changed. But, I realized over the summer how much I missed her. I needed her back in my life, and I did not care what she had done or might have become. I needed her.

So, I basically beg to get back with her at the start of my junior year (last year). A month or so later, we are back together. I am extremely happy to be with her again, and so is she. However, I meet her new friends. They are nice people, but their life-styles don't exactly go hand in hand with mine. But, I give in and try her new interests. I try hard, but realize it's not exactly what I want in my life. Even so, I stick with her. She cares for me, the sex is great, and we can't leave each other alone.

...but as before, the same problems arise. And I discover day by day new sides of her. Turns out, this time, she really, really desired sex much more than before. We had several discussions about it, and she ends up admitting that she still feels insecure with me, i.e I might love another girl, etc. I assure her that this is not the case, but that I am afraid that she is not the person I once knew. 

Fast-forward last semester. She feels the need to break up with me right before summer, as she doesn't want a distance relationship, and the sex was too scarce for her (our current pace was 1-2 biweekly, she wanted more than once weekly, which in this case this may have been me at fault, perhaps not, I'll read you guy's comments). I am devastated. But I still try to understand. During the summer, she is in an internship. I talk with her almost daily. She sometimes comes back to campus (where I was taking a summer class) to hang out with friends and sometimes with me. 

Fast-forward to this semester... I feel she leads me on. She sleeps with me. We have sex. No compromise, though. She doesn't want to be together. A few weeks ago, I find out she's been seeing a guy. Dating? Maybe not. Fucking? Yes. How long had this happened before we were still having sex or spending a lot of time together? Not sure. 

Last weekend, she tells me it's official, they're going out. When did it become official? I'm not sure.

Reddit, I don't know. I don't know if I should hate her. Am I a fool for thinking there's still some hope in the future? She tells me there is. But that I shouldn't stop because of her. 

But even if I want to move on, it hurts me to see her. To talk with her. And what hurts the most is that to this day, she still takes care of me when I am sick, lonely, etc. It really makes it hard for me to hate her, because I love her. But the pain is too much.

Anyway, I have a class soon, so I have to cut this short. I will update this later, and if you managed to read this far, I'd love any advise or comment you may have on this. And, even if you don't..., well, I guess I feel better that I've been at least able to put these feelings into words. "

kuyjr,4,2011-09-29,"I want you back, but you've moved on.",Police_Ataque,UnsentLetters,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/kuyjr/i_want_you_back_but_youve_moved_on/,"I know that in the past I have had trouble communicating with you.  I know that I’ve had trouble talking to you about problems I’ve had in our relationship and in my life.  So I want to have an open discussion with you about how I’m feeling, and what I want from my life.

I love you.  This is something that almost goes without saying at this point.  The profound effect you have had on my life in the time I have known you is beyond remarkable.  Being with you brought me joy that I didn’t know was possible, and confidence beyond anything I have ever known.  I’ve walked on flaming coals, jumped out of planes, won championships, and conquered fears.  None of these gave me even a fraction of the confidence I felt with you in my life.  Knowing you were there, feeling this same love that I felt for you, made me feel like nothing could break me, and nothing could stop me.  Seeing you smile, hearing you laugh, kissing you goodbye every morning before work, these were the reasons I loved you so much.  You have good heart, K.  The way you talk about your family and the way you cherish them makes me proud, in so many ways.  You would bend over backwards just to make them safe and happy.  In many ways, this was the love you offered to me.

Relationships are difficult to manage, in many ways.  I made many mistakes in the relationship, the first of which was my inability to prioritize you in my life.  I often think I can have it all in my life.  The loving girlfriend, the great friends, a successful career, a successful soccer season, and time to myself at the end of the day.  But there are only so many hours in the day.  And my hubris was too great.  I believed that I was smart and quick enough to only devote a little bit of time to each of these things on a given day, and still manage to tend to them all effectively.  But this was foolish.  Life is about sacrifices, especially when it comes to how we spend our time.  And what was sacrificed most was the time we spent together.  In my effort to maintain relationships with both you and with my friends, I often tried to combine the two pursuits, not realizing the toll this took on you, and the toll it took on our relationship.  We drifted apart, lacking time spent getting to know each other one-on-one.  Without that time, our lives diverged, and you resented me for it, and rightfully so.  I pushed you away foolishly, feeling as though you demanded too much of me.  And things spiraled from there.

As we drifted, I began to think of what the future should look like.  I wondered, only to myself, if perhaps I would have to continue on alone.  If I would have to move to Seattle, or DC, or San Diego, to discover my own path.  I didn’t know what to do.  And I felt as though I couldn’t talk to you without hurting you.  And in that moment, that lack of communication was my biggest mistake.  Every time we talked about our future, I was wracked with my own private battle.  I put off the decision continually, not knowing what I wanted or what I should do.  I wanted to talk to you, but I didn’t know how.  So I put it off, again and again.  I wanted a future with you, but I felt like I might be too young and foolish to commit to something in that moment.  At the time, I was right.

This crippling fear of change expanded into other areas.  I wanted to leave my job, but I didn’t know how.  I wanted to leave Tucson, but I didn’t know how.  I wanted to break free of my dad’s safety net, but I still didn’t know how.  I felt like a dumb kid who had been hit in the face with all of life’s choices at once without a clue of how to solve them.  I decided to avoid the problem.  One more summer couldn’t hurt, right?  One more summer of irresponsibility, coasting at an easy job while I played one last season of soccer before I inevitably had to leave.  I neglected to consider the fact that I would need to plan these decisions.  I hemorrhaged money, failing to plan for the possibility that soon we would be moving.  Failing to consider the costs of this expedition, and failing to consider the fact that you needed me to consider these costs in order to realistically plan our next step. What I was trying to do was run a marathon without having so much as jogged in the last couple of months.  I let my life decay, hoping that one day I could wake up and go, and everything would be fine.  You knew better, and you called upon me to help you plan the next step.  I was stubborn, and like everything else, I put it off, again and again.  I failed to face my problems and let them build up, until they became enormous.

So what?  At the end of all of this, why should you care?  You are more than aware of the problems we had, and why things fell apart.  It’s true, I’ve rehashed them more than a few times between then and now.

The point is, things have changed.  Or at least, they are changing.  That dead-end job is gone.  I am leaving Tucson, as are you.  I have a reasonably stable financial cushion to leave my life in Tucson, and start a new one elsewhere, as well as a few decent job prospects.  I have a bit more pain in my heart, which has only helped me develop strength and wisdom.  But more importantly I have perspective.  I recognize my mistakes.  They were the mistakes of youth, in my opinion.  I say this because I expect more of myself, as a man.  Becoming a man is a process, and in most cases a process requires a catalyst.  A process as monumental as this requires a strong catalyst.  And in my case, the catalyst was losing the girl I love.  That’s not to say that you left, and I immediately changed my act.  I looked for refuge in many places, trying to make myself happy with quick fixes.  None of it worked.  So I took a step back, and looked at my life, and asked myself why I had been unhappy for so long, and what I could do to fix it.  Why did I have trouble in relationships, and why did I always feel so helpless?  Through wise words from friends, family, and counselors alike, I discovered that the root of my problems came from the fact that I had trouble getting up and solving problems in my life.  I opted not to communicate with people when I had issues with them, I chose to spend extra money rather than planning efficient ways to solve problems, and I let myself settle for coasting in a job and a city that I wasn’t happy in.  And I recognized that many of these problems were identical to the root causes of our breakup.  So I resolved that the next thing to do was to start solving those problems.  The only thing to do to be happy, and to have healthy relationships (romantic, friendly, work, family, etc.) was to take responsibility for those issues, and grow up.  I had to work towards being a man, rather than a boy.  I didn’t have to give up my idealistic spirit or my naive view of the goodness of people, I just had to actively work to make myself a productive, functioning member of society as an adult, rather than a child.
I started throwing my resume to any appealing job that it would stick to.  And one of the places it landed with the biggest, most appealing splash, was San Diego.  This job provided more opportunities than I could think of.  First, it was a decent legal internship through a San Diego legend who could probably get my foot in the door with a number of other opportunities down the line.  Second, it was close to you.  And I think that second part appealed to me more than I was willing to admit, publicly or to myself.  It provided a second chance at a future I had squandered, and I got to thinking.  I started thinking about a realistic future with you again.  I started thinking about an apartment or a small house a short distance from the beach.  I started thinking about you and me, walking Jack along the boardwalk in the mornings and the evenings, about a small windowsill garden with a couple of big sunflowers posted on the window by the kitchen.  I started dreaming of a future together.  Maybe not the healthiest thing for a guy who had just broken up with you.  But I started thinking, nonetheless.

So here we are.  I don’t know how I will spend the next few years of my life, whether that will be in law school or grad school, or finding another job that makes me happy until I figure out the long-term plan.  There’s a lot of discovery between now and then.  What I do know right now is that I am a man-in-progress, a boy taking realistic steps to promote himself to adulthood.  In the time since I left Apple, I have saved up a small chunk of money for the transition, about $2000 to start a new life somewhere.  In my heart, I know how I would like to spend that money.  I would love to spend it relocating to California, just an hour from where you are, to start a new relationship with you.  And I’m not talking about “starting where we left off”.  Because where we left off didn’t work.  That’s why you left, and that’s why we’re here now.  I’m talking about a new relationship, built on open communication between two young adults who are discovering what it means to be newly adult, and who are ready to see what life without safety nets means. I want a relationship with realistic priorities, where I can manage my time with you set as my first priority, in line with the way I feel about you.  We’re not talking about massive character changes or personality shifts.  Because our good character and our caring personalities are what attracted us to each other in the first place.  We are talking about growing up.  And I have begun that process, and I intend to continue with it, regardless of what happens with us.  I hope that you will join me as I take the next steps to become the man I want to be, because I know that man is a strong one who will make you happy.  More importantly, I want to be there to see the woman you become.

This is how I feel.  This is what I want.  And more importantly, this is what I have to done to get there so far, and what I will do to get the rest of the way.  I hope you are there with me to see the end result, because frankly, I think it will be pretty awesome.

There is this guy. We met my freshman year of college (now we're both seniors) and we have had a very very long and dramatic history. 

Freshman year: I am dating (not officially) this guy from home (a rather fucked up, abusive relationship... details of which are not relevant here) but this guy (lets call him S) and I are hooking up. I start to develop feelings for S and finally break up with this asshole I was dating. 
S and I hook up, but he is clearly not wanting a relationship. I move on, date another guy. 

Sophmore year: I'm single. S and I are hanging out, not hooking up. I am at this moment struggling with an eating disorder, which S is the only one I have confided in. He convinces me to get the help I need. I realize he is honestly a good friend. 
Later in sophomore year, I meet a guy... we start dating. After a few months, we break up. 
S confides he has feeling for me. We begin to date 

Now it is summer after sophomore year. I am staying at school for an internship, S lives only 4 hours away. We are not official... he says he does not want to try a long distance relationship; is worried it might tear us apart. He repeatedly says that ""we are not official, you can do whatever you want."" 
That summer, I hookup with a friend of mine (not sex, just clarifying). 
I tell S about this. He gets mad. Says he doesn't know what to make of it. Wants a break. 
A few weeks later, S calls me. He has met someone. Some girl from home. Another few weeks later, they are dating. I am heartbroken. I only kissed my friend b/c I felt like I would seem to clingy to S if I did not heed his advice of ""do whatever you want."" 

Junior year: S is dating his gf from the summer (the long distance relationship he never wanted with me...) S and I are still hanging out, he starts to admit he has feelings for me. He says he wants to be with me but is afraid of me leaving (quite literally, I am leaving for NZ to study abroad for the spring semester). He and I end up hooking up numerous times (never sex, but everything but.) He still has a Gf. He promises me he is going to break up with her. He never does. 

I go to New Zealand (second semester junior year) and meet an amazing guy who treats me right, who never strayed and made me oh-so-happy. I no longer have feelings for S. NZ boy and I don't work out b/c I have to come back to the states, and we are at different stages in our lives. However, that does not denote what I felt for him while there. 

I am now back at school (my senior year) and S and I are hanging out. He one night tells me he is breaking up with his GF. I say likely story. He says, ""no, I want to be with you. I fucked up before. She is out of the country doing service right now but she comes back thursday (tomorrow) and I am breaking up with her.""

I told him that he would have to prove himself, earn my trust and earn the right to be with me. I am not about to give myself up to getting hurt again. Or end up doing something I regret (like being the other woman... I regret that so much. I was too wrapped up in my own emotions. I feel terrible about that) 
He said he will do whatever it takes. He seems different now, more open and honest.

We're close friends... but our friendship was never normal/platonic. It makes this more confusing. 

My close friends say to fuck him, that I deserve better. But I don't know. I think I will regret not giving him the chance to prove himself, to finally fight for me like he never did before. 
There is something about us, about him and me, we never stay apart for long. It has been 3 years of off and on... what if it is meant to be? 

What if it isn't? 
I'm just curious to hear strangers' opinions. People who don't know me. Everyone else is too close to the situation. 

Thanks for reading this saga.....so tell me, TwoX, what do you think? "

kuv8u,2,2011-09-28,lack of a computer/girl rant,[deleted],rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/kuv8u/lack_of_a_computergirl_rant/,"So, I probably have a gaming problem (I probably use games as an escape), but I'll go ahead and explain my situation and my frustration.

I've had a school-issued laptop for a long while, about three years. It plays games well, but not great. I had a gaming PC of my own for two of those years, but it broke down last October. I sold it for parts to my best friend (works in IT, loves working with computers) for about 300 dollars so that I could make rent one month.. I just recently had to return the laptop because i'm taking a semester off from school to get my finances in order. So, now I have no gaming rig or laptop to use.

I told my good friend that I plan to pay him back for the computer he bought off me, if we could get it running again. He told me he had spare parts we could use to test which parts failed (his bro had the same setup, but just upgraded). We were unsuccessful, and the computer remains in pieces. I need about $106 to get it running again, but I work for my dad, and I don't necessarily get a paycheck. It's basically the communist system. We cover the biggest part of the income and support the rest of the family. Oh, and I also owe my friend's dad about 60 more hours of labor for the car he sold me.

I mentioned to him that I have freelance work to get going on, of which I can't do on my mom's or dad's computers (they don't have the programs or can't run them), but he doesn't seem to want to cough up the back-pay for my computer parts. So then, I emailed a client and asked them for an advance, but I haven't heard back yet. I also owe my cousin $100 dollars in rent.

So basically, I have no hope for a computer within the next month or so. I haven't played a game in three weeks. I have a really close friend that I talk to primarily on Steam and play games with regularly. We talk about life and love and our music production and everything. I miss him dearly. 

I move back and fourth every few months between two places (home and school) which are separated by a four hour drive. This basically prevents me from meeting girls, deciding if they're right for me, working up the courage to ask them out, dealing with rejection, finding another one, building up enough trust and passion to move back home for a few months and also keeping it going, etc. Within those few months that I'm in one place, it's just impossible for me, with an introversion, to start a long-term relationship. I've tried the long distance stuff before, but I'm never satisfied enough with talk and text. Humans yield to their primal side and demand a physical side to romantic relationships!

I know that I should try to get another job, but I don't know if I would be able to handle it. I get so little sleep as it is, and I work for my dad 9-5or6 weekdays.

I need a way to tell my dad that I need this money to get my freelance jobs started again. 

I need to figure out what I need to do to be in a position where I have enough time to start a long-lasting relationship with someone. 

I need to find an architecture internship once I start school in January, and fast.

Is this the death of my gaming career, or will I still be able to keep it as at least a hobby?

Have I doomed myself into being forever alone?

Is there any advice you could give me?"

I'm thinking about joining the Airforce, Navy, Coast Guard, or Air National Guard. My primary concerns are: I have another 2 years of college left before I can obtain my BS, and I would perfer to serve in the reserve (part-time) during that period. And,  I'd hope to postpone my BCT so I don't have to leave school for a quarter to train (It's OK if I cannot). I'm also thinking about getting a PHD in engineering and becoming a faculty at some later dates in life.

As for the reason I want to join. I think I'm too sheltered and not independent enough. The only real job I had was working in a deli during my highschool for a few months. My parents are super friendly, great relationship and  are willing to pay for all of my tuitions, but I really loath that idea. I think I will miss out a lot if I just march into the road that most sensible people will pick, which is get an intern, then get my BS, work for some firm while getting a phd, then become a faculty. I also have a strong desire to be competent and deciplined.

Personality wise,  I can be impulsive at times, and do not take orders well unless it can be justfied;   which I believe will be a challenge while serving. I do not have any depression problems, excise regularly and are decent at managing my time and school.

That being said, what are my best choice in gaining the most out of my tuition help? What job would be right for me? I'm interested in Cyberspace securtiy, high tech gadgets, programming(so not much debugging, but who does), blowing things up as long as I don't hurt anyone while doing so. I don't mind getting my hands dirty; like to fix things up; like to swim and travel around, A LOT."

We used to get out of the bus at the same stop, and I wanted to start a conversation with her.
Though most of the time she's with a friend (sister maybe?) So I'm kinda scared I guess...

But I have internship till begin January so I can't get out at the same stop to talk to her. 
And I really don't feel like starting a convo with 2 of my friends around and in a really busy bus.

So whenever I see her being alone, or atleast when my friends arent around I should start talking to her.

Of course I asked her for a letter of recommendation which she wrote for me.  I did waive my right to look at it, but she requested that I look at it anyways.  It seemed fairly generic.  So and so was a great intern, he watched a lot of court proceedings, he read the material I gave him.  It definitely was positive, but just very bland.  I come across as just another guy.  Is this a good letter to include or will it make me look average?  Am I being immoral by looking at it?"

kwtkv,16,2011-09-30,The Mail,kmlweather,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/kwtkv/the_mail/,"***This is no ghost story - it's just one of those ones that is a real ""WTF"" moment. Read on - it's a long read***

I often make trips to the local post office for my father who runs a mail order business from our basement. Every other day consists of the same routine of sorting all of the packages into piles depending on what class of service they are mailing by, and then taking them right out of the neighborhood to the closest post office. My dad has used this post office since my parents moved here in the 80s…so all of the clerks know who we are. 

A few weeks ago our mail stopped showing up at our house. It’s normal for us to have a day or two where we only receive those dumb coupon mailers but I can’t remember another time when we did not receive mail for 3 or 4 days straight. My dad told me on the fourth day to ask about it when I made me near daily visit to the post office that day. 
I drove out to the post office with the normal volume of packages in tow and I waited in line just like I always have. They were understaffed on this day and one of the managers was working at the counter. His name is Simon and he’s a nice fellow who always asks me how school is going and he’s always very personal. When he was done ringing up the total I asked if our mail carrier had changed or maybe there was some kind of other screw up in the system. Simon went back into the back part of the post office while I waited at the counter. A few minutes later he came back with a copy of the form you have to fill out when you get mail forwarded to a new address. He told me that one of the other clerks remembered an older man coming in a few days before and filling out the form. I asked what the person looked like and then questioned why they would let such an order go through given our long history of using this post office. He said that the clerk responsible remembered the person providing proper proof of residency and claiming to be a visiting relative. Well shit…who could that be? Even weirder is that the address for the mail to be forwarded to was our next door neighbor’s house. 

Confused as hell I made the short drive back home and told my dad what Simon had told me. My dad was just as confused. We don’t’ see our neighbors that much and their driveway is much longer than all of the other driveways in the neighborhood. Most of the houses are pretty close to the street but this one sits a decent ways back into the woods – still it’s a typical suburban neighborhood except our street backs up into the local park (lots of wooded area in there). My dad had spoken to the couple in that house many times over the years but ever since a small dispute about a tree between our properties we have been out of touch. 

Not wanting to touch off a physical altercation, my dad found their phone number and called. Naturally, the line was out of service…so they had changed their number somewhere along the way. 
It was just prior to dinner at this point and my dad and I told my mom that we’d be back in a few minutes. My dad wanted to go over there to see if anybody was home. It was apparent as we walked up the long driveway that they had not been there in a few months. Still, the house was left in good condition as if they had simply taken a break from it or something. We walked up the tall concrete stairs that led from the driveway to their front door and rang the doorbell. No ring. So we knocked. After a few minutes we knocked again – still nothing. Assuming that they had gone on a long vacation we gave up for the night having had none of our questions answered. 

Coincidentally, the next day as I was pulling back into the driveway on my way back from classes I noticed our neighbor’s white SUV parked near their mailbox and the man was unlocking his mailbox (they bolt it when they go away for long periods). I parked and texted my dad inside to come outside because he was back from vacation. 

We had a nice conversation (he and his wife had gone to Costa Rica to look at property there). The topic quickly came to the subject of our missing mail. He genuinely had no idea what we were talking about (this guy is pretty nice except for that one argument we had with him). His wife was still in Costa Rica and would be arriving home in a few days. We all kind of shrugged off the whole tree incident from a while back and he invited us to come up to the house for coffee or tea. We walked up the driveway while he parked his car and accompanied him to the front door. 

He opened the door and immediately paused. There was trash everywhere inside and lots of discarded banana peels scattered about. As we walked around it became apparent that somebody had been residing in their house while they had been away. One of the windows facing the woods had been forced open (old house with old locks). From the amount of garbage present, it was clear that this person had been here for quite some time. I used to intern with the police department around here and knew that we probably shouldn’t touch anything if at all possible. The whole thing was kind of creepy…we left and called the cops. 

Since it was not an emergency call the cops took about an hour and a half to show up and take a report. They wanted to clear the rest of the house and we were told to wait outside on the driveway. About ten minutes later they came out another door of the house with a bunch of boxes. One of the boxes had ALL of our mail from those missed mail days. It had all been opened and some of the contents were clearly missing. There were also photos of our house and a few other houses on the block. No rhyme or reason to why the houses pictured were selected. The cops looked through the photos and boxes and then took them in for evidence. Meanwhile, a few other cops checked around the houses that were in the photos. 

I won’t lie to you – this isn’t a ghost story or anything but it just gives me the creeps – especially knowing that this creeper is still out there (though no sign that he has been back). The cops had identified a picture and found evidence of somebody lingering right outside the windows of the room where our main home computer is. (There are two windows in that room on the main level of the house with some bushes slightly away from the exterior wall). A few cigarette butts were also found. This guy had been creeping it up RIGHT outside the fucking window where I spend most of my time (computer room). I’m literally in that room from the time I get home until dinner and then from like 9pm until I go to sleep. 

Since it wasn’t a case of assault or any type of violent crime, the cops really can’t do anything but keep an eye out for more suspicious activity…it just makes you feel so vulnerable knowing that some dude was outside within feet of where I was sitting just watching me. He better not have been fapping or something. Ugh.

kwr73,3,2011-09-30,Started hanging out with a girl that is new in town. Need advice.,IceBlue,dating,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/kwr73/started_hanging_out_with_a_girl_that_is_new_in/,"I met her through the training I'm in. She joined last week but dropped out due to getting into an internship more related to her field. She's new in town so has no friends and suggested we hang out. We went drinking on Saturday. Yesterday we had dinner (I paid, though she felt bad and said we could have gone dutch) and went to this monthly block party thing in town (and got some dessert while we were there).

Anyways, I suck at flirting and don't have too much experience dating. From the beginning I've had the concern that since she's new in town she may just want to make new friends rather than get in a relationship. I keep getting that feeling but I don't know if it's just in my head (I tend to overanalyze things so I can't tell what is a sign and what is just in my head).

I feel mostly inclined to just play it cool and continue just being friends (maybe with casual flirting) and show her around town but I'm starting to really like her and I'm afraid of getting stuck in an awkward position in the future (like losing her interest in even being friends by making a move too early). The tough part is once I start liking a girl, I can get pretty anxious and awkward.

What should I do (or not do)?"

I will take that for what it's worth. Assess my strengths and weaknesses and move forward to a placement in an agency where I do fit. I have been assured that this  will have no bearing on my grade or my ability to graduate in May. But it sucks none the less. That said, despite the shittiest day since quitting smoking, I have not had an urge to smoke. I did have a dream the other night where I did buy a pack of cigarettes so I could just smoke one to ease the stress of my internship and it crashing and burning. But even in my dream i stopped myself from smoking it. I thought about how disapointed my girlfriend would be if I smoked. I thought about how I would have to come on here and have my days turned back to zero and start over. I thought about how if I started again I could never stop this time. Most of all I thought that if I did start smoking how I could never live with myself for failing there as well.

I should have a new internship sometime next week and I will remain smoke free for over 7 weeks by then.  The world did not crash around me.  This has been a learning and growing experience for me. I have no doubts I will be successful in both endeavors in the future."
kwqho,9,2011-09-30,Scholarship essay contest for price of attendance? ,venustas,redditcon,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditcon/comments/kwqho/scholarship_essay_contest_for_price_of_attendance/,"I am one of the many people on reddit that is in college, and I would want nothing more than to be able to attend the hypothetical redditcon. However, I'm living on ramen, and I live in the middle of nowhere. I'm crossing my fingers that the location is somewhere moderately close to me so I can at least fantasize about going, but being honest, every one of the top choices are so far from me, I'd have to fly. 

So here's a fleeting thought for consideration. What if an essay or some other kind of contest was held for college-age redditors without means to make it to the convention. The winner, or collection of winners, would get a plane ticket and lodging in the city the con is being held? It can be accomplished in several different ways. One, the registration fee for the convention could have 10% go towards this fund, two: donations from redditors that want to see the youth of the site flourish, or if reddit has the funds as a corporation, they could sponsor someone out of the kindness of their hearts. 

I'm not suggesting this because I want to make it easier for me to attend, but just having the opportunity would make me happy even if I didn't win. 

**Edit:** Another thought, what about giving college students the opportunity to work for their attendance? Let a few of them do all the heavy lifting and file sorting the convention will invariably have in exchange for their airfare and lodging? Like an internship, but without the job experience. Unless they're going into convention management... "

I have finally just secured my first full time salaried job after graduating three years ago and doing internships for the last two years. I just got my first paycheck, and most of it will go to pay down only a fraction of my credit card balance. However, I will have enough left over to send 1, maybe 2 people to NYC. I found tickets for $75 one way as soon as Monday, but I'd like to find someone as soon as possible and get you there possibly as soon as mid next week. The protests have gained some very important momentum in the last few days, and needs to continue. I have been unemployed since March, and became very discouraged this summer and returned to Chicago after spending a year in DC trying to make it in the public policy realm. I've taken a job that has nothing to do with my studies, or where I hoped to see myself. But I am grateful to have a job, and am very nervous about the ""double dip"". 

The recession has had a tremendous impact on young Americans, who I can relate with the most. I don't want to make restrictions, but I would prefer to send someone who is either a recent college grad, or someone else who has had difficulty finding employment. I also hope that you can stay for at least a few days.

My only stipulation is that I will pay for your transportation there, but lodging and a way back are totally on you. I do have a nice warm Marmot sleeping bag you can have if you need. 

Please write a brief description and we'll get in touch. I wish I could go, but I really need to focus on starting my new job. Say hello to the JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs and the Koch Brothers for me."

- I'm in the CO-OP program, doing my second rotation now, and I'm doing my last one next summer.

- I'm interested in signal processing/networking/telecomm. I'd like to go to graduate school (top choices: Stanford, MIT, Berkeley, CalTech, oh and Tech of course)

- I can graduate in 4 years, but I feel like I won't have done enough in these last 2 years to make myself stand out on a grad school application (which is really based on what I'll do in this next year since grad school apps are usually done during your senior year) or resume if I decide to go into industry (I think it'd be really cool to work at Qualcomm or Cisco).

kwi9g,4,2011-09-30,"So scared. My mind is all over the place. Overwhelming guilt and rumination, college plan/life feeling in shambles. Any kind words appreciated. ",[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kwi9g/so_scared_my_mind_is_all_over_the_place/,"Reddit, I'm desperate. 

I'm a HS graduate of 2009. I had a 3.4 Honors Diploma, 2100 SATs, 33 ACTs, and I'm an Eagle Scout.  I played baseball basketball and football, and had the leads in the plays my junior and sr year. My dad had me playing baseball my entire life, and wanted me to play in college, but I finally put my foot down and told him i'd only been playing in all the travel teams and going to college showcases and such to appease him, as it was never a real passion of mine.  At the end of my high school career, I was still completely disillusioned by the realities of the real world. College was just ""the next step"", and my parents had been insisting forever that it's ""the only way to make anything of yourself"" ""get anywhere in life"" etc etc.

When I graduated HS, my house was completely dysfunctional. My sister has a severe eating disorder, was stealing all of the time, and my parents would get in huge fights with me about ANYTHING I did, even if I told them/got their permission. My gf of a year and a half cheated on me with a close friend of mine, and some random guy at a beach within a week of each other after 18 months of me sticking with her, even though we couldn't have sex because of vaginismus (which she refused to get checked out by a gyno...). At the time, I was in love with her, and it was soul crushing. It was also very weird for me because he was in my core social circle and all of my other friends kept hanging out with him.

My parents only let me apply to state schools and schools in Boston (since that's where my dad went to college). Like I said, I was completely disillusioned by the realities of the real world, and was never thinking of college as furthering my career, or gaining experience in a field that I would want to go into.  It was ""the next necessary step"".  To me, it was escape from my neurotic mother who has worked at home since I was in 5th grade and only gets out of the house to shop and get groceries (she has no social life) which kept any issues with my dad or her work in the home, which was very stressful.

When I applied to colleges, I didn't look at programs of study, or the classes that different degrees would require, or think about what I wanted to do or any of that. I know it's ""uncommon"" for undergraduates to ""know"" what they want to do until they're done with college, but that baffles me. I literally just applied to the schools in my state and the couple in Boston.

I got accepted at a school in Boston and went and did my freshman year there. No scholarships, but my parents have had the money set aside for college for a long time (I realize how fortunate I am), so I took them up on the offer for out of state, because I would have ""had to live at home"" for these other schools. I fell in love with a girl on my floor somehow while still aching from the pain of my cheating ex.  My parents insisted that I get a job up there as well, which I did, serving at a local music venue.  I did OKAY freshman year, well... not super.  I got C's and B's, a 2.6.  

Over the summer I talked my way into an internship at a defense contractor.  I got lucky too, my gf had an internship nearby, even though she was from way out of state. At the insistence of my father, when I went back to Boston the next semester, I decided to transfer into the business school and declare a business major. My life started to fall apart right around here.

I was diagnosed with MDD at 15 and had been on antidepressants until I graduated from HS.  At the end of HS I spoke with my psych and decided to wean off them to see if I could function without them.  I had brain zaps and was irritable the whole summer, but I chalked the irritability up to being irked about my gf and my parents. When I got to school I seemed okay, but there were times I got extremely anxious. I managed though.  I've never been one to drink, ever, but college drinking sucked me in, and my gf being a bit of a boozer didn't help.

So back to last fall. I was walking around feeling sort of out of it for a few days and wondering what was wrong with me. Then, looking in the mirror one morning, I noticed I looked really thin.  I'm 6'5"" and should weigh 200 at my lowest; I weighed 185.  Holy shit, I thought, I'm depressed. I called my pysch back home and talked with him, he said I was right and should start taking my medication again.

Here's where my life and mind got really turned upside down.  I started taking the medication again, and suddenly, I was horrified by what I was doing.  I realized I'd spent the last year and a half, and a TON of my parents money, working towards nothing in particular, barely ""learning"" anything even though I was passing classes, and not working in any way towards a career.  I felt like I was just there for the piece of paper that said ""I did it!"".  Not only that, but I began to feel like everything I was doing wasn't my choice.  Like my major, the schools I had applied to, etc.

I went home over thanksgiving break and told my parents I wanted to take some time off from the university and take classes at the local community college, in music theory and an instrument. They were a bit shocked I think, but supportive, at least in theory.  I remember being haunted for a couple weeks by a memory of asking my parents to take music lessons when I was younger, but being told we were already spending enough money on sports equipment.  

came home after the fall semester ended, excited to be saving them money and feeling like I was finally doing something for myself. It was a very hard decision as I'd be leaving my gf up in Boston and I had grown very attached to her.  

Back at home though, I started to think differently about her, very quickly.  I started thinking about how dependent on her I'd become, how I shouldn't have even met her in the first place since I didn't feel I should have picked that university just to get away from my family, and how I might not be going back, and how she would be going abroad next fall (this current semester), and how she was absolutely gorgeous, but a sorority girl and a drinker, and how much temptation there would be at her mixers with the frats, and encouragement from her sorority sisters to cheat (these aren't assumptions, I know a lot of these girls and they way they talk and treat their relationships... it's sad really).  So I broke up with her, citing ""too young to be in love"", ""not knowing where I'm going and not wanting to hold you back"", and the inevitable breakdown that would come with the distance and uncertainty of us seeing each other again.  I can't explain how soul crushing this was for me, every word made me second guess myself, but I kept saying it.

I'm a finance major and philosophy minor. I have pretty good grades, I'm on track to graduate, and I've held an internship in three different finance-related firms every summer of school.  I don't want to do anything in finance. I appreciate the knowledge and don't mind the major, but it's definitely not where I see myself working.

Basically, I want to be an entrepreneur, but I feel like I should probably explain the term seeing as it can be meant broadly.  The word I've always used for it is just a business man.  I want to buy interests in companies, not market securities but actual ownership in small, private firms.  I want to manage companies, develop products and services.  Basically, I want to be fluid in my approach to a 'profession.'

My strategy to now has been as follows: form here, take my LSAT, graduate, get a job at a small start-up, get references/experience, go to a good law school, get a JD and weigh my options.  Like I said, I'm looking to go into business, and do not plan on practicing law.  This seemed like an ok route, and I've always been interested in law and would appreciate the knowledge.

What I'm wondering, though, if I should be weighing my options of some good business programs (presumably graduate) that would benefit me in this goal better.  My school has an entrepreneurship major but it's pretty much a joke.  I don't want to throw out entrepreneurship as a program because of that bias, or maybe you guys could show me something else I should be looking at.

tl;dr thinking about going to law school, but want to do business.  What are some top-notch business programs, entrepreneurial-esque, that I should check out?"
kw8ba,1,2011-09-30,I need inspiration.... ,thewoosh,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/kw8ba/i_need_inspiration/,"I have been going to school for computer science and have three years C++ experience from classes, side projects and one internship. I start a lot of projects and end up not finishing them. Like my chess program, maze generating program, and other random things I wanted to write. I want to keep challenging myself but I feel like by not completing my projects I'm not learning all that I can. So I'm asking you programming world. How the hell do you guys keep on track with your personal projects? What motivates you? What keeps your fingers on those keys?"
kw71a,5,2011-09-30,Hello! I'm about to start working with people 18-24 that come to a program to help people with Asperger's develop relationships. I need your help! ,[deleted],aspergers,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/kw71a/hello_im_about_to_start_working_with_people_1824/,"As the title says, I am starting this Tuesday a job where I will be helping people with Asperger's to develop social skills. Specifically, my title is a Social Thinking Instructor.

Few people have confided in me that they have been diagnosed with Asperger's in the course of me talking with them, so I feel a little on my heels. I'm not sure what to expect. The people I would be helping would be 18-24 year olds (I'm in my young 20's, myself) who came to our college internship program. Our goal is to take people with high functioning autism and Asperger's and give them what they need to find an internship and eventually employment. 

I'm wondering, do you have any recommendations for what would work best to teach social skills? My biggest fear is that I will come off as too patronizing and aloof. Is it more comforting to talk with people that know that it is awkward to talk to people sometime? The trick I've found is that it's about meeting the 20% of people who realize that the other 80% are the real awkward ones who tense up and don't know how to communicate with anything that seems different to them. 

Thank you everybody. It really is cool to be able to talk with so many unique people in so many different areas. Sometimes the internet is a great thing :)"
kw67o,2,2011-09-30,"Feeling down, not sure if this will help but it's worth a shot...",poly_outsider,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/kw67o/feeling_down_not_sure_if_this_will_help_but_its/,"So, it's a rather long shot, but I thought reddit might be able to cheer me up when it seems I have no one else to talk to.  Couldn't hurt, anyway, since this is a throwaway.  It's not suicidal or anything, and I wouldn't call it full blown depression...  It's also not organized, just a random mish-mash of words as they came out of my head.  Some of the names, places, schools, etc. have been changed to give me reasonable deniability. Anyway...

My life-long dream was to go to Caltech.  More than anything else in the world, and it's been that way since a *very* early age, around 4.  Everyone labeled me as smart, even though I don't really **feel**
 smart.  I'm passionate, and I've got a bit of talent in a few areas (programming, math), and everyone's labeled me as some genius.  The fact that I somehow stumbled my way into the valedictorian seat at my high school didn't help.  The pressure to live up to that label has been overwhelming at times, but it also brewed in me a misplaced sense of confidence, an unwavering knowledge that I'd get into Caltech, because as all my friends said, ""if anyone deserves to get in, it's you.""  When I was rejected in 2009, it crushed me.  What crushed me more was that I had not applied to any other colleges.  I spent a year of my life essentially wasted, with the only thing to show for it the fact that I managed to save up $5,000 from my day job.  The depression I slipped into due to a failed internship opportunity, my rejection, my failure to get an IB certified diploma (instead I got a certificate of completion, which only counts as a regular diploma), a verbally abusive boss (old conservative car mechanic, they're like that.) I let another year slip by only applying to one college again, Caltech.  You don't need to tell me how ridiculously stupid that was.  I was rejected a second time.  I decided, however, that with my $5000, I'd move to Pasadena (from Boston), and learn to live as an adult.  And that's what I did in September of last year.  It was incredibly invigorating, empowering even, to take control of my own life, to pay my own bills.  I was still working a mind-numbing, pointless day job in retail (Caltech bookstore, so it was at least somewhat interesting), but I wasn't wasting away my year as a vegetable in between groggily dragging myself to work.  I finished NaNoWriMo, remarkable for me since I never finish ANYTHING I start on.  I started the ""Open Problem Society"", a group of people (really just me and my friend from work, but I know how to market things) who got together weekly and worked on unsolved problems, not for a grade, not even for success, just to enjoy math and it's frustrations as recreation.  It was a blast.  Admission decisions day rolls around again, and I'm rejected from Caltech for a third time.  It was crushing, but not nearly as bad this time, because I had applied to other schools this time.  I ended up going with the [Top 10 engineering school], and started here one month ago.

I've felt like an outsider ever since.

My age gap makes it hard for me to relate to people as well here, it's a thin plastic film separating me from everyone else.  No matter how much I surround myself with new friends, I'm always aware of that film.    I don't feel like I belong here.  I don't feel like I'm home, something that I felt at the Caltech campus like I had never felt anywhere else.  I feel like I've stepped into someone else's life, or I'm in some terribly cheesy film from the Syfy (not SciFi, I liked them.  They had to go and change their name) channel where someone for some poorly explained pseudophysics gets transplanted into a different universe from the multiverse: Everything is *almost* right, but not quite.

Nothing drove this home harder than tonight, however.  A few days ago was the birthday of one of my new college friends.  We all hung out until midnight, and everyone sang him happy birthday right at midnight.  His best friends from back home called and wished him a happy birthday right at midnight.  Everyone made a generally big deal about it.  Tonight (today, I guess), was my 21st birthday (I don't drink, so no, I won't go drink away my sadness).  I got no phone call (first time in 8 years), and the group of people I was with didn't even notice, nor did they notice when 15 minutes later when I quietly let myself out of their room and went back to my room to spend the next half hour or so crying.  It's not as if I was sulking in the shadows, I was conversing with them, while they were playing cards.  Had one friend (birthday boy from a few nights ago) look over my shoulder while I checked my phone to see what time it was, see that it was 00:05, and declare that he had an 8 o'clock class, so he was going to go to bed.

This seems a terribly pitiful and childish thing to get upset over.  I'm the 21 year old, I'm supposed to be the mature one who doesn't give a shit about all this high school whining, yet it's still got me so upset, and the fact that it's such a silly thing is making it even worse.  I dunno if anyone is going to be able to say anything I haven't already told myself, but I guess it helped to just type it all out.  I'm no longer sobbing anyway.

**TL;DR:** Meh, It wasn't that important anyway, carry on with your day."

Long time lurker, long time fan. Looking for some input.

I've just started my third year in Engineering Physics at some will-not-be-named university (the Engineering Physics thing kinda narrows it down, but I digress). I really would like to find some kind of internship in the aerospace industry, like perhaps the CSA or SpaceX or NASA (maybe even Virgin Galactic?)...ho damn there be some dream jobs right there.

 I know that this is probably a long shot at best, but I figured the fine people in /r/space might have some ideas for a budding engineer like myself to stake a claim in this industry. I really want to be on the frontier of space exploration. Perhaps my ambitions are high, but I gotta reach for something."
kw12g,5,2011-09-29,Any younger geeks looking for a paid internship at a start-up company?,duffmanhb,vegas,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegas/comments/kw12g/any_younger_geeks_looking_for_a_paid_internship/,"Hey, guys I've been to enough meetups to know this is probably the first place I should look for what we need hahaha

We just lost our last intern to Germany recently. Apparently he had to go back to school and no one managed to plan ahead and try and rehire. He was a 20 year old German dude who also used Reddit, so I figured Reddit is the key to the best of the worst out there hahah...

What I need? Some one that knows computer science and can do some coding. Nothing too intense, but just to maintain the already completed software backbone and make some slight changes every now and then. Also some one that is analytical that has no problem gathering data from the system and running it to figure out some problems. It's not very difficult but can be a lot of fun. You would also probably be making a lot of Skype calls with our San Fran office to help them out and come up with new ideas. No dress code, just don't be a douchebag haha

For the job, the pay is not bad. 

Also, it's freakin' stellar experience. We are a start up that just got a massive investment (90 million) recently so things are constantly changing. Roles are being reassigned on a weekly basis because we are expanding so fast. Next week we move into our THIRD office which is even bigger than the last. Mind you, the first office just opened up 1.5months ago and is poised to be the main US office, which is critical. To say you worked with a start-up from it's very early days that ended up exploding into a well known company is a resume monster.

The company is called Wimdu, it just started about 7 months ago. The idea was to be the AirBnB of Europe, which has happened in an extremely short time. Now we just entered the US market after the investment we received and are set to do some real damage to our competitor. 
  
So yeah, if you think you can fill this position either part time or full time (Preferably full time, but we can do part time) don't send me a resume. Send me a little about yourself, an interesting fact, and some sort of evidence that shows you are a fellow geek and can do what's needed. You could start as early as next week...

P.S. I'm Chad from some of the meetups if you remember me. I'm about 24 and can drink my weight in alcohol if that rings any bells for any one. Also, if you're from UNLV, that's a plus, because I am biased like that.  "
kw0v2,19,2011-09-29,Shit... I think I might've just gotten hired to work for an shady company,afuckinmoron,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/kw0v2/shit_i_think_i_mightve_just_gotten_hired_to_work/,"My first day is this Monday and I quit my old part-time job for this one. I've been told that I'll be making $20k/year plus commission and that I'll be selling Verizon Business services to local businesses. It sounded like a dream job until I came across this comment on [One Day, One Job](http://www.onedayonejob.com/jobs/the-landers-group):

""These companies are all over many popular job sites. They tout event marketing, public relations opportunities, management training, and more. I worked at SV Marketing in Tampa, Florida (also known as Sloan Vinson Marketing) for one month. I never got stranded, and I never got a gone pulled on me, but I did feel scammed and like I was scamming others.

The deal with this company is ‘updating customer’s Verizon bills’. Basically, it was our job to pull 
Verizon bills from current customers (or other companies, if you’re really good) and call Verizon to 
make changes. The job is 100% commission, based on certain changes you are able to make to 
customer’s bills. A few times this may actually save the customer money, but many times it will in 
fact be more expensive. The recruiting of other employees is a large part of all these scams. The 
more people you recruit, the more money you make off their commissions. Once you are in the door 
and recruiting, they tell you all the techniques they used to get you in. To questions of ‘do you pay 
for gas’, you either avoid it, or say yes- it’s a tax write-off. Just save your receipts, including those 
for your suits, shoes, car, etc. and get it all back later!

As soon as you have enough experience and employees under you, you have the ‘opportunity’ 
to move to another location and start your very own business doing the same thing, or selling 
something very similar (including Staples.com), hence the sheer number of companies that do this.""

This basically just described what I saw when I went for my ""job shadow"" day. Holy shit, I think I just got played like a fiddle. The question is, what should I do now? Do I just not show up for my first day Monday and keep looking for work? I feel like such a fucking moron for falling for this, but I was so excited to get my first full-time job that I refused to see the red flags.


**EDIT 1** I fucked up the title. It should read ""a shady company."" Sorry about that, but I kind of wrote this while crying about my stupidity and it was hard to see straight.

**EDIT 2** For the record, I also did comment in here with my real username, not that it matters. The company is in Virginia and it's called Atlantic Coast Consulting LLC.. If any of my fellow Virginians sees them on Monster, you now know what they're about. Hope I could at least help someone else avoid wasting their time/gas on these people.

**Final Edit**
I've decided not to waste anymore time with these fuckers and to just move on. I appreciate the advice and support of my fellow Redditors and I hope I've helped a few people avoid falling prey to this shit, too. Below are a few of the red flags I noticed during this particular company's interview:

* After asking around, I found out that no one other than the managers had been working at the company for longer than a couple of months. If that's not a red flag, I dunno what is.

* No one would directly answer me when I asked what the company did. All I got was a bunch of ""you'll see""s during my interview. They also dodged questions about how many people had already been hired to the company during this hiring cycle.

* No company reimbursement for travel costs. ""It's tax deductible!"" my ass.

* The company only liked to hire young people. While that's nice and all in theory, the truth is that they probably just see us as being more vulnerable and gullible (and damn they were right), as well as more willing to sacrifice our free time for the sake of advancement.

Also, this may have worked out for the best after all. After spending all day contacting local tech firms to inquire about internships, I've gotten a response from one! Things are looking up, indeed."
kvxx7,6,2011-09-29,Leaving and Re-Entering Japan,FakeShark,japan,https://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/kvxx7/leaving_and_reentering_japan/,"Just wanted to check that my understanding is correct with some people who probably know about it. I'm currently living in Japan as an intern. This Christmas I would like to go back home (England) and I'm a little unsure about the process of doing so. From what I've found out, all I need is a visa which says ""No. of Entries: Multiple"" (which I have) and a Re-entry Permit from my local government office (in my case, Ichikawa) which I can get when I go to collect my Alien Registration card. Is there anything else which I need to do, or is that it?

Thanks for any clarification you can give :)

tl;dr Is a visa with multiple entries and a re-entry permit all that is needed to leave Japan and come back again?

Edit: What does the re-entry permit look like? I just took a look in my passport to see if it was done at the airport when I entered or not. There's a sticker (next to my stapled-in embarkation card which I filled out) and on that sticker it says ""Landing Permission"" with the from date matching my date of entry. Is this the re-entry permit or do I still need to go and get one?"
