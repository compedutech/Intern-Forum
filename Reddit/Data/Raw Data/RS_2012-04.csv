This June I will be graduating UC Davis with a B.S in applied pharmaceutical chemistry, a 3.0 GPA, and a huge interest in medicines, pharmacology, and chemistry. To put on my application, I have two letters of recommendation from both my chemistry and physics professors at my previous school, Santa Rosa Junior College. I participated in a summer internship at a Rite Aid pharmacy last year, And I have fulfilled all the curriculum requirements for most of the schools here in California. I did apply this year but I messed up on a couple of supplemental applications, and I feel like I wasn't even considered for an interview with only two letters of recommendation.

I'm lucky enough to be able to move back onto my Dad's property rent-free this summer so I can spend the next year making the best possible actions for reapplying. I'm willing to reapply as many times as it takes since this really is the career I want.

I had a couple of ideas for bolstering my application. I have considered getting my pharmacy technician licence and try to gain experience and get on a pharmacists good graces for another letter of rec. I was also considering putting in hours in the anatomy lab at my old junior college producing human prosecutions since I have a lot of animal dissection experience and did well in my human anatomy course. The professor there would write me a letter, but I'm not sure if another letter from a professor at this school is best for me.

Sorry if this seems jumbled, I can clarify on anything. I'm just looking for a point in the right direction"

So my girlfriend recently graduated with an awesome conservation biology degree from the University of Washington (WAYYY cooler than my lame-ass history BA). Despite the fact that she's a brilliant researcher/thinker and meritorious writer, she has run into a string of bad luck.

More than anything, she loves writing about science, because it gives her the opportunity to use her abilities to influence and help others, i.e. take the complexity of a scientific paper and decode, rewrite and simplify it for us dumber audience. Unfortunately, in the past month or so, she applied to two different paid internships as a science writer and was turned down at both. Her credentials checked out and she was given multiple interviews at both places, but each told her they were cutting their internships for financial reasons.

I was hoping that Reddit could give me some advice as to opportunities in biology you have heard of. She's a shy and sometimes pessimistic girl, but she is driven when she sees an opportunity and her writing abilities are unmatched. 

Any ideas? Thanks everyone!

I need to find a place to live and I figured another college town would be familiar, relatively affordable and have options for short term summer housing. What's the best way for me to go about finding summer housing at UCI?

I know UCI is on the quarter system which makes my timing poor. My start date is May 14th and my end date is early August. I'd like roomates (preferably around my age) for the company because I don't know anyone in the area and because it's cheaper to live with roomates than alone. Any suggestions/advice would be fantastic.

We have been dating since May of 2011. I graduated last year but am still in the area, he is graduating this year. Which is part of the problem.

I guess I've been avoiding the discussion of next year for a while. We started talking about it two weeks ago, without any real solutions. He doesn't know where he's going to be, and neither do. Although barring my internship this summer turning into a job, I would be willing to follow him to a new location.

Anyway, the other night we were drinking, and things came up. I told him I was more sure about him that I have been about anything. He said he was not sure what he wanted.

I know that it's ok for him to need time to figure his mind out, I had just hoped that after seeing me for almost a year, he would have a little more clarity. Not to mention that he told a mutual friend that he has never been in love. It just kind of hurts to lay my heart bare and to find out he's not sure. He would also have a little more time if he wasn't graduating in two months and possibly moving halfway across the country (he will probably move back in with his family if he can't find a job). He doesn't have plans for next year yet, and is having trouble deciding what he wants in that aspect of his life too. 

I can't help but feel a little heartbroken. But also like I'm being a little insecure. I don't know what to feel. Whenever I've not been sure about a relationship, it's because I don't care enough. But I don't want to be that quick to damn our relationship because I am crazy about him and I know he cares about me too.

TL;DR Boyfriend doesn't love me after a year, however graduation decisions are coming up and I'm super freaked out."
roa2t,4,2012-04-01,Any oboe players want to help me out with a project?,[deleted],musicians,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicians/comments/roa2t/any_oboe_players_want_to_help_me_out_with_a/,"Hi. I'm an art student and I am in the middle of my senior project right now, which is focused on video art. I need someone with decent (better than a computer microphone but doesn't have to be top-of-the-line) recording capabilities who plays a woodwind instrument. I am specifically looking for and greatly prefer an oboe, but other instruments may do- let me know. What I need is a 5-8 minute recording of someone practicing an instrument and not doing so well at it. Pick something you've just started learning or something that is really challenging. I want the mistakes, so if you're ""not that good"", that is absolutely fine. It would be good if you can play at least some of whatever piece you pick (older, classical pieces preferred), but you shouldn't be amazing at it. 

Also, a note: My work this semester is of a somewhat sensitive nature... to put it bluntly, this music is going to be paired with orgasm sounds. Here's an explanation that I wrote for it on my blog:

""This comes from a 'real-life' occurrence a couple of summers ago. I was staying at a communal farm as an intern. My roommate played the oboe and had gone outside on the porch of the farmhouse to practice. She was good at the oboe, but decided to practice a song that she was unfamiliar with, and stumbled over most of the notes. Just about at the same time as she started playing, I noticed some pretty ridiculous sex sounds coming from upstairs- pretty much the loudest and most extravagant sex sounds I had ever heard at this point. This was like, crazy yappy dog screams. And at the same time, my roommate stumbled over her oboe solo. It went on for what seemed like forever. It was perfect. And at the same time I felt an overwhelming sense of dread. It's still hard to put into words, but I think this says SOMETHING about sex and I want to recreate that.""

I'm fine with whatever way someone wants to or chooses not to be credited, since it is pretty explicit. 

Please let me know if you're interested and please tell me if this a completely inappropriate place for this- I've already tried a few other subreddits with little response, so I figured I'd try here. By the way, if you're on the fence, we can talk about some sort of compensation. Internet favors or a (small, art student) amount of money. Thanks!

TL;DR: Do you play the oboe? Are you not squicky about sexy things? Will you play your oboe and record it for me?"

I've been thinking about confiding in you all for a while now. I'm on my phone typing this at the moment so please excuse typos. 

I really don't want to go on and on so I'm going to try to get to the gist as quickly as possible. I'm 25 years old, 5'7"" and I think I'm 160 lbs. I'm a singke mom to a 6 year old. (I don't own a working scale. When I went to the dr about a month ago this is what I weighed.) Before having my son I was 140 lb. at one point at 135. I felt and looked great. After having my son I've lingered between 150 and 155. Ive been stuck at 155 for a year or two. I'm a full time college student working on a double major and I intern with kindergarteners. I want to be healthy and fit. I will be! I was working out much more and generally being healthier and happier from August to December of 2011. I hadn't been calorie counting or anything super strict as I literally am so freaking busy, that the first step for me was just making the effort and commitment mentally to change my life and health. Oh and in January of 2010 I quit smoking cigarettes after having smoked heavily for 7 years. When I want something better for myself or my son, or I decide to work on something to better myself, I will do it. I might slip up, or get down once in a while, but once I know in my heart what is best for me and my son, whether it be leaving his abusive father, getting full custody, adding my second major so I could become a teacher, learning how to not let my anxiety from school work get out Of control, quitting smoking, or building a better relationship with my father... I will do it. I just can't do it all at once. So in The fall of 2011 I was really beginning to work on my health a d exercise. I have known for about 2 years now that getting in shape and healthy was a serious priority for me. I Want to be around for my son as long as possible. 

So on New Years Eve this year I fell in my high heels and broke my ankle in 3 different places. I've had surgery. I have 10 screws and 2 plates. I broke both my tibia and fibula. The tibia in two places. I guess I sort of broke my ankle and leg. The breaks were in like 3 diff places. It was a horrible break for just being in high heels and hopping off a railing I had been sitting on, not far up at all. I'm still in shock and every time my surgeon sees my X-rays he can't believe I broke it as badly as I did in that manner. Anywho, I had surgery Jan 5. I was bed ridden practically for 3 weeks. Then I started back at school on crutches. After id get home from school I'd rest in bed from swelling and pain. I got depressed from not being able to actively play with my son and not being able to drive anywhere. I don't have a lot of people to help out. It's been really hard. I'm in a walking boot now but I'm still not allowed to do even the elliptical. I won't be able to play tennis for a year. I began eating really healthy for about 2 weeks, but shipping for veggies and fruits for only 2 people, The food goes bad so fast! And I hate grocery shopping, especially injured! When I was on crutches cooking became so difficult and painful and took FORever. I am up at 5 am doing school work, at internship by 7:30, at therapy after that, picking up my son at 5:00 ish.  I have so little time to do some fun bonding with him, like playing at the park for an hour, cooking dinner, bath for him, and bed by 830. I usually fall asleep by 10:00. I'm so tired at the end of the day. 

I see how my muscles have deteriorated. I've gained 5-10 pounds in the past 3 months, probably more. All I've wanted to do the past couple if years, with regards to weight loss, is lose 10-20 pounds. Now I find myself unable to exercise for at least 2 more weeks (then I might be able to begin the elliptical), a bit depressed by my weight gain. I literally almost hate my body. I have awful stretch marks from pregnancy. But those along with this fat on my stomach and thighs and arms really gets me down. I can't afford new clothes. The clothes I've been wearing the past few years, in sizes I had to buy new, and bigger, are now too tight. I'm so uncomfortable. 

I realize my current weight at my height is a goal for many people. But for me, I'm uncomfortable. This isn't who I know I can be. I even had gotten down to 145 at some point post pregnancy. But I strayed from that. 5 pounds on me, gain or lose, makes a huge difference to me. My clothes fit totally different, I feel different, I look different. 

How do I begin? Lately I've been just eating anything in front of me for comfort. I feel defeated. 

I want to be active so badly. I feel tired and overwhelmed. How do I begin to get ready for the time when the dr does say I can start light exercise? How do I find the time to shop for and cook healthy foods? The money? It's so expensive! I want to buy a scale (for food &amp; to weigh myself) and I tried calorie counting with my fitness pal but good lord I don't have time to sit there and input all the amounts of each ingredient.  I need suggestions for... Everything. Exercises I can do that don't involve weight baring on my leg? How to eat healthy and not too much without having to count and measure everything? If that's the only way to do it, then how do I make time for it when I already feel overwhelmed and that there's not enough time in the day?

Gah sorry this was so long. My mom just brought me a plate of Pancakes (I'm visiting her) right after I just told her Im desperate to get a grip on my eating. Wtf? Thanks mom. I turned them down but burst into tears. Now she's angry at me. Ugh. Life! You are a little bitch and awesome all at once. 

Love u all. Thanks for reading all this, if you did. You all are do inspiring to me. I'm glad I've found you. 

That ended up being so long. I'm sorry. "

rnrty,0,2012-04-01,What should I do over the summer? (Currently a CS 1st-year undergrad),[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/rnrty/what_should_i_do_over_the_summer_currently_a_cs/,"An internship would be best, I assume, but I didn't actually bother going to any of the career fairs since I was told (by several different professors) that companies basically never took on freshmen, and getting dressed up and going through the bother of missing classes (plus the inevitable anxiety) just didn't seem worth it. I'll need to begin attending them next year though, I know.

So, over the summer I suppose my two options are to either get a menial minimum-wage job, probably at our local movie theater since I already know two people working there, or skip the job and just focus on teaching myself something cool, like Clojure maybe, over the summer and keeping up 1-3 projects.

Right now I've only got one major side project going on, I've been working on it for about 6 months now in free time, but it's [a plugin for Minecraft SMP using the Bukkit API](https://github.com/Everdras/MCTowns), which is probably a bit too childish to actually mention specifically on a resume/application, so any projects I did would probably be iOS or Android apps, or if I actually find a need, a desktop application.

As for programming background, I've been coding in Java since mid-high school and just picked up C++ during college, as that's the language my uni uses as they teach basic programming and data structures. I also know a smattering of Ruby  (no Rails, unfortunately) and python. So I can probably teach myself anything I'd need to use for any project I took on.

I've never actually had a job before, so I just wasn't sure if it would look better on an application/resume to say ""I worked this summer at [local theater]"" or ""I spent this summer learning clojure and working on [1-3 GPL-licensed github projects]"".

So, what should I do this summer? Thanks in advance for reading. I know I tend to be long-winded."

I'm a college student who is weeks away from completing my Bachelor's in Computer Science and have spent the last three years working feverishly as a Software Development Intern (30 hours a week) and student. I've been paid well and out of sheer fortune, have been employed at this company for 2 years (Since my second semester in college). I have a strong GPA (3.7) and am among the top students in all of my classes. My manager at work appreciates the work I do and intends to hire me as a full time Software Developer with a very competitive salary (at a well respected company) when I graduate. 

I'm a logical person, however, I feel like these accomplishments aren't that exceptional. I feel like I'm lazy, and should work harder and learn faster. That I could be so much further along if I had pushed myself. That I should have been an EE major or an ME major, something with more rigor, with more respect. I feel like because I did poorly in high school, that I will never be able to distinguish myself from the herd, and yet, I try so desperately to do so. 

My question to you is this:

How can I get over this feeling that I NEED to differentiate myself?
How can I feel happy with my accomplishments, instead of constantly feeling like I need to reach higher and further?
Is this just natural? Does everyone feel this way?

I can't seem to pick between the two. They each have their pros and cons.

Ringling has a top notch reputation as being a hub for talented animators; however, I will get zero financial aid (32k per year!) and they seem to 'force' their students into working in a Pixar/Disney style. While I have no qualms about working in the mainstream style, I kind of want to do my own thing too (at least in my free time) and I'm worried about the lack of creative freedom. SCAD doesn't seem to have as good of a reputation (and the student work is not quite on par with Ringling's) but I can probably graduate in three years with 60k of debt and the chance to study abroad. I've also heard that their career services is not as good since the program is so huge. However, I have to say that I am leaning towards SCAD because of their aid package.

So here's the story, my ex (22F) broke up with me (24M) almost 3 months ago.  We met about 8 years ago and became friends.  We lived in different states, but her father lived near me and we would see each other when she came out to visit him around holidays and over the summers.  We had various ""flings"" over the years and maintained a lighthearted ""flirty"" friendship.  Almost 2 years ago now, I decided to fly out and visit her.  Feelings resurfaced on both sides and after a hectic summer we both admitted that we had fallen in love.  She still had a year of college left and I was now entering a phase of jumping from internship to internship until someone would hopefully hire me. Over the next year and a half we carried on our long distance relationship.  She finished school and moved to a big city where she got a ""grown-up job,"" I continued to jump from internship to internship in various states.  We would spend a few hours on the phone together everyday and we would see each other in person over varying lengths of time.  In January, while I was spending one last visit with her shortly before i moved out of state for another 3 months, she told me she couldn't handle the distance anymore and that we had to break up.  She said that ""it never felt like a real relationship,"" that she was ""growing to resent"" me, and that she couldn't keep waiting for me anymore.

After I moved away again she would still call me on her drive home from work like she always did.  She told me that she couldn't just cut me out of her life because I was her best friend.   On a couple of relatively humiliating occasions, I broke down and told her how badly I wanted to be with her again but she always replied that she had to do what was best for her and that even though it doesn't seem like it, breaking things off now was the best choice in the long run.  

She seemed to be doing fine with everything, but over the next 2 and a half months I felt worse everyday. Every time I hung up the phone, after talking to her, I was on the verge of tears.  My self-confidence (something I've always struggled with) was at an absolute all-time low.  I couldn't tell her how miserable I was because I couldn't handle hearing her say ""this is best"" again.  She was still my ""best friend"" but I couldn't tell her what was on my mind anymore.  
Eventually I decided that my last chance at getting past anything would be to go into ""no contact.""  I sent her a long winded e-mail explaining everything I was feeling.  I told her how miserable I was, how angry I was with her, and how humiliated I was.  I told her she could call me that night if she wanted, but the next morning I would be cutting all lines of communication.
She called that night and we spent a long phone call and skype conversation just kinda spilling our feeling to each other. I was surprised that she admitted that she still loved me and that she stills wants to be with me, but once again, the distance made things impossible.  She didn't want to do no contact but she accepted that it was what I wanted and that she would give me all the time I needed.

That was a week ago, so where am I now?  Honestly, I feel numb.  I feel completely emotionless.  I don't really feel sad anymore, I don't feel happy anymore either.  I am completely disinterested in the world around me.  I don't talk to people unless or leave the house I have to. There's a couple people in my life encouraging me to get out and be social again but I just don't have any will to do so. 
If I had typed this post a week ago, I wouldn't have been able to see through me tears, and now as far as my emotions are concerned, I'm writing a lab report.
And the strangest thing? Two days ago I was asked to fly out to her city for a job interview.

So my question is this: After a week of ""no contact"" I went from being a crying, miserable, wreck to a completely numb, emotionless, anti-social shell.  Is this improvement or regression?"

Especially from Texas!!,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/rn632/anyone_with_a_degree_in_mass_communicationspublic/,"Hello! I'm currently looking into college degrees and want to do something in mass communications or public relations possibly with a minor in business (or at the very least take lots of business classes). Overall the programs seem really interesting to me and the jobs sound very enticing. 
However I'm skeptical of a few things such as if there is a strong job market for such degrees? Are internships easy to come by and helpful? What exactly are the expectations/responsibilities of someone working with this degree?

I got into two different colleges with the degrees I'd like, University of North Texas and Texas State University but am having lots of problems deciding which would be a smarter choice to attend. Both a degree in mass communications or public relations are under the school of journalism and I'm honestly not sure which school would give me more opportunities for internships or possible future jobs. 

I'm just really unsure about where to go to school and if a degree in one of these fields would be the smartest move economically. "

I would love to speak to anyone who has been an intern there to see if it would be worth shelling out about 600/month for rent.  I'm a pretty broke college student, and my parents won't be helping me financially after I graduate.

rn2ee,3,2012-03-31,Should I end it or keep working on it?,teersofhops,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/rn2ee/should_i_end_it_or_keep_working_on_it/,"Hopefully he doesn't see this as he is also a redditor, but I don't think he comes to this subreddit. Anyway, this is a little bit lengthy, but I hope you'll read it.

Firstly, some background- I am 23(F) and he is 28. 
We first met five years ago, but only started dating about a year and 10 months ago. Our relationship moved pretty fast- we were basically living together for a while and were fairly serious. He helped through some really tough times (I had PTSD and was recovering from an assault I had faced at the hands of a peer). He has been very supportive and protective of me in the while we stayed together. We had a fairly loving relationship, and were almost playing house I guess.

-

We've been LDR for the last 8 months. I was living across the country (or continent, rather, since we're Canadian but I was down in the States) from September to December for an internship opportunity. Then, by a twist of fate, we swapped places as he went down there raise capital for his startup while I came back to school.

-


Anyway, some problems we've faced: firstly, I'm of Indian origin and he isn't. My family wouldn't mind him, except that he has been utterly disdainful of them from the beginning, and now they don't like him. In addition to this, he sees Indian culture as backwards, never wants to go there, and scoffed at my vegetarianism until recently. He said he changed his mind recently, but only after he sensed I was pulling away. 

-


Secondly, he recently decided he wasn't going to finish his undergrad until an indefinite later date. He started his undergrad at the same time I did, but was obviously about four years older than I am. We were both in a fairly specialized (&gt; 4 years) electrical engineering program when he decided to drop out, then changed faculties a bunch of times before deciding to do his startup. He is a really smart guy, but this has left me feel super disappointed, as I am almost done. The one thing big thing here is that I will likely be working abroad full time once I am done, but won't be able to sponsor him, and he may not be able to get an appropriate visa without an undergrad. I also don't really know what to say to my family, who were already not too happy that he switched out of engineering. 

-

My future earning power is also much higher than his now and because of this, he would make me spend on tickets and hotels for him to come visit me even though I couldn't afford it due to school. He later told me he just wanted to see me and keep me company, and I understand that.

-


Those are the two main problems. Others have included the fact that being with him started to become isolating. He didn't like me hanging out and drinking with my male friends (even though they were my friends out of necessity, being in engineering). He accused me of cheating a few times over the last 8 months, though I convinced him I wasn't and he believed me. He would argue with me frequently over trivial things, like using Linux over OSX (he preferred the latter) and would often tell me to get out or make me sleep on the couch. He would frequently ask me to choose between my family and him, saying if he wanted a traditional Indian girl who wanted her family, he wouldn't have dated me. He is fairly argumentative in general, and has gotten up in my friends' faces for disagreeing with him in the past (he can pull it off because he is a big guy), and would also get upset at me for telling him to stop.

-

I don't know what to do. I've been unhappy for a while, but I love him. We talked recently and he cried profusely, saying he was willing to change if I gave him a chance. He says he loves me and asked me remember all the good times we've had. His startup recently received a lot of funding (a LOT), and I think he's been using that to try and reel me back in, but I don't know. I love him so much. I really do. But this relationship stresses me out to the point that I am no longer attracted to him and I am scared that I'll be isolated from my friends and family.

What do I do? I am so scared. He comes back from the States this Thursday and I have to give him an answer.

**TL;DR** BF doesn't like my family/culture, dropped out of undergrad, does other things to stress me out. What do?"

Well he told me at work he was going to be on campus visiting a friend and I told him to stop by if he had time.

Well I live in a fraternity house in a heavily trafficed area but for some reason there was none that night.  I remember there being none because I thought it was odd when a rock bounced off my window and I looked out and saw but one person.  I immediately recognized the tall thin frame as my friend and called his phone to see what he was doing.  He picked up and I asked him what was going on, that's when I noticed that the person outside the window had his arms to his side as my coworker apologized that he couldn't make it to hangout.  I am so thankful that I live on the second door and that there were two locked doors between me and that thing because the smile it flashed had a few too many teeth and the speed with which it fled far too fast."

I do not have the emails of the three people I interviewed with (I interviewed with them one at a time), but I do have their names and the email address of the person who I set the interview up with.

Should I ask for the interviewers' emails or should I ask the person I set the interview up with to forward the email?  Also, I told the second interviewer that I will be taking a summer class twice a week and was told by the third interviewer that they want someone who will work about 40 hrs per week(derp on my part).  Should I mention that I can work around this or just not mention it at all? 

Lastly, I asked what they look for in interns and I fit the bill pretty well.  Should I reinforce this in the email (ie ""my blah blah skills are a great fit for this position) or would it be redundant since I already said this in the interview?

I didn't notice the other employee running up behind me, or in fact the receptionist man running towards the other side of the door when I tried to apply a little more force. Anyway I pulled a bit harder than I expected and I forced the magnetic lock open. Just as soon as the door opened I heard the receptionist (male) shouting ""JAYSUS! GO FUCKING EASY!"".

This is an update to my post about a month ago looking for people to advocate for BDSM/kink to mental health professionals. Most professionals still don't understand how persons who practice BDSM can be mentally healthy. My goal for this study is to learn how we as a community, generally, feel about mental health professionals, and our experiences with mental illness (or lack thereof). 

I am a graduate student at the University of West Georgia, in the program for Counseling and Educational Psychology, specializing in Professional Community Counseling. I am nearing the end of my coursework, and begin my internship in the fall. At the end of this program I will be a Licensed Assistant Professional Counselor, and with further post-degree supervision I will be an LPC and able to practice on my own. I will be a queer, kink, and poly-friendly counselor; there aren't enough of them, especially out here in farmland. 

I created the survey on a site that was recommended by the professor, Zoomerang. It's only 10 multiple choice questions, so shouldn't take long at all. :) It requires no personal information, and people of any age can complete it, even minors. Please recommend this survey to anyone you know who practices BDSM.

Babson clearly costs more than Uconn. Babson has a better program from my research, and can give me more hands on experience. Uconn has Division I sports teams, while Babson is Division III. There is less of a social life at Babson than at Uconn.

My friend is currently a law student (finishing up L1) at Syracuse. He's looking for an internship at either a law firm or a legal division of a bigger company here in LA for the summer. He has an interest in anything dealing with sports or entertainment. I can vouch for the fact that he's a hard worker and is eager to learn anything he can about the field.

He's not a redditor, so that's why I'm posting this on behalf. If anyone has any leads, I'd greatly appreciate it.

I'm 19 years old, and went to culinary school directly after graduating high school. After an accelerated 6 month course, I worked as an intern at a one Michelin Star restaurant, and got hired after a couple months.

I've been working at this place for a year now. The trouble is, I'm starting to realize that I don't see a future in doing this. No matter how much I love cooking and working the line, I just don't have a dream of running a kitchen of my own-- Not a real dream, anyway, if that makes sense. I realized that the want of running a kitchen as a chef was an ""expected"" dream that I sort of ran with because I figured that's what you did later on.

Don't get me wrong, I love my job. I work the station faster than anyone, can plate three station's stuff, and help out everyone else whenever I can. I'm not lazy, I bust my ass day in and day out, and don't have too much of a problem with any aspect of work as of the moment.

It's hard though, to see myself really running a restaurant. Not because I don't want to do it, nor that I don't think I can do it a decade down the line, but just that it's not something I jump at. It's odd, and hard to explain, but... I just don't see a happy future as a chef.


Should I quit out while I'm ahead, go back to college for who-knows-what with the money I've saved from working, or should I push on and hope that I'll truly want to have a kitchen of my own someday?

rpr4y,9,2012-04-02,Can getting back together work?,[deleted],relationship_tips,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/rpr4y/can_getting_back_together_work/,"Hi, 20 f here, sophomore in college. 

I dated my first boyfriend (same age) all of freshman year and through the summer (he was in my freshman dorm). I moved to DC, where he lives, because I got a great internship, and we had a nice summer but trouble adjusting from living down the hall to living in different neighborhoods. We fought a lot, but were very much in love, but eventually it got to be too much and he broke up with me right before the school year began.

The fall semester was full of fights, yelling, screaming, breakup sex (didn't go more than a week without it), asking who the other had been with, and was a really terrible time for both of us. I had thought we were trying for something again toward the end of the semester (we had been having sleepovers for about a month straight), but it turns out he was sleeping with others and not telling me. When he finally did, right before our winter break, I told him I did not want to have him in my life any more, in any capacity.

But then he had a very terrible thing happen to him-- I won't go into it here, its too complicated-- and he became depressed and reached out to me. I couldn't help but talk to him and try to help him-- I still cared for him and loved him, even though he had been breaking my heart for months and months. I helped him through his issue, and he told me he still loved me (he hadn't said that since we had broken up the first time at the end of the summer) and he admitted that part of why he had ended things after the summer was because he had cheated, and he regretted it. The terrible fall semester was because he didn't know how to tell me, and didn't want to lose me, but couldn't deal with what he had done. He had previously told me he had never loved anyone as much as me-- we had a very passionate, loving relationship for 8 months.

Now, I know I will get some hate, but I decided to forgive him. I know him very well, and I am very smart. Of course in the back of my mind, I wonder if I am just blind, but he seemed genuinely sorry, and I decided to give him a chance. Please do not tell me to break up with him. We got back together around New Years, and became official about a month later. Since then, our relationship is better than it ever was, and I am slowly but surely beginning to trust him again. He is being very open and understanding, and tries to help me work through how hurt I was. It's not a very present force, but I do think of it in passing nearly every day. But our relationship now is more loving, considerate, and fun than it ever was. I am very happy, and much more than the first time we dated.

But I have a sneaking feeling that I am just going to be hurt again. ""Once a cheater, always a cheater"" comes to mind-- or even if he doesn't cheat, that he will get restless like he did before, and begin to appreciate me less.
Reddit has so many stories of ""getting back together"" fails. Does anyone have any advice? Any stories? Has a second chance ever paid off?

**TL;DR: Got back together with ex of about a year 3 months ago after he admitted he cheated (we were broken up for 4 months and I didn't know about the cheating until after). I forgave him, and things have been better than ever for the past three months. Do second chances work? Looking for support/advice.**"

Here's my story.",sevennationsalami,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/rporh/redditors_have_you_ever_been_supremely_conned/,"This happened several years ago, but I have only told two close friends about it. Time to get this thing off of my chest.

At that time I was doing an internship in NYC. I was on my way home, still in daylight, just a few steps from the apartment building and already reaching for my keys, when I bumped into someone walking past me. The guy had been holding a plastic bag, which fell to the pavement, glass shattering. Some liquid started flowing out of the grocery bag. The guy immediately started cursing, grabbed the bag and threw it into a garbage bin. Then he turned to me, all upset. I was shocked and ashamed, and was apologizing all over the place. Only then I realized, that there also was a pregnant woman with the guy. Both of them where much older than me, probably in their 40s and rather scruffy and poor looking. The guy was all mad at me, the woman just about to cry, it definitely was not a scene I wanted to be in. They told me something about ""pregnancy medicine"" they just got from the other side of the city and how I now had to replace it. They wanted me to take a cab with them to the place and pay for a new bottle of medicine. I declined the cab ride, but offered to pay for a replacement. It would cost me 40 bucks, and they wanted the money asap, because the clinic was about to close. I was OK with replacing what I broke, so I went with them to the next ATM. Along the way they constantly bombarded me with guilt and how awful this was for them and especially for the unborn baby. I felt mortified. The price they where talking about also continued to grow. First they added something for the cab ride back and forth, then the medicine constantly became more and more expensive. At the time we reached the ATM, they where talking about $100, but I felt too bad to think clearly and object. So I withdrew the money, gave it to them, they hopped into a cab and I was left standing there, feeling like the most stupid person on the planet. Only then it dawned on me, that things didn't feel right. So I went back to the trash can and fished the bag out of it. It was a broken bottle of Lemon Tea Snapple.

To this day I feel incredibly ashamed, that I would fall for some stupid trick like that. But as much as I loathe what these two people did, I somehow must applaud that they managed to pull it off. The whole thing only took four minutes beginning to end. And the amount of coordination and quick thinking they put into it (making me ""bump"" into him, constantly upping the amount of money, etc.) was actually quite impressive.

**TL;DR** Paid $100 for a Snapple.

There doesn't really seem to be a system in place to properly manage how Windows goes about starting up critical services when it's rebooted.  As it stands all I see is the system booting and all services making a bat-shit crazy dash for resources to get started. It's fucking stupid.

This is something I've been struggling with lately.  We're looking to implement completely automated Windows and AV updates on all of our machines using WSUS, Group Policy, and our AV Admin services.  THe problem I'm facing is that Windows only offers two options for starting services: Automatic and Automatic(Delayed), which translates to ""Mad Dash for Resources"" and ""Wait until those morons quit fighting, then start.""  This is obnoxious because it turns what could be a minute long process into a five to ten minute long process.  What's more obnoxious is that Linux can reboot in about a minute and have Apache, PHP, SQL, and FTP running.  

My question is this: is there anything I can do about this at all?  Are there any third-party services out there I can implement into our system to help manage this issue?

EDIT:
First off, before I start getting flamed out the ass, understand that I'm basically a junior system admin.  This is my first system admin job, and it's a small company and the people running it before were devs doing extra work.  I came in as an internship to help straighten things out and lightne their loads.  This is all shit I don't really understand and am trying to without schooling, which I'm actually in for Network Administration.  This is just temporary and I'd like to understand more."

rpj1z,57,2012-04-02,Tourist Trap,JadenGH,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/rpj1z/tourist_trap/,"Tourist Trap
In rural Wisconsin, there is an old abandoned park. Built in the 1920s, it served as the town’s gathering place for everyone.
That is, until a newly developed Train and Tunnel for Tots™ ride was installed in 1932. It was an innocent looking childish train, with one main (mechanized) head car, with three small trolleys pulled behind it. It went around some loops before going into a small tunnel.
But this is where the story gets weird. There were numerous cases of child deaths that year, all of them happening after the child rode on that train system. Some kids went missing in that short tunnel (about ten feet), and others went comatose after leaving. One, upon exiting, was found to be dead. Her dress was covered in what looked like small bloody handprints. Some killed themselves by scratching at their throats until they bled out, and one of them even killed another child before hanging herself with razor wire at the family’s farm.
The park was closed, and the town’s popularity as a tourist town plummeted.
Recently, a team of scientists were sent out to the park. They taped a video camera to the train, and put a new intern in with it, before sending it on its way onto the tracks.
When the train left the tunnel, it was empty, except for the camera.
The last ten seconds were nothing but static, save for the sound of children laughing."

So I'm scared that if I'm leaving before my work permit is done, I won't be able to get in Canada.

Because the immigration site of Canada is not that clear, I don't know what to do : should I wait to get in Vancouver and then make my work permit at the airport, or should I try to make it while in France? What difference does it make?

Admittedly I've not been there long (2 months), but I still feel this is slightly unfair. I've put everything into this job (which is currently unpaid, but I did get a letter offering me a full time paid position to start in 2 weeks) - I've stayed behind after finishing time to work on problems that aren't mine, worked on my days off, pretty much jacked in my degree (I got a letter Friday saying that Student Finance have been informed that I no longer attend my university, so therefore no loan for me! No word from uni yet), quit my other job where I was actually being paid, and trying to do this with a butt load of stuff going on at home (taking my dad's company to court for almost killing him and making him brain damaged being the main one) and my own mental health problems.

Can they actually fire me for something like this? The woman who runs the company doesn't believe in sick days, and has said so to everyone many a time - her policy is that unless you're in hospital (or something equally severe), you're expected to come in. And if you choose not to, then you should at least be working from home. She's recently been highly unprofessional and critical of another employee, telling her to break up with her fiancée because they're obviously shit together (they're not, I'd just like to state), and when said employee told her to butt out, it's not her business, she yelled at her and said ""how dare you talk to your boss that way!"" (This was at a house party whilst boss was drunk. Boss is also said employee's brother's mother - don't know if that's relevant). There is also severe favouritism towards her son within the workplace (to be expected, I know, but when he gets to keep his job for constantly disregarding her rules, not doing his work and staying home for a cold, it's a little annoying)

So I guess I'm asking for advice, and maybe some stories to cheer me up. (Or a job offer if anyone wants to hire me?)

EDIT: Yes yes, foolish of me to work for free, I know. It was an unpaid internship with the promise of a full time paid job after three months. I had written confirmation of the internship and of the job offer, which probably doesn't mean anything except I'm a trusting fool. I'm still at my paying job for another week, going to try and see if they'll take me back later."

And she calls me selfish every time I ever need anything. I don't know how I'm supposed to do everything they want! I have to just obey what my mom wants me to look and act like, and stfu whenever I might need anything because I'll get in trouble if I dare voice anything. if I ever try to bring up something I'm thinking about I'll get yelled at. I should just never talk. I should just die. 

I'm doing everything wrong. Maybe if I was the kind of daughter my mom wanted then I'd be ok. Maybe she'd even help me with the other shit that I'm going through. That's the worst thing. That the only help I really need from her she'll never give me. I don't know what I want anymore.

Rarity is a fashion designer, duh, it's one of the most upfront things about her character, and lives at her home which doubles as her business. Rarity seems to act like she's part of the 1 percent. It is assumed she is the wealthiest of the main 6.

Applejack works and lives on her family's farm. This can be a pretty high-paying job, depending of course on the size of your farm, Applejack has her life's plans laid out before her, she's pretty set on inheriting the duties of the sweet apple acres orchard.

Twilight Sparkle is a full-time student on a graduate study project, I assume she is getting by on scholarships or government grants. Her friendship study is rather odd, but being something approved by literally the god of the earth, she's pretty set to have pretty prestigious reccomendations on her resume, and is sure to be a rush-in at any forefront research gig. She will get top picks of research interns at her disposal.

Pinkie Pie works at a bakery, and rents out the space above it. For such a blue collar position, She seems to be doing pretty well. Her apartment is quite spacious. She must sell drugs on the side. That would explain everything.

Rainbow Dash is a bit odd-- she almost seems like a vagabond sometimes, seemingly just doing nothing but ""napping"" randomly in the tops of trees or on small clouds, but it is revealed a few times she apparently lives in what appears to be a palatial mansion made from clouds (I assume they're actually made from some sort of nanite-infused loadbearing aerogel, because, you know, regular water vapor clouds you can sit on and build cities out of is, of course, ridiculous, and I know this show isn't trying to be scientifically inaccurate or anything) ...but Rainbow Dash doesn't just do nothing but lay around and show off. She does do important work in several instances helping with weather control, so I assume that she's part of some sort of weather control task force, why this, with all the off-hours it apparently provides for napping and showing off, I can't imagine how it would pay so extravagantly, so I assume that in pegasi statuses, perhaps that house isn't a mansion, this would make sense, seeing as how some sort of aerogel component might be cheap and easy to produce and the scale and 3rd dimension to the sky would allow for nearly limitless building potential. Rainbow Dash might actually be very poor, perhaps the poorest of the ponies.

Fluttershy... she lives in a cottage in the countryside by the woods, a very large and spacious cottage with multimple levels and rooms, though she lives by herself. She seems very well-off, though her character is the most unclear in its career. What exactly does she do? She obviously likes to take care of alot of different animals, but is that her job? Is she a veterinarian? Aside form grooming Rarity's cat in one episode, she hasn't done anything else to indicate she helps ponies take care of their domesticated animals (confusing, right?) she could be a wildlife rehabber, but those positions are usually class (c)-105 nonprofit and require donations, and are typically volunteered. The episode where she tried to give off one of her anmals to Rainbow Dash as a pet made he look like some sort of exotic animal breeder... Is this her job, perhaps? She keeps chickens, perhaps she is just a small subsistence farmer, hey, nothing has indicated she doesn't slaughter and eat those chickens, amirite? What else would she be keeping them for?

Seriously, I can't figure out what fluttershy's job is... Can anyone else help me?"

With all that laid out, some have suggested that I go to CC and then transfer. Any input on that? If I want to transfer, I can just go to NMT and transfer from there since it will be cheaper and living in a different state really builds character. NMT will give me internship and research opportunities that CC won't give. Plus, the better professor interaction times for better letter of recs."

I have a 2.5 cumulative GPA, and am getting a BA in Economics with a minor in Philosophy.  I'm a bit concerned for the future, so I was hoping that with some information you guys might be able to offer some advice:

*The majority of my employment has been summer employment at a Boy Scout camp in Wisconsin.  I have been in a leadership position for some time now which involves leading three to four person teams to maintain an area to national standards and providing an excellent program.

*I am an Eagle Scout with Bronze Palms

*I currently work three jobs (pizza delivery, burrito making, and dishwashing if it's worth anything).

*I have extensive training in Latin.

I'm a big fan of technology and enjoy keeping up with the latest trends and gadgets.  I am always willing to move to a new place (22 houses in 20 years, so far) and have been told both to my benefit and my dismay that I will have to sell myself on my personality because the objective ""tests"" tend not to show my intelligence.

I have an M.A. in the arts, and naturally am not finding employment. I'm thinking of taking a new career path, and have always been interested in becoming a counselor. I don't have a great deal of formal education in psychology, but I have a lot of personal and family experience with mental illnesses, and have myself benefited greatly from counseling. I am by nature a very caring and compassionate person, with a strong desire to help others get far far away from the problems that have plagued me. I like listening to people and I think counseling is something I could be good at. However, I have only experienced it from the receiver's end, and am sure there is a great deal I don't know or understand about what it actually is like to be a counselor. If anyone has the time, I'd love to ask a few questions.

What is school like? What kinds of courses can I expect to take? 

I understand that one must complete an internship or training past the Masters to become licensed. How does this work? 

What is it like to do this kind of job day to day? How difficult is it not to take it home with you? 

Those of you who are counselors, do you enjoy your jobs? 

I would be so grateful if any of you who are counselors would give me some feedback. I don't know anyone personally who is, so I'm relying on the great power of reddit!! "

I never signed any type of contract or something that told me how long I would work for. Im only working part time. What would you guys suggest? Would you even suggest quitting?

I was working part time during the year for a designer that was very talented but when she ran into financial trouble, I lost my position :( I had already done 2 internships and some freelance projects so I really thought my experience was beyond interning. I had a hard time finding another design job after graduation so I took a part time retail job and eventually got promoted to a management position. 

I had applied to so many design houses and companies and never heard back from anyone. On a whim, I applied for a position with one of the brands of a major parent company that would be my DREAM to work for. Long story short, they thought I was better suited for one of their other brands (that currently had no available positions) and I hadn't heard from them since March 2011.

2. Any grad students in the Agronomy &amp; Horticulture, Soils &amp; Biogeochemistry, departments?
If so, what kind of GPA and GRE scores do you need?
Also, do you happen to know of any PI's that have openings in their labs?

3. Let's say for some reason grad school does not work out this semester/year. I think I still want to move there and establish residency ( I am from Texas, please don't hold it against me), take a class or two, and reapply the next year. So, how hard is it to find a place to live and find work?

4. Any feedback on how to increase my chances of matriculating into grad school will be appreciated. 

5. If you have any questions, have connections and need to know more I will be glad to answer any questions and provide my personal statement.

Thank you! :)

The problem is, I also found out that she's almost done with school, and she's taking a job in a different country. It's now April and she'll be gone by June.

I heard they were pretty good quality, especially the collars and cuffs, so I bought 4 and got a nice tie all for ~$140.


Primer: I'm 6'1"", 180lbs, wear a 15.5"" neck/33"" sleeve, 38"" chest, 31"" waist, and a 38R suit jacket.

Out of the box, the [tailored fit white poplin shirt](http://www.ctshirts.com/men's-shirts/men's-dress-shirts/White-poplin-tailored-fit-dress-shirt?q=usddefault||FD002WHT|||||1862,||||||||&amp;ppp=43) felt really nice. The material was lightweight (which is great for this florida weather), but not cheap like other department store dress shirts. As advertised, the cuffs and collars felt extremely nice, and had a certain thickness and more mature look about them compared to other dress shirts I have worn. [Collar pic](http://imgur.com/Jzgm1,jFDJv,EFQiL,15Xj3#0)


Onto the rest of the fit:

A [Straight on shot](http://imgur.com/Jzgm1,jFDJv,EFQiL,15Xj3#1) disappointingly showed some billowing at the waist and upper sleeve (a bit more than I expected from a ""tailored fit"") though a better tuck could improve the look of the fit. The [side pic](http://imgur.com/Jzgm1,jFDJv,EFQiL,15Xj3#2) does the shirt better justice, as the darts in the back of the shirt really help reduce the billowing in the back (a problem that I encounter quite a bit). [This shot](http://imgur.com/Jzgm1,jFDJv,EFQiL,15Xj3#3) clearly shows a bit of tailoring could be done on the sleeves and sides to turn it into an ideal fit.


For $35 I have to say that this is a pretty solid deal. I haven't experienced many high end shirts, but at this price the quality is tough to beat at this price. If I had to guess, most people (especially in this subreddit) would be best getting the slim or tailored(extra slim) fits, and those with a frame like mine (or slimmer) may require a tailor to make it a TRULY slim fit."

I'm 19 years old, and went to culinary school directly after graduating high school. After an accelerated 6 month course, I worked as an intern at a one Michelin Star restaurant, and got hired after a couple months as garde manger.

I've been working at this place for a year now. The trouble is, I'm starting to realize that I don't see a future in doing this. No matter how much I love cooking and working the line, I just don't have a dream of running a kitchen of my own-- Not a real dream, anyway, if that makes sense. I realized that the want of running a kitchen as a chef was an ""expected"" dream that I sort of ran with because I figured that's what you did later on.

Don't get me wrong, I love my job. I work the station faster than anyone, can plate three station's stuff, and help out everyone else whenever I can. I'm not lazy, I bust my ass day in and day out, and don't have too much of a problem with any aspect of work as of the moment. I have a lot of passion for what I do, and always want to learn and always am excited to see new things.

It's hard though, to see myself really running a restaurant. Not because I don't want to do it, nor that I don't think I can do it a decade down the line, but just that it's not something I jump at. It's odd, and hard to explain, but... I just don't see a happy future as a chef. I've no trouble with long hours and low pay right now, but as I hear, hours only get longer and the pay doesn't get very much better later on(though money is honestly a non-issue). I guess what I'm most scared of is never seeing friends and family and regretting it later on in life.

Should I quit out while I'm ahead, go back to college for who-knows-what with the money I've saved from working, or should I push on and hope that I'll truly want to have a kitchen of my own someday, and that it'll turn out alright?

I have been a student of Aerospace Engineering at my university for the last three years. After a long a painful conversation with my undergrad advisers about why I always seem to be in a constant haze of stress and near-depression in regards to school we came to the decision that ASE probably isn't right for me.

My issue is this - I have spent around $50k in student loans getting through my first few years with the expectation of having a solid, well paid job at the end of my undergrad. Now if I change majors I stand to essentially throw away fifty grand (I do have all my basics out of the way at least, so I'd have little down time between majors) for the sake of being successful at my field of study.

I have a love of programming and things of a more technical nature, along with several years worth of experience in a shop/industrial environment which is why I gravitated towards aerospace. However as it turns out, rocket science is *fucking hard* and many of the higher level concepts are over my head no matter how much study time I put into trying to comprehend them.

Additionally, I have worked as an intern for about half a year at a production company making props (hey, gotta take whatever opportunity life gives ya, right?) and I really enjoyed the world of production and editing. The ability to see instant and tangible results is what made me love it so much, and is something that ASE lacks sorely.

What the heck should I do to figure out what my new focus of study will be?? I'm not going to school for the purpose of learning - I'm going to school so I can get a job with decent pay, but I have zero knowledge of job markets outside of the engineering sector.

**TL:DR** - My current major is not working for me and I need to change to a new one that still has a high level of job assurance at graduation."

I am an ME senior graduating soon in May. I have done an internship in the past; I applied for a full-time rotational position there but they went with someone with a better background and experience. I have continued to apply for entry-level positions I find but it gets frustrating not hearing back about any of the opportunities. 

My question now is: what is the general opinion about applying for internships after graduating? The company I interned with before liked me and they have several internships available this summer, in process engineering and other relevant fields. I feel I would get excellent experience out of several of these opportunities, and since I have yet to hear back about serious job opportunities, would it be frowned upon for me to try and do another internship?

rraf4,0,2012-04-03,Question about Internships,[deleted],actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/rraf4/question_about_internships/,"I was wondering what companies who offer internships to undergrads generally expect of applicants? How many tests passed, if any? What, in general, would set me apart? I'm looking to try to apply for some positions over the summer, though not sure where.

Here's a brief profile:

I haven't taken any of the tests as of this exact moment, but I'm taking P in May, which I'm very confident about, and FM in June, which I'm also feel fairly well about, though perhaps not as well as I feel about P. So, by summer I'll likely have 1 if not 2 tests passed.  

This coming summer will be that between my junior and senior years. I'm an actuarial science major who's also taken a fair amount of non-essential coursework in economics and statistics out of general interest, and I may decide to complete minors in one or both. Both my overall and major GPA are about 3.3

I haven't had any prior internships. My weakest aspect is probably my lack of ""involvement"" in activities/clubs; my only involvement in the *university*, per se, is as a math TA. On the flip side, though, I spend most of my free time either reading, painting, making music, or partying, all of which have helped me cultivate strong written, oral, and visual communication skills.

How do I look on paper? If anyone has any insight, please do share.

[How awkward was the kiss with Katie?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47pxul?context=5)|It was good. She was very gentle, which is something I need.
[What is swaim like IRL?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47pv3h?context=5)|He's tall. Also he talks with his hands and wears a fedora.
[If you could fight one extinct creature, what would it be? Would you use that creature for a pizza topping? Based on this comment alone, would you write me a letter of recommendation for grad-school? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47pz8e?context=5)|If I could fight one creature it would be the pterodactyl. I don't really like my odds but, man, what would people even SAY at the wake?
[What's John Cheese like in person? I love his articles, but it seems like he'd be one of those guys that can really suck all the fun out of the room with a single anecdote.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47q6pj?context=5)|I've never actually met him in person. I've heard that when he and David Wong are together it's like Abbott and Costello. Is that not a timely enough reference? 
 |They're like, uh, Ash and that one girl he hangs out with in Pokemon.
[Are you at all related to David Bowie?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47q8ot?context=5)|Only spiritually.
[How in the world does one pronounce ""Bucholz""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47q2vz?context=5)|Buckles. I refuse to believe anything different.
[Holy shit! Soren, you're a redditor? Yes, you will do. You will do..  Um.. I have to ask a question? well, this is awkward, I don't think this far.  So... kittens?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47pxdc?context=5)|Of course!
[If you weren't in the writing business, what would you see yourself doing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47pyck?context=5)|Leading wilderness trips. I'm a climber and a hiker.
[How did you come up with your 'character' that you use in your articles? And is everyone's 'character' a kind of over-exaggerated version of themselves or a certain part of their personality?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47pyxj?context=5)|It just seemed to fit really well and no one else was doing it. I can't really get away with the self effacing stuff because everyone's immediate reaction is, ""Oh, fuck you."" So I went all the way in the other direction. Also I grew up in Aspen.
[What is David Wong like? And how does one ""Squancho""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47q1ap?context=5)|David Wong is the smartest person I've ever met in my entire life. He not only catalogs information in his brain but he knows how to develop unique ideas and strange hypotheses around it. He's incredibly analytical.
[""After Hours"" is awesome and hilarious, who writes what on that show? Do you each write your parts?  Basically, how does an episode of After Hours go from Inception to what we see on screen.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47pzt6?context=5)|You can always see the writer of each episode in the credits. The writers are usually Jack O'Brien, Dan O'brien, Michael Swaim or me. Robert Brockway wrote a phenomenal episode and throughout the process of rehearsal Katie Willert does a significant amount of work as well. 
[Soren are you working on anything ouside of Cracked.com? Like a book? Or a movie? Or videos? I really loved all of your 5 minute videos on Youtube. Please do more.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47q8y2?context=5)|I wrote a book but no one wants to publish it. It's about a family that goes to the desert one summer and it gets so hot that dogs start eating each other. There's also a sexual predator who stands outside a girl's window each night. It's very funny.
[Why don't Cracked.com articles ever fit on a single page?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47pxyv?context=5)|We spread the lists across two pages because people are more likely to read something when it's bite-sized chunks. It's the same reason we write lists. There's less of a commitment when your scroller isn't the size of a pinhead, and we feel like we can win you over through the first page because our content is good. 
 |On a bigger a note, I guess I don't understand what the problem is. It's literally as easy as the push of a button to read the rest of the article. Is everyone so jaded that pushing a button sounds like too much work?
[Are there cubicles? Are they personalized? Is there photo-documentation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47pvye?context=5)|Yes, there is an ID scan so don't bother trying to break in.
[Is this because O'Brien is too shit faced to do one?   How hard is it to get started in your industry? Like, let's say I wasn't funny but had a winning smile? Anyone like that at the office?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47py6b?context=5)|I feel like this is probably an insult directed at me. But I also generally assume the world revolves around me on account of the winning smile.
[How much can you bench press? I'm going to be a little disappointed if it's not at least 100x my body weight.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47pw1b?context=5)|Two hundred and fifty thousand pounds. But I can only do three reps.
[Do you get very much man-on-the-street recognition? Swarms of fangirls swooning at your feet?  Do the girls always end up asking for Swaim's number by the end of the convo?  Can I have Swaim's number?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47qazr?context=5)|We get recognized sometimes. I get it a lot less than Dan and Michael. Crowds will form around Michael, it's incredible. I've even taken pictures for people of Michael. It's a nice humbling moment.
[Aside from your own, whose writing do you generally like the most?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47q35e?context=5)|I think Dan O'Brien and Seanbaby are consistently the funniest writers on Cracked but David Wong writes articles that will change the way you see the world. Brockway is still my favorite though because his goal is always to terrify you just a little bit while making you laugh, and I really appreciate that.
[Are there actual (non-acting) people around when you guys film After Hours? Do people ever get up in your business when you film? I would ask if internet fame has ever gotten you laid, but if your articles are any indication then that's a silly question.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47q101?context=5)|We film After Hours from about 6pm to 6am. The place is closed while we film so the only people around are crew and extas. It would be impossible to film while the restaurant was open. Not because we're famous or anything, but because plates and people are really loud.
[Did the crash of Digg have an effect on Cracked traffic at all?  Cracked was always front page when Digg was at it's peak.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47q893?context=5)|Not really. At first we saw a dip but by that point we weren't really relying on Digg for the majority of our traffic. Now if Facebook crumbled today, we would probably be in trouble.
[Why do most people on the internet seem functionally retarded?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47q809?context=5)|Because you're only seeing the worst and the worst people just happen to be loud. Just remember that nothing is personal and that there's a very specific reason everyone feels the need to troll or tear something down.
 |Unless you're including me in that statement, in which case I can't tell you for sure. Probably on account of the retardedness. 
[Are the Cracked columnists friends in real life or do you all secretly hate each other? Or openly hate each other? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47q4b0?context=5)|We are all really good friends. At least those of us who live in the same area. Sometimes Seanbaby will come down to visit and that's always fun. 
[Where do you film Cracked After Hours?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47pvdm?context=5)|We film at a restaurant called the Los Feliz Cafe in Atwater Village, Los Angeles.
[If you, Swaim, and O'Brien all had to switch bodies with each other for the rest of your lives, and you got to to decide who gets which body, what would you do? Would you choose for your own benefit, or to spite Swaim and/or O'Brien?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47q9xa?context=5)|I would do the selfless thing and let them decide, then I would take whatever was left over. I've had it pretty good until now, I think I could turn one of those other busted heaps into something useable.
 |Honestly though, Dan is more in shape and probably stronger than I am now. He runs marathons and everything. That might be an upgrade minus the freakishly long torso.
[The subjects of the articles written by you and the other writers varies so much, which topics tend to get the most interest and feedback?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47q0rv?context=5)|The ""X things you didn't know about being ______."" Do really really well because people are genuinely interested. When I write about fighting turkeys or the best kinds of monkeys, usually those aren't huge traffic drivers but I still love doing them.
[How much do you edit their article when a user submits? Is it a ""you aren't funny, let me try"" or do you leave them as is?  And also, what are some of the dumbest articles you've received? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47pzkb?context=5)|We usually work with the writers from the pitch stage so we know that they have great ideas to start with. From there, I'm always impressed with how well they understand the voice of the site and the sophistication of their humor. We've had to do completely rewrites before but we also have some articles that we barely have to touch.
[Curious to know if there is any rivalry between the east cost staff (Gladstone, ATB, e.t.c.) and yourselves on the west coast?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47qg1b?context=5)|Yes. This is heating up to be Biggie and Tupac all over again. We never learn. We never learn.
[What's your favourite porno?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47py10?context=5)|Candy Stripers.
[Do you guys have title generation software for your list articles, or is someone actually coming up with all that stuff on their own?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47pqkt?context=5)|We do not have title generation software. Each article comes to us as a pitch first. The titling happens at the end, once the article is finished and we title based on what we've seen be successful in the past.
[Any tips for those of us aspiring to contribute to cracked.com and other comedic endeavors? How do you develop a funny idea/premise into a full column that remains entertaining throughout? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47q7za?context=5)|Keep writing. If you are submitting to Cracked in our writer workshop, keep submitting. Our feedback will tell you exactly what direction you need to go. We will essentially work with you throughout your entire pitch because just turning everything down doesn't help us at all. We want you to succeed because we need to fill the slots on our front page every day.
[What topics have you wanted to address in After Hours, but have not been able to yet? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47qfdu?context=5)|All the dead moms in 90's sitcoms. Full House, My Two Dads, Blossom...think about it.
[How much do you guys get paid, how do you get paid, and where does the money come from? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47q22y?context=5)|Yes, we are full-time writers/editors. All the money comes from the ads you see on the site.
[Admit it; Katie was your first kiss.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rq1yh/i_am_crackedcoms_columnist_and_editor_soren_bowie/c47q246?context=5)|Was it that obvious?

I feel like my GPA's pretty good, ~3.7, but I haven't actually held any relevant positions outside the classroom, and I feel like because of that my resume's highly lacking.  I've been wait listed and turned down for the internships I've applied to so far, and I really don't know where else to look.  Most of the traditional paths for interning, job fairs and applying through company websites, have turned up nothing.
I'm definitely interested in the biotech side of things, and very interested in brewing.  I've made a few batches of homemade wine, and I'd love to learn how to perfect the technique.  Aside from that, medical biotech definitely has my interests.  The ability to engineer a solution to a physical ailment is an awesome feat, and I would love to learn more.


I guess my questions are the following:  
- For going into industry after graduation, how important is holding an internship or a research position before then?
- If you had an internship position for the summer as an undergrad, how did you obtain it?  Was it through traditional means, or did you know someone already in the business?
- In the event that I can't get an internship, what should I try to do with my summer that would keep me going in the right direction?

TL;DR: Junior ChemE student, no summer internship, what do I do?"

Shaw](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._E._Shaw_%26_Co.) is one of the largest quantitative hedge funds out there. Everyone I've met who has worked there has had great things to say about their office culture. Those of you who participated in math contests during high school may know of them through their funding of ARML, USAMO, MOP, and the IMO.

The posting on Bruinview seems to be for a paid summer internship in New York. If you go to the [linked application website](https://www.deshaw.com/recruit/jobs/OC/UCLA), it lets you pick positions like Quant-Strats, Trading, FinOps, Corp-Dev, and IT.

The ideal candidate probably has an econ, science, or engineering related major. The Bruinview post says that they are fine with sophomores applying. I don't work at D. E. Shaw, but I'd love to see more Bruins there."

On Saturday, April 28, 2012, women and men across the United States will converge in state capitols and cities to give voice to our opposition to the oppression of women’s access to health care and women’s rights. Politicians in Washington and in legislatures across the country have been trying, and in some cases succeeding, to legislate away the rights that women have fought for and won over 40 years ago. We will not let them turn back the calendar  to the middle of the last century.

Join us as we march united against the war on women  in New York City and  celebrate the history of women in the United States. The march and rally will also provide a platform to honor national and local organizations struggling to support women and to advocate for equal rights as well as  local and state government officials who stand with us in opposition to the current social agenda aimed at reducing women’s rights.

WHEN: Saturday, April 28, 2012

REGISTER: 11:00 AM – Noon(Location TBD)

MARCH: 12:00 – 1:00 PM (Route TBD)

RALLY: 1:00 – 3:00 PM, Foley Square

RSVP for our event - www.unitewomenny.org

We will have opportunities for outside sponsors, businesses, and organizations to promote their causes. If your organization is interested in becoming involved in an official capacity, please contact us and we will get back to you right away.

Unite Women is currently accepting volunteers and interns! If you are interested in becoming more involved in any capacity, please send your resume to UniteWomenNY@gmail.com."

Do people usually put things like that on their resume? I worked pretty hard and spent a lot of money to get it, so I'm fairly proud of it....

Have any of you put your PPL on a resume? What type of company were you applying for?

I'm trying to get an idea of whether or not this is a common thing to do. The lady in my student career services building said I was the first one to ask about that, she had no idea.

How?,ItWorksInTheShower,medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/rqocu/research_in_medical_school_when_how/,"I am a first year at the moment. I somewhat nonchalantly applied to a summer research internship at my school, as I could not specify an area in which I had a notable interest. I have a substantial amount of undergraduate research experience, but at the time I submitted my application I could not come up with anything concrete on which to focus, and I unfortunately received a rejection notice today.

I have since fostered a particular interest in clinical neurology and neurosurgery, and I feel I could now present a more enthusiastic demeanor. My question is, should I start volunteering myself for unpaid positions this summer or are there typically enough opportunities for research after the summer between 1st and 2nd year for me to take this summer off and relax?"

2. Who were the people that outraged you the most in your interviews, but required you to keep your cool.
3. Have you ever been scared for your life in an interview?
4. Who has been the favorite (person/group of people) that you have interviewed.

I wanted to start this thread to be a constructive discussion of what Syfy should be. I know most people (including me sometimes) are frustrated with the channel, but I want to concentrate on real solutions. What things can be done to make the channel what it SHOULD be.

I ask because I am in the television industry and am a huge Sci-Fi fan. I'd love to spend my career working on great science fiction programming and hopefully we can influence Syfy to be the channel we all want it to be. 

If we get good constructive suggestions, I will attempt to share them with my contacts at the network.

So, I'm a 23 year old near-college-graduate who's gotten a bit lucky with hard work, and has landed an internship. I'm not always expected at the office, and the attire is ""business casual"" (Nice shirt, tie optional, trousers, nice shoes)

- may have closed some doors initially but hard work and getting experience through internships is the ticket out of the rut

- Be aggressive with your application process.  Don't wait around to hear from a particular employer.

- Focus on the things you are good at and make sure the interviewers know you are confident in those areas.

rtjj5,4,2012-04-04,One month later,[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/rtjj5/one_month_later/,"It's me... Again...

Today was an interesting day. It started with me sending out a couple of e-mails, making a couple of plans, and enrolling in a couple of extra classes to try and get my life back on track. I am trying to get into some research at my University, and I am trying to retake some classes that I did poorly in to boost my GPA over the summer. Doing smart person things, and I felt great this morning when I was getting it all lined up.

For those of you who don't know, 21M, she was 19F. Dated for 3 years, I was in love with her, we wanted to spend the rest of our lives together. My life wasn't on track though, I was slacking, and she wasn't. I was holding her back. 

Part of me is glad that she broke up with me, because that smack in the face from reality is made me realize my life has been slipping and if I want to do anything with it I need to step up and take control of my life. Hence spending a couple hours this morning figuring out plans and talking with people about classes and research.

Today was a strange day. I felt really good about myself this morning, I thought ""I am finally doing all the things I needed to do a while ago. It is a little late now to change anything with R, but I will better myself, become a better person, and then who knows what is in store for me? But if I better myself, better things will come my way.""

Then about an hour ago, I was thinking about R, as I still always do. I wasn't upset, I even noted to myself ""Ya know, I don't feel that bad right now. My chest hurts a little bit, but I've gotten used to that, and I can live with the pain.""

Half an hour ago I start cooking dinner, just spaghetti since I am going to work out tonight, I will have a bigger dinner after that but I didn't want to stuff myself before working out.

Fifteen minutes ago I finished preparing, put it on a plate, sat down at the table, and started crying. And now I'm crying again. I got tears all over my glasses I can't fucking see right now so I apologize for spelling mistakes.

What I am thinking right now:

&gt; What the fuck is wrong with me? I was fine just an hour ago, I was *happy* yesterday? I haven't cried over this in about 2 weeks, I haven't actually had tears in my eyes in 3. I just miss her so fucking much. I had her for 3 years, I lost her because I put off doing these things that she wanted me to do for myself because she CARED about me, that I am doing now, and I am actually enjoying bettering myself. Why the fuck didn't I do them before? I am so pissed at myself right now. I miss her. I miss sleeping next to her. I don't sleep well by myself. I don't fall asleep until a long time after I've gone to bed, and I always wake up before my alarm clock wakes me. It has been exactly 1 month since we broke up, and I broke down on the floor. I have a job now, I am enrolled in classes, I have a meeting tomorrow to find out about some internships or research I can get myself into. My life is on track now and yet I don't have the one thing that I actually fucking wanted. I've made new friends, I've become better friends with the rest, except for one of my best friends who has all but ignored me since this happened. I don't think he means it, I think he is just bad at emotional issues and thus ignores it and thus me. However I would rather have an awkward conversation with someone rather than be completely ignored.
&gt;
&gt;I just want to fucking cuddle with her, but I know that isn't possible anymore, and probably never will be. How can I get over this if I can go from just casually thinking about her but feeling fine to feeling like the day after she broke up with me and all I did was sit on the couch and cry all day in literally 15 minutes. I don't know what I am doing with my life. I am trying to get my life on track. But the one thing I always expected to be around, to be there for me, got fed up and left me. How much longer will this last?
&gt;
&gt;I've had thoughts and ideas pop into my mind every once in a while. Thoughts and ideas I don't want to think about, ones that I promised myself I would never think about, and ones that I yelled at myself for thinking.

I'm sure I'll be fine in a few hours after I've worked out with my team. But still, this was just the weirdest, and one of the scariest things that has ever happened to me.

Now if you will excuse me I have to go clean off my glasses so I can continue studying."

At the end of the interview we basically decided to try to work something out with a research program I'm in so that I would be working for them but not for the duration of a full internship. If this didn't work out, I would go on board with them for the full internship position. After I left I realized how ridiculous and confusing I was being so I sent her an email asking to just go on full time in the internship program.

Still haven't heard back from her but I really need to get back to the first internship people that offered me a position. I'm worried that if I tell internship #1 I found something else, internship #2 will decide not to give me the full position and I'll be left with nothing. Should I risk it?"

I'm a sophomore CS major. Much to my dismay, I've so far been unable to land an internship this summer. I think I've gotten close a few times, but haven't quite been able to seal the deal. I'm feeling a bit discouraged because I spent a lot of time over the past few months sending applications &amp; interviewing with different companies.

I have a pretty good GPA (~3.5), I'm attending a well regarded university, and I'm a full semester ahead in the CS track. However, my lack of real world programming experience seems to be my Achilles heel.

What I need are ideas for things to do over the summer to help ensure that I'll be able to land an internship next summer. I really don't want to end up graduating without an internship under my belt... Unfortunately, I'll probably end up having to work a typical min wage summer-job, but hopefully I'll have a little time to invest in a programming project.

My idea was that after school here, move to the UK for cheaper post grad school (looking for a PhD in Economics, or maybe a Masters), and also to get out of the US. But i have no idea how this works. I remember my mom saying that for you to really be recognized as a citizen in the UK, you actually have to live there for about a year to get all the benefits. 

I'm also thinking about just moving to England after i graduate, and either trying to land a basic job with my Bachelors, or trying to get an internship at a relevant company to my major. Grad schools seem to like it if you don't go directly into your post grad work, so moving to England for a year before to get used to the culture, and to get myself settle could be a good plan. Where would one go to find jobs/internship openings within the UK, specifically for economics?

Thoughts?"
rsyv9,55,2012-04-04,Difficulty finding entry-level position ,[deleted],engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/rsyv9/difficulty_finding_entrylevel_position/,"Hey all! 

So I graduated in 2010 with a degree in Manufacturing Engineering. After graduation, I moved back home and took a position doing product design with a start-up company. The job was unpaid, but I had hoped as things progressed there would be more room for growth. That turned out not to be the case, and after about a year I had to move on, since equity does not pay any bills. 

Currently I'm working as an intern (unpaid) at a firm in NYC. In the past few months I've made it pretty far (2nd/3rd interviews) in the hiring process at three different companies only to be told three different times that ""the hiring manager has decided to pursue other candidates whose experience....blahblah"". 

Don't get me wrong, I never thought this process would be easy. But I also never thought that almost two years out from graduation I'd be living at my parents' house, struggling to find someone to pay me. It's frustrating to see my friends from school who majored in PR, PoliSci, English, and Film all manage to find jobs and move out relatively quickly. 

I guess I just needed to get that off my chest. Anybody having similar experiences? Anyone have advice for a struggling grad? 

Thanks for reading :) 

EDIT: Wow! I really only posted this to vent some of the frustrations I've encountered searching for jobs the past few months and honestly didn't expect so many people to jump into the conversation. 

Anyway, I've read all of your comments and appreciate everybody taking the time to write out their advice. I'm confident that I'll be able to find a job, but it seems that if I want to stay here it will take a little longer than I had anticipated. "
rsyn1,4,2012-04-04,"Should I quit my job, and if so, how?",Death2DrunkSasquatch,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/rsyn1/should_i_quit_my_job_and_if_so_how/,"I am a full time student in Law School, just finishing my second year. I got an internship for the summer at a Malpractice Insurance Company, and will be doing that full time.  
  
I have been working 20 hrs/week doing charitable gambling sales for a local nonprofit. It pays minimum wage plus tips (which have dropped in the past 2 years from averaging $80/shift to $20/shift). The nature of the job requires evening and weekend shifts, which has prevented me from socializing with my friends and attending family functions.  
  
Most of my friends in school don't work, and with the internship I will be making nearly double what I am making at my current job. I will be able to save up for the summer, and live off of that money and student loans, allowing me to focus more on my last year of school. I'm also unsure if I will continue the internship in the fall, and if so, can't afford the time commitment of both jobs.  
  
So...I'm wondering, if you were in my position, would you quit your job, or try and work at both, or just ask your boss not to schedule you until future notice?  
  
How would you go about talking to your boss about it?

I see stuff like this all the time:

[The Founding Fathers believed, and the evidence still shows, that industriousness, marriage and religion are a very important basis for male empowerment and achievement. We may need to say to a number of our twenty-something men, ""Get off the video games five hours a day, get yourself together, get a challenging job and get married."" It's time for men to man up.](http://www.cnn.com/2011/10/04/opinion/bennett-men-in-trouble/index.html)

and this:

[Burress, a cute, short, African American 24-year-old grad student who is getting a doctor-of-pharmacy degree, had many of the same complaints I heard from other young women. Guys high-five each other when they get a C, while girls beat themselves up over a B-minus. Guys play video games in each other’s rooms, while girls crowd the study hall. Girls get their degrees with no drama, while guys seem always in danger of drifting away. “In 2012, I will be Dr. Burress,” she said. “Will I have to deal with guys who don’t even have a bachelor’s degree? I would like to date, but I’m putting myself in a really small pool.”](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/07/the-end-of-men/8135/2/)

It seems like there is this societal consensus that men who play video games are lazy, useless and un-marriageable.

I am a man. I am 22. I am married. I have two bachelor's degrees, one in Computer Science and one in Mathematics. I graduated college in three years, because I clamped down and studied super hard. I took classes spring, fall, intercession and summer, every year until I was done. I also did research which was published by BYU and attended numerous math conferences. I held a 20 hour a week, minimum wage job during my first two years, and during the third, I did a 20 hour a week corporate internship.

During all of that, if I didn't play at least 4 hours of video games a day, it was a bad day. I usually played SNES and NES games on my retro-duo. Kung Fu and Killer Instinct got played through more times than I can count.

I was being actively courted by graduate schools for math when I finished my degrees, but decided to go into the workforce. Upon graduating, I took a job as a software developer. My starting salary was $62k/yr. With my first paycheck, I bought wedding rings, paid a an Italian restaurant to feed everyone at the wedding reception and bought an xBox 360 and a Kinect. I married my girlfriend of several years pretty quickly thereafter, and began paying her college tuition so she could have a degree too. I pay all the bills, she studies, maintains our apartment and cooks meals. Sometimes I work crazy hours, but every day, when I get back from work a couple of hours either go to StarCraft II, World of Tanks or something on the 360.

Last year, I started my own business. Pretty quickly I was down about $3k. I held with it for four profitless months, then started making pretty good money. Now I'm up $70k. If things get much better, I'll quit the software developer job and work on my business full time.

Through that whole adventure, I played Halo III with my wife and my old roommate every night and drank many beers.

Don't try to tell me that playing videogames is a problem or that it leads to lazy unsuccessful men. Video games are what my generation likes to do. Surprise, surprise, different generations have different pass times.

**tl;dr:** It's a bad week if I don't game as much as I worked and I'm pretty damn alpha."

heart",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/rsjz4/opportunity_of_a_lifetimebut_about_to_break_my/,"Me: 22. Her: 22. Been together just over 10 months now.

I met her while I was doing my undergrad in California. She's a bartender, no college experience. Physically, she's unbelievable. The hottest thing I've ever touched. At first she could be a bitch, but after she realized that I was a nice guy, she let me in. She's the sweetest girl in the world, would do anything for me. We love each other. 

I recently graduated college and moved back in with my parents, about an hour north of her. We've kept things going LDR for 4 months now. I'm doing an internship, looking for a paying job. 

She's bartending and saving money. She lived with her parents until just recently, then moved into a friends' house due to family problems.

Our goal has been to save money and move in together in the city. She often tells me things like ""I'd go anywhere for you"", ""you are my goal"" It's so fucking sweet, and I love it, it makes me feel special and important. But I know it's not healthy, she needs goals independent of me. 

If I could get a fantastic job now, I'd get us an apartment and make it work. 

I just got accepted to a very prestigious university in Europe for grad school. Never told her I applied...never thought I'd get in. It would be crazy to turn this down.

I don't leave until August. I cried today thinking of what our conversation would be like when I told her the news. I know it would just destroy her. She loves me so much, and I love her too. 

I have 4 months left in the states...when should I tell her? I know she will want to break up as soon as I tell her. LDR is pretty much out of the question. 

I guess I know what I need to do, but I just don't want to do it. I don't want to break her heart, I'm the only one she's loved like this. I've had my heart broken before and I don't want to do that to someone I love.

I'm looking for advise on how to break it to her. She is obsessed with me...and I've loved that, until now. This is going to turn her whole world upsidedown. I'm sure she would marry me if i asked. I feel so bad. I want to leave her better off than she was when she met me. She never went to college, but always talks of going back. 
I feel bad for not telling her I applied, and for not living up to her expectations of our relationship. I know it will be a shitshow when I tell her, she will be absolutely crushed -- it came out of no where! I want to cause her as little pain as possible.

TLDR: got accepted into prestigious university overseas, it means the end of our relationship. "

I'm originally from Columbus, OH, which is where you and your girlfriend (now wife, I believe?) spent time for the episode of 30 Days that talks about living on minimum wage. Since all the other questions I wanted to ask have been asked in the AMA so far, I am wondering if you have any salient memories about your time in Ohio, or stories about what it was like trying to live with next to nothing... if I recall, this was before the minimum wage was increased, so I think you guys were making like $5 something an hour. What was it like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rrhx2/i_am_morgan_spurlock_time_to_ask_me_anything/c482di0?context=5)|Was difficult making that show.  My girlfriend and I have since split up, my work being one of the contributing factors, but I love Ohio.  We've shot there many times.  I think its a great representation of the country, so we will shoot things there because I think they translate well to a large audience.
[Wow, thanks for responding! Sorry to hear about you and your lady :-\  I agree that Ohio is very representative of the everyman, we used to get a lot of product trials in Columbus because it apparently provides a good cross-section of consumer acceptance of a new product or service. Apparently we also have generic accents.   Just out of curiosity, what do you think about the minimum wage increases? I remember making $5.15 an hour working at Radio Shack in the late 90s, and I find it unconscionable that it didn't increase until 2007 (at least on the national level). Do you think it should increase more than it does/has?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rrhx2/i_am_morgan_spurlock_time_to_ask_me_anything/c482maz?context=5)|It can always be more, and some states are already higher than federal, but its still really low.

I dont have much job experience and not great at making resumes so i was wondering if someone could help. Ive listed all my course work regardless of relevance just so i dont miss anything.

People at about my level at drexel have been applying to some major firms around Philadelphia such as susquehanna, blackrock, peco, saw, and so on. I attached the resume i use to use just for small time jobs around home and high school but its not really at the appropriate level. Any help would be great and any advice on how to go about applying to a major firm as an intern would be great cause personally outside of coop i dont really understand how a major firm would hire someone like me (no experience and a second year college student) (also apologize for any grammar or spelling mistakes kinda up late doing work and tired).

I recently started a new internship and I am being asked to do some things that are way outside my range of knowledge. I will try to explain as best as I can.

What I am looking at is comparing two average results from different branches from 2003 and 2005. However, some branches lack results from 2003, and some rows lack from 2005. When a branch lacks a result from 2003 it usually means it hadn't opened, and I need excel to report ""not opened"", and when it lacks a result in 2005, it usually means it closed and I need to report ""Closed"".

If there are data for both years, I need to compare them and have excel report whether the data in 2005 shows an improvement or if it has declined. 

My boss wants me to write different macros for this, and have the macro highlight the row in which each (""not yet opened"", ""closed"", ""improved"", ""declined"") occur.

I've literally spent 8 hours online trying to figure this out, but I've never used excel before so I'm having a really hard time.

Let me know if my explanation doesn't make sense, and I'll try to explain better.

And it's great and I'm proud of her, but can't help but be extremely jealous.  A little back story; her and I met in college. We had the same major, but she was a year behind me. Basically, I have been out of school for over a year and still haven't been able to land a job (right now the only thing I have is tutoring). She graduated this past December and within 3 months got a job through the internship she had. I know it's petty, and I should only be happy and proud of her but my jealousy issues are overwhelming me. I absolutely hate it, and I feel like a terrible BF for it.  I don't know how to control these issues and convince myself to stop being jealous.  It's unfortunately seeped out and she knows I'm jealous, but holds no grudges against me nor is she upset with me.  Some days I'm better than others, but today it was pretty bad. I have vamped up my job search and send out resumes and make calls every day. I've gotten bites and interviews, but nothing has stuck. I feel as if the only way for me to get over my issues is when I finally land a job.  I'm just looking for advice or tips on how to control my jealousy.

Aside from this our relationship is fine, this hasn't even really caused many issues between us because she's so understanding.  It's more problems within myself.

ruza4,5,2012-04-05,Day 1 ... Thank you /r/leaves for opening my eyes so I could reassess my situation,StrangeDaze17,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ruza4/day_1_thank_you_rleaves_for_opening_my_eyes_so_i/,"Hello all,

I wanted to post my story as a way to vent, and also to show my appreciation to this subreddit - which ultimately forced me to take a look at my habit and reassess my situation.

It all started freshman year of college. My dorm roommate was getting into MJ and me being the adventurous type, I figured I'll give it a try. From there I only would smoke on special occasions, most of my efforts were concentrated on getting hammered and living college life to the ""fullest"" in that respect. Despite the heavy partying, I was still able to make deans list for both semesters that year. Then sophomore year came and I moved into a house with my dorm roommate and a couple other friends from high school. EVERYONE was toking up regularly except me..because I was pre-med and I needed to get shit done. Well, needless to say that didn't last long..before I knew it I was smoking everyday, playing lots of Halo. Hell, our house was renamed ""the cave"" because it was usually dark, musty and smoky ALL the time. Each semester my grades went lower, and my motivation to succeed diminished. Also, from experience various clubs and volunteering activities I decided I did NOT want to go to med school. Im sure MJ had some influence on this, but in hindsight I am really glad I decided not to pursue med school. Anyway, this gave me the excuse to smoke more..My train of thought went from ""Med school here I come!"" to "" wellll ... As long as I graduate I'll be fine"". Luckily for me, I had enough brain power to receive passing grades w/o EVER going to class. At the end of my junior year I hit bottom..but there was light .. I scored an internship with a respected Pharma company, and I met my wife.. Because of fear of a drug test and my new romance, I was easily distracted from MJ. I quit cold turkey. I would smoke once every few months if I was around old friends but that's it -- it stayed this way for about 2 years. 

In late 2009 I got reacquainted with an old college buddy who was just getting into it. We would hangout once a week and smoke. It was not long before I convinced my fiancé that it was OK for me to do it at the house. 

Here is where it gets interesting.. I have been vaping pretty much everyday since the start of 2010 - except for several extended vacations and work travel. Weird thing is, during this time, I have really advanced my career, invested in real estate, and broadened my knowledge in Music (I play), politics, economics, and science. It's almost like MJ has reinvigorated my love for learning new things. I have not neglected relationships either..And last year I lost over 50 lbs from good eating and lots of exercise. It almost seems that 2011 was my most accomplished year..in fact a lot of friends and family look up to me as an accomplished individual..but then again, none of them know exactly HOW MUCH I smoke. 

It's weird, in my mind, it seems like a problem, but the results do not tell the same story. This subreddit has really helped me identify some issues I am having:

* I depend on it for sleep. Can't fall asleep fast without it.
* find myself in the reward loop .."" well if I do this, then I can smoke""
* I am more irritable when I do not smoke
* think about toking up a lot!
* guilty conscience sometimes when I smoke

I guess before I saw this subreddit, I had the mindset of, ""we'll MJ isn't a REAL drug, it's basically harmless."" and ""well it is better than drinking, who needs all those calories"". However, after reading some stories on here it really opened my eyes to the fact that people do really struggle with MJ addiction.

I have been thinking of taking a break or possibly giving it up for good over the past couple weeks. I stumbled upon this subreddit last night, and to my dismay discovered that, I proabably do have a problem. I immediately decided not to smoke before bed, and then I flushed what MJ I had left down the toilet this morning. 

So here I am, day 1 of an extended t-break or perhaps giving it up forever. Wish me luck! I fear that stopping this time around will be more difficult because I don't have the major distraction/replacement I had back in college.

Thank you everyone for sharing your stories and experiences, it truly is a great thing to have a community like this. Comments and questions are welcome!

I graduated in November 2011 with my BA in human development, and a concentration in cognitive psychology.

I have recently began searching for graduate schools, which I would begin in Fall 2013.

I have a strong interest in cognitive psychology, neuropsychology, and neuroscience.  I would love to be involved with helping and rehabilitating individuals with traumatic brain injuries.  How would I go about looking for graduate programs?  Should I be searching for clinical psychology, cognitive psychology, neuropsychology?  I am also not sure if I should lean toward MA or MS?

I should add that I am currently in the premature stages of an internship that is researching the onset of Alzheimer's disease and I am also looking for a part-time job that will help supplement my degree (and look good on my resume).  I've been trying to network like crazy as well... (because it pretty much *is* all about who you know). 

Is there any other advice you can give me so I can feel a little bit better about being stuck in this rut?

rutgt,7,2012-04-05,Need some advice...,Protagoris,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/rutgt/need_some_advice/,"First, we are an American couple. My SO is a little over 20 weeks pregnant now. I'm currently in a masters program for secondary education, and frankly don't have enough time to work. Especially when my internship and student teaching starts this fall.  Currently my parents help me (because they can, and they're wonderful) to cover all the bills. My SO lives with me, and works full time at a daycare.  However, the job is an hours drive to and from every day on a toll road, and with gas prices right now she spends anywhere from 100-125 dollars in travel every week.  Also, daycare work pays about 8 dollars an hour. It's not great. So she basically pays her car payment, gas, tolls, insurance, credit cards, and student loans, and barely has anything left over.

Every day she comes home depressed and too tired to do anything. I do all the cooking, most of the cleaning. I don't mind doing all this work to take care of her. I see it as part of my duty as her SO, but she feels guilty for not being bale to help more.

She hates her job, dreads it, and cries almost every day because of it.  She's afraid of what all this stress and depression is doing to our baby, and her own health.

Her contract with the school is up late May, but every day it seems like she is about to quit. The only problem is, if she quits, she can't cover her finances. I have some savings and my parents can help for awhile, but it can only go so far. I already feel bad for not being able to just take care of her, and that I'm having to sustain us off my parents.  My SO doesn't help with rent, food costs, and I cover her phone bill. (Don't get the impression that I'm complaining. I don't mind any of this, do my best to not make her feel guilty, do everything I can to support her).

On weekends she's a completely different person. Excited, full of life, and energy.

I'm afraid of her pushing herself too much, and I worry about her being on a busy high way for two hours a day in a fairly small car. If she quits she's afraid no one else will hire her, and that she wont be able to get unemployment.

We're thinking about asking her doctor for some sort of note, but not sure on how to go about it.

Has anyone else been in this situation? Does anyone have advice?

TL;DR - My SO hates her job and it seems to ruin her mental health. Afraid of not being hired, not getting unemployment, and may ask doctor for a note. Any advice?"

My culm. GPA is mediocre/bad because I switched majors and the last one really hit me hard. My 'major' GPA is a bit above 3.2, that's counting only business classes, if I counted only accounting/finance courses it  would be a bit higher, I haven't gotten anything less than a B in these courses.

Soon, it will have been a year since I made a life-altering decision. A decision that I felt was right, and I will never regret fighting for what I felt was the right thing. The side effects are what hurt worst though. When I made this decision, most of my friends left me. One stayed, but a few months ago she just quit talking to me. So I do without. My family turned their back on me as well. I have a couple of siblings left and that's all. I know it all seems so petty, but I've always been about the little things. They make me happy, but when a lot of little things go wrong, they overshadow the good. I try to focus on the good, but my mind just keeps slipping away from it.

The word ""friend"" feels very hollow now. I use it sometimes, but I don't mean it in the same way. After seeing all of my ""friends"" suddenly and gradually turn on me, it's hard to build up a relationship with anyone now. I haven't had a girlfriend in a year and really haven't had the desire to be in a relationship either.
There are a lot of people who look up to me. They see the big accomplishments that I've done, and I am grateful for that. I see them too and they make me feel good, but I just break up like this sometimes. I feel like a skyscraper whose foundation is crumbling. No one sees the foundation, they just see the big accomplishments. Meanwhile, I'm deteriorating beneath.

No, I don't want to die. But my life feels useless. Hollow. I have limited relationships with the people around me. I've been working to better myself by going to college and applying for internships, public speaking, appearing on podcasts and radio shows and trying to turn my initially bad experience a year ago into something positive, but my life doesn't feel right. I have meaning in my life, don't get me wrong. I just have no connections with people. I work four days a week, play video games the rest of the days, and only interact with housemates.

I miss having a friend to talk to. A lot of people offer assistance, but it doesn't compare. I don't know them and I don't want to for some reason. I want someone I can connect with, and for now I just feel disconnected from everyone. I guess I'm done whining."

I wake each day looking forward to only the moment that I can lay down again and go to sleep. I find that my happiest moments during the day occur during that brief period of relief before my eyes shut.

I'm a sophomore in a very expensive university right now, and I thoroughly feel that I have wasted my life. My grades have been on the low side of mediocre, and I think that the majors that I have since switched to will leave me as one of the many chronically unemployed degree holders in this country. I'm not a member or contributor to any bit of the social life on campus. I have only a handful of acquaintances here. I haven't landed any internships - haven't even put in the effort for applying to them out of the very reasonable expectation that I'll be declined.

I've descended to the point that I no longer attend class regularly because I simply haven't the energy or willpower to rouse myself and walk those 50 steps to the classroom. I ignore assignments and disregard homework. My motivation for schoolwork seems to have wholly disappeared.

I wasn't always this way. I used to be extremely driven in high school, and though I have always been socially anxious, kept a a reasonable number of close friends with whom I generally had a pretty fun time with, and had an avid interest in literature and science. Although I have always struggled with long bouts of depression and anxiety, it seems that my entrance to college has only worsened these problems.

My personal interests have dulled and have been largely thrown aside. When I pick up a book or begin to sketch out a picture, I no longer find the enjoyment that I once had. I feel completely out of my social element here and suffer from a constant sense of inferiority. Am I as intelligent as the students around me? Am I maybe just very boring and stupid? Why don't people like me? Why do people never approach me to speak to me? Is there something inherently ""off"" about me?

Every day, the possible methods run themselves through my head like a comforting litany. I could find some cyanide somewhere. I could buy a rope and go into the woods. I could find a high place to jump from or find a gun or slit my wrists - the possibilities are many. But I'll probably never do it, I conclude, because I am a coward. Because as an atheist, the prospect of an eternal void terrifies me. And yet, these obsessive thoughts continue, somehow deeply comforting me as a convenient end solution and a way of escaping responsibility.

Suicide is selfish. I try to tell myself so.

I have a brilliant, beautifully understanding and comforting boyfriend who is my only source of comfort in this place. I have friends who would probably be at least shocked and horrified with my death. I have a family to whom I owe masses of support (both financial and emotional) to. I have a really great RA currently who would probably lose his position if one of his residents decided to off herself.

And yet, I twist these sources of comfort into incentives.

My boyfriend deserves far better than me - he deserves someone who is truly up to his caliber and who is able to support him as much as he supports me. He doesn't need a cling little bitch to constantly pat on the head. My parents have wasted too much money already by sending me to this university and have gotten little to show for it. I've always been the ""failure child"", the one whom my sister has been explicitly told not to imitate, lest she ""turn out like me."" My friends have moved on, into larger circles and away from me. I am probably nothing more than an afterthought. My RA...well yeah, that's going to be pretty shitty for him. Sorry.

I don't know if this is even a legitimate post for this subreddit. Maybe this is nothing more than an extenuated whine for attention. Maybe all I was looking for was a few pats on the head. But these thoughts persist to the point that they linger daily as small reminders, and I don't know what to do about them. 

I'm tired. I'm really just very tired at this point.

This was a pretty long post. Sorry for taking up your time if you did end up reading the whole thing. And thanks."

I hope you all are well. I am a Psychology major and will also be adding on a second major of Cultural Anthropology. I am a nontraditional student and I'm trying to make some decisions about after I earn my BA in 2013. 

1. I've been toying with the idea of possibly doing an online PhD program in Psychology at Walden University. While I think this may be a good fit, the whole idea of the cost is scaring me! Any idea how to avoid swimming in debt?

2. Internships: I have not found a lot of success in finding an internship that would not involve me going away for a few weeks... (As I explained, I'm a nontraditional student. I'm 30, married and have a family)

Social Psychology has been the area that's really interested me yet Clinical Psychology also seems interesting. Should I leap with both feet and attempt the program at Walden that will allow you to earn a Masters while earning a PhD or should I just try for an MA now, then go for a PhD later, if I am still interested.

I hope my post is clear, but if not please be kind, it's 3am and I'm a little sleepy... (go figure, right?!?!)

Now, my situation is kind of weird. I got the internship back in January, but due to some depression problems, I had to withdraw from school for the Spring 2012 semester, essentially missing 4 MSE classes worth of knowledge that I could apply this summer at my internship. 

I feel like my knowledge in the field is small, and I'm worried that my employer thinks I know a lot more than I actually do. I have a very high GPA and I'm in the honors program at my university (Tier 1 public university), but this doesn't translate to having substantial engineering knowledge. 

Do you learn a lot on the job, or do you apply knowledge from school in these types of internships?  I am an extremely fast learner and I do believe I can learn on the job very quickly, but if it's applying knowledge, I feel like I don't have enough knowledge to offer. What should I expect? Is there a chance I'll be fired? 

***TL;DR*** I feel like I don't know enough for my internship. Will I learn on the job or am I screwed?

I'm a college student and I got an offer for an Internship on a tech company on SF.
I'm interested on knowing the city and I plan to stay since 5~6 of June, to mid September.
I am looking for a nice room or apartment near Embarcadero and Mission, however within walking distance (2~3 Km) is fine too.

**About me:**
I like cats, but I don't mind dogs or other clean pets. I dislike tobacco. I can live a minimalistic life though good Internet, a nice bed and a nice chair are a must have. No need for parking, bike parking a plus. I am a native Spanish speaker, know a bit of Japanese, and I'm willing to learn other languages; a roommate who is bilingual or multilingual is cool! I can cook some stuff, and an equipped kitchen is a plus. I like photography so having a dark room is a heavensent, also low humidity is a nice perk.

I'm straight, but LGBT friendly; don't mind for occasional 420, no hard drugs, I don't care for your religious views as long as you don't mind mine (Agnostic Atheist). I love to friendly argue and discuss any important or non important subject.

**The Moneys issue**:
Depending on the area, I am thinking of paying ~1k but lower (and higher) rents and shares are welcome.

Feel free to PM if you're interested, or just want to say hello."

I'm just looking for some thoughts/opinions from you guys (preferably people who have had to take a hair test or know of somebody who has), and if you think i would be in the clear by that time. 

tl;dr; Last time i smoked was Feb 8th and only a small amount (a bowl or two), have a hair follicle drug test sometime in may. Thoughts on if I will be good to go or not?

Here's my story, I got accepted for a very well paying computer science internship for this summer at a fortune 100 company, and I stopped my daily 'after 10pm' MFLB sessions of 2-3 inhales a night in preparation for the pre-employment drug test 6 weeks from now (and also for focusing on school). The weed is not a real big issue, it's inconvenient that I can't vape a little weed after ~8 hours of straight studying and going to bed with a tired out mind, but I obviously HAVE to pass this test and I know my priorities so I know with time this goes away. The thing is, is that every night since I stopped, I've been having dreams related to acid, shrooms, drug tests, hash oil, etc. I'm not used to remembering my dreams so much because I used to always fall asleep high, but it's been a common recurrence that all my dreams are related to drugs in one way or another. Last night I had a dream my drug test was supposed to happen at that very moment in time, and although I could possibly pass the weed test, I was worried about failing the amphetamines test for taking aderall the day before. Another dream I had decided to eat an eighth of shrooms, while being at my house with my parents around asking me to do chores for them, which also had me worried.

A key factor that plays a role in these dreams and something I should mention, is that a week AFTER my drug test and a week BEFORE my internship begins, there is a huge music festival I've been anticipating for a while. I plan to spend the weekend of the festival in a totally different dimension, mescaline one day, shrooms another, candyflipping the last. I've bought all this stuff in advance, and it's all tucked away in a safe 20 miles away at home. I do plan on smoking that weekend, having taken the drug test the week before, but once I begin my internship and thus beginning my future career, I can't say weed will be in my life anymore and I plan to quit for good. I don't look like a hippie, nor do I act like one, and I don't want to be doing the things I've been doing at my age for the next stage of my life, so I've come to accept it.

I'm being distracted all day thinking about this festival, and once I sleep I am literally dreaming it too. I'm not sure what I'm trying to ask you guys, other than how do I keep this off my mind."

Long story short, he moved out of state last year. Since he was the real motivational driver to do these things (always been a gamer myself) I find myself in a quandary as to how I could motivate myself to do these things on my own or a comparable activity to fill the void. So far I've come up with three options:

A) I could man up and go it alone. 

B) Maybe a companion, specifically a dog, who could partially take the place of my brother as adventure encouragement to get back into the wilderness (though my brother was more the leader and I the tag along). 

C) Give up and just play video games like last summer.

**What I think:**

A) Going it alone seems like the most practical solution, except that I find myself giving up and admitting defeat rather easily without some outside encouragement. I know all about the 'set your mind to it', 'man up and do it', but past experience has shown my resolve probably won't see it through.

B) Getting a dog is certainly one of my goals ever since my brother's/mine died while I was a junior in high school. They are awesome adventuring companions. The problem is that during fall and spring semesters I really don't have the time to properly care for a dog. Is it okay to get a dog, but semi abandon it for 40-60 hours of the week when school starts up again? Are there any FAers who have had a dog and not had a problem with leaving it alone for long periods of time during the week? Any tips on raising a dog not to have seperation anxiety when you aren't capable of giving it a large amount of time?


C) I don't have a problem with playing video games all summer, I rather like them. Lately they just haven't had the same draw as they use to.

I guess I just wanted to see what reddit thinks or if you guys have any additional insight in how to fill up the free time of summer? I do have some summer classes and hopefully an internship, so its unlikely I'll be able to travel (or I would go stay with my brother for the summer). 

What other options do I have?

I wanted to share this with you guys, although I'm not sure how interesting it is to people other than me. It's relevant for journalists or anyone else looking to build their resume.

I wrote music reviews and the occasional feature as an intern for Performer Magazine in 2010. There were no problems, whatsoever. My writing was printed verbatim (a bit weird in itself), and the EIC and I got along fine. It was a remote internship, as I live in Washington and Performer is an East Coast publication.

After my internship, I asked for a letter of reference (what else is an unpaid internship good for?). The Editor in Chief said he would get it to me the following week. At first I was very patient, but he never delivered. Weeks passed, possibly months before I wrote him again. He told me had, in fact, already written my letter and that he would email it to me as a .pdf after he wrapped up the current issue of Performer. I wanted to ask why he didn't just attach the letter in the email he was writing to me at the time, but I simply said ""sure,"" and waited some more. That was several months ago — the last I ever heard from them. I have called and written them numerous times to no response over the months.

My new employer, lacking a letter of reference to check after my job interview, called Performer Magazine and left a message. They never returned my employer's message. I have no idea why Performer started avoiding me, but they left me high and dry when i needed a reference.

A couple days ago, after more unanswered emails and calls, I realized I was never going to get a reference from them. So, I took to posting on their facebook page. Nothing offensive, no swearing, just kind of bugging them. I knew they weren't going to give me any letter at this point, but I also knew they couldn't do anything to me. Every time I posted a comment, Performer deleted it immediately. Stuff like ""What would you do if I actually showed up to your office? Would you hide behind the curtains until I walked away?"" or, ""I wonder how long it will take for this to be deleted?"" got removed within minutes. Pretty uneventful, sure, until...

LO AND BEHOLD, Yesterday I got a response to one of my wall posts! It went as follows: ""Kevin, our company wishes to have no further communication with you. Please stop calling, emailing and posting to our social media sites. Further attempts by you to contact us will be ignored.""

...and then they deleted that post as well. I took a screenshot this time, it's in the album.

**TL; DR: 6 MONTHS OF FREE WORK AND PERFORMER MAGAZINE WON'T EVEN GIVE ME A REFERENCE, EVEN AFTER CLAIMING THEY ALREADY WROTE IT FOR ME. THEY IGNORED ALL MY ATTEMPTS TO CONTACT THEM OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS, AND THEY NEVER RETURNED MY PROSPECTIVE EMPLOYER'S CALLS FOR A REFERENCE, EITHER.**

So, DAE want to troll Performer Magazine's facebook page? I was thinking it would be cool if everyone wrote something like ""Hey Ben, where's my reference letter?"" Or whatever tickles your fancy. If you ""Like"" Performer Magazine's facebook page, you can post on their wall. It would make my day GLORIOUS, FOR **I HATE THESE PRICKS.** *And admit it, you're bored as fuck right now.*

Yes, it is immature. But it would be really fun. And after this royal screw job, I'd say the ball's in my court.

[PROOF] For some reason, I couldn't find all the emails, but I dug up a few to show you the time span we are talking about. Also, screenshot of the facebook response they gave me.

rwyym,0,2012-04-06,Performer Magazine are lazy scumbags. Please read if you want to help me troll.,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/rwyym/performer_magazine_are_lazy_scumbags_please_read/,"Hello Reddit,

I wanted to share this with you guys, although I'm not sure how interesting it is to people other than me.

I wrote music reviews and the occasional feature as an intern for Performer Magazine in 2010. There were no problems, whatsoever. My writing was printed verbatim (a bit weird in itself), and the EIC and I got along fine. It was a remote internship, as I live in Washington and Performer is an East Coast publication. 

After my internship, I asked for a letter of reference (what else is an unpaid internship good for?). The Editor in Chief said he would get it to me the following week. At first I was very patient, but he never delivered. Weeks passed, possibly months before I wrote him again. He told me had, in fact, already written my letter and that he would email it to me as a .pdf after he wrapped up the current issue of Performer. I wanted to ask why he didn't just attach the letter in the email he was writing to me at the time, but I simply said ""sure,"" and waited some more. That was several months ago — the last I ever heard from them. I have called and written them numerous times to no response over the months. 

My new employer, lacking a letter of reference to check after my job interview, called Performer Magazine and left a message. They never returned my employer's message. I have no idea why Performer started avoiding me, but they left me high and dry when i needed a reference. 

A couple days ago, after more unanswered emails and calls, I realized I was never going to get a reference from them. So, I took to posting on their facebook page. Nothing offensive, no swearing, just kind of bugging them. I knew they weren't going to give me any letter at this point, but I also knew they couldn't do anything to me. Every time I posted a comment, Performer deleted it immediately. Stuff like ""What would you do if I actually showed up to your office? Would you hide behind the curtains until I walked away?"" or, ""I wonder how long it will take for this to be deleted?"" got removed within minutes. Pretty uneventful, sure, until...

LO AND BEHOLD, Yesterday I got a response to one of my wall posts! It went as follows: *""Kevin, our company wishes to have no further communication with you. Please stop calling, emailing and posting to our social media sites. Further attempts by you to contact us will be ignored.""*

...and then they deleted that post as well. I took a screenshot this time, it's in the album.

**TL; DR:** 6 MONTHS OF FREE WORK AND PERFORMER MAGAZINE WON'T EVEN GIVE ME A REFERENCE, EVEN AFTER CLAIMING THEY ALREADY WROTE IT FOR ME. THEY IGNORED ALL MY ATTEMPTS TO CONTACT THEM OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS, AND THEY NEVER RETURNED MY PROSPECTIVE EMPLOYER'S CALLS FOR A REFERENCE, EITHER. 

So, DAE want to troll Performer Magazine's facebook page? I was thinking it would be cool if everyone wrote something like ""Hey Ben, where's my reference letter?"" Or whatever you twisted fucks come up with. If you ""Like"" Performer Magazine's facebook page, you can post on their wall. It would make my day GLORIOUS, FOR I HATE THESE PRICKS. **And admit it, you're bored as fuck right now.**


[PROOF] For some reason, I couldn't find all the emails, but I dug up a few to show you the time span we are talking about. Also, screenshot of the facebook response they gave me.

I don't create anything sustainable, I just fill out the paperwork so people can go market sustainable products. And if you're curious - It's complete bullshit, but that's another post.

Apparently I have 0 transferable skills because everyone I've spoken too thinks sustainability consultants hug trees and pet unicorns all day. I've worked with recruiters and networked to the point of exhaustion and apparently unless I want to start over as an intern, I'm fucked. In summary, I'm freaking out, don't have money to start a separate company and I'm pretty much paycheck to paycheck to pay for my one completely worthless undergrad degree and two utterly useless master's degrees. I'm so glad the real estate market collapsed and my daddy isn't a developer.

I could use some advice first on how to calm down aside from the standard workout and sexercise and second some good resources for people floundering in their current career.

The second stage requires that I fill out some paperwork and in one section it asks if I have ever been convicted of any crime.... not just felonies. 

Rewind back to senior year 2007. I had just turned 18 and I got caught underage drinking three times... in six months. Is there any sort of way I can look up my record to see if these charges are on there? Should I be completely honest and forthcoming and just list the charges anyway? Should I try to hide them? 

My state has a system where you can pay a nominal fee and look up your record, but the processing time is around 2-3 weeks and I only have a week to turn in the paperwork."
rwxjv,12,2012-04-06,It's Finally Turning Around,smilingeveryday,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/rwxjv/its_finally_turning_around/,"Several months back, my life fell apart. Someone I really trusted threw me out like trash after confessing some form of love to me. It destroyed me. I trusted him so much. I relied on him more than I realized, and with him suddenly gone, I just couldn't keep it together. 

I was overwhelmed. All of my applications for study abroad and leadership positions were denied by my honors college even though I was overly qualified for all of them. My grandmother passed away. I ended up having to drop a class because I couldn't handle the stress. All of my friends began avoiding me because I was always so busy and irritable because all I could only ever think of the work that I needed to do. It was terrible.

My self confidence vanished. I didn't find myself attractive anymore. I hated my body. I hated everything about myself. I would cry myself to sleep every night feeling completely alone and heartbroken. My desire to write completely vanished, and with it, a piece of myself died. 

Now, six months later, I feel good about myself. I found out today that I didn't get the positions because of a fluke in the system, and I was invited to apply again next year with the promise that I would probably get the positions. One of the heads of the honors college admitted that she adored me and wanted me to be an active part in it. I've also become a major part of the Honors Congress, and I plan to join a committee and run for a position next semester. 

I changed my major to biology, and the department head is excited to get me on track so that I can take the classes that I want. He's working with me to get an internship at the local conservancy. I've started making new friends and actively going out of my way to greet people. It feels wonderful. 

I fall asleep every night with a smile on my face now, and I am genuinely happy. My life is really turning around, and today was the first day that I finally admitted it. After all of those months of hell, I'm better of then when it started. "

After visiting both programs, I can tell that if I attend UT things such as internships, finding a job, and the reputation of the program I attended will all come easily, but, I have fallen in love with USD as a school. Though unfortunately USD has a bit of a smaller CS department (30ish students) and I haven't heard really much of anything about how people in the industry view them (if at all).

So does anyone have any insight on whether or not attending USD is a good idea from a internship/job standpoint? Also, any general advice into my choice would be appreciated. I'm completely on the fence right now.

rwkqj,23,2012-04-06,"When my mother asked my therapist if he could help me work on focus &amp; follow up, he said ""That's Aspergers,"" and we should ""Probably try to get your son on disability.""",unholyprawn,aspergers,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/rwkqj/when_my_mother_asked_my_therapist_if_he_could/,"Sorry in advance as this post is mostly me venting my spleen. 

For the past 4 months, I have been seeing a new therapist to help me work on my depression and my Aspergers. So far, we have gotten my depression under control and now we are working on what is for me, (and so I have heard many with AS) is a major problem and so far the largest impediment to my success; focus &amp; follow up.

In the past month I have been doing poorly at school and have not found a new job (my prior internship ended on 3 March on good terms). Because of the relatively poor direction my life is taking, my mother thought it would be wise to reach out to my therapist in order to help me work on those two issues. The therapist told her that we would try upping the dosage of the ADHD medicine, but not to expect much because ""That's Aspergers, and we really can't do much about it."" He also suggested that we (myself, my mother, him, and his assistant) should ""Try to get your son on disability.""

I honestly don't know weather to be more enraged, upset, or disappointed. To think that a professional doctor in the heart of New York City would be so defeatist stuns me. It is common knowledge that people with AS can hold very good jobs, do well in school and so much more, and that he would just dismiss me is so wrong. Making matters worse is that he and I have only met once (normally I deal with his assistant), and during that time he kept checking his watch frequently. 

I end this post with a couple of questions.

1) Does anyone else on this subreddit have difficulty with focus and followup? If so, how have you managed to overcome this?

2) Are the beliefs held by my former therapist common?

3) Does anyone have any recommendations for a psychologist/psychiatrist/neurologist in New York City who has expertise in Aspergers/Depression/Family issues? I know it may be a stretch to ask this question, but any help is appreciated. "

I find myself often overcome with negative thoughts about my relationship, my future, my apparence, and my interaction with other people.

When I was in forth grade I was diagnosed and treated for OCD, after I became obsessed with the fear of my mom dying. I couldn't leave her site for almost a year, just barley got away with passing 4th grade because of it. Soon After I was treated, the OCD symptoms completely went away. My biggest fear is that someday Ill be triggered by something that will cause an extreme obsessive  thought like that to manifest again. 

After my symptoms went away, my family never mentioned it again. It was something that I hardly thought about. In high school I did a lot of worrying and stressing about my life, but it didn't really become something that drastically effected me till about my sophomore year of college. 

When I was about 20 I completely became withdrawn and depressed. I pretty much stopped leaving my apartment, and ended up being put on academic suspension for a semester because of my grades. After that I started to see a psychiatrist who put me on adderall. 

Adderall ended up really helping me for a while. In my semester off from college I worked a lot and saved money, and when I came back to school, things really turned around for me. Even though mentally I didn't feel perfect, I was able to accomplish a lot, and I was generally happier then before. After about a year on it, I decided to stop going to my psychiatrist because of money and somewhat because of my parents worry about me becoming dependent on it. 
Ever since I've always wondered if things would be better for me if I were back on it. Sometimes I buy a few here and there from friends, and I feel really great for a week.

 I'm at a very challenging time for me right now. I'm about to graduate from college, and I am in the process of applying to grad schools, getting my portfolio together (i'm a designer/copywriter), and applying for internships. I don't feel like Ive been emotionally stable enough to accomplish any of this right now, and they've been piling up and weighing on me more then anything ever has. 
I could go to the psychiatrist tomorrow and get adderall. I know it has worked for me in the past, but i'm convinced that my real problems are anxiety. Or I could try to be treated for my anxiety, and risk wasting precious time that I don't have right now figuring out what medications work for me, etc. 

Reddit, what should I do? I'm leaning toward going back on adderall till the end of the semester and bring up my anxiety problems in the summer, when Ill have time to experiment. 

I'd really appreciate peoples opinions, just found this subreddit, but it seems like a really great resource. "

Dreifus, a New York Times writer and an adjunct professor at Columbia University School of International and Public Affairs, and Hacker, a veteran political science professor at Queens College in New York, spent three years interviewing faculty, students, and administrators and crunching statistics for their book, Higher Education? How Colleges Are Wasting Our Money and Failing Our Kids — And What We Can Do About It. Their finding? That many of America’s colleges and universities — especially the elite — aren’t worth their tuition and serve faculty over their undergrads.

More outrageous, they say, is that tuition nationwide has jumped at more than twice the rate of inflation since 1982, so many kids graduate deeply in debt. “Tuition is probably the second-largest item you’ll buy in your lifetime, after your home,” Dreifus says. Given that, the authors suggest you consider the following as you bear down on the decision of where your child will spend the next four (or more) years.

1. Beginning adulthood without debt is worth far more than a designer diploma.

The authors’ No. 1 rule for parents: Don’t let your child go into debt for college. In 2010, almost two thirds of undergraduates borrowed money, and student-loan debt outpaced credit card debt for the first time. The College Board likes to say that a typical senior graduates with “only” $24,000 in debt, but with interest, collection charges, and penalties for postponed payments, the amounts owed can exceed $100,000. If you ever default on a federal student loan (and the rate of defaults is rising), you’ll be hounded for life. Lenders can garnish your wages, intercept your tax refunds, and have your professional license revoked. You can’t work for the government or collect your social security. “People have been sold this propaganda: ‘The rates are so low; just get a loan,’ ” Dreifus says. “The long-term effect is to cripple your children.”

2. Research universities are no place for undergraduates.

Professors at big research universities are often more interested in doing research and working with graduate students than teaching your child because their prestige (and their university’s) depends on publishing. So they tend to host huge lectures and then foist undergrads off on teaching assistants who may or may not be supervised. “At Harvard, we ran into students who said they never had a professor who had enough of a relationship with them to write a recommendation for grad school,” Dreifus says. How to avoid that? Go to a school that’s completely dedicated to teaching, like a four-year liberal arts college with little to no research. “Look for seminars where 15 to 20 people sit around a table,” Dreifus says. “The big question we want parents to ask: Is this a place that’s about developing my child’s mind?”

3. Colleges are overrun by administrators.

Student-to-faculty ratios are important, of course. But it might also be wise to ask about the proportion of administrators to students. Between 1976 and 2007, that ratio has doubled at colleges nationwide, the authors say, with bureaucrats serving in such roles as “babysitting coordinator,” “dietetic internship director,” and “residential communications coordinator.” Such services may be useful, but are they really necessary? “You should ask yourself, Is this really a college, or is this a giant multiversity with a lot of extraneous functions? Because that’s going to end up costing you,” Hacker says. “It’s a big reason tuition can now run a quarter-million dollars for four years.”

4. The star professors touted in college brochures probably won’t be teaching your kid.

Universities and colleges are increasingly relying on underpaid, part-time instructors to lead undergraduate courses. Contingent teachers, including paid-by-the-course adjunct professors, now do 70 percent of college teaching, up from 43 percent in 1975. (The elites aren’t immune: At Yale, the figure is 70 percent.) Most adjuncts don’t even have an office on campus, and because they make on average only about $3,000 a course, they often teach at three or four different colleges. “It’s hard to be a great teacher and to be there for your students when you’re juggling that many jobs,” Dreifus says.

5. The college’s best professors may not even be on campus.

Though they get their summers off and breaks during the school year, tenured faculty at many universities are encouraged to take frequent sabbaticals. What will that mean for your undergrad? At Harvard, where senior professors get a sabbatical every three years, 10 of the 48 professors in the history department — more than one in five — were off doing research in 2010/2011. During a recent year at Williams College, another school with a great reputation, a third of the professors in the religion department were on leave. If you choose a school that gives its faculty a lot of time for research, your son or daughter might find that his or her senior-thesis adviser is on sabbatical in Tuscany.

6. Don’t be seduced by the luxuries they show you on the tour.

Today’s students get suites, private bathrooms, and food courts with chefs that make sushi and Dijon chicken, not to mention jumbo Jacuzzis and five-story climbing walls. It’s all part of an extravagant amenities race that’s helping to push up tuition rates. “When we sneaked in on parent/student tours across the country, we were shocked at the number of questions parents asked about amenities,” Dreifus says. “A college doesn’t have to look like Club Med. In fact, I’d say you should be suspicious if a school has a lot of amenities. When a college has every kind of plaything, that tells you something about its priorities.”

7. Your tuition may be subsidizing a college president’s $1 million-plus salary.

College presidents create a tone and a direction for an institution, so take a look at the person at the top. Does he look like an educator? Has he switched to a new college every few years? What’s his salary? A growing number of higher education leaders are making more than $1 million a year. “When a president is remunerated the same way as a CEO, that’s a sign that the school has embraced the corporate model of doing things,” says Dreifus. “This should be a public service. A university president should not make more than the president of the United States.”

8. High-powered athletic programs drain money from academics.

Only a handful of athletic departments actually pay for themselves. The rest rely on your tuition and fees to help pay for coaches, trainers, equipment, and travel and lodging expenses for the players. Birmingham-Southern College in Alabama has more football coaches (seven) than it has professors in its history department (four). “If you didn’t have football, you could hire more history professors,” Hacker says. The other problem is that once colleges get into big-time sports, corruption tends to follow. Even Princeton recently had an alumnus who paid tuition for a tennis player in violation of NCAA rules, Hacker says. (The student agreed to repay the money to charity.) He acknowledges that some teenagers love the excitement of painting their faces in team colors and cheering for the home team. “How can I argue with that?” he says. “Except to say that you should recognize the trade-off: It’s depleting the quality of your education.”

9. Going to an elite university does not guarantee success.

To prove this point, Hacker and Dreifus tracked the 900-odd students who graduated from Princeton in 1973 to see if the school was delivering on its promise “to prepare students for positions of leadership,” whether in business, public service, or the arts, which Princeton administrators claim as their goal. “We were very disappointed,” Hacker says. “There were only a handful of recognized names in that class of 900. What that tells us is simply this: In America, if you put your talents to their best use, by the age of 35 or 36, you’ll be passing people from Princeton, no matter where you went to school.” Sure, the authors acknowledge, a designer degree might help you get into medical school or law school at Harvard, Stanford, or Yale. That’s a nice bonus if you can pay the full sticker price, they say, but not enough of an edge to saddle your child with many thousands of dollars in debt.

10. Honors colleges at public universities can offer as fine an education as the Ivy League.

The honors colleges at City University of New York, Arizona State, and the University of Mississippi, to name a few, offer the intimacy of a liberal arts college at state-school prices. “These students get first pick of classes and have special classes to themselves, and at Arizona State, they have their own dorms,” Dreifus says. “We met students in those honors colleges who got into Harvard and other elite schools, but they said they didn’t want to burden their parents with that kind of expense. Now that’s a smart kid.”

The rest of my work experience is more along hte lines of student jobs cashier, salesman, manager at a video stor. My thought is that I might try to apply with some of the oil or inspection companies as office staff, then apply to grad school for a MBA/JD program and hope to land an internship then.


Now for the questions

How happy are you in your current position?

What are your qualifications MBA/CPA/JD?

Are the big 4 really that big of a deal?

Are professional memberships actually worth the money?

What is the dress code? 

What is the work schedule like?

I constantly have to remind myself that there's a difference between being unbiasedly skeptical and just plain obnoxious.

Plus, I pretty much set myself up for failure by creating these imaginary situations in my head - me actually doing something with my life, certain family members deciding to put others before themselves, that cute IT intern discovering that he wants to befriend me - but nothing ever happens, and nothing will happen.

Every day is the exact same; I always set myself up for failure by aiming for unattainable goals like those mentioned above. I feel like I create these elaborate storylines inside my mind and my real life can't compare. It will never compare. I just want to get out of this house and leave this shit behind. Each time she does this, I find myself growing more and more tired of her bullshit.

I've had hemorrhoids for over 7 years now. It sucks. Obviously this is a really embarrassing condition, so I kept it to myself.

I kept quiet and just hoped that this pain, these swollen bumps at the bottom of my ass would just go away. They never did, and intern everything got worse overtime. My lack of care just exacerbated my condition to the point I got a anal fissure (a cut on your asshole) and i was partially prolapsed (part of my anus would stick out after a BM and would have to be pushed back into my insides). Pretty gross. If you are still reading let me tell you that it sucked. Every time i had a bowel movement it felt as though someone was stabbing me. I felt cursed. It is such a terrible irony having this condition and being gay. It has prevented me from being the person i want to be. I did have one boyfriend though, had intercourse a couple times, it hurt, a lot. He never noticed my condition and i was too embarrassed to tell him. He broke up with me later anyways.

rvose,6,2012-04-05,AutoCAD Abilities,stabletable,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/rvose/autocad_abilities/,"Hey engineers, I have an interview next Tuesday for an internship with a consulting firm.  I have a couple of questions about my biggest concern - my autocad skills.  The position will involve drafting, and I assume they use AutoCAD..

My first question is about what to expect in the interview.  Is it likely that I will be asked anything technical about the program, or asked to use it?  

I have experience and I can find my way around.  I've done a couple of projects with it, but I'm an amateur beyond laying down lines and curves.  I don't know if I could pass any sort of ""test""... 

Which leads me to my next question.  How much do I need to know?  It's a very general question, I know.  If I were asked something before getting the position, how difficult should I expect it to be?  I have some time to practice some things, so what are some basics I should know?  This applies to actually working somewhere too.  I'm a quick learner, but where is the line between embarrassingly bad and good enough?

**TL;DR**:  Internship interview.  Should I expect some sort of AutoCAD ""test""?  And what abilities defines someone as ""good enough"" at AutoCAD (maybe a few, critical skills)?"

I thought of it more and found for me it was different and the order was 

the reverse of what I was expecting.

**THIS IS A LONG STORY. YOU CAN IGNORE THE STORY AND JUST ANSWER THE QUESTION WITH YOUR OWN ANSWER :)** 

Everyone will have different definitions of being a boy/man and some of you will roll your eyes at my personal experience since it is tied strongly with my romantic relationships growing up 

but here we go:  


**The point I became a man: 19 years old**

When I was 16, I got an unrecognized contact request on MSN. I accepted it and it was someone who had tried to add someone else whose email was very similar to mine but made a typo. By chance we found out we lived in the same city and then through one of the most statistically unlikely events I've ever had in my life we pinpointed each other down to the fact that we both had taken the same summer school course a month earlier. I sat at the table with my male, public school posse. She sat at the table beside us with her female private school posse. It was funny because they had nicknames for each of us at the guy table while I know our table didn't care for any of that because we were too busy discussing the finer points of Diablo 2 min/max stats. One of her friends who sat at the table got added to the conversation, her name was Sally. That night Sally and I talked until 6am on a school night. I felt the kind of connection that only naive teenagers could feel that night and I was so sure She Was The One.

I fell head over heels for her, and she did for me as well. We were both very shy so we were indirect about it in that ""*well, if you have nobody to go to Winter Formal with, I **guess** I can go with you*"" kind of way. We chatted every night until the break of dawn and I think those 8 months or so were the happiest times of my life.

I met some of her friends, and her cousin who she was very close with. I became aquaintences of her friend and a close friend/confidant of her cousin **Vera** who had some serious emotional issues and found it easy to talk to me. This will be important later.

Sally was my second girlfriend I ever had but after the winter formal she disappeared without a trace. I did not commit any horrible faux pas at the formal so it's not like I drove her away. Just all of a sudden one day I lost all contact with her. We didn't go to the same school (her school was very far away) and her friends all similarly disappeared. It would be 3 years before I saw her again.

The question always on my mind was: why did Sally disappear? What did I do? How did I screw up so bad and not realize it? Why was it something that couldn't be at least explained to me instead of breaking off all contact with me and telling her friends to also break off all contact? Why? I wanted ""The Answer"".

In those three years I did not find another girlfriend. I went to my prom stag. I always felt miserable inside. I would sometimes think I saw her around town but then when I looked again I wasn't sure if it was just my eyes playing tricks on me. We went to the same university but it was a very large campus and we were in different disciplines so sightings on campus didn't happen (or maybe did, and I didn't think it was her?). I had some interesting dates in university but I never allowed anything real to develop from them. I never called back, and I never so much as kissed a girl in those three years though I had lots of opportunities to do so.

Vera was my only link to Sally but she refused to divulge anything. I didn't push her because she was very fragile emotionally and was in a borderline abusive relationship. I got a lot of 4am phone calls in those three years and had to go pick her up when she was drunk or crying on the street and was constantly afraid she would follow through on one of her many suicide threats. 

One day when I was 19 years old, Vera called me and told me she wanted to talk over some coffee. I was used to this routine by now: something bad had happened between her boyfriend again and needed someone to talk to. Strangely this time she said she would drive over and pick me up. 

I noticed that there was someone in the front seat when she arrived and I climbed into the back seat. I leaned forward to introduce myself and I froze because there was Sally sitting in the passenger seat. ""GUESS WHO I BROUGHT???"" screech Vera estatically. It was a very awkward ride to the cafe as both Sally and I had been tricked into ""coffee"". 

At the cafe we talked about our high school days and tried to catch up on what happened in the past three years. Eventually Vera left and we had a private moment and we finally talked about the elephant in the room.

Sally: I'm really sorry about what I did to you

Me: I don't think you need to apologize... I feel like I am the one who should apologize. 

Sally: really? I always imagined this moment, I would be apologizing for... disappearing on you like that. Aren't you curious, like what happened?

This was the moment I had been waiting for for three years, and yet somehow, what came out of my mouth was completely not what I expected.

Me: I always thought you must have had your own reasons for disappearing. I'm sorry if it was something I did. 

And that was it. It felt so surreal because in the past three years ""why did you disappear?"" was everything to me. And when I finally had the answer within reach I somehow let it go and was satisfied with it. We never talked about it again. 

Looking back, this was the moment I became a man. When I could let go of the one thing I wanted most and walk away.

Sally and I would chat occasionally but it was never the same anymore. We had become different people in those three years and we eventually drifted.

I am closer with and still good friends today with Vera (who is doing much better now!) and I will forever be in her debt for what she did for me that day.



**The day I was no longer a boy: 22 years old**

This story relates to my first girlfriend, let's call her Gina. 

Gina and I met when I was 15. We started a relationship that was cute, happy and in retrospect the definition of puppy love. If it had run its course normally then it would have had little impact on my life. Unfortunately she had strict parents and when they found out about me, they threated to send her back to her home country unless we ended it. I was not a bad boy (quite the opposite, I had straight A's and never smoked/drank) but *parents, amirite?* We decided to end it and there were a lot of tears. I was quite upset and thought the whole thing super unfair. I missed pretending to be embarassed when she covered my entire locker with post-it notes with hearts on it and I missed holding her hand and I wasn't quite sure what to do with myself at lunch, after school or on weekends anymore.

Fast forward: I am now 22 years old. Sally matter had run its course. Guess who is in town? It's Gina. She went away for University (I went to a local university) and she needed someone to pick her up at the airport as she nolonger knew many people here. I agreed and picked her up. We went for some dinner and reminisced a lot. She was staying at her uncle's place because her parents had now moved back to her home country. Her uncle hated her and made her sleep on the floor and basically made her life awful during her return to our town. I helped by driving her to buy some proper bedding and pillows and ate out/hung out with her a lot that summer. I picked her up when her shifts at a local cafe were done and we spent every day of summer almost exclusively with each other.

One day someone had eyes on her at the cafe she was at and gave her his number. She discussed it with me and I told her to go for it! I didn't have any romantic thoughts of Gina and although this guy seemed a little creepy, I told her if she was interested she should go for it but use common sense. I told her she could call me if anything went wrong. Gina and Michael dated for a while although after I met him I did not like him because he seemed like a very petty person. He knew I was Gina's ex and he would ""turn up the bravado"" when I was around (eg: feed her food in front of everyone like she was a baby). Gina thought it was ridiculous too. 

Then one day the heartbreak happens: Michael dumps her. Gina is really upset and calls me at work. I was a programming intern at the time so I was expecting to stay overtime until 11PM. Instead at 4:30PM I grabbed my coat and left immediately. I found her crying on the grass at a local park, little kids pointing at her from the playground. We sat there for a while and I cheered her up the best I could. We went for dinner and a movie and went to watch airplanes at the airport while sitting in my car. This was something that Michael had always promised they would do but never did. That night she fell asleep on my shoulder and I didn't want to wake her so we just slept there. In retrospect, this is my favourite memory of a single night in my life.

For the rest of summer we went back to our pre-Michael ways of hanging out every day until summer ended and we both went back to our universities. I dropped her off at the airport and as I drove away I realized that this was my favourite summer in quite a long time (first summer not ruined by Sally and ""The Answer""). As classes went on, I realized how much I looked forward to summer. How much I looked forward to seeing Gina again. We talked a lot by skype and MSN but it just wasn't quite the same.

I revealed this to Vera, who suggested that I definitely had a thing for Gina. Hearing it from someone else made me realize that indeed I hadn't felt this way in a long time. I was saddened though. She lived on the other side of the continent. ""You'll find a way"", Vera said. And I was inspired.

I took on two extra jobs, with my classes and saved every penny I could. I also worked extremely hard to finish all my school projects early and a week before Thanksgiving I handed in all my term projects which other students would take probably another 3~4 weeks to finish. I went online and spent all my hard earned money on airplane tickets to her city for Thanksgiving. I had never worked so hard in my life for a single purpose and put everything on the line in such a crazy manner. My friends all thought I was foolish and that this would end in heartbreak but I didn't care. I've had plenty of heartbreak and this couldn't be worse than the past three years. 

I arrived and surprised Gina at her dorm. She was excited and happy that I suddenly arrived out of nowhere to visit her and I stayed for about a week. During this week we hung out and had a great time. I slept in her dorm and she showed me around her campus and she was really glad I came because everyone she knew had disappeared over thanksgiving break. The last night of the visit, I told her honestly I realized I had fallen in love with her over the past summer and if she would consider starting a relationship again. She was quiet and told me that she had to think about it.

The next day as I got ready to go past the security at the airport, she told me that she loved me back when she was 15 and when she came back at 22 we had become different people and that incredibly, she loved me again as a different person. However, she felt a relationship would be a bad idea. It was long distance. Her parents were still an issue (Her Mom eventually warmed to me but her Dad will hate me forever) and she wanted to focus on her career. She went to the United States to study because she was ambitious and wanted to succeed professionally. I was a smart guy who could have went to my pick of universities in the US but I chose to stay because of my friends, family, and I did not have big ambitious dreams. I understood what she meant and we gave each other one small kiss and I walked through the terminal. 

On that day, I ceased to be a boy. I knew I stopped being a boy because I would ever again be able to summon the boyish naivete that allowed me to drop everything and put all my effort and 

energy into chasing such a optimistic quest.

Gina and I kept in contact for quite a while after this, but eventually she hit the corporate ladder and got too busy and we drifted. We both got into relationships and last I heard she is working her way up in a big financial firm in New York. 

**Today**

I am turning 26 years old in a couple of weeks and I will be spending it with my girlfriend of 3 years. I am lucky to be a man with a job he loves, a lovely ladyfriend, surrounded by friends that make every weekend seem like it passed too fast. When I think back though, these two experiences are what made me into the man I am today. I have no regrets and will always cherish these memories.

I can't even tell you how happy I am that I get to hug him and kiss him tomorrow. This is the longest I've gone without seeing him since we met over a year ago, and it's been hard. I won't see him again till June, unless something works out. Our LDR will end in August, so not too bad, but still hard.

rvjxs,6,2012-04-05,How much does a recent mechanical engineering graduate make?,BABYEATER1012,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/rvjxs/how_much_does_a_recent_mechanical_engineering/,"I spoke with a company today, they've been courting me for the last few months about a job offer, and the president said today email him what my pay expectations are and they'll come up with an offer. I have about a years worth of internships and about 4 years of large scale projects(FSAE and SAE Baja) but I don't really think those carry as much weight as an internship. I have no idea how much to even begin to ask, I live in central florida outside of Orlando so the cost of living isn't in the stratosphere. I was thinking some where in the range of 50-55k but then I don't want to over ask and look like a douche you know? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

rvjcf,23,2012-04-05,[Progress] This semester has been awesome so far!,[deleted],selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/rvjcf/progress_this_semester_has_been_awesome_so_far/,"Context: Last semester I was taking ~11 credits in grad school. All I did was play World of Warcraft most of the time. I studied a minimal amount each week and spent the rest playing games or watching Netflix. I did however change my diet last semester to primarily vegetables and rice and lost 25 pounds (215 -&gt; 190 at 6'4''). Oops, I guess I should mention I am a 22 year old male.

Anyway, I wanted to change my daily life to better myself for this semester. Here are the things I wanted to do:

* either no more video games or a heavy reduction in time spent playing
* READING - spend time reading books
* start lifting weights again for the first time in years
* find new hobbies to replace drinking on the weekends
* through the other changes, BE MORE CONFIDENT
* get a summer internship

I have accomplished most of this list, despite taking a ridiculous 15 graduate credit hours (I should be able to get 3 A's and 2 B's). I completely quit and turned off World of Warcraft and Star Wars: The Old Republic. This opened up a huge amount of time. This allowed me to start reading some. I quickly read Hitchhikers, Ender's Game, and Ender's Shadow. I plan on reading a couple more of the Ender series. Then I have about 10 other books waiting on my kindle to be read.

I started lifting weights 6 days a week in late January. I have been VERY persistent in going. My parents visited in the middle of March during my spring break and they made a lot of comments regarding me being muscular (despite me not mentioning that I started lifting). I put on about 25 pounds since late January. I'm fairly certain a good portion of that is from the creatine I am taking. The rest is hopefully largely from added muscle and then a little amount of fat.

I've also gone on two hiking trips so far and excited to do another. Each trip was at a different canyon in north Texas and both were really fun. I grew up on a farm so it is nice to get back out and enjoy nature. Other than hiking as a new hobby, I have been playing frisbee golf every so often. It is much more fun than I thought and another good way to be outside.

I still haven't found an internship though for the summer. I really need to start trying harder... Also, I am still getting coaxed into drinking more than I'd like. I need to find some way to go out, but not drink into oblivion.

This ended up being a bit longer than expected haha. I just don't really have anyone to tell this too that wouldn't be annoyed and jealous :P."
rvj9h,22,2012-04-05,Long overdue rant,Welcome-To-Heartbrea,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/rvj9h/long_overdue_rant/,"   Ok, before I kick this off, I just wanted to let you know, this might get long. It will also probably be downvoted to oblivion, as my complaints probably are insignificant compared to other legitimate posts. It might not even be downvoted as people will probably already be moving on to the next post, seeing as how I'm rambling even here. By all means, do what you have to do. This is, after all, a self-post, and meta-Hivemind dictates we not care about karma.  

So, I have no clue where to start this off, but I guess it could be this, seeing as I just got into an argument about it. A few weeks ago, my parents left the country for a week, business on my dad's part, shopping on my mom's. My grandmother, from my mother's side of the family, stayed with me and my younger sister during that week, as to drive my sister where she needed driving, etc. Now, I never really had anything against my grandmother. She's been in a different city, a few houses away from my uncle, for almost ten years. Lost contact, and having moved to a different country for about five years on two different occasions, I just plain didn't have much to do with her. I've never even been her tech kid. I'm everyone's tech kid. (This sentence sounds dumb as shit, but what I meant to convey is, if something went up with your computer, I'd get called over to reboot it, thus fixing the problem on 99% of occasions). She would always entrust this to my cousin, her other grandson, who is two years older than me, never did too great in school, but managed to get into college after two years of trying (college is messed up here. if you're interested, look up Vestibular, it's what's used to select kids into colleges here). I did it in my first try, but I got into a much better, paid albeit, college than him. He's going to a great one too, but it's free, harder to get in, etc.     

I hope you're not going to hate me, but before this next part, I'm going to need to give you a bit more background. So, I'm a sophomore in college, studying to be an engineer. I have just started an internship in February. Like I briefly went over, I have always been a hard working student. I study my ass off, especially near midterms or finals, even more so now that I have that internship. If I fail a class, I have to retake it the following semester, and since my classes are either all in the morning or all in the afternoon, if I fail a class, that means I have to retake it in the period I have free, which I am using for the internship. So I don't allow myself to not study, especially when I know I need it. My daily schedule goes a bit like this: wake up at 5:00, get ready, go to school at 6:00, last class ends around 13:00, go to internship that starts at 14:00, ends at 18:00, arrive home at 19:30, eat and have free time from 20:00 to about 22:00, which is when I force myself to sleep. The two-hour period I told you I have free, is basically useless. I try to use it to study what I had that day, so I don't have to cram too much near finals (which always ends up happening, always), however, I'm a bit exhausted around that time, and often go to bed then.   


Ok, back to when she was staying over; she stays on my case for the duration of the first day, just telling me over and over how I should be balancing my life. Mind you that this is two weeks prior to my midterms, and I'm beginning my crazy study schedule. This means I study about everyday for as long as I can, without that interfering with my sleep schedules though. No one fucks with my sleep. So, she's telling me, hey, Welcome-To-Heartbrea (fuck, I just noticed I missed a ""t""), why don't you go to a bar with your friends or something? Why don't you have more friends? Why do you just stay in all the time? (By now, I fully expect you to all be on her side, because I'm coming off as an extremely spoiled brat with an awesome grandma. Well, you're probably right...) I tell her calmly why I have to study so hard these weeks, and that I understand her point. That would have been great had it stayed like that, except for the fact it carried on for the whole week.   And one day, she's talking to me about how she ran into a distant family member I've never met, and I tell her I don't know who she's talking about. She randomly gets ticked off and starts calling me anti-social. For not knowing someone. Right. I get pissed, talk back, and that was about the last time I talked to her for that week, until today, which is when I get the news I'm visiting her this weekend, even though I hadn't been consulted about this, and this is my first weekend after midterms and was really looking forward to relaxing, etc. I didn't take this too kindly with my mother, and asked why I hadn't been consulted, and that I'm not sure I want to go. Discussion ensues.  

So, here's part two:  
I am numb. Numb in the sense I shut off some emotions. My life's been a mix of two songs lately: ""[Cat's in the Cradle](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUwjNBjqR-c)"", by Harry Chapin, and ""[Welcome to Heartbreak](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMH0e8kIZtE)"", by Kanye West. If you know them at all, you know what I mean. If you don't, take a second to listen to them, both are great songs. If you don't feel like it, but for some odd reason, want to hear what I have to say about it, well, here goes: I strive to succeed. What does that mean? Shit, you got me. I used to know. I used to think it was all about being the boss-man at the end of the day. Heck, I still think that. But then again, I never thought that, and I still don't. I knew way back then that the most successful person was usually the one working his ass off the most, and not having a family, a proper weekend, a life. The one with the average salary, on the other hand, had a proper life, with friends and everything's all giddy like According to Jim. You've got a banging wife and friend to keep you company.  

I honestly don't know anymore what I want to be. I see myself not having 10% of the day to myself, and out of every 10 weekends, taking 6-7 to study the whole time.  
I have grown apart from my closes high-school friends. I have moved countries back and forth and I just don't have a sense of belonging. I grow attached to a place, I get it taken from me. I hate change. I finally adapt after a year at that new high school of not having any friends, get friends, get separated from them. I've lost track of how many times I've had to shed friends. And I hate that. Ever read that one text from Mary Schmich, [Advice, like youth, probably just wasted on the young](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/columnists/chi-schmich-sunscreen-column,0,4054576.column), also known as 'Wear Sunscreen'? There's a bit that says ""friends come and go, but with a precious few you should hold on"". That few has come down to one person, and I thank whatever there is to thank that I'm still friends with him. Awesome friend, but we haven't been talking as much, since we graduated.  
And the numbness I refer to is my love-life, or rather, the lack thereof.  
I've never had a girlfriend. Never kissed, never touched, never had a romantic moment, never asked out, never went beyond just staring her and hoping she'd magically walk over and kiss me, we'd start dating, she'd be the one, and we'd get married and life happily ever after. But fuck, I want that to change. And I know I'm smart enough to give myself all the advice on how to succeed. Everything that gets posted to r/GetMotivated, for example, is stuff my brain could come up with all the time, and I'm never willing to listen to it. After getting into college, this being an engineering-only college, there are close to no girls in it, but last year, I managed to somehow become friends with this nice girl that I quickly became interested in. She was, however, dating, and was deeply in love with this fucker. I'd give up my free time, after I'd already passed the test and had been on vacation, to get on skype and help her with her questions, all the while she would make out with her boyfriend on the other end of the call. There were also occasions in which she blew me off when she arranged something, treated me like I was just any one else, and that was great, because I got to realizing she wasn't that awesome as I had made her out to be in my head. Really, I just don't get much talk or get to know any girls, so when one comes along, I hold on for my dear life. The girl is now single, has been for some months. I could pathetically attempt to make a move, but now that she's single, obviously, I'm not interested anymore. Fucking brain.   

Truth is, I have everything in life I could ask for. I have nice parents who provide, and extremely well, for me. They are not abusive, and if I say so myself, did a great job of raising me. I am, however, surrounded by money. They never spoiled me, but always gave me the means to spoil myself. And so I did. I surrounded myself with an Xbox, a smart phone and a computer. What else do I need to numb the wounds?  Heck, I'm even with a foot in the industry, and pretty much have a guaranteed job after I graduate (note: this is because my country really lacks engineers, not because I consider myself an apostle, or some shit). I have that one friendship at least that I'll cherish for a long time, the money to keep me entertained and well fed, a new career. But then, I realize my grandma wasn't so wrong after all. Where's the balance? What's this all about if I can't share this journey with someone?   

That's all I can remember for now. If you've stuck around, I'm glad, I suppose. "

**Misc Personal Information**

My name is Dashiell. I’m 15 years-old and work as an intern at the *To be Forever Wild* Production House, an up and coming film that my teacher/boss is directing.

I follow plenty of people, such as [raocow](http://www.youtube.com/user/raocow), [KinkyOats](http://www.youtube.com/user/KinkyOats), [JonTron](http://youtube.com/user/JonTronShow), [Continue? Show](http://www.youtube.com/user/ContinueShow) and many, many YTPMV and pony music artists. I also follow comics such as [VGCats](http://www.VGCats.com) and [xkcd](http://www.xkcd.com)... and a few more comics I *should* follow.

****

**Preferred TF2 class and loadout:**

I main Engineer, but recently I’ve been into Heavy and Spy a lot. I tried to get into Sniper, but I don’t think I’m ready quite yet... But, I’ll play just about every class, mainly to even out a team or just have fun. I’ll list the ones I play as in order of class.

[**Scout**](http://imgur.com/a/ay4YG#0) - Soda Popper, Pistol, Sandman or Boston Basher

[**Demoman**](http://imgur.com/a/ay4YG#1) - **Medieval**: Bootlegger, Splendid Screen, Caber | **Regular**: Stock, Splendid Screen, Caber

[**Heavy**](http://imgur.com/a/ay4YG#2) - The Black Market Business loadout

[**Engineer**](http://imgur.com/a/ay4YG#3) - Combat Engie: Frontier Justice, Pistol, Gunslinger

[**Medic**](http://imgur.com/a/ay4YG#4) - Blutsauger, Stock, Ampulator

**Sniper** [**1**](http://imgur.com/a/ay4YG#5) &amp; [**2**](http://imgur.com/a/ay4YG#6) - **Medieval**: Huntsman, Darwin’s Danger Sheild, Shahanshah | **Regular**: Stock or Pee Needles, SMG, Shahanshah (It’s my only other Melee for Sniper other than stock...)

[**Spy**](http://imgur.com/a/ay4YG#7) - Any of my three current Spy guns - Stock, Ambassador or Enforcer - S.Knife, Dead Ringer

**I do not play Solider or Pyro.** I... don’t know, I find neither of them enjoyable. I mean, it’s different for every player. That’s why I wanted the Gunslinger so badly, I didn’t have fun sitting around smashing my buildings... I didn’t feel like I did a good job with Engie to begin with. My problem with the Solider and Pyro is that their loadouts can either be way too powerful and hard for me to manage or way too easy (and cheap).

****

**How long have you played TF2? How many hours?**

As of now: 262. I guess I actually join Steam around the time TF2 was F2P, but after spending 17 on my old tower with Windows XP trying to download it, it told me I didn’t have the right video card… THEN I GOT A MACBOOK PRO. 

But it’s still not always fun... not always...

****

**How long have you known about ponies?**

Well, towards the end of last year’s summer, my first experience of ponies was [Fuck-**Shy**t-Stack](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rciGK095EM). after someone shared it on Facebook... I’m forever in debt to them.  After a week later of watching Pony YTPMVs, I looked into who was behind the show and was captivated from the new found information and immediately gave the show a try with a positive attitude... haven’t been disappointed since!

****

**How long have you been in this community?**

I guess I was first introduced to this sub when Mic and some other pony artist made that apology post for acting so rudely on the server, and after browsing a bit I subbed. I found while searching “reddit” on TF2... I fell in love as soon as I saw those Ponispencers!

****

**Favorite pony?**

Applejack by far. I mean, she’s my waifu... if she were real and human, of course. She’s got the best traits out the Mane 6, but we all know Mane 6 is best pony. 

I was first pulled into the show when I found that Rainbow Dash’s name was... “Dash”-  just like me! So I also like saying Ashliegh Ball is best pony because my interests (jokingly, I mean it seriously for the Mane 6 ಠ_ಠ).

****

**Favorite Valve character?**

I don’t lie - I haven’t played every Valve game, but I have a vast understanding of every character. But, out of their immense group of characters, I’d say Space Core.

But, out of games I own, I’d say Engineer. His rough-neck attitude and seriousness is inspiring...!

****

**Hobbies that you have other than TF2 and ponies?**

I make plenty of videos on Youtube: [PinkieOats](http://www.youtube.com/user/PinkieOats). I also post art on [dA](http://iirockpuppy.deviantart.com), hardly go on it though. I’m open to requests though!

I also have a Google+ account (not willing to share because of ) and, obviously, reddit!

****

**The pony/character that you identify with the most and why.**

Once again, Applejack, which further extends the fact that we’d make a good couple.

She’s a hard worker, and holds a strong integrity to her moral code!

****

Heck yeah, using big words! Not doing a very good job at aiming.

The problem is that he comes from a hindu family and I come from a southern baptist family (and to make it worse, my father is a preacher). We've been dating for almost 3 months, but have liked one another for almost a year and a half. We've been keeping the relationship a secret so far, but I need advice on how and when to tell my parents. 

It's really frustrating that something as silly as religion can get in the way of a relationship that is working and flourishing. How can I convince my parents that our love is real and that religion shouldn't play a part.

We are both seniors that are graduating in late may. I'm going to go off to work away from home for a month before going to school, and he has to go work at an internship about an hour away from there. Once school starts again in late summer, I'll be going to school in Dallas, and he'll be in Houston. We've both already agreed that we're going to try to make long distance work.

*edit - It seems that this is a bit of an issue, but I guess I should just clarify that we are both 18, but I'm almost half a year older. I am a female, he is a male, and we'll be having our 3rd month anniversary this upcoming Wednesday, although we've been going to the same school together for 2 years and have liked one another for almost a year and a half. 

*For the TL;DR - Boyfriend and I get along really well, but our parents don't agree religiously. They don't know about our relationship yet. How do we tell our parents?*"

rydo1,3,2012-04-07,I think I'm losing it,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/rydo1/i_think_im_losing_it/,"I've had depression since I was 11 or so, much of it due to abuse as a child. I'm 22 in a few weeks and I feel like I'm losing my mind. I was going to attempt suicide in the 10th grade, but someone found out and reported it. Went to a counselor, but I lied and said everything was ok. They don't really care about anything so long as you can pay. 

I've lost interest in everything. I'm a runner, but I hate it now. I can't get myself to go run, go to the gym, or even draw anymore. All the things I enjoyed over the years - I've just lost interest as time went on. Now, I'm just angry. Angry at myself. I hear voices and I can't help but get pissed off. I can't keep a train of thought going. I can't remember things that happened 30 minutes ago...and I used to have photographic memory. I can't stand being around people, even my own family. I've come to hate people's voices. It annoys me to no end when I hear people talking and I want to tell them to shut the hell up. I don't know anything but anger, though I wouldn't hurt a fly. Hell, I can't even cry anymore.

By no means am I unsuccessful. Maybe I'm stupid and selfish for feeling this way as I graduated college a year early despite failing my first year. My internship was no more - they offered me a full time position instead. These things would make anyone happy, but not me. Then we have the whole 'I've never had a gf, kiss, etc.' ordeal. I went on a date last week, though, and thought things would actually change. I gave her a hug upon meeting her and we had a blast that afternoon. I can honestly say it was the happiest day of my life. I went home happier than I had ever been. Happier than when I got the job or when I graduated college. But it was all a joke. Now she's pulling strings and playing games. At least that's what I feel like is happening.

This week has been especially bad for me. I haven't been able to sleep properly. I've had gruesome nightmares, and I've lost weight (as if I wasn't slim enough). My desire to cease existing has never been stronger. I'm not strong enough to go through with it, though. I'm a coward like that. 

I wish I had friends, *real* friends who I could go out with. My mom keeps telling me I should go join some sports club or something at the Y. Easy for her to say when after paying some of their bills every month on top of my car and everything else, I don't exactly have a ton to spend. 

I feel like the only thing that can make me genuinely happy is to be in a relationship and having genuine people in my life. But I know it's not going to happen. I've come to terms with it, though it's difficult to deal with. I wish the voices would stop. I wish I weren't so angry and didn't feel like this all the time. I don't intend on seeing a counselor. I'm not paying $200+ a session for someone to pretend to care. I can't believe this is going to be me for the rest of my life. I don't know what to do anymore.

I'm sure this was all poorly structured, etc., but I just can't focus on any one thing anymore. My head is constantly hurting and...I just don't know."

I tried learning programming on my own after not being able to really find a real job, and really enjoyed it.  I decided since I had some access to more loan money, I may as well go back to college.  I am currently on a CS track (first semester), but after talking to an adviser in that school, it looks like it will take longer to complete than I originally thought.

However, I did get a business minor with my Psychology degree, and my school does have an IS degree available there.  I could complete the degree faster since some of my business classes are already done, and from what I understand it could get my foot in the door in IT.

My question is, is how do I make it so that I am actually marketable candidate for jobs once I get out of college (should only take 2 years seeing I already have all my gen eds done from previous degree)?  

I already plan on getting an internship no matter what.  But, are there any certificates I should aim for or any personal projects I should do on my own time that would help me out?

Again, I really love programming, but I don't think I will have the loan money to pursue a CS degree.  

Can I get a job pursuing a IS degree?  And what should I do between now and graduation to ""guarantee"" that I land a job pretty easily?

I'm also planning on visiting L.A. from Oregon and would eventually like to tour the campus to get a look at what it's like to work there, just as I would for any other company.

Again, if anyone knows anything or could help a guy out, it would be wonderful!

rxzl6,6,2012-04-07,Jumpstarting a Programming Career,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/rxzl6/jumpstarting_a_programming_career/,"I want to program. I have experience in IT support and some programming  from a few years back. I'm working to complete a night class BS-IT program which I will focus on programming in. I also have a good background in Math and Science and have taken some more traditional theoretical CS classes in the past. Here are a few questions I'd like to posit to the community:

**1. How do I not get typecast as a IT support guy?** 

I spent 2 years doing that sort of work full time. While there I did get to do a modicum of programming so I will try to focus around that in my resume. I still fear that I will be viewed as best in a support role. Besides my work full time work with support, most of my other part-time jobs were similarly help-desk or system level support and I know that isn't really the career I want to pursue.

**2. BS-IT V. CS?** 

Due to various time personal factors and time constraints I am taking a degree in BS-IT, with a math minor, as opposed to CS. I have no doubt that CS provides stronger fundamentals, yet I am also glad to be able to take more practical classes, than those that constitute a CS degree. The program I'm in is pretty good, requiring a descent amount of math like Discrete Structures. I've supplemented this with classes in Physics and Math, I used to be a physics major, so I think I have comparable amount of knowledge to a CS grad in all areas besides high level stuff that won't play a part in my career: compilers, functional languages, assembly, and OS level programming. I know, or knew and can refresh, on concepts such as efficiency, O-notation, linked listed, data structures,etc. **Sub-question, what would be a good way to refresh my knowledge of this stuff for interviews?**

**3. iOS V. Web Development?** 

I am very interested in iOS and see the app economy as a good place to start a career. I'd like opinions as to how career development in iOS will compare to more traditional web development. I have some past experience in web development so I could leverage that to help get my foot in the door, but I think I am more passionate about iOS and see a brighter future there. I realize that all trends pass and that having the fundamentals and ability to learn are more important in the long run. But let's face: most jobs ask for a highly specific skill set so to be practical I need to start developing it ASAP.

**4. Getting my foot in the door.**

Sort of the capstone question. Given my past experience and interests how do I get my foot in the door. I need to start work sooner rather than later but I'd hate to settle for an IT support job that might further typecast me, just because it will be easier to get in the short term. My current plan is to brush up on what I do know, then learn about iOS development and try to build out a basic app that I can bring to an interview to prove I'm competent. Any advice for going about this? Any other ways to approach it? If I need to get my feet wet with internships or even free work at first I'm will to do it. I think based on my experience I could get an employable programmer within a few months of refreshing and learning.

Thanks!"

I'm a senior in high school, going to a community college first to save $$$. After that though, I can either go to a college in my state of Michigan and major in public policy, or I can go to a college near Washington DC to pursue the same major and get into an internship.

Pros of college in DC:
-Close to DC means close to internships which means close to jobs when I graduate.
-It's all about experience, and I won't get that in Michigan unless I partake in a Study Abroad program.
-I love Washington DC, Virginia, and Maryland. I wouldn't mind living there, and going to college there would give me a good taste of what it would be like.

Cons:
-Going to college in DC would be pretty costly, around $30,000-$40,000, compared to around $15,000-$17,000 if I stayed in Michigan.
-Traveling back home would be miserable, it's about an 11 hour drive.
-Credits may not transfer from my community college.

Basically it comes down to this - if I go to college in DC, would I be able to snag a job almost right out of college? If so, that would take the edge off of the higher cost of tuition for being an out-of-state student. 

Thanks for reading!"

rxsbe,12,2012-04-07,Question and a warning ...,abraxsis,keto,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/rxsbe/question_and_a_warning/,"So I am currently in my internship with about 30 hours left out of 600 that I've put in since Jan 11th. The place I am is an inpatient facility so we eat lunch on the unit which is nice cause that hour counts for me. However, over the last 5 weeks or so, I have begun to resort to prepackaged lunch meats for a keto friendly meat, eating half as breakfast and half about 3 hours later as lunch. I didn't think much about it until I got on the scale and realized I had put on nearly 15 pounds. Now, granted I have been focusing on building muscle, so this accounts for some of this gain since my pants and shirts still fit like they should. Could the salt content be helping my body to retain water, or does the diuretic effect of low carb aid you in eliminating it faster?

Now ... here is the warning. I recently landed in the local ER with a splitting headache and a blood pressure of 190/120. This was transient due to a tension headache but the doctor was concerned. After we discussed diet she said to STOP eating so much prepackaged meats. I never really paid much attention to the sodium content. After looking at them this morning, it looks like I have been consuming between 1500-3500mg of sodium BEFORE LUNCH and that doesn't include anything else I've eaten. As of today I am beginning a low sodium diet and I'll be taking my lunch to work again like I was at the start."

1. What programming languages are typically used in the CS classes? Also, do classes tend to be only theoretical at first, or can I expect to have actual coding assignments my first year?

2. What non-CS classes do students usually end up taking their first year (such as Physics)? 

3. How hard is it to land a paid CS-related (such as coding?) internship during the summer after freshman year? I'm pretty motivated and willing to work my ass off to obtain the skills that an internship would require. Is it really uncommon for a freshman to get an internship?

I've tried my hand at a couple of languages over the years, but I haven't really ""excelled"" at one, so I sort of want to spend summer to really get a sort of headstart for college classes, as well as work on the skills I'll need to hopefully land an internship!

The first will have me working with other interns on a project using MySQL and JavaEE writing a web application from the ground up.


The second is focused on cyber security and will have me doing related work with C and a little Python.


The first company seems like it will allow me to put more marketable skills on my CV, while the second seems to have a better overall employee satisfaction online and better prospects for future employment(at the same company). From what I've seen online, Enterprise Java programmers seem to get paid quite a bit more on average compared to C/C++ developers, is this true? It also seems like it will be easier to move onto another job having developed applied skills outside of class with Java and SQL.

How much weight should I give to employee reviews on GlassDoor? the first company is around a 2.3 while the second has about a 3.4

rxfxt,2,2012-04-07,The hell is wrong with me?,noteverythingisok,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/rxfxt/the_hell_is_wrong_with_me/,"Okay so I just browsed through this reddit and now its pretty underwhelming because mostly everyone here seems to have it worse than I do. Here's a quick rundown of my life so far. Approaching 22. Didn't have a great childhood, not a good relationship with my parents. Had a few friends and was bullied a lot during elementary school. It got better as I approached high school. Arguably the better time of my life was in high school, except my relationship with my parents just got exceedingly worse. I had great, smart friends who I love hanging out with and just talking to. Never used drugs, not a drinker. No siblings either. I went off to my first year in university. My last year in high school was average, so I didn't get into all the programs I wanted. Anyway I went off to study business. Screwed up real hard during my first year and got kicked out of the program. Obviously my parents were pissed, I get it. I moved onto studying math instead. Just finishing up my final year now and trying to find a way to progress my life. Job prospects are poor, as are my grades. All my friends are in some top tier engineering or science programs at other universities with jobs ready and internships under their belt. I'm envious but hey, good for them. I realize that all these screwups are my fault and mine only. I don't get why though. It's like yeah I want to be better than this but I have no drive or motivation to do it. Hey I might just try to make one day productive but it's meaningless because the next day I'll be to the same bad habits and zero motivation again. This has been fucking up my entire life, just this personality I carry around with me. I've spent time just thinking and trying to figure out why I'm like this because clearly everyone I know isn't. So why is it just me? I have constant pressure from my family to follow the same path any successful person would, get an education, find a good job and start a family. I get it. To be honest I have it pretty good and I hate myself every single day for fucking it all up. I've had this sort of feeling for as long as I can remember. I had suicidal thoughts as early as maybe 10. I still do but I know they don't mean anything. Every day I wish that someone would just kill me but at the same time I don't. It's just plain wrong. I am not in a relationship nor am I looking for one. I honestly prefer the lone wolf lifestyle and wish to live alone the rest of my life once I move out. I don't want a family nor do I want kids. I feel like I've had enough of family already for 20 years and it's just judgement 24/7. I never retaliate or bother defending myself whenever my family will get pissed off at me (which happens quite often). I know what they are saying is right. My grades are suffering and I need to pick them up, yes I know. I know I need to find a job soon. It's all right. I will never say anything and just take it. In the end just wondering why did I turn out like this. My existence is nonsensical.

Anyway I'm glad I stumbled on this reddit, my story is all over the place I know but I just needed to get this off my chest. "

[What is your feedback to pepole saying they hate unity and want gnome back?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c4957tg?context=5)|Gnome the upstream moved on from Gnome 2.x. Unity did not take it away, it's simply that the sun has set on Gnome, at least for the upstream developers and maintainers.
 |I don't know how you can hate Unity. I find it highly efficient and a pleasure to use on my netbook and my workstation.
[It's so pretty, beautiful, elegant, promising! But FUCK, it was as buggy as KDE 3.9.9.9.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c49dned?context=5)|I'm not going to say anything here that might offend KDE 3.9.9.3 developers.
 |I can say, again, that there has been a huge focus on robustness in 12.04 for all of Canonical developed code that lands on Ubuntu, not just Unity. We will probably make one last Unity upload this Monday, so if you want to give it a spin on Tuesday there *shouldn't* be any new bad Unity bugs. However, experience tells me there will be. So if you could help verify that it works perfectly, or help us suss out those last critical issues ... that would be great.
[Can you give us some of the major differences you noticed immediately in the environment between working for Microsoft and Canonical?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c495gqr?context=5)|The differences between the environments could not be bigger. On the whole, I find Canonical engineering staff to be smarter than Microsoft engineers. Canonical engineers are, as a group, the most humble group of engineers I've ever encountered. Microsoft thrives on conflict, Canonical thrives on mutual support.
[Is it almost like going from working in a corporation to a small office environment?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c495gqr?context=5)|The Ubuntu Engineering team is a home-based work force, so my office is small indeed (part of my bedroom)! :) Working from home is much different than working in an office, in ways that would take too long to go into.
[What do you think is holding back any Linux (including Ubuntu) from being on more desktops for home users? I personally think its due to not being easy to get certain tasks done as easily as in Windows since half of the time you have to enter the terminal to do what you need. What do you think Ubuntu can learn from Windows (which everyone uses)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c495a0c?context=5)|I think that people are used to Windows and there are misperceptions that Linux based systems are harder to use.
 |For example, you don't, in fact, need to use the terminal in Ubuntu to do normal things. There are GUI ways to do anything. Similarly, there are some tasks on Windows that require their command line. I think Ubuntu is easier to use than Windows.
 |I also think that Microsoft and Apple have marketing budgets that are orders of magnitude larger than Canonical's entire budget.
[Who and how decides on stuff like using Unity instead of Gnome(for Ubuntu), and what were the primary reasons to abandon using Gnome to use something not nearly as much tested and arguably reliable?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c4957mj?context=5)|There wasn't a single moment when sabdfl suddenly annonuced to us ""we are making Unity"". These things evolve slowly. Unity started during the netbook craze. Canonical's OEM team started a project called ""Ubuntu Netbook Remix"" because OEMs wanted something with more consumer appeal than GNOME offered. Slowly over time, we realized that we could create something better than GNOME. Obviously GNOME upstream came to the same conclusion because they went on to create gnome-shell.
[Can I have a *free* copy of Ubuntu?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c496kz4?context=5)|Yes, if you send $5 I will send you a free copy/
 |I just occurred to me that maybe you weren't being snarky. Just in case my sarcasm detectors were overly sensitive, Ubuntu is free to use and share, and always will be. You can download it from ubuntu.com.
[Do you think all Android smartphones constructors will embrace Ubuntu for Android and produce smartphones running Android and Ubuntu? How is the process going for now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c495af6?context=5)|Yes, I believe that Ubuntu for Android will be pretty standard on higher end phones in the coming years.

[What do you think about Android?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c49562r?context=5)|I have an android phone that I use daily. I like the openess of it relative to iOS (I will never by an iPhone under the current circumstances). However, I really don't want to learn another application programming stack, so I haven't bothered to write any apps for it. I really only enjoy platforms that I enjoy writing apps on.

One way to get started is [the free MIT course](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-189-a-gentle-introduction-to-programming-using-python-january-iap-2011/).

[Thoughts on linux mint?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c496k5j?context=5)|I haven't used Mint myself, but Mint users seem really passionate about it.

[How does one profit from providing free software? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c4964jd?context=5)|Canonical strives to make money from Ubuntu by ""providing services in and around Ubuntu"". I have friends who earn a living providing training for free software. Many Free software vendors provide support and consulting (see [Link to blue-mind.net](http://blue-mind.net) for example). However they do it, apparantly Red Hat now pulls down $1billion a year! So, it can be done.
[A charge often levelled at Canonical is of a lack of ""giving back"" to upstream communities.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c495ao8?context=5)|When one chooses to write Free software (in the sense of the 4 freedoms) one does so for the benefits that accrue to the users of the software, not themselves. In other words, we make our software free to bestow freedom upon those who use our software. There are responsibilities encoded in the licenses for users of Free software though, and those are pretty simple, keep the software Free.
[What responsibilities would you say that companies such as Canonical have to the wider Free Software community and do you think that Canonical does enough in this area?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c495ao8?context=5)|In terms of making money from the Ubuntu Archive, there are lots of ways to do that. Affiliates codes, as in the Banshee case, are a good example of how you can do that. You can also straight up sell your software. For all of the money that Canonical spends on Ubuntu, I think it's only logical that they claim a slice of revenue to continue to support it.
[A bit relatedly, an issue for third parties is how they can make money out of products in the Ubuntu archive. Canonical has shown with the Banshee Amazon move that it is willing to take a slice of this kind of revenue for itself. Do you think there are/should be any boundaries to this kind of activity on Canonical's side? How can upstream projects be sure that they will be able to make money from products in the Ubuntu archive when Canonical reserves the right to divert this away from them? (Is this just a part of the deal that you accept when writing free software?)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c495ao8?context=5)|In terms of diverting, this is, indeed part of writing Free software. People can and do choose to use it to make money. For commercial projects, such as Firefox, there are different approaches, like reserving the trademark, etc...
[I have a question about Ubuntu for Android. Which of the new and upcomming SOCs would you recommend for Ubuntu for Android? Tegra 3, Qualcomm S4, Huawei K3V2, OMAP5, the new Exynos?  And a second Question. Will it be made easy for the open source community, I think about the great devs at XDA here, to port Ubuntu for Android on devices without official manufacturer support?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c496h0a?context=5)|For your second question, Ubuntu for Android will be Open Source, so if you want to use it all the code will be there. I think there was some initial confusion about this because Canonical is not making a ""Ubuntu for Android Edition"", because there is so much handset specific work required that an Eiditon would not make sense.
[What is your day-to-day schedule?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c495r28?context=5)|Rest of morning: If things are not okay, work with people awake in Europe to see what are the problems, get them resolved. Have calls with people in Australia (it's end of the day for them). As Europeans and English folks wake up, have regurlarly schedule calls with them. Paper work, maybe a bit of programming, etc...
[How do you bridge the gap between people working in your offices and those contributing from home?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c495r28?context=5)|Which brings me to your bridging question. All of Ubuntu Engineering is home based, but spread out from Portland, OR, USA, to Sydney Australia. So there is a lot of timezone jugglling, and every now and then, someone has to take it in the teeth and do a call in the middle of the night. We have become very heavy users of Google Hangouts, as it works so reliably.
[How about Wayland? Can we hope that there will be some preview in 12.10? How it will affect to unity and apps?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c4959ni?context=5)|There is a preview of Wayland in 12.04!

[What was you duty in microsoft before joining ubuntu community and if it was about developing any part of windows os,what do you think about microsoft/windows as an former employee? if a windows/os X user ask you ""why is ubuntu(or linux) better than any other os"" what would be you answer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c495bhg?context=5)|I started as a Usability Engineer on Visual Studio, then Usability Manager there. Then I was a User Experience Manager for Microsoft Virtual Eatrth (only for a year). Then I finished up as a Lead Program Manager in the Windows Tablet Division, just as Vista was shipping.
 |What do I think about Windows? To be honest, I don't think about it much. I never use it, it has almost no impact on me personally. 
 |Compared to Windows and OS X, I think Ubuntu 12.04 is better in every way. It's faster, more up to date, prettier, easier to use, easier to write apps for, easier to find and install apps, more secure, etc... Ubuntu is also a Linux based system. Therefore, the kernel and the plumbing are very well designed, and are constantly improved.
[I'd like to contribute and I'll look into it. (Very political answer from you!)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c49hcwg?context=5)|I don't know what you mean by ""political"" here. Sorry if I inadvertantly offended you. Quickly is a labor of love for me, and a project that I do in spare time as a community contribution. I wish it were the case that I could make it be all that I want to be, but I just can't dedicated more than a bit of time to it here and there these days.
[How do you gather community feedback aside from user-submitted sources?  What I'm specifically getting at is, do you occasionally read blog posts or articles or reviews to see what critics/reviewers/users think, and is that feedback taken in?  For example, this usability article was doing the rounds a few days ago.  Does anyone at Canonical get to see this and add it to a 'feedback list' somewhere? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c495gq3?context=5)|I personally spend a part of every day reviewing what users, press, and the community is saying. I We have internal mailing lists where we occasionally discuss things like that article, including that article.
[I notice you drive the development of Quickly. How do you see (or want to see) the experience of app developers changing in years to come? An IDE? New language or toolkit? An entirely different framework?  Are there any major changes you're seeing in Ubuntu that haven't gotten the visibility they deserve?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c495rlh?context=5)|I think that as Ubuntu starts to run on more form factors (TV, tablets, phones, etc...) there will be a lot of changes, in terms of a lot of interesting apps to write! I, personally, suspect that there will be multiple technologies that are well supported for this. I think QML and HTML5 are going to be good choices. Personally, I am currently working on a new Quickly template to make it easy to write HTML5 front ends, with Python backends.
 |In terms of major changes ... I think it will take a while for it to sink in for people just how rock solid the Ubuntu client has become. On the server, I think Ubuntu Cloud is so innovative and such a radical simplification of an otherwise complex space that it will take a while for the world to catch on.

[Your thought about the ""Linus Torvalds"" persona?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c495hh7?context=5)|Well, I really like his attitude about how people can and should use the kernel. I don't agree with his technique of using public humiliation to influence people. However, from what I've seen, he appears to be an exceptionally generous person.
[How do you think we can help Ubuntu's market share to grow?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c4958lg?context=5)|I think Ubutnu's market share will grow noticably with 12.04. The Ubuntu desktop is a polished jewel, and Ubuntu Server is the most innovative server OS ever!
 |I feel that my top responsibility is to continually drive improvements to how we build and deliver Ubuntu so we can meet and exceed user expectations for quality and robustness.
 |Just realized that I didn't answer your question. How can *we* help Ubuntu's market share?
 |I would say, using Ubuntu is a good start :) Share Ubuntu. Share your knowledge. Most of all follow the Ubuntu Code of Conduct. I think the CoC is one of the strongest things that Ubuntu has going for it. If people know they can participate in the Ubuntu community without fear, more people will take the plunge.
[*Ubuntu Server is the most innovative server OS ever!*  What features, in your view, make it more innovative than others? In other words, what features do you like in Ubuntu Server that are missing in others?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c4977jd?context=5)|In a nuthsell, everything that make Ubuntu Cloud. Maas, Micro-clouds, OpenStack clouds, and the ability for juju to target all of these in addition to public clouds. Add in the juju charm store, and you have a simple to use, but incredibly powerful system at your fingertips.
[No it isn't. Backports and PPAs for newer software are not common, and they are not terms that I would expect the target audience of an OS with the tag line ""Linux for human beings"" to understand - let alone compiling from source.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c49hd3v?context=5)|I also agree that accessing PPAs is not ideal for typical users. Also, PPAs are not vetted, so installing from a PPA can make configuration changes on your system that you are not expecting and can be hard to recover from.
[*It's easy to upgrade to get the lastest and greatest every six months.*  But what about the potential boot problems. like this bug .  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c4962nz?context=5)|There are bugs.
[I, personally, would really like to see applications become more Ubuntu-ish. For example Libreoffice or Firefox being cross-platform beasts at heart, have nice, but not full integration. Esp. compared to other applications, such as the more-gnome-ish Abiword, Gnucalc or Midori. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c495rin?context=5)|Firefox and LibreOffice as upstreams both see themselves as cross platform, and the portability of their experience across platforms is important to them. We do cooperate, and they do listen. We also offer patches. We carry distro patches where necessary.  From a community perspective, I think having more Ubuntu advocates in those upstream communities would help. Also, just having more users in general make Ubuntu more important to them, so just being a user helps :)
[Does the engineering team invest time and effort into integration of such third-party applications? And how to do do that? Do you coöperate with the upstream developers? Are upstream developers of Firefox and Libreoffice listening to Canonicals suggestions, changes and integration-issues? Is there something we, the community can do to ease your work there? E.g. vote on upstream patches, mail upstream developers and so on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c495rin?context=5)|Canonical puts a lot of effort into making these apps integrate with Ubuntu. Our engineers have good relationships with their engineers. 
[Are you enjoying the French wine? :-)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c4957tz?context=5)|Well, I was enjoying it a little too much to start. So, I'm off the wine, cheese, and pastries until a lose another kilo or so :)

[I saw some numbers yesterday that indicate that Ubuntu staff contribute very little to the development of LibreOffice. Do you feel that Ubuntu should be better supporting OSS that are an integral part of the desktop environment and that determine to a very large degree whether users will use a given platform or not? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c495hwq?context=5)|We spend a lot of effort making LibreOffice work with Ubuntu. Consider how many packages are an ""integral"" part of Ubuntu. Then calculate how many engineers wold have to working on those packages for Ubuntu to be on the top contributor list for those projects. We'd never have time to write Ubuntu!
 |Anyway, that misses the point. What Ubuntu brings to Free software is critically important. Every six months Ubuntu allows you to access the latest and greatest Free software in an integrated user experience. We make Free software matter to people who would never otherwise consider using it. That's our role. It's an important role. It is a role that I am very proud to be part of.
[I recently applied to Canonical, but my application was responded to as ""unsuccessful."" Any protips if someone is looking to work there on what types of information is looked for? Thanks in advance.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c496i5o?context=5)|There are so many engineering groups with different requirements in Canonical, I can't be decisive.
 |I look for resumes that match the requirements, of course. I look for something that makes a person look like they may stand out as a leader (yes even for solely technical positions). 
 |I get turned off when someone ""spams"" the jobs (applies for every available technical position, for example). 
[Do you think there will be a Gnome version of Ubuntu (Gnobuntu, Gnomebuntu, whatever) like there is Kubuntu with KDE, anytime soon?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c496i74?context=5)|Having flavors of Ubuntu (Xubuntu, Lubuntu, Kubuntu, etc...) is a big part of what makes Ubuntu Ubuntu.
[As a follow-up, was the name ""Unity"" intentionally chosen to troll the rest of the GNU/Linux community?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c4969hc?context=5)|No, as Mark said many times, it reprepresents the Unification of UI elements across all of the form factors that Ubuntu will be running on in the comming years.
[What do you think about a steam kind of gaming for ubuntu? Gaming is the only thing stopping me from running full on Ubuntu. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c496b0y?context=5)|Something like steam would be really nice. Of course, we already have the Software Center, which delivers a lot of software, but we don't really have the games like a Steam would have.
[Where do you see gaming on Ubuntu/Linux going in the next couple of years?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c495lq7?context=5)|I don't really have a clear view on this. For my part, I gave up using a PC for anything but casual gaming 15+ years ago. It seemed every new game required newer hardware than I had, even if I *just* bought by computer.
[Can you comment about Canonical's recent choice to start referring to your kernel as the ""Ubuntu Kernel"" instead of the ""Linux Kernel""? Does Canonical truly feel that the term ""Linux"" is taboo for widespread adoption, or was there some other reason behind that change? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c497855?context=5)|I think the ""Ubuntu Kernel"" thing was a bit of a tempest in a teapot. It's just something that the release manager wrote in release notes for a beta. To be honest, I was glad to hear that someone even read the release notes.
[, drawing from that, how do you respond to the people who accuse Canonical of being the new ""Apple""; as-in, Canonical contributes very little back upstream (less-than Microsoft, surprisingly) while relying on many of those upstream products to make their product?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c497855?context=5)|I have not seen any credible comparisons between Canonical and Apple. The companies don't seem the same at all. 
[I have noticed a recent trend with smaller distributions basically becoming platforms for various desktop environments. In other words, there is only one distribution, but any of the major desktop environments can be installed.   It seems like out of all of the distributions out there, Ubuntu could gain the most from this philosophy. They could capitalize on being being the ubiquitous distribution, but cater to the various tastes as far as workflow and desktop organization. Unity might be awesome for some people, but for others (myself included) it has been enough to make me reluctantly switch to lesser distributions.   Is Desktop Agnosticism a possibility for Ubuntu's future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c496aob?context=5)|I think this is by and large already achieved in Ubuntu. You can install all kinds of desktop environments and choose them at login time.
[I have a Lenovo Y570 with a hybrid intel HD3000/NVIDIA Geforce 555M graphics card. Will 12.04 be able to do the software switch between the cards. Also will 12.04 have the advanced features such as screen mode selection, battery optimization features such as those that come standard with winbloze?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c4958li?context=5)|I don't think Hybrid graphics on Linux will be easy any time soon. I mean, it fundamentally works, but the driver support will take a while until it's easy to do the things such as you are mentioning.
[Really? I thought most people became supporters of Canonical's position after the first few weeks of the conflict becoming public, mainly because the move still resulted in a net gain on the part of the banshee team and attracted so many new users. I guess time will tell.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c496frc?context=5)|Well, it wasn't just the money. In fact, it was a net benefit for Banshee financially speaking. That wasn't really the problem.
 |Canonical just bungled the situation a bit. Part of the company promised them one thing, than another part of the company withdrew the offer, etc... 
 |The Banshee team showed a lot class and patience throughout, imo. Suffice to say, we learned a lot from this experience.
[How closesly do you work together with nVidia/AMD for X11 drivers? If I remember correctly new Ubuntu releases sometimes shipped with nvidia-drivers that weren't even officially out yet, so there seems to be close collaboration. OTOH, apparently fglrx is still not working correctly in Linux at all.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c495s45?context=5)|The Ubuntu Desktop team works pretty closely with these upstreams to help them test and land their drivers. It is still proprietary software, though, so there's only so much that can be done.
[Why is there no option to revert to a classic environment? I personally don't like unity at all. Its too convoluted to use. Would it at least be reasonable for y'all to at least have the option to install it via the package manager... ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c497f7r?context=5)|There is such an option. The name escapes me at the moment, I think it's called gnome-panel or something.
[Are you hiring/looking for interns?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c496fjp?context=5)|Sorry, Canonical does not have an intern program.
[Do you know why paid development of Kubuntu has stopped? I'd always thought Kubuntu was a great product and a credit to the project.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c49bnuo?context=5)|It's actually not accurate to say that paid development of Kubuntu stopped. There are many flavors in the flavors community, and only Kubuntu had a dedicated person. This was strange because while Kubutu is great, it is not one of the more popular flavors. Also, it didn't make business sense anymore of Canonical to offer paid support for Kubuntu. Therefore, we changed the way we support flavors so that all flavors (Xubuntu, Kubuntu, Lubuntu, UbuntuStudio, etc...) all have access to the same resources.
 |Note that there was exactly one person who was paid to work on Kubuntu, and Kubuntu is a largish community. I really don't expect that you'll see any difference in the quality of the project.
 |At 12.10 UDS I would like us to revisit how we manage flavors and see if we can be providing better infastructure and services to make it easier for them to do what they want to do, rather than just keep doing it the way we have been for years without thinking.
[So why do I have to apply a kernel patch to install aircrack-ng?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c498jdi?context=5)|I don't think that cracking wireless networks is really a core use case for the kernel team, so I wouldn't expect them to prioritize carrying this. I'm glad you got it working though.
[*This means I am the directory of the Ubuntu Engineering team, all the people employed by Canonical to roll Ubuntu and Ubuntu Server.*  So how does one become a successful directory like yourself?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c4991m0?context=5)|Attentiont o detail.
[What laptop / notebook computers does Canonical use in house? Recommendations?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c49ac1q?context=5)|We try to have people buy all different kinds of hardware so that we have hardware available when users run into hardware specific issues, which is incredibly common. For example, I bought an ASUS with hybrid graphcis for my laptop workstation for the very reason that Hybrid graphics is such a pita in Linux.
 |If I were looking for poblem free hardware, I would look to Dell and buy machines with Intel graphics with Free drivers available.
[Hey! Would Ubuntu be a good OS for a Pandaboard ES, if I don't want much else running other than a homemade shell utilizing Wayland for compositing, as well as some homemade tools? Thinking since Ubuntu works so well on a pandaboard, and have been tested etc. Or do you think Ubuntu will steal a lot of resources?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c49by9p?context=5)|I expect one of the 12.04 omap4 images will work fine for you. However, you sound like a hobbyiest who likes control. You might want to look at the Ubuntu Core release that we are doing for 12.04. You can use this to create a customized minimal system and then add just pieces that you want from our repositories.
[Do you ever plan on improving the Ubuntu Netbook Edition?  I love Ubuntu, but NB Edition is just slow.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c49fe0c?context=5)|There is no more netbook edition, we merged it with just plain Ubuntu a few releases back. I am using 12.04 on my dell mini 10v at this moment, and I do every day for a couple of hours at lease. I find Ubuntu with Unity to be quite snappy and responsive. Responsiveness has in fact improved in 12.04 due to some contributed patches that boosted performance.
[With the latest list of kernel contributors having been released, how does Canonical heel about Microsoft making more contributions of code to the Linux Kernel then Canonical(Who prides it self on being the biggest Linux Distro out there)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c49gqw7?context=5)|It's pretty clear what is happening here. Linux cloud images, of which Ubuntu seems to be on of the most popular, are in incredibly high demand in public clouds. If Microsoft wants Azure to be at all credible, they must modify the Linux kernel so images like the Ubuntu ami run well there.
 |I am proud that our efforts to simplify cloud computing and to deliver an ami that everyone wants has helped bring Microsoft to the Linux table.
[What are your thoughts of ubuntu server for small business? is that a goal for canonical? A web based GUI for ubuntu server could really help with adoption in the small business market.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c49cwhb?context=5)|I don't think Canonical is focused on this area. However, I know that many in the Ubuntu Server community are. Many of the community contributes use Ubuntu in such situations so contribute to making it work well there.

What are your thoughts on this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c49a901?context=5)|I do all of my application development in Python. It is my go to language. I don't use an IDE. I think IDEs are good for making complex programming environments accessible, but Python programming is not complex, so the IDE just gets in the way.
 |I agree with Mark about Go. I think it will come into heavy usage. I think the c-like syntax is more accessible to people than Python's radically simple syntax, and I think that the built in concurrency is targeted right at avoiding so many of the bugs that application *and* system developers run into these days.
[Why is brainstorm.ubuntu.com dead, and why has it been dead for years? Sure, lots of people still post to it, but as far as I can tell, none of the suggestions have been targeted for *any* major release of Ubuntu. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rw6iu/iama_directory_of_engineering_for_canonical_i/c49enwg?context=5)|Directed at upstream projects.
 |Extremely hard to accomplish.
 |Good ideas that have been considered but there are good reasons they have been implemented (such as we need to support packages that are reasonably easy to support).
 |Don't forget that Ubuntu is a *community open source distro*. Brainstorm shouldn't be considered a place to tell Canonical staff what they should be doing, but a place where we can call find good ideas for things that we can implement.

(Chemical/Biomedical),[deleted],AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/rx5ko/how_do_other_people_find_and_get_internships/,"I'm a female sophomore majoring in chemical engineering, biomedical option (my university doesn't have stand alone biomedical engineering, it's chemical engineering plus some specialized classes).  I have been trying to find and apply for internships since the fall.  I have looked all over the internet with no success.  The few I did find were not relevant to my interests and I was denied anyway.  My university's career services center is not helpful to me; they exclusively help chemical engineers get internships at oil and natural gas companies, which is useless to me as I want to be a biomedical engineer.  I don't even know what companies I should be looking at for biomedical engineering internships besides the few I have found through internet research that do not accept undergraduate interns.

Am I not a strong candidate?  I am a female sophomore as I said, but I started college with 32 hours from AP credits so I have junior standing.  I have had some chemical and general engineering classes (if it makes a difference, specifically chem e fundamentals, chem e computing, chem e fluid dynamics, electrical circuits, statics, electromechanical systems...).  The chemical engineering classes are only offered fall or spring and must be sequential so I'm forced into a 4 year degree, which just means I'll only be taking minimum hours to be a full time student the next two years.  I have a 4.0 GPA (yes, straight As), work as a research assistant in the chemistry department, am in my university's honors college (which means extra classes and honors classes), have three years of programming under my belt in java and Excel visual basic, have been involved in my university's orchestra playing the bassoon, and have been involved in robotics club.  I'm taking 18 hours this semester and working and literally have no time to do anything else.  So, why can't I find or get an internship?"

Reviews online are a mixed bag, but the general consensus is that you will get out of it what you put into it.

rx4j2,6,2012-04-06,We just hired another associate attorney: Some feedback for job seekers out there.,[deleted],law,https://www.reddit.com/r/law/comments/rx4j2/we_just_hired_another_associate_attorney_some/,"It may come as no surprise that our firm (a debt collection firm) is growing in this economy.  We recently hired another associate and as I've seen so many job seekers and recent grads on r/law, I thought I'd give a little feedback to some of you out there.

1- Get a CLEAN and RELEVANT resume.  I don't give a damn what you did in undergrad or how you spend your weekends.  I want to know where you went to law school, when you passed the bar, and if you've had any relevant work experience OR that you have some work history even if it is unrelated (i.e. you managed to keep from getting fired by showing up everyday and doing what you were paid to do).

2- Read the job posting before you submit your application.  I like to think of the job posting as a aptitude test.  If the posting says, ""must be a member of the bar in good standing"" and you send me a resume saying, ""I'm taking the bar this summer"" without even addressing the fact that you're not qualified and some explanation as to why I should be willing to wait, I will assume that a- you lack sufficient reading comprehension for the position, b- you are going to be a shitty lawyer, and c- you are probably going to fail the bar.

3- Do some homework on the firm to which you are sending an application.  If you were going to apply for a job with the ACLU, you probably don't want to put that you were an intern for Bill O'Riley and provide him as a reference.

4- Your interest in pro-bono work is not impressive. Why, why, WHY when you are applying for a job, would you ask something like, ""How often will you be paying me to go and do work for someone else free?""  Here's the deal. As a new lawyer, you are BARELY useful to me.  It will be about 6 months to a year before I can actually start taking things off of my plate and entrusting them to you. Why in the hell would I be interested in paying you to do LESS around the office?  Pro-bono work is awesome and very fulfilling (yes, I do my share) but you should start talking to employers about pro-bono stuff AFTER you have actually become an asset to the firm.

5- Slow down, take a deep breath, shut up, and just answer a few questions in the interview.  Don't sit there like a Cocker Spaniel puppy on meth trying to tell me why you're the best applicant ever.  You have NO IDEA what I'm looking for or what I think will make you a good fit for the job or the firm.  If I ask about experience with sales, PR, or  marketing, it doesn't necessarily mean I want you to do marketing for the firm.  It means I want to know if you can present an unpleasant argument without being unpleasant (just because we're taking your money doesn't mean we have to treat you like shit).

6- When I say. Do you have any questions...  HAVE SOME QUESTIONS. Just sitting there looking at the ceiling for a second and saying, ""nope"" tells me that; a- You think you already know everything you need to know in order to make a decision about working for us, b- You aren't actually interested in working for us but will consider it if we give you an offer, c- You are stupid enough to consider working for us without asking any questions, d- You are (or will be) a shitty lawyer because you can't even think of something to say when you are given the opportunity to take over the interview.


There are others, which I thought would be obvious to someone who has made it through law school, like...  Be on time. Don't chew gum. Don't list potsmoker@, kegzilla@, hyperslut@ or anything of the sort as your email address on your resume.

For those of you to whom this all seems like common knowledge...  Good news.  You're going to get a job because the competition sucks. "

I've seen the power of the reddit community work wonders before, and I'm hoping you guys will come through for me!

May 19th I will be graduating from Roger Williams University with a Bachelor of Science in Architecture - which I have been told is, basically, useless. Last summer I had an internship at a large firm in New York City - and the majority of the people I worked with had their Bachelor of Architecture degrees (acquired through a 5 year program). I would like to be able to start working, but is this not possible? I talked to the person I got the internship through (principal of the firm), and he basically said if I want to find a job I would need, at least, my Bachelor of Architecture degree. I am looking for advice with what to do next. I am so burned out from school (and my wallet is too), that I would love to work for a year or two before returning to a masters program. Do you think it's possible to get a job with the degree i will be receiving?

I am not top of my class, but I believe I have a strong set of skills (revit, cad, etc.) and portfolio. I will also be taking my LEED GA test in the next couple of weeks (and I got cleared to get my LEED AP after that). My school has a 2 year Master's program - but I think I would rather go elsewhere. I am attracted to NJIT because I am from New Jersey, and it is a highly respectable program (around the NYC area).

I realize that I am all over the place right now, but I am just so lost and not sure what I should be trying to do. Should I be investing my time in job applications? grad school applications? I may be returning to my old internship for the summer, and I was also talking to a firm in RI that showed interest in me after a career fair.

I think I sort of know the answer already (to contine and get my master's)...but maybe I just need to here it from people working in the Architecture field. Or maybe you guys will have other ideas on what I can do.

Any advice, personal stories, or motivation would be greatly appreciated!! thank you so much


EDIT: You guys are all being extremely helpful, I will be contacting my past internship and some other firms looking for full time employment (mostly in NYC so I can start racking up the IDP hours) -My back up plan is to perhaps begin school during the spring semester, to give myself a little break and the chance to make some more spending money.

[This is me. =)](http://i.imgur.com/yJmnd.jpg)

I've been lurking here for about a year now. Thanks to this subreddit and /r/fitness, I have begun my transformation from shapeless, fashionless blob into something more awesome. I'd just like a quick check-up on how I'm doing so far, if anyone is feeling bored on a Sunday evening. 

**Background**

Male, 23, 5'10"", 190 lbs down from 215 last year - still working on getting it lower, of course. Finishing my junior year of school and starting an internship this summer. I want to dress well to show respect for those around me, and give off a good first impression to all. 

**Questions**

1. I have a very round/oval face. I hate it. I know that losing more weight will help, but unfortunately, genetics also seems to play a part - my father is really slim, and still has a very round face with full cheeks. Anyone have any tricks? 

2. I have short legs and a long torso / long arms. You'll see what I mean in the pics. I try to wear shirts that I can tuck in to help with that, but any other advice?

3. From reading the guide on colour from the sidebar, I gather that high contrast colours are the best for Winters. I'm trying to have that contrast somewhere - if you have any suggestions about colours, I'd be especially grateful to hear them. 

**The Pictures**

Apologies in advance for any traumatized eyeballs. Also, forgive the facial masking (MS paint oval skills) - I was feeling shy last night, when I took the pictures. These are a few outfits I wear from time to time - let me know if something works well or doesn't work! 

*Casual:* 

Levi's 505s, CDBs, T-shirt from Old Navy, thrifted jacket.

Question: Is tucking shirts like this into jeans a no-no? It seems to be a topic of some debate, from here to other websites on the 'net. I don't want to really weird anyone out by doing so, but - with the whole short-legs thing going on, I do prefer the tucked-in look myself.

I only have to stay in undergrad 3 years because I have extra credits from taking community college courses during high school, but I'm beginning to feel that I'm moving too fast. I want to apply to PhD programs in developmental or clinical psychology, but I'm afraid that when I apply, they'll see me as some fresh-faced kid who doesn't know anything.

I have some research experience (by the end of this year, I will have two terms of research in psych labs and a small amount of research-related work that I completed while working as an office assistant in the education department), but I'm not sure if it will be enough to make me look like a good candidate. My GPA falls right on or close to the averages from previous admissions in the programs I've been looking at, so I'm wary of how far that will take me as well. I am currently taking a data analysis course for psych, in which I will learn the basics of SPSS. Next year, I will take a course on advanced research methods for psych. I've also been considering taking a couple more stats classes to build a better math background. This summer or fall I hope to enter an internship within the community, or I will continue research in the psych department. I will also be studying for the GRE general test over the summer and taking it in September.

I am prepared to apply to graduate school, but I'm quickly losing confidence in my abilities and interests the more I look at current admits or applicants. Am I ready? **Should I go for it and apply this fall?** Do psych programs accept many students straight out of undergrad?

**Or should I graduate and take a gap year? What do I do during my gap year?**

Alternatively, I could extend my undergraduate stay and take on a stats minor, but I'm not sure if how beneficial that would be (and I don't know if I want to spend anymore money on undergraduate education).

Help me gain some perspective, please? I also apologize if my thoughts in this post are a bit scattered. I tend to ramble when I'm nervous, but I did try to trim down the details. Thanks in advance for any help!"

Link to original: http://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/p9brc/student_designer_offered_top_tier/

Just wanted to follow up with you about my decision about the ""top tier"" unpaid internship.  Forgive me, I can't remember my old throwaway so I made a new one.

I ended up NOT accepting the internship.  I pushed and pushed to get some sort of stipend, but the owner wasn't budging.  I told him thanks, but no thanks.  It ended up being the best decision I could have made.  A few weeks ago I was offered a full-time job with excellent benefits and salary.

Especially after reading on Motionographer's article on Digital Domain boasting about their Unpaid internship workforce, I feel much much better about my choice. http://motionographer.com/2012/04/02/paying-to-work-for-free/#disqus_thread

For those out there looking for unpaid internships, I advise you not to accept unless they offer some sort of compensation. If enough of us do this, it will change the industry. I realized that working for a company with no pay was starting off on a bad foot (in regards to the type of employer they are) and devaluing my work as a designer.

Anyway, hope this helps!"

SO JUST WALKED ALONG, THINKING THAT EVERYTHING WAS FINE NOW, WHEN THE SKY TURNED RED FOR SOME REASON.
THEN I FOUND A YARD SALE THAT WAS SELLING GAMES. I FOUND A POKEMON ONE THAT WAS JUST A BLANK CARTRIDGE WITH POKÉMON WRITTEN ON IT IN MARKER. I SAID ""I'LL TAKE IT."" AND THE YARD SALE GUY WAS LIKE ""DUDE, THAT GAME IS HAUNTED."" AND I WAS LIKE ""BITCH I DON'T CARE."" THEN I PUNCHED HIM IN THE GUT AND LEFT HIM FIVE DOLLARS (WITH THREE DOLLAR TIP, OF COURSE).

I THEN REMEMBERED THAT BEFORE I LEFT, THE YARD SALE GUY TOLD ME THAT THE KID WHO OWNED THIS GAME PUT SATANIC POWERS IN IT AND COMMITTED SUICIDE, BUT THEN I REALIZED THAT I DIDN'T GIVE A SHIT AND KEPT ON PLAYING. THEN HEROBRINE CAME ON THE SCREEN FOR SOME REASON AND SAID MY NAME, EVEN THOUGH I DIDN'T TELL THE GAME MY REAL NAME. CREEPY, HUH? SO I KEPT ON PLAYING AS NORMAL. I WAS TRYING TO LIVE CHILDHOOD NOSTALGIA WHEN SOME UNOWN FLASHED ON THE SCREEN, AND WHEN I TRANSLATED IT, IT SAID ""LOOK BEHIND YOU."" SO I DID AND THAT CREEPY GIRL WAS THERE AGAIN, NOT DISEMBOWELED FOR SOME REASON. I PATTED HER ON THE HEAD, THEN WENT BACK TO THE GAME. I DECIDED TO TAKE A BREAK (BUT I COULDN'T TURN THE GAME OFF, WTF?) WHEN I FOUND SOMEONE PM'ED ME THIS THING THAT I COULD HACK THE GAME WITH,

SO I DID WITHOUT QUESTIONING ANYTHING. I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT IT WOULD DO. THEN CHARACTERS STARTED TELLING ME TO TURN BACK, TURN OFF THE GAME, AND TO NOT GO TO LAVENDER TOWN, BUT I SAID ""FUCK THAT SHIT"" AND WENT THERE ANYWAYS. I WALKED UP TO SOME KID AND TALKED TO HIM. HE SAID ""BEN DROWNED"" I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE FUCK THAT MEANS, BUT WHATEVER. SO I LEFT LAVENDER TOWN BECAUSE THE MUSIC MADE ME WANT TO COMMIT SUICIDE. SOMEONE SAW ME, THEN I FROZE. HE WALKED UP TO ME AND SAID HE WANTED TO FIGHT. BUT WE DIDN'T FIGHT. THESE WEIRD MUTATED CREATURES DID. MINE ONE, AND HIS SUNK INTO THE GROUND. THEN I STOLE HIS MONEY, AND THEN ROBLOX. THEN THE GAME DELETED ITSELF, AND I COULDN'T GET IT BACK. NOW THAT THAT WAS OVER, I DECIDED TO WATCH TV.

And one night out his best friend asks me ""so are you and A a couple?"" to which I answer ""Nah, we just met about 3 weeks ago and I don't know him too well, but it's nice to hang out with him, we'll probably hang out some more in the future 'cause I think he's a nice guy"" or something like that. I thought this was a very weird question seen as I barely knew A and we're in college, where casual sex doesn't mean you're in a relationship.. And after that night I actually never heard of A again, I asked him to go out again, but he made up a lame excuse.
Then about two weeks later I meet another guy (let's call him B) at a bar, the same thing happens, though I see him more often, we connect better, we talk more etc. Also his best friend asks me after three weeks ""so are you and B a couple?"" and I basically give him the exact same answer as I gave A's best friend, though unlike A, B starts acting much more closely towards me, he asks me to go watch his basketball game, he wants me to come visit him on his internship abroad in the summer etc, completely different from A's reaction.
So what's up with that, guys actually ask that question as a shit test to see how a girl thinks about him and then decide how they're gonna handle her? It was honestly the weirdest thing having to answer that question twice in one month."

I'm about to graduate with a marketing degree, and while everyone else that I know in the business school has already had at LEAST one great internship, I am just now starting my first internship at a small, local SEO consultant firm. It was far too easy to acquire this internship (hence the reason I got it), and now I'm realizing why it was so easy...

The owner/boss is attempting to train 8 interns by himself, and he is not doing a great job. I won't fully dive into the details because I could ramble about it on-and-on. Basically, he has been teaching us the basics of SEO that many of us already know (e.g. ""What is SERP?"") and at the same exact time, he is just blowing through completely random functions of Google Analytics with shoddy explanations before bouncing to some other SEO tool that he uses that we don't even remember the name of because most of us tend to zone out when we realize that you'd have to be super human to get anything of value from what he's talking about.

I really do want to get something out of this internship besides some words to slap onto my resume; however, 1) I have no idea what I should be learning and HOW I should be learning it, and 2) I really only fully enjoy and absorb an experience when I share it with others, so how can I do that?

Additionally, he expects us all to have a ""practice website,"" which should be an actual website owned by yourself/family/friend/etc., but I don't know anyone who would actually CARE to implement the changes I would recommend...

I'm just feeling really pessimistic and lost, and I need some guidance in terms of where, what, and how to learn, how I might be able to practice SEO, as well as how the hell to have fun with this despite having an unfavorable work environment."

I recently went back to school to become a paramedic, and with my internships, I started smoking again after a year. I've been in EMS for a while and haven't had a real problem for this past year.

I don't know if it's the work/school/internship combo or the just the fact that almost everyone smokes, but I've decided to quit and have a question:

Does anyone in the EMS/Medical field have any advice of how to not be tempted to smoke?

Thanks in advance. Day 1 again!"

I have applied to a few PH internships, but so far, nothing has come of it. I realize that if I can't do any paid work, volunteering would be okay, too, but I'm having some trouble finding the right places to look for volunteer positions.

I like to think I'm fairly handsome, I'm in decent shape, I'm always complimented on my style, intelligent, starting to advance my career (consulting internships), and do a capella. I'm not afraid at all to treat girls as great friends and be goofy and stuff.

But when it comes to asking girls on dates and the like, I'm enormously reluctant to do so. A combination of it is fear of rejection and going to a small college (2200 undergrads); the women I often find attractive are people I see on a daily basis. They live down the hall, have the same classes, are around in the library, etc. And the volatile nature of attraction doesn't help with my expectations of success all the time. I guess I fear rejection and then seeing them all the time. 

I did ask a girl I liked out to dinner last month when we were some of the only people on campus, but that whole thing was kinda really weird and is in an unresolved spot, though implicitly I think it's over. But like I said, I always see her around, we always interact, and it sometimes just feels strange.

Any advice for how to deal with this stuff? I suppose getting a thicker skin and giving less fucks are the ideal solution, but that'll take some more time"

I'll be starting an engineering internship with a large company this summer, and hopefully getting some interviews in the subsequent fall.  I've decided to upgrade my wardrobe and have made a lot of MFA-advised purchases, but I was looking at my $40 laptop bag and decided it was time for a change.

I'm 21, 5'11"" and about 200 lbs (if that matters for getting something that doesn't look oddly sized), and I was looking for a black or brown leather bag.  My question is, which is more versatile?

My price range is up to about $250 or MAYBE $300.  My dad advised that I invest in shoes and a briefcase, as they'll last forever if you take good care of them.  I'm looking to hold a 15.4"" laptop, phone, some books and papers, and relevant accessories while still keeping pretty slim.  I've searched around here to see other suggestions, but have a hard time seeing the Copper River bags working in a formal setting (which is sometimes required), and the Saddleback bags are a bit out of my price range.

I like this one a lot:  http://www.kennethcole.com/product/index.jsp?productId=12644275&amp;cp=3075215.3075278.3075281

I work as a marketing project manager in a middle sized corporation out in Toledo, OH.  I got this full time gig through an internship, and to be honest I didn't even know what marketing was before I started it (I was a history major).  For pretty much the entirety of my life, I was looking forward to the 40 hours of work that I would do every week, the moderately sized paycheck, and the amount of time that I would have off to spend it and enjoy my life. 

When I started working, I realized that the 40 hour workweek doesn't really exist, and the technology that I used to love using is just something the company uses to keep me chained to work.  I have a smart phone with secure corporate email, a corporate laptop that I'm required to have on me at all times, and we're getting iPads next week (that we're required to have on us for work).  

I work closer to 60-70 hours / week and I make a very entry level salary, and I'm seriously starting to wish I had an hourly job doing something more meaningful.  There's no work life balance, I barely get to see my family anymore, and my girlfriend (that I live with) I feel like I rarely get to see.  Are we really progressing with these technological advances or are they simply giving our employers more means to stay in contact with us at all times and consistently improve our productivity and therefore their bottom lines?  It feels like with each of these new technological advances, we're just working harder and longer hours, and it's becoming a 24hr/7 day workweek rather than a 40 hour workweek.

**TLDR** Technology used to give us serious boosts in life satisfaction (having fire, boats, refrigeration, penicillain). In the recent 5-7 years it seems like advances in technology simply just keep us busier/more distracted/lazier/give us lower quality of life. What do you think?"

I’m more curious if I can pull myself out.


Back story made short – I dated a girl for 7 years, and the last 6 months of that we were engaged.  Then she left me for some really shitty reasons.  That’s a whole other story.


Shortly after my S.O. left me, I was chatting up this girl I was friends with and see often (We’ll call her Allie, not her real name).  She’s a bit younger than me, but not creepy younger, less than 10 years younger.  Or at least I feel that’s less than creepy.  Anywho, through an internship I get free tickets to orchestra concerts and the other stuff affiliated with the orchestra.  There was a big band concert close to Valentines Day and my BFF who was supposed to join me bailed.  So I asked Allie if she would like to go.  I was completely oblivious to Valentines Day or the fact it was a Valentines themed big band concert, and she took this as me asking her out/wanting a rebound.  She has been a rebound girl before, so all the shits were flipped.  I was in no mood to date or anything, so my intentions were nothing of the sort.  We had a chat; I explained I was not trying to ask her out, just a dumb ass with no concept of calendar dates at the time.  I went on to say that yes, I found her attractive and fun, but obviously it wouldn’t be very fair to her or myself if anything like that were to happen.  I wanted a friend who wasn’t treating me like a fragile doll, and she was doing it, so I just wanted company at a concert, and wanted to keep our friendship where it was.  (We banter like House and Cuddy due to two very sarcastic attitudes towards life.)


So now we’ve hung out more.  I have really started to dig her.  But I am obviously in the hardcore friend zone place, and put there by my own actions.  What’s more annoying is her inherent distrust of men in general because all the ones she wants ignore her and anyone actively trying to flirt with her is instantly treated like shit.  I joke about flirting with her sometimes and get a stern glare.  Using the word “date” freaks her out, but twice she’s come over to my apartment alone and I have made her dinner.  No moves were made because I don’t feel like getting punched in the balls.


I don’t want to ruin a friendship, because honestly I believe going on one or two dates to “test out waters” (I don’t mean sex, I mean personality compatibility) shouldn’t mean we can’t be friends.  But I’m afraid that 1) the simple act of asking is going to kill the friendship and 2) she’s young enough to think that dating does mean if it isn’t going to work, we can’t be friends at the end regardless.  Do I have any hope, or did I ruin this chance a while back?

ryoiq,2,2012-04-07,I am giving up.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/ryoiq/i_am_giving_up/,"I quit my job in the middle of march. I had just graduated college exactly one year ago and got a high paying job as a programmer. It was all planned out very well by myself. I had the internships, decent grades, independence from my parents and everything. I even had a girlfriend I was in love with. I moved into a beautiful apartment and was honestly making a bonafide name for myself... 


--Then I dumped my girlfriend because I was so paranoid and distrusting. I know it was my fault. She was going to move in etc... It broke her heart and mine too, because deep down I thought I really loved her and she thought she really loved me. That might very well be true but I'm not sure, it is too late anyway.







--Then, I quit my job because the stress it was causing me was literally out of my control. The day I quit, I couldn't control myself walking out the door, I just *knew* I had too. It was a confusing and depressing work environment. I don't think quitting was totally my fault, I think it is something I was forced to do.





--Then I moved back in with my parents and dissolved the entire life I had created for myself. I only vaguely know what is *actually* going on with my life right now.



--I have been a pretty steady substance abuser since I was in middle school. I've never been caught (beside some close scrapes with death, and a brief chat with my parents [they are abusers too]) and I have always been able to function pretty well in society with my problem. It got in the way of my grades but I've been able to complete tasks outside of my field of work well... And I was definitely at the top of my class when it came to programming abilities. Anyway... I'm totally clean now. But who knows for how long.



..


-- I threw it all out. I don't even know why. I am so confused and extremely Jaded as to what exactly happen. My confusion doesn't totally stem from the substance usage either, but that was definitely a part of it. I will admit that.




..


-- So I am a officially giving up. I *really* dont give a fuck anymore. I've always pushed myself to care about shit but it was all fabricated in my head so I wouldn't be a ""loser"" or let my parents down, but I can't do it anymore. And I don't care because I am not sure why I should care. Poverty and an uninsured lifestyle doesn't sound too bad to me. Living as a bum feels like its a option right now. I hate living with my parents. I hate my situation. Once upon a time I wanted to work for the government or serve in the military. I can't do that for some unknown reason.

My background- I have 17 years of dancing experience (ballet, jazz, tap, lyrical) and two years of teaching dance experience. I had always done Pilates in ballet classes, although it was never explained to us as being Pilates.

I was in a pretty bad car accident a few years ago, and I sustained some whiplash injuries. I had experienced daily headaches and at least bi-weekly migraines since the accident. I went through tons of injections into my cervical spine, and not much helped the pain. My neurologist suggested Pilates, and thus began my formal introduction to Pilates. Honestly, the classes help a ton. I'm not pain free by any means, but I'm greatly improving.

I am not going to say which method I'm training in, but it's a pretty major one. The classes are very intensive, and so far I feel the training is very good. It's worth noting that not all Pilates certifications are created equal! They aren't all like this.

The syllabus looks something like this:
30 hours anatomy classes
90 hours instruction and teaching
at least 20 hours of observation
70 hours of actually doing Pilates (classes or on my own)
40 hours of practice teaching
60+ hours of internship

This encompasses both matwork and reformer work. Not counting internship, it's about a 16 week course. 

After this is all done, I am eligible to take a test to get certified in this particular method.  The test is written and practical (actually teaching someone in front of an evaluator).  I must also conduct a postural analysis during my evaluation.

Feel free to ask me any questions you might have, either about Pilates itself or the process of becoming an instructor. I am not certified at this point, just about halfway through my classes."

Due to this, u can see the given minimal amount of advice and reads (all appreciated). So I thought I would give Reddit a go:

I am a very well rounded IT guy, with a passion for programming in particular. I have been through a BS program less the internship as I refuse to go lower than minimum wage (i.e. free) and/or such opportunities find the institution lacking. Since then, the catalog for my degree has changed, so I am making peace without it. I go up for job interviews and get myself no farther than a submitted resume. I have even changed my strategy and made this website: [http://goo.gl/qqpN8](http://goo.gl/qqpN8) to showcase my highlights (but not at all exhaustive) for specific areas in the US and paid for classified ads. The 'internship' is notable as I am just trying to get my foot in the door.

Because IT is so vast, with programming and engineering in particular, I spend my time researching the requirements for the job I am applying for. This has made me that well rounded guy I spoke of earlier, but has made me a victim of being a jack-of-all-trades; unfortunately being a master of none.

I embrace my gung-ho attitude and find it to be a trait that has powered my career before. But I am starting to lose steam. I want it straight. What is not appealing about everything I am doing? What are the technologies that I need to focus on that are in great demand at the moment?

s1k77,0,2012-04-09,Need help preparing a professional cover letter. ,cmart12,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/s1k77/need_help_preparing_a_professional_cover_letter/,"I'm graduating this may with a B.S. in Industrial Engineering, and the job hunt has been difficult so far. I have relevant experience in my field from two internships and my GPA is alright for my major (3.1 in major) but I am still struggling to get past the application process with most companies. 

I believe my cover letter is hurting me the most because that is obviously the first thing a company will look at. So far I have been structuring my letters in the following format:

-Introduction about my academic background, discussing relevant coursework and programs I am involved with.

-Next I talk about my relevant work experience and the results of my internships. 

-Finally I conclude with how I believe I will fit into the company I am applying for, and discuss any other relevant experience I have that I think would be a strength for the company. 

Does this seem like a logical format or am I taking too long to begin talking about what I would bring to the company? Should the entire letter be about how I can contribute to the company and tie in my information with that discussion, or does it make sense to keep it separate?

Any help would be greatly appreciated, with graduation approaching I am starting to get nervous about finding a position and I just want to make sure I am marketing myself in the best possible way. 

Thanks for any help or advice, I really appreciate it.

Up until this last week, I held 2 student jobs at my college.  Both were programming jobs.  I held onto one (we'll call it Job A) as long as I did because my boss was on maternity leave, and at the other one (Job B) I wanted to see a project to the end.

Boss got back from maternity leave last week, and basically wants to negotiate with me to stay on at Job A for about a handful of hours - maybe 5 or so - until May.  I've been pretty firm that April 5th was my last day.  I'll do documentation on what I've previously worked on, but that's all I will do at this point there.  Obviously, she wants me to do more, but understands that I want to move on (I have a job offer elsewhere and have had a few interviews, but that's not relevant).

Job A, however, is a little less relevant than what Job B is pulling.  I'm OK with working there for 5 or so hours a week until the end of semester, but what Job B is pulling seems like something that can hurt me in the longterm.

See, at Job B, I'm working under a professor of engineering as a supervisor.  He works under the dean of the college that I attend - computer engineering.  He (the dean) is in charge of my schedule and signing me off for classes, so I really don't want to end with him (the dean) on a bad note.  However, I feel like I don't have a choice.

My resignation as a student manager for Job B was effective April 2nd.  My supervisor (the professor of engineering) is perfectly OK with this and wished me the best, but the dean has.. well, he hasn't been terribly professional.  All I'm doing at this point is documentation on the project and what needs to happen to ""future proof"" it - in other words, I'm not actively working on it, but I'm recording what work I did on it for future reference.  Today, there was apparently a meeting, which my supervisor did not attend, but the dean did.  At the meeting, the dean apparently went off on me.  He said that if I ""didn't get my act together"" that he would personally fire me.  Here are the important points:

* Two students, master's students, are constantly saying they don't know what their task is.  I have documented several occasions where I have gone in detail over what they need to do, and how they need to do it.  They appear to never understand, no matter how much I hold their hands or how simplistic I make things for them.  I am not going to go into my personal feelings on this, but my supervisor (not the dean) has been present for this several times.  I am suspicious that they are attempting to take over the project (I am a bachelor's student, not a master's student, and there are a few other prejudices they have against me) and get me off of it by whatever means possible.

* Both of these master's students were hired without my consent or my supervisor's consent.  He (the dean) literally went under our noses to hire them, even though they do not have any proof of previous work or any proof of their qualifications to work on the project.

* I have personally finished the work of both of these master's students at times just to meet deadlines.  Shame on me for it, but it was more important to me to have the deadline reached than to give them work they did not show they could do.

* As a result of the previous point, the project in question is labeled as ""completed"" as per the guidelines on the grant the project was created under.

* In addition to this, he (the dean) is complaining that I did a certain task on the project exactly the way he asked.  The man seriously cannot be pleased, and I am convinced he, like the master's students, is attempting to get me fired.


I'm honestly not sure what to do.  Week after next, I start at an internship at a local company.  While this would make things OK in a typical job situation, I'm relying on this guy to sign off on me for certain things just so I can graduate in the next year or two.

Is there anything I can do professionally?  I'm already ""finished"" with the project and have documented everything that's been completed with it at this point.  I had proposed to also document what would be done in the future, but at this point, I'm strongly considering not even doing that much because I do not want to have to deal with this any longer.  I guess I'm at the point where I'm considering just changing majors so I don't have to deal with the guy, and going with computer science instead of computer engineering.  It seems a bit extreme, but I just honestly don't want to deal with him any longer.

I'm tempted a diplomatic but professional email to my supervisor about this (not the dean).  It just strikes me that the dean is being completely childish, but I'm also not sure if this is a ""good"" course of action?  Obviously I wouldn't make any accusations on the dean or master's students and the shenanigans they've pulled, but I would probably mention the rest (such as the bit about personally firing me, in front of my entire team)."

I willingly took an internship with a company in SC, as the person who hired me really sold me on the process they follow at the company.  Unfortunately, two weeks into my internship, he was forced to resign (the company owner has some pride issues, and their original partnership plans fell through when the owner decided he didn't need the guy who hired me anymore)

Here's the beginning of the problems, after those two weeks, I started to put in more than 30 hours, occasionally surpassing 40 hours.  I was doing development work up to par with their senior developer and front-end developer - but I was still the ""intern"".  

Throughout my whole employment there, I was required to be at the office no later than 9am (the owner didn't bother to hide his disapproval if I were late to other employees); I was expected to show up during ""happy hours"" (even though I didn't drink beer, AND the owner pulled me aside telling me it's very important that I go to these, or else I wasn't being part of the ""team"") or any other activities they were holding; and I was required to file leave of absence forms for unpaid vacations or sick leave (those were probably the only times I worked less than 30 hours).  I was never paid overtime, and it was always on an hourly basis. 

Fast forward a couple of months, I was given a ""promotion"" (if you can call it that, they paid me 50% LESS for a person with my experience and degree) to ""junior developer.""  Even though I held a more ""permanent"" role, I was not treated the same way as the other hired employees. All this time, the company had not taken out taxes like all my older jobs and offered no benefits.  I began to worry.  During my internship was fine, I figured they handled it like the way my college did when I was a student assistant.  But if I was supposed to be ""salaried"" and supposed to be an employee, why wasn't I given benefits and etcetera?  I wasn't as worried about the benefits (all of my previous jobs had never offered me any benefits as I was always part time or PRN, so it didn't occur to me to ask about it) as much as the taxes not being taken out, so I confronted the owner about his.  His only response was that this would be better when I went back to graduate school during fall of the next year.  He said I was a student anyways, so it wouldn't be a big deal; they would give me a break. (Actually, I had already graduated at the time and I didn't find out until later that I couldn't really count my tuition fees from that spring semester as part of this tax season because I paid them off last fall).  There were other things too that let me know that I wasn't held with the same respect as other employees - I was given no key to the office (everyone had one), offered no personalized business cards like the rest, and so forth.

Near the end of my employment, I heard him asking others if I was worth keeping at the company, as he just hired a new director at a 6 figure salary, easily 3 times more than I was making, and he felt that I was not fitting in with the company, even though I got along well with the group I was working with.  I knew company profits were down and business was slow, but I was the only other developer who could help take the load off of their senior developer, who would have been overallocated had I not been hired as their intern.  So knowing I was next to be fired and knowing that the two managers/directors I trusted were trying to buy me extra time, I quickly found another job and high tailed out of there.

Anyways, I shouldn't have believed the owner at all, about anything. I definitely owned the government this year, and anyone I spoke to about it has told me that I was wronged.

I have already also filed an SS-8 (employee determination form) with the IRS and am still waiting to hear back...but I know it takes forever.

And after speaking with the guy who originally hired me for the company, he said that he knows I had/have an employee file with the company, because he didn't have me sign a contract like he did other contractors for the company.  

Is there no legal action I can take about what the company just did to me?  "

I'm a 24 year old college graduate. I have 7 years experience in Information Technology, 8 years experience running an at home business doing web development. I graduated in 2010 with an AAS. As part of my degree I had to do an internship in the field of my degree, I interviewed for my internship at the company I currently work and was accepted for 120 hours unpaid in September of 2010. After my internship ended in early 2011 I was hired as a temporary employee (first intern hired ever apparently) through an agency working as a sys/network administrator under the director of I.T. In feburary of 2012 I was hired full time for human resources and I.T. basically filling two job roles helping HR, and my current duties under I.T. 9 days after I was hired my boss called and told me he was putting in his two week notice and moving to Florida to be a I.T. director at a new company. 

Being the most familiar with the layout of our company, operational needs, and experience the upper management decided that I would assume the responsibilities of my boss and would review the performance after 30 days. 

He had a Bachelors in CIS and 20 years experience, was proficient in our MRP(manufacturing resource planning) software and written some custom applications for the business.I'm not to his proficiency level in the MRP software, nor have I written in the language he developed the applications in, I'm more or less in a maintenance role at the moment, making sure the business runs smoothly. 

**My 30 day eval is this week**

I need some pointers on salary negotiations - I've never negotiated my salary before, I'm informed on our area's salary range for network administrators I'm grossly underpaid (about ~27k with OT). Right now I'm hourly, but they are leaning towards putting me on salary. The starting salary for an entry level in our area is about 37K, 35 - 40 was what I was thinking of. I'm not greedy but I live with my parents right now and I have a car loan I would like to move out this year. (Additional information: Health insurance to start after 90 days, profit sharing, 401k, tuition reimbursement after 12 months - I want to go back and get my bachelors in CIS) 

Additionally I need help in my department, my boss was struggling trying to keep up with just him (3 locations in the US, two in state, one across the US with between 90 - 120 personnel total), which is why they hired me after my internship. I want to come off with saying I need help but not in a way that It sounds I can't handle the job. "

I've always been that fat girl ever since I was young.  When I hit high school all I ever did was eat and drink junk and that made me balloon up quickly. I never really cared what I really looked like, my excuse was I'd lose it later once I'm done with school. 

Well now I'm a junior in college and I have an office job in a corporation, things probably aren't going to get more stable for me aside from just finishing up school and focusing on work.  Lately I've just been feeling insanely depressed about my looks and I just really want to make a total lifestyle change.

I've been diagnosed with PCOS and because of that I actually have acanthosis nigricans.  The only ""treatment"" for these is to lose weight, and even then there is a small chance that it won't help since there are even slim women with PCOS. 

I was raised on the whole ""finish your plate"" mentality, so this basically made me over eat.  I over eat all the time because my eyes are way too big for my stomach, and I just don't want to deal with left overs.  I've just been stupidly lazy in taking care of myself and I've been yo-yo dieting in the past.  I even did stupid stuff such as the master cleanse that took me down to 245 lbs, but I eventually gave in and started eating out again. 

I'm not huge on cardio, because I have osgood slaughter in one of my knees that easily flares up since it's carrying so much damn weight, but unlike a lot of women, I love to lift and weight train.  I don't want to be one of those women that always needs a man to help lift stuff or open jars, but I don't want to be a shredded woman that looks like she's on roids.  But I recently started jumping on the elliptical and bike since it doesn't hurt my knee so much.

I've been looking online and there are people that state the the south beach diet helps a lot with women diagnosed with PCOS, I just signed up for it online today.

My main issue is having food readily available...  I'm studying to be a computer engineer and I currently work at a huge company as an intern, this alone doesn't give me a lot of time to spend shopping for and making meals for myself.  It would probably go better if I actually knew how to cook.  Right now I'm just steaming broccoli and eating canned tuna... It also doesn't help when my roommate cooks huge amounts of delicious and fatty asian foods...

I currently hate how i feel and how I look right now and I want to be healthy target weight for myself is probably 150 lbs.  I definitely am hoping to drive my self forward, but figured I would start in r/loseit to see if anyone else is in my shoes, if anyone knows of any easy recipes I can make fast and eat on the go, stories of your weight loss journey, any words of wisdom/encouragement.

TL;DR: I'm new, I have PCOS, I hate how i look/feel, I'm starting the South Beach diet, hoping to drop to 150 lbs. "

We were on the gymnastics team together almost ten years ago.  Although we were never particularly close, I was deeply saddened when I heard the news of her accident five years ago.  And I've always kind of felt guilty for not visiting her in the hospital, or even now at her parents' home...  I guess I felt like it would be awkward, just simply because of the fact that we weren't really close friends.  Or maybe just thought that she might not even recognize me after all these years...

She was a quiet and soft spoken girl, but always friendly and kind to anyone.  The one memory that stands out to me of her, is the time when she decided to try a butterfly leap at gymnastics practice.  She had apparently seen it on TV the night before.  So she just went for it!  And then ended up breaking her wrist.  We all laughed about it afterwards, but she really surprised me that day how spontaneous she was.  And from all of the stories I've heard about her time at the hospital, I know that she probably surprised many other people with her kindness, her empathy, her charm, or her spontaneity because I heard that her recovery room was always brimming with people.  She had many friends, of many backgrounds, from all over the world.  She was just a beautiful person, inside and out.  

I check her mother's blog about once a week to check on her progress.  She's now able to move around on her own (with assistance) and is communicating through the use of an iPad!  But I know that her family has been struggling financially for sometime from the medical bills and aftercare costs.  I try to make donations when I am able, but I've been living on a tight budget as well and can't give as much as I'd like.  I imagine that donations have also stopped coming in as frequently since it's now been some time since the accident.

So today I've decided to solicit the Reddit community for help.  I feel like one of those kids walking around the parking lot with boxes of chocolate caramel turtles asking to help me pay for my summer internship program...  But hey, it can't hurt, right?  If you have a dollar, or 5, or 10 to spare today, could you please make a donation [at her mom's page](http://dearada.blogspot.com/)?  

Thanks for reading.  I hope this can help get the word out about Ada and her family to more people out there."

I just kinda lost it this afternoon with everything else going on and this was the resulting word-vomit. So thank you for listening to my whining. It means alot. )

I can't get a single fucking break this year. 

Not a single break has gone my way. 

My classes suck and I hate them. I'm probably going to fail biology although I'm still trying. That part isn't the end of the world. I can take some bullshit class for that requirement next year. I'm more focused on passing calculus, but who knows how that will go. I'm studying more now but it's discouraging. I feel like I tried to do too much and I should have went to an easier school and took a bullshit major instead of trying some noble bullshit about developing myself as a person and trying new experiences. I'm stuck out in the yonder, where you aim for the moon but don't reach it and your kinda just in space doing a whole lot of nothing. 

I thought I was going to be able to move and not have to deal with commuting by car anymore, that would have been a huge benefit. I went balls to the wall and invested considerable time in internship hunting, went on two interviews for a sales position to ultimately get denied. Then I stumble onto an internship that's exactly up my alley, extremely relevant to what I want to do, not wanting to bring up the issue of pay...well, it did come up. 

It's in Manhattan, where I would love to work. Doing exactly what I want to do. But it's $1,000 **a month**

The train for the month alone is $350. That plus rent of $525? I'd be making almost nothing. I could live at home until September, meaning I could keep the rest of the money not for the train, but it's a terrible fucking salary for the time (8/hr a day plus commuting) and even though it's relevant experience, I need to make money. 

I don't know what to do. I feel like everything I've tried to do lately has been a miserable failure. I don't want to get out of bed in the morning anymore because every day feels alittle bit worse then the last, impending some major disappointment. 

I was hoping this internship offer would be the tide that lifts all boats. Instead it was like pouring a teaspoon into a fucking dry dock. 

Excuse me while I continue my day and half-ass everything just enough to get home back to bed and snuggle with my Twilight pillow, because fuck, every relationship I've given a shot at this year has failed miserably too. I want to hide under the sheets and do nothing. But then that's going to do nothing to help the situation, anyways. But at least I'd be comfortable. 

Fuck everything. Excuse me while I go back to pretending like I give a fuck at work and then try not to drive into oncoming traffic on my way to the library to work on assignments for classes I fucking hate with dipshit classmates that are better situated to be on a reality show about oompah-loompahs with rich parents.

s116o,25,2012-04-09,I want to share with you how I've passed every drug test I have ever taken.,[deleted],trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/s116o/i_want_to_share_with_you_how_ive_passed_every/,"First off, this is weed. I don't know if it works with other drugs or not. I know some people are going to say that this doesn't work, but this has worked every single time for me. I've gotten jobs and passed two drugs required for my probation with this method, as well as passing a drug test for school to intern at a hospital, which require a drug screening to work at.

First off, you only need a couple hours. And it does not involve any fake pee or products. You will hand them a cup filled with your real pee and it will pass. Here is what I do:

1. About 2 hours before hand buy 2 20oz bottles of Gatorade. I forget if they come in 40oz bottles, but if they do, get that instead because I assume its cheaper.

2. Buy 1 8oz can of Coca Cola.

3. Buy one standard sized Red Bull. The size of the can escapes me, but but the can that is the size of the original Red Bulls, before they started coming in different sizes.

That is all you need. Chug all of these about an hour before you go to take the test and DO NOT GO TO THE BATHROOM UNTIL THE TEST. This is the hardest part because by the time you get to pee in that cup, you will probably hardly be able to walk. 

Here is why I believe it works. The Gatorade dilutes the urine. This will make the THC less prevalent in it. However, you never want to go in and have pee clear. This will make them suspect. That is what the Coca-Cola is for. This will give your urine the color it needs to make the dilution less obvious. Finally, the Red Bull. Diluted urine will actually weigh less than non-diluted urine. This is because when it is diluted, the creatine levels will be lower and it will literally make your pee weigh less. Red Bull puts the creatine back in.

Now, I know there will be some nay sayers, but I am just telling you what has worked for me. I'm a pretty skinny guy, so that may factor in. I also usually stopped smoking at least a week before taking the test , which sucks because I smoke multiple times a day. I also would drink a lot of water during the days leading up to the test. I don't know if this actually does anything, but it does give me peace of mind and leaves me usually feeling pretty confident that I have prepared enough before the test. Lastly, the best way to pass a drug test is to NOT SMOKE for 4 - 6 weeks in advance. If I have the chance, I try to do this. But there have been times when I did not get such an early notice. So use this method sparingly and at your own risk. Happy toking, Ents!"

It doesn't pay alot and it's uninteresting. I need some advice here, though....

I got offered an internship in New York City doing exactly what I hoped to do, it's in marketing and very much relevant to what I'd like to do (my major's in business and environmental economics). 

The problem is it doesn't pay as much as I hoped for. It's $1000 a month, starting in May, and the train fare alone traveling to NYC is $350/month. I would be able to ditch my car, meaning no insurance and no gas or repairs and I would gain ~$1000 from the sale of it. Also, I'm moving in July and my rent would be $525/month. I'd be making enough to cover rent and the train, but not much of anything else. Is this a good idea? I'm weighing the experience vs. the fact that I need to produce some income, and I could make ~$1600 a month as a camp conselor, althought it wouldn't be relevant experience. Maybe I could save enough during May and June to float through July and August.

I want to go to grad school after undergrad: I enjoy chemistry, and I want to know more about chemistry than I will have learned from my undergrad degree. I am wondering what steps I should be taking now and over the next few months, and what would be some good programs to apply to. I have ~3.7 for a GPA at a top 20 undergrad university. I have been doing research since the beginning of sophomore year, but have missed out this semester due to being abroad. By the time I graduate, I will have had 5 semesters of research. I am also attempting to graduate with honors, which involves writing a thesis about my research, though that will not be completed until after I have already applied to schools and heard back. Despite my best efforts, I have been unable to obtain an internship during the summers related to chemistry (though hopefully that will change this summer). My area of interest is organic chemistry. I would especially love to get into Harvard or MIT (I am from the Boston area and would like to study there), though anywhere I could participate in great research is a possibility. 

What should I be doing to get ready for grad school? What would be some good programs to apply to? Should I highlight my double major/study abroad experience while applying (it might make me stand out, and I can mention that I have been auditing an orgo class in Russian while here)? And what is some general advice about grad school that you would give to me?

As I'm already looking around for architecture firms which I would like to apply for this, I'm also looking for something abroad, because the different lifestyles and styles in designing really interest me and is definitely worth it for further evolution of my overall skills.

As the USA has always interested me in forms of architecture and urban planning (in good AND bad ways, cfr. suburbs), I'm really interested in working for a firm there.

But I have no idea if this is a reasonable idea at all. Does anyone of you have experience with working abroad your first years after graduating? How are foreign architecture graduates seen by these firms?

I knew I couldn't marry her without having a foundation for our future.  I'm back in school now, one semester left and I have an awesome internship that I'm 95% certain is going to hire me full time after I'm done.

In the last few years, I've run in to a few people who think marriage is a bad idea and cite various reasons why.  Normally, I'd shrug them off and think their reasons are invalid and that I've made the decision for myself.  I've looked further in to their arguments and I think they have some valid points, though mostly focused around divorce.  I don't want to be so headstrong and arrogant as to think I won't get divorced, but I have absolute faith and trust in my fiancée and I know the feeling is mutual.

As I said, normally I can just shake this off, and it's not that I'm doubting my relationship, but I just really want to hear some people defend marriage for a change.  I feel like ripping it apart is the easy road and I want to hear what others think.  And by all means, if someone thinks it's a bad idea, feel free to share, just don't present it as ""think of all the awesome adventures you'll have and the cool people you can hook up with"" because those arguments are incredibly juvenile."

My parents are the typical ""When you gonna be doctor"" Asian parents. Their whole life, they've been pushing me to pursue a medical career, and I don't think I want to. They've lived longer than I have and they are more knowledge about the real world than I do. A lot of their friends are doctors and they are all happy being a doctor. For some reason, the people that they know who are not doctors are struggling to make a living, being either laid off, not being able to find jobs (if they have recently graduated), or struggling to make ends meet. I am doing a double major in math and psychology and I really don't know what I want to do. There are just so many options out there and it seems unlikely that I can make a choice and stick with it (compared to choosing a medical field, where the only logical option is being a doctor).

My parents say that if I'm not sure what I want to do as a job, I should try to do what everyone else wants to do--become a doctor. I could see why a lot of people want to become doctors--a high paying job while helping needy people and enjoying a high job security. If you look at average people, most of them are not doctors. As far as I know, the average people should be somewhat happy and satisfied with his or her life. 

I really don't have a plan what I want to do after graduation. Right now, I'm finishing sophomore year and I haven't had a real internship and my grades aren't stellar either. What should I do? Are most people happy with what they did after graduation? Is the real world just full of suffering and hardship for all those who are not doctors?"

Business development consulting (included)

The major roadblock is coding. I have the entire image drawn up in my head but never learned how to code. I've spoken with many coders and while I don't mind sharing the company with them, 50% of it just for the initial coding is pretty ridiculous. I also don't want to outsource the coding either (even though it can be less costly).

How should I go about acquiring people to code for the new company? 
I've come up with the following ways
1. Hire a software development company to do it for me
2. Get a team of coders who want to help start the company
3. Get a single coder who is knowledgeable in all of the necessary languages to do it
4. Hire interns to code
5. Work in tandem with a software company and give them a portion of the company instead of cash (kind of how ebay owns 25% of craigslist).

Any advice would be greatly appreciated and feel free to message me to discuss if you've started a company before.

I'm already quite experienced with business operations, marketing, etc. The main thing I'm looking for is advice on the best way to acquire coders. I know that.

I have some background knowledge of Java from high school classes and an internship. I am fairly confident when doing programming assignments, but now I want to make something myself. I want to create what is essentially a mixology app for Android. I have some ideas of how to expand the app, however, none of that matters if I can't even make the basic app.

*

As far as I'm aware a simple recipe cannot be copyrighted, but the names of drinks can. Am I protected under fair use for listing a drink with copyrighted name? What if I am making money off the app with ads?

I'm not even really sure how to get the recipes themselves without manually entering them into a database. I was thinking of using Python to scrape a website for the recipes. http://www.drinksmixer.com/drinkvw13728.html for example. Am I allowed to scrape the site for all drinks, such as that one, and use their quantities/ingredients and directions? (I doubt that most recipe apps/sites paid someone to type everything up...) I would love both technical recommendations of how to scrape recipes and comments regarding any consequences. 

*

Android seems to use SQLite. I have a tiny bit of experience with SQL, but I definitely need to sit down and draw out the database. Need to include ingredients, quantity of ingredients, name and any instructions. Again, I want to avoid doing as much of this manually as possible because I feel that with scripts is the ""right"" way. Not really sure how to put the scraped data into a database.

As you can see this project isn't too complex in the scheme of things, but is a fairly big step for me in trying to do something myself. Some of these questions are outside of programming and some are outside of my current ability, but I really want to do this the ""right"" way and build something of quality.

Feel free to make any comments (just be polite!) or ask any questions. I probably left some stuff out.

The housing that the place was going to provide for us fell through and we're in a scramble for a play to stay.  Does anyone know of any place to look (aside from craigslist) that does monthly rentals?  It's frustrating because all that comes up in search is weekly rentals.  

We realize that this late in the game we are going to have to look other places (KDH, KH, Duck, etc). We need fully furnished 1-2BD places. If anyone has any helpful sites or places that I could contact would be great.  Thank you reddit!"

Part of this comes from the fact that I wasn’t prepared to come out when I did. 

A couple of weeks ago, I checked myself into the ER because I was feeling suicidal about school and had a plan to kill myself that I didn’t go through with. I was sent to a mental hospital for 6 days before being discharged. It was there that I came out, at first to some of the patients I started to connect to and eventually to my parents. Since then, I have seen my psychologist and told him about it and he wants me to take a psych test. (As an aside, I’ve seen this guy for years and I have a follow-up appointment scheduled so I’ll complain about this shit then). Anyway, since my parents and my psychologist know about this, I don’t think I’ll be able to go back to my old life, but this is where my problem comes in.

I don’t live in the best place to transition and my biggest fear is that I will be hated or killed for the gender I identify as. My parents are as a whole supportive, even though my mom kind of thinks it’s a phase, but that’s a whole different story entirely. The problem is that everyone else in this redneck shithole of a city I live in won’t be as supportive as they are and that will come back to haunt me. No one would want to give me a job because they’re uncomfortable with who I am. 

I first felt this way when I was 18, I’m 20 now, and I was an intern at a local newspaper. The thought just hit me one day when I noticed that most of the people there were women. I didn’t want to do them, I wanted to be them. Over the next two years, this gender identity crisis was an on and off occurrence in my head, and as time went on, I felt more and more uncomfortable being a man as I kept thinking about it. I even wrote a transgender female character into a novel I was working on just to examine these issues in a way that nobody would find out about for years to come. 

This is my first post on Reddit and my thoughts are scattered because I’m still trying to understand the situation. Any advice would be appreciated because I don’t know what the hell I’m doing. Sorry if this kind of thing was asked before.

- On the same line, how difficult and rare is it to maintain a high GPA? (3.8-4.0)? 

- Are most students if not all, in the honors or scholars program? I assume so since engineering is more difficult to get into. Is there any significance to being in honors? 

- On average how many hours do you spend studying a week? 

- Since the classes for the first two years are large, how hard is for your professors to know you personally? Like if you needed a recommendation for transfers or interns.

Have nothing objective to add? Just feel like blurting out your acceptance story and/or ranting about admissions? Go ahead!

I'll start:

I'm a Californian and I'm currently deciding between UC Davis and UC San Diego. I'm a chem major who's interested in research and lab work, and so both schools are quite strong in that regard. My sister goes to Davis, so I've visited there a good bit and appreciate the homely feel that it has (which may be a factor of me visiting often). I recently came back from Triton Day at UCSD and it felt distinctly less ""comfortable"" there, but I feel that it might have more to offer academically (San Diego is a hotspot for biotechnology, so internships would be easier to get). I'm considering going back to San Diego to get another look at the campus, but I'm torn in the middle at this point. I have no doubt that I would be happy at both schools, but Davis feels more like home (not to say UCSD feels **un**homely), while San Diego has a better academic reputation (both are top ranked research universities, however). I want to have new experiences (San Diego is farther away and culturally more different than Davis), but that sacrifices the ""home"" feel of the other school. "

I have an internship in Hampton for a large part of the summer. From what I can tell, it doesn't seem like there's too much going on there, especially on weekends. I'm a college student, so I do like to have options in terms of places to meet people, places to go, things to do etc. 

Right now, I've been leaning towards moving into a sublet in either Williamsburg, or near ODU. According to google maps, both are roughly 35-40 minutes away. 

I guess my questions are, will traffic be a real killer? Is it preferable to just find a place closer to Hampton and suck it up with things to do? And of the two, should I settle in Norfolk or Williamsburg?

She first asked for college credit but found out she was not eligible. She then asked if she could work part-time but was told that if she refused to work full-time she would lose the internship. She finally asked to be compensated for travel expenses, which was again denied.What disgusts me even more is that the school helped her find this internship.

Please explain to me how this slavery is condoned and considered the norm? 

I've heard that internships are supposed to pay you if any of the tasks you complete help them generate profit but I've never ever heard of this being enforced.

EDIT: When I think volunteer work I think working for a company or organization or non-profit that helps better humanity in some sort of way. Though it's at her free will, it's a messed up system and it's wrong. Why should she need a 4 year degree + 480 hrs of unpaid experience to get a job? It's a total exploitation of the victims of a screwed up economy. So no, there's not a gun to her head... but proverbially yes there is because if she doesn't take this internship she has less of a chance of landing a job. I believe for the amount of work shes doing, and for the difficulty of it and skill required to do it she should be paid. I don't see how there is anything wrong with that

[Additional Text] Personally I've never even considered taking an unpaid internship. I cannot afford to take an unpaid internship, hell I can't even afford to take most paid ones. Instead of an internship I'll be delivering Chinese food, same as I do during the school year. I'm an art student with hundreds of hrs of freelance under my belt, when I've been offered unpaid internships and unpaid freelance I've taken great insult and made sure to tell the person off. It's just so disturbing to me that us youth are taken advantage of. When my father got his first job out of college 35 years ago he received paid training, now you have to complete months of unpaid training to be considered for a shit contract position with no benefits.

Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated.,ross_swan,advertising,https://www.reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/s2szd/i_have_an_interview_for_a_copywriting_internship/,"After months of applications/rejections, the intern god blessed me with an interview.  Because this would be my first job in advertising, I'm afraid there might be some industry norms I'm not aware of.  I'd really like to not screw this up, so if you have any advice I would love to hear it.

Thanks!"

I am a 3rd year student at NDSU and I am attempting to create my portfolio to apply for a position. I am having the toughest time trying to organize everything so that it would better help me. Basically I have my studio projects to show my skills. and with that I have made an video for my most recent project. As for my past work experience I have created a series complex Revit families.

What I really want to know is what are employers looking for out of new interns in a skill set."
s2rso,6,2012-04-10,"About to graduate, feeling helpless/lost/depressed....help me Reddit",IntotheRealWorld,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/s2rso/about_to_graduate_feeling/,"I am about to graduate undergrad with a bachelors in Management Information Systems and I feel like I have lost all my passion in life. This time last year I was very motivated to graduate, start a career in IT and move out of my parents, but now as I feel I get closer to graduation I find it hard to motivate myself to do anything. The only way I can think to express my feelings is by explaining the factors which I believe lead to my feeling of this. The main things that distract me the most are job hunting/school, legal troubles and my awareness of issues.
 Job hunting, while I know I haven't been searching long (about 3 months) I am starting to realize things about my education that may actually set me back. I never had an internship nor worked in my field of study and now this is hurting my job search. I love what I went to school for, specifically the idea of creating a solution for a business based on technology. I become discouraged when I search for jobs because they are mostly more technical positions, which I also enjoy but my Major isn't as technical as say a Computer Science degree. A lot of my classmates express similar feelings and are seeking jobs in other fields. 
Another big thing is I was arrested last December for possession with intent to sell marijuana, it has been dropped to three possession charges since then and I am hoping it doesn't hurt my job search (if it hasn't already). It makes me feel like I am a bad person, even though when I really think about it I had no intentions(and don't believe I actually did) to harm anyone, I was only trying to make a quick couple bucks and smoke for free. Regardless it really took a hit on me and stressed me out. 
 I have also recently become politically interested and like to spend a lot of time educating myself on the problems in the world and thinking of solutions.  I find now that the only motivation I can get is with these problems. Many times I will write down solutions, some of which are completely doable and this is the only time I feel I can make myself think, stay focused and motivated. 
Overall, I feel very unproductive lately, and can not find motivation to use on school work or job searching. I feel distracted, like I can't stay focused on anything productive. Can anyone relate to this? Or have any advice for me? I know I need to get my ass in gear and to stop feeling sorry for myself, but I can stop feeling useless, helpless, lost and depressed.

s2rl5,0,2012-04-10,"My friend is about to take a full-time 40hr/week unpaid, uncompensated, un-credited internship in an HR department. Explain to me how this is legal?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/s2rl5/my_friend_is_about_to_take_a_fulltime_40hrweek/,"EDIT: At the top because I realized I set me self up to me misinterpreted. When I think volunteer work I think working for a company or organization or non-profit that helps better humanity in some sort of way. Though it's at her free will, it's a messed up system and it's wrong. Why should she need a 4 year degree + 480 hrs of unpaid experience to get a job? It's a total exploitation of the victims of a screwed up economy. So no, there's not a gun to her head... but proverbially yes there is because if she doesn't take this internship she has less of a chance of landing a job. I believe for the amount of work shes doing, and for the difficulty of it and skill required to do it she should be paid. I don't see how there is anything wrong with that

My friend is about to complete her 2nd yr of college and for 3 months this summer she will be taking this internship. She first asked for college credit but found out she was not eligible. She then asked if she could work part-time but was told that if she refused to work full-time she would lose the internship. She finally asked to be compensated for travel expenses, which was again denied. 

What disgusts me even more is that the school helped her find this internship.

Please explain to me how this slavery is legal? I've heard that internships are supposed to pay you if any of the tasks you complete help them generate profit but I've never ever heard of this being enforced. If it is legal why? If it isn't legal how to companies keep getting away with it? What can she do in order to receive some monetary or credit compensation?

[Additional Text] Personally I've never even considered taking an unpaid internship. I cannot afford to take an unpaid internship, hell I can't even afford to take most paid ones. Instead of an internship I'll be delivering Chinese food, same as I do during the school year. I'm an art student with hundreds of hrs of freelance under my belt, when I've been offered unpaid internships and unpaid freelance I've taken great insult and made sure to tell the person off. It's just so disturbing to me that us youth are taken advantage of. When my father got his first job out of college 35 years ago he received paid training, now you have to complete months of unpaid training to be considered for a shit contract position with no benefits. F this system."
s2py4,166,2012-04-10,How Do You Make Him Stop?,Pharazlyg,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/s2py4/how_do_you_make_him_stop/,"I’m an idiot. A real fucking screw up. You dabble and you muse and when you dive in it comes to bite you in the ass.  I sit on the internet all day, watching horror movies, researching legends and myths, and when I found reddit and everything it had to offer on these subjects, you can just imagine to what level my obsessions went.

I’m writing this with shaking hands. I can’t tell if it’s fear or just the poisonous amounts of caffeine and nicotine in my body right now. I’m writing this to tell you guys to stop. If you’re obsessing and reading and can’t get enough, just stop. It’s not worth it when the computer screen finally goes dark and you’re left in your room all alone. In the dark. With him.  

I played the game about a week ago. It’s called the Midnight Man. I’m going to guess anyone reading this knows what it’s all about, but just in case you don’t, here’s the basic premise; At midnight, you write your name on a piece of paper, place several drops of your blood on it, and put it in front of your door. After that, you knock twenty two times, open the door for a moment, and then close it. At this point, it’s said that the Midnight Man has entered your home. You’re supposed to have a candle with you, moving around your pitch black house until 3:33 AM. If you stop moving, the Midnight Man finds you and forces you to hallucinate your greatest fears until 3:33. 

I played with my girlfriend. The house was dark and we both had our candles. After about an hour of moving around, we became a little bored. I snuck up behind her and gave her a good scare. The scare was enough to ensure a little friskiness and we ended up on the couch in my living room. In the middle of the festivities, I turned my head and swore I saw a black shape on the already solid darkness of the room. I jumped and ended up scaring my girlfriend yet again, unintentionally this time. I told her what I saw and she told me, in no uncertain terms, that I was full of shit. I got an earful about how I was too obsessed with this horror shit and needed to get my priorities in line. This wasn’t the first time I had tried to freak her out mid-hayroll. She stormed out. The time was 2:26 AM. 

I fell asleep on the couch after that, attempting to get her to text me back. 

I had the worst nightmare that I can ever remember having. There was blood. A lot of blood. But it wasn’t coherent, it was just screams and faces. And fear. Just pure fear. At any moment I could die, and DID die, but yet, remained in fear for my life. A life that was always in danger, yet never in danger. It was fear without end. It wasn’t even corpses, or creatures, or the normal, routine stuff of nightmares that any horror addict had grown accustomed to. It was just pure terror, as if injected straight into my veins. 

I woke up, sweating and sore. My throat felt raw. In the nightmare, I knew I was running and flailing and panicking and screaming. I must have done so in real life. I can still feel the burning in my throat now. I feel like I couldn’t scream again even if I wanted. 

I was convinced I did see the black shape at this point. I checked my phone; 3:35. I knew I had spent at least two minutes scanning the now, seemingly, darker room for any signs of life or otherwise. 

I told my girlfriend. She didn’t believe me. I’m not going to even go into the details. You’re all smart people. Most likely as addicted to this stuff as I am. You know how skeptics get. It wasn’t a big deal until the next night. 

I fell into bed after a ridiculously long day. The elevators had even broken just as I was on my way out (I’m an intern at an accounting firm downtown). I was just reaching that point of half-awake/half-asleep when my last bit of consciousness caught motion at the end of my bookshelf. Now, my room isn’t nearly as dark as the rest of my small house, as the windows for the second floor are right at streetlight level. However, this does mean that all sorts of crazy shadows are thrown into the room. If you had asked me a week ago if that creeped me out, I would have laughed. Not now. 

I saw it again. The shape of a man, or what something thought a man should look like. It had the appropriate limbs and structure, but it just looked unnatural. It was a shadow with texture, like a black, decomposing snakeskin sliding between the shadows of my room. It made no effort to hide itself. As it moved, I saw its mouth opening and closing sporadically, like it was trying to breathe or talk, but couldn’t quite figure out how. It became more agitated as it moved from behind the bookshelf, to in front of my desk, to the point where it peeled itself off the wall and started gliding towards me. 

I screamed like I never thought I could. I swear I tore my throat open. I screamed the way I thought no one did in real life. I scrambled to my night stand and hit the light. In one, eye-shielding instant, the room was awash in the soft glow of my lamp. The figure was gone. I sat shaking, unable to move. Sick fear was in my gut and it wasn’t going away. It still hasn’t. I sat up all night. 

I kept the light on for the next two nights. But now he’s gotten smarter. He just waits outside the circle of light, pacing and silently babbling. And he doesn’t stop there. He’s suddenly everywhere. 

Yesterday, I was told to go home from work. I don’t blame them. I look terrible. I haven’t slept more than a few hours per day. My boss found me passed out on my desk. He woke me up and told me to go home. I told him I was having some family troubles. He seemed to buy it. I stepped on the elevator and hit the ground floor button. As the elevator started moving, the lights flickered once. I almost lost it right then and there. In the instant they flickered, I knew he was there. I didn’t see him, but I saw him. I know, somehow, I did. I ran out of the elevator as soon as the doors opened wide enough. 

That night I slept at my girlfriend’s house. I thought sleeping somewhere else would help. It didn’t. The nightmares came back, except this time he was there the entire time. The screams, the pure fear, the faces, the blood, and him. He just stands there the entire time. Twice, my girlfriend woke me up. I got another lecture on this “horror shit.” She didn’t appreciate the thrashing and the screaming. I decided it was another sleepless night. 
From where I am right now, it’s about seven hours until sunset. I don’t want it to happen again. I looked everywhere for a solution. I burned sage, I bought a crucifix and a bible. I even poured a circle of salt around my bed. I don’t know if any of this works. This has never happened to anyone else who’s played. I wanted a thrill and now I got one. 

Don’t fuck up like I did. If you’re obsessed, take a break. It’s not about fear anymore. I’ve had enough.

[Have you kept in touch with any particular guests (if any)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s1h5i/iama_previous_employee_of_the_jerry_springer_show/c4adats?context=5)|HELL THE FUCK NO.
[Did you have sex with any of the guests?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s1h5i/iama_previous_employee_of_the_jerry_springer_show/c4abuwb?context=5)|Only the trannies. 
[Tranny is kind of a slur like faggot, do you mind not using it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s1h5i/iama_previous_employee_of_the_jerry_springer_show/c4ah4y0?context=5)|I guess you have never said OP is a faggot... maybe you should start now...
[The individual guests put themselves there, to be sure, but the show chooses which guests and how to present them.  And it picks on minorities in particular, in a very nasty way.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s1h5i/iama_previous_employee_of_the_jerry_springer_show/c4aqhrn?context=5)|I'd say more of the people I dealt with were white, actually. 
[Nope never have and never will. It doesn't convey any real meaning and it just meant to hurt someone, furthermore it holds the connotation that being gay is something bad, which I dislike very much.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s1h5i/iama_previous_employee_of_the_jerry_springer_show/c4al9tl?context=5)|You won't make an exception to the rule? 
[How fake is it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s1h5i/iama_previous_employee_of_the_jerry_springer_show/c4abujq?context=5)|40%. Haha, everything is embellished, but rooted in truth. People are hired to Make a couple into a love triangle, everyone has to fight, and you should see these people before they go in to hair and makeup. 
[So, these people have actual issues with the other guests but make it bigger than life somehow? Is it that the show's writers make a small family feud into some sort of incestual thing that it never was? Could you elaborate?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s1h5i/iama_previous_employee_of_the_jerry_springer_show/c4adk69?context=5)|It depends. Some people are really acting a lot, but the incest story that I was talking about was pretty legit. The girl who was fucking her stepdad was talking to me about it when I took her outside on a smoke break ( they had to be supervised at all times) and was telling me that her sister really did hate her for it. Her sister confirmed this many times. The couple was creepy as fuck, and the sister really did hate the fuck out of them... so their fight, story, etc. was pretty legit. 
 |On the other hand there are many instances of bullshit... 
 |One woman didn't know what accusations to make so she made up the following while I was in the room with her.. pretty hilarious : I Found a condom under the bed, we don't use condoms! 
 |I've also heard ""she's my homegirl I don't want to fight her.""
 |The best instance of this though was a scrawny little black man that seriously looked like Flava Flav, named Santiago. He had a tranny girlfriend that was approx. 400 lbs. This obviously wasn't enough of a scandal so they hired some dude to act as a third lover to make a more dramatic ""love triangle"". 
[*People are hired to Make a couple into a love triangle.*  What does that mean?  are you saying they hire a prostitute to fuck a guy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s1h5i/iama_previous_employee_of_the_jerry_springer_show/c4ahcis?context=5)|No, they don't fuck. The third person is just a hired ""actor"" who just goes along with whatever story the producers give. 
[Was there a particular guest, or couple, that stood out the most to you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s1h5i/iama_previous_employee_of_the_jerry_springer_show/c4abu6r?context=5)|Oh yeah. The most disturbing was a family of two sisters and a stepfather/ father. 
 |Sister A's (lets call her Tina) father was deceased, and her mother remarried and had sister (Well call her Val). Val's father and mother had recently separated, and he and Tina, his stepdaughter, became engaged. This couple was the raspiest, dirtiest, most Beverly Hillbilly people I have ever seen. The sister, Val, was a 6 foot tall bohemeth. Absolutely disgusting. 
 |And when the time came for the on stage fight, and scrawny ass Tina kicked the shit out of her, I was the one locked in a bathroom taking off Val's shirt to reattach her mic to her newly broken bra. -_-
[Tall people are not disgusting :(](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s1h5i/iama_previous_employee_of_the_jerry_springer_show/c4ahmhe?context=5)|She was 6 foot tall and probably 350 lbs... and I had to put my hands inside her sweaty shirt to fix her shit so she could go back on stage to do some more fighting. 
[Because of this story, I have an inter-quest to go on.....any idea of what season/episode?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s1h5i/iama_previous_employee_of_the_jerry_springer_show/c4ah7zq?context=5)|Ummmm... it was shot in december or january of 2009/2010. I have seen the episode before I will try to look for it too! its a great one, and the individuals involved were well... the only way to describe them is ""grey"" if that makes any sense..

His show is some FUCKED UP SHIT. That's the heavy stuff and his wife is the exec producer. He always makes comments about sex when it comes up and it always looked super awkward for her. 
 |Jerry was way chiller, less egocentric for sure.

And basically everything goes in. 
 |Jerry's little stand up act before is cool, but itis the same every time. 
[Does it actually ever help anyone?  after the huge confessions do they actually work out their problems backstage and go home happier than they came in?  or is it like you said mostly for tv and nothing really changes between the people who have problems.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s1h5i/iama_previous_employee_of_the_jerry_springer_show/c4adrb7?context=5)|Yeah basically its just women hating their baby daddy... they leave still hating their baby daddy but at least they have 5 or so packs of cigarettes when they leave and get to take a limo to the airport.

I couldn't believe what these girls thought looked good... But it wasn't really up to them. The production assistants told me what they were going for... Slutty, pure, etc. from there I pulled clothes and brought them to the green rooms. Basically nothing was slutty or trashy enough, they wanted everything too small, or something with a terrible fit every time. 
 |Trannies aka t girls are the worst. Try stuffing a fat ass man foot into heels that people have to wear again and again. Ugh.

Very rarely did people call about the ""question of the day"" or whatever it was, but usually it was a woman crying about getting abused, about her daughter, or something equally sad.

I suppose I'm thinking about it relatively early - 20's, had a few internships with some money left over, still in college - but I believe that it's never too early to start putting money away for older me. I just want to put it away in the right place, with reasonable compounded interest and as tax-free as possible.

I'm leaning towards a Roth IRA at the moment, but I would really like to know what's out there before I commit. Both suggestions and additional resources are welcome.

EDIT: Thank you all who responded, I think I'll choose the Roth IRA based on the information you have given me. I'm still undecided about if I should rush to open up an account before the filing deadline on April 17th, or if I should wait, acquire more money, and open an account within the upcoming year. So additional advice on that would be helpful as well."

s29ja,0,2012-04-10,My story,ADHDthrowaway101,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/s29ja/my_story/,"Hi /r/adhd, I just discovered this subreddit and after reading a lot of comments that I could relate to I decided to just sort of spill my story and heart out.  Please excuse me if the writing gets sloppy at some points.  It's late at night and I've been drinking a few beers...

So I'm 21 years old and was diagnosed with ADHD when I was in 1st grade, which I believe was around the time when ADHD was starting to become more well known and understood.  I can't recall how much it affected my childhood and it's not really important to this conversation so I won't really go into it.  

You know what, let me get to my main points because I'm starting to feel less and less motivated to do this, so let me get this out quickly before I just abandon it altogether 0_o.  Fuck it I'm going James Joyce 'stream of consciousness'...

About two years ago (summer before junior year) I started to feel very depressed.  During that summer I started my first job as an intern and hated it.  I hated working for people, I hated being told what to do, I hated doing bullshit tasks etc.  Around that time I also started self-studying philosophy, which I've continued to do since then.  I feel I've become a lot more intelligent since I've started studying philosophy, but at the same time I've felt more depressed by doing it.  Ecclesiastes 1:17-18 really speaks to me there (I'm atheist btw).

Also I'm a virgin.  Not exactly an easy thing to say, even anonymously on the internet.  Never had a girlfriend, but I don't think I'm ugly and I can generally talk to girls pretty well.  I think I have an appearance issue though.  I always have to see how I look in a mirror and I'm generally uncomfortable with how I look, so I always feel that girls will just find me repulsive for whatever reason, despite deep down I know I'm rather attractive. I guess I always I always have these fear that I'm being judged around strangers or acquaintances as well.  I think I'd be a pretty baller boyfriend, I would just love nothing better to cuddle the shit out of whatever girl I'd be dating.  I really can't think of anything better than to get under the covers, spoon like a boss, and listen to that rainymood.com site for hours.  This all has been a large influence on my depression obviously.  

I have almost no motivation to do anything.  I have a bad habit of not doing my dishes and when my roommates asks me to do them I get really pissed off, despite the fact that I know I should really do my dishes.  I guess I have a really hard time being told what to do.  My major is marketing, but I fucking hate it.  I feel like college has been a general waste.  I really really hate being taught.  I have a test tomorrow and I'm looking at the book and the chapters that are supposed to be on the test and I just couldn't care less.  Despite this I still love to learn, as I mentioned before, I like to read a lot of philosophy books and I also like studying science, and economics, history, politics, psychology etc. but only if I choose to on my own.  I took a philosophy class last semester and dropped it after three days because I was starting to lose interest in it just because someone was teaching it to me.  what the fuck?  Does anyone else feel that way too?  I have this really strong desire to write a screenplay, write poetry, write song lyrics etc. but it's hard to bring myself to do any of it, and when I do I cross it out thinking it's just not good enough.

So I'm about to graduate college soon and I am trying to find a job.  And by trying I mean I've done very little about it.  Mostly it's my father who has been pushing me to send my resume out, make contacts etc. but I feel that if I get out of college and get a job in marketing, my brain will just collapse in on itself.  I wouldn't be able to handle it.  For the last few months I've been obsessing over just taking some menial job.  I was looking at some of the top thread in this subreddit, and I noticed some comments in which the redditors stated that they would like to just do menial tasks like gardening or painting.  I really wouldn't mind working at Barnes and Noble or even fucking McDonalds.  But what the hell am I supposed to do with the rest of my life?  I still what to live normally (whatever the hell that means).

I take medicine for my ADHD, and it helps me to think clearly, but I can't use it forever.  I can't really talk to anyone when I'm on it, so it wouldn't be practical to take at work or whatever.  So it's like a lose-lose situation.  If I take it at a job I'm asocial.  If I don't take it I can't think clearly.  

I was supposed to call my dad on sunday about emailing a friend of his regarding job contacts.  Still haven't done it yet.  I think I'm just going to call my parents tomorrow and tell them there's no way in hell I can get a ""real"" job right now.  I just can't do it.  What the hell should I do?  I'd really just rather sit on my ass all summer and read, sleep, relax etc maybe work at Barnes and noble.  But I really can't get by in life with this sort of overall mindset going on.  I want a normal life (again, not entirely sure what that means) but I don't see how it's possible for me to get one.

I feel like I could do a lot of great things with my life if all these issues were constraining me."

s27hg,1,2012-04-10,Time to be a grown up...but how?,walledin,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/s27hg/time_to_be_a_grown_upbut_how/,"My mind feels like it's at the bursting point, and I really need to review the facts and marshal my thoughts. Something tells me this could take a while...

The paralysis in my stomach began when I was 18, but it took three years before my increasingly numerous doctors had any idea what was wrong, time I spent in a gradual but steady decline. Soon I was almost always ill. About five minutes after eating anything I'd feel like I'd swallowed live scorpions and would be incapacitated by pain. All of the money I'd saved for an apartment was quickly spent on diagnostic tests that all came back negative. Finally, my attendance at school suffered to the point there was no mathematical possibility to save my grades, so I left school. I thought I'd focus on figuring out what was wrong with me and getting better and try again.

After another year of scans, I still had no answers. I grew increasingly afraid that whatever I had was killing me by slow degrees, and no one would no why until the autopsy. I resolved to go back to school, and came up with a game plan. Skip breakfast and lunch and drink a great deal of Pepto during the school day, do my homework, then eat a meal with enough calories to keep from losing more weight and endure the pain until morning. I was maintaining good grades, but then I got extremely sick just before finals. I missed them, which meant an automatic F in every class. 

The silver lining was that I'd gotten bad enough to be diagnosed from one of the dozens of scans the doctors ordered. It took a long time, but I learned to mostly manage my condition. Still, every few months, I'll have a week and a half where the pain, nausea and exhaustion are incapacitating. 

When I went back to college yet again, I tried to get a case manager from the Center for the Disabled to review my case, but it was months before she could see me. When she did, she told me it was a shame I couldn't get in earlier, because she would have advised me to take online classes instead of coming to campus. Well, shit, why didn't that occur to me at the time? Same old story--I do well in all of my classes until my symptoms strike me down for two full weeks. The attendance policy being what it is, I'm once again forced to drop out.

Now here's the big problem--through all of this time, I've been paying for these classes from savings bonds given to me by a relative in my childhood and my parents have helped pay my outrageous medical expenses. I haven't been able to work for the same reason school hasn't panned out--I figure no employer would keep me if I might be out of commission for two weeks at a time, even if they ignored my years of unemployment.

Today I found out that my parents are having serious financial troubles of their own. I feel awful--they have their own medical bills and a mortgage to content with and here they've been giving me room, board, and paying for my medical expenses--there's no way I can keep gobbling up their resources knowing they're in trouble, and furthermore I'm 23 and want very much to be independent--I have to move out and get some sort of job, yesterday if possible. My case manager thinks I'd qualify for money from Social Security, but that process can take years and a lawyer's help to wade through. I have about $4,000 left from the bonds, so I'd have enough to pay for rent and other expenses for a little while, but how long? And won't prospective landlords care that I'm jobless? 

I'm (trying to be) a writing major, but I haven't gotten to any of the classes in freelance writing or preparing fiction for publication, and I feel lost when I think about embarking on my career at this stage. Thinking about how much I don't know makes me feel dizzy. How does one get into freelancing? Write a few dozen articles and send them out until someone bites? What format should I use for submitting them? What price do I charge per word? 

I can learn these things on my own and through trial and error, but how long will that take? With as little money as my parents have left, I don't want to stay any longer than I absolutely have to. And I don't dare assume writing can support me, certainly not at first. Unfortunately, it's my lone marketable skill. Should I take a job I can do from home, so I don't get fired the first time I get really sick? That would be ideal, but so many of them are scams... Data entry? The best my resume could possibly offer in that area is that Mavis Beacon seemed impressed with my typing speed in the high school computer lab. Actually, with how long I've been out of work, few places would think I'm a good prospect. And that's if they don't figure out I'm a touch sickly. I look healthy, just tired, so I might get away with omitting that fact for a little while. 

I can get back into volunteering to bolster my resume, which I've been itching to do for a while, but people rightfully want to know you a little before vouching for you to an employer, and enough years have passed that I might not be remembered by those I worked with in the past.

Maybe I can get work study, but that can't start until Summer semester (yes, I'm going back yet again, with online classes this time. I don't give half a damn if it takes fifty years and beggars me for life, I value education for its own sake, and I will never, ever stop trying) and work study positions are in huge demand. I want to have moved out by then to avoid any financial aid confusion and spare my parents' wallets, anyway.

I've heard some nasty stories about the local temp agency, but would that be an option? I don't need a good job right now, I just need any job. And if I get fired from whatever job I somehow land? Well, I'll get another one. I'll muddle along. It's more than time I learned to stand on my own two feet. 

An internship could work for as long as I can keep my attendance steady. They're in high demand, but it's worth a shot. Should I focus on getting a job first and go back to school in the fall? But I've wasted so much time being sick already, that doesn't seem like a viable solution either...

At this point I feel like I'm playing a game of pin the tail on the life altering decision. "
s26t3,2,2012-04-10,I don't want to go home after school is over. Anyone have any experience with my situation?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/s26t3/i_dont_want_to_go_home_after_school_is_over/,"My parents don't treat me poorly, so it's not like I'm in a Harry Potter-like living situation, but I dislike how reliant I am on their welfare and we aren't currently speaking to each other due to recent events. 

I don't have any job experience, and I'm broke as all hell. I haven't had much money in my accounts for as long as I can remember and today after school has been paid for I've got less than $60 to my name and I'll have to reserve all that for food.

Do any of you have any suggestions for how I can land a job when I don't have any prior experience to put on a resume? Do I just mass apply everywhere and hope they overlook that fact? Does it even matter that I don't have job experience in anything? Every job application I've ever seen seems to require previous employment history.

I'm a 4th year computer science major but honestly I don't feel like I've learned much so I'm reluctant to try for an internship in my field. At any rate, I'd like to build up some capital so I can hopefully rent a cheap apartment while continuing to work and pay off loans.

Any suggestions at all would be pretty helpful. If you read through all that, thanks - in a way, I just needed to get these thoughts out of my head.

So I go to college somewhere in California, and as any college student, I like hosting/going out to parties on a typical weekend. The thing is there is this one girl who always comes up with a group of her gfs from L.A. and she's always friendly and chill when she's sober and ridiculously touchy ( hair, hand , sometimes my crouch ) when she's drunk. Now we haven't done anything but I can tell she's into me ? ( Im guessing by her actions) She's pretty cute, super chill and what not but Im not looking for a gf right now. 
Now theres this girl back home, Im from San Diego who I have known for nearly a decade and with whom Ive recently connected with through FB. She's chill and she just recently broke up with her toolish bf. Im, like any other college student, looking for an internship and she's helping me out with her connections and what not. Now when i first met this girl back in 03, i had a huge crush on her but i have moved on, but there are still some feelings there. Idk if Im friendzoned with her or what or do i have a chance and what not. 
I like well over 500miles from home and only go back on big breaks, spring break, winter and summer. 
so yea my question as to what do I do? Chill with the girl who comes up to my place or start more and more hanging out with the girl in SD? "

I was riding to my internship last week and 1 block away from work I entered an intersection after the light had turned green and in my peripheral vision I see a midsized SUV come barreling at me from the right at 35mph, blowing the red light. Fortunately, I had maybe half a second to apply the brakes before impact which prevented the SUV from impacting my leg but was not enough to avoid the collision to the front end of my bike, bike was ripped out from under me and I was thrown free. I was unfortunately not wearing complete ATGATT at the time and was in just some regular pants. I only received bruised and road rashed hip/knees (almost would have been completely avoided if I was wearing my gear), bruised foot, neck strain, tweaked back, (Possible concussion) and bruised hand. All that and a ""fun"" trip to the E.R. in an ambulance as a possible trauma case since it was an over 35 mph crash.

So just a reminder to wear as much gear as you can as I unfortunately got to see first hand how much it can prevent further injury.

I am currently a sophomore in a university atm. I am planning on getting a BS in biology and then applying to pharmacy school. I have no volunteer hours or internships yet, since I have to work a lot to pay for college/rent/etc. However over this summer I will be doing a lot of volunteer hours at a hospital. My GPA is a 2.7, and I am going to try to raise it to at least a 3.3. My problem right now is that I am not actually interested in pharmacy, but microbiology and lab work. My family doesn't agree with this because they don't believe I will make money in this field. In all honesty I have never met anyone who chose this as their career choice either. But on the other hand a lot of my family members are in the pharmacy field. I'm not sure what to do right now and I feel as though I won't ever be good enough or as interested in this field for being a good pharmacist. And I keep hearing that pharmacy is getting insanely competitive.

My two questions are:
-Do I even have any hope getting into a pharmacy program after -getting a BS in biology?
-Is microbiology a horrible way to go, career wise?

s24i2,79,2012-04-10,What my parents don't know about college today.,bl1y,lostgeneration,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostgeneration/comments/s24i2/what_my_parents_dont_know_about_college_today/,"I'm going back to school in the Fall and in discussing this with my parents I've come to learn just how ignorant they are about the way higher education has changed in the their lifetimes. Here are a few things they didn't know:

In 1979, paying tuition at a state university required working a minimum wage job just 5 hours a week. A private school would take 22.25 hours.

In 2009 those numbers were up to 18.5 hours of minimum wage for public school and 64 hours a week for private school.

Internships are now largely non-paying. Not just that, but you have to pay for the privilege of working for free. That is, you still pay for the credits even though it costs the school nothing more than minimal administrative costs. (By the way, you may want to consider getting just 1 credit, even if you qualify for more, to keep costs down.)

Entry level government jobs are increasingly unpaid, because they're not subject to minimum wage laws. Even some private sector jobs are simply calling their junior workers ""interns"" thinking that means they don't have to pay them. This is in fact illegal, but who's going to rat them out when you need the experience and reference?

No more subsidized loans for grad school. If you go to a three year program, it will cost you an extra $5,500 to attend. That's interest accrued during school, plus interest on that amount because it becomes capitalized (6.8% for 15 years). If you work minimum wage, you can either pay off the costs of unsubsidized loans in now, or attend 3 years of state university in 1979.

Employers now care about skills over credentials. It used to be that a college degree was a sign of high level general competence. Now it's a sign of moderate intelligence. Employers want more. *And they should.* I don't blame companies for realizing that a college degree doesn't mean much. I do blame the 30 years of blissful ignorance that told my generation all they needed was a college degree without paying attention to how the world was changing.

The biggest thing though that I realized my parents don't understand about college today is that many of us leave wanting to do intellectual and creative endeavors. Having an upwardly mobile comfortable income is important, but it's taken a back seat to contributing something meaningful to the world. Many of us would gladly take $30k a year and a job we want over $60k in a Dilbertesque cube farm."

s23t9,3,2012-04-10,Temporarily not smoking because of potential pre-employment drug screens. Any insights?,xkhakuran,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/s23t9/temporarily_not_smoking_because_of_potential/,"Hey all,

First off, thanks to everybody that reads this. It means a lot. Here's my situation: I'm a senior undergraduate, about to graduate with a degree in Biology. I'm taking a year off before starting grad school, so I've been trying to find some internships or short-term jobs. I've applied to a bunch of places relevant to my field, but haven't heard back from any of them yet...of course, if I do hear from any of them, it's almost certain that I'd have to consent to a drug test.

On the other hand, I do have a job interview tomorrow for a job that's not related to my field. It would be good to have a source of income, but it would look better to graduate admission panels if I get a job related to my field; thus, if another opportunity arises from one of the jobs related to my field, I'm going to apply for them.

This leaves me in a strange position - I'll almost certainly get the job that I have an interview for tomorrow (one that doesn't drug test), but if I happen to hear back from any of the jobs that do drug test, I'll go for them and definitely need to be clean for potential drug tests. It's a shitty situation, because I haven't been smoking for about a week now and really want to (I have minor depression issues and weed helps a bunch). Thus, I'm not smoking for an indefinite amount of time, and I'm really disliking it.

Could somebody give me some advice, or offer any insight? I'm trying to tell myself that it's for the best and that if I get an interview for a bio-related job then I'll be clean. On the other hand, I hate not smoking just because there's a chance that I may get one of those interviews.

**TL;DR: Can't smoke weed on the off-chance that I'll get a job interview that drug tests. Have minor depression issues and weed helps. Looking for a compromise.**"

Coming Home


I landed in PDX in my fancied suit smelling of day old sex, cigarettes, and a hangover. My mother was waiting for me in the arrivals terminal to hug and kiss my cheek. My father would’ve been there as well, but he passed nearly 3 years ago. I still think about him every now and again, sometimes when it feels it’s been too long since I have. Other times simply to ground and remind myself. It had been a long flight since I’d left Edinburgh. The French were on strike for some odd reason and I got stuck in Charles de Gaulle, more mad that I couldn’t have a smoke or continue drinking now that it was 8 or 9 am than being delayed really. It sounds like something they’d do anyways. They questioned why my growler smelt of alcohol. I wanted to say it’s because I forgot to wash it after polishing it off in the taxi around 4 am that morning in Edinburgh, but with my french I could only lie and say it was water. The ensuing pat down was firmer than the norm. 

I’d been drinking since 4 or 5 the day before, strategically filling up my growler from Brewdog earlier in the afternoon, I think it was the Trashy Blonde that day or maybe the Punk IPA, and saved it for the time between when the bars close and my taxi ride departs. I’d gone out with the remaining interns, only two or so at that point, and my Scottish coworkers. I skipped work that day, my last, wasn’t much going on in the Parliament on a Monday to be honest anyway and met up with Paul and Iain up the Royal Mile, a song or two away from my flat for the last night out. 

We sat and drank the first of many pints in a shadowy pub called the World’s End. As soon as I arrived Paul roared into a story of how Iain and another American intern, a breezy and aloof blonde from Utah, had hooked up last Friday night, Hannah’s last night here. Iain brought her back to his new flat to crash and they ended up making out and getting into it, as you do. It gets hot and he ends up inside her slowly penetrating her for a good thirty seconds until she gets flustered and admits that she’s a virgin and doesn’t know if she can continue. She heads into this minute or so monologue about whether she should or shouldn’t have sex, meanwhile Iain is plowing away at a soft and steady rate throughout the whole thing. She inevitably tells him she can’t, and he pulls out, and we all have a laugh at how many times she’s been in this situation still thinking she’s a virgin. The last of the interns Yassef arrives at the pub having missed the story and we number five now, Paul launches into the story once more for Yassef’s ears breaking for a smoke and a call from his girlfriend, a californian blonde who’d left two days before. I smoke one and we chat for a second about goodbyes and past lovers outside after the call. It’s wet, the cold december rain riding in on sharp breezes in stacatto-like fashion, but the pub is warm and inviting, the story continues. After pulling out, they make out and she starts to jerk him off. He’s about to finish and, in her grace, she apparently thinks it a brilliant one to shove a finger up his arse. He freaks out and comes all at once. The table cracks up and cheers to that non-mormon Utah girl long gone by now, Iain’s joyful smirk following the story was priceless. 

We move up the mile to the Tron tavern, smokes in hand, and we enjoy the first buzzes of our night, the nicotine hits like a missing drumbeat, the age old cobblestone beneath our feet encouraging us, the whole lot buzzing. Pints and food are ordered, WC’s visited, seats taken, and we proceed with jovial conversations and laughs. More friends join, the Seattle girl from my office and a cute Manchester girl, Tony the Scottish-Italian gay coworker who fancied me at first, Stuart a coworker and Yassef’s lover at some point, and I finally start to realize it’s my last night here. I text Camilla, a barmaid I’d asked out and gone out with for bottles of prosecco the night before, and drop a line.

To be continued...I'm too drunk and I have class in the morning, can't continue this chapter or what have you currently."
s21nv,3,2012-04-10,No reason for feeling like this,takeiteasyonme,MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/s21nv/no_reason_for_feeling_like_this/,"Where the hell do I begin?  I might get off subject and rant a bit but I'd appreciate your attention throughout. I'm a student at my second choice college, in my 4th year(will be staying for a 5th) in my dream internship working for my colleges football team.  After next year, I'm going to try getting a graduate assistant job to help pay for grad school and everything on the outside for me looks all good and well.  I was raised in a bible belt home by two strong christian parents and my entire childhood up until I was 18 leaves me with no choice but to believe in a higher power.  Fast forward 4 years later, I've gotten away from the church and have come to the conclusion that there is no God and that us as humans are incredibly ignorant to believe that from our small world surrounded by so much we know so little about, that we know exactly how we all got here.  This change has affected my whole outlook on life.  I now concentrate solely on being as good of a person as I can to anyone and everyone I meet.  If there is a God, I hope he sees that I did my best to be the best person I could be.  I think it's hypocritical to think we must be perfect in an imperfect world for the ultimate result in heaven.  I'm already ranting and this is branching off into other conversations for other threads so sorry about this.  I've dated two girls my whole life, both of them while I've been in college.  I was mr. popular in high school but i was never interested in dating, partly because no girls every really came across me as being interested in dating me.  The first girl I dated, we lost both of our virginities to each other and she fell head over heels for me.  A year into our relationship, I felt since I was young and had two more years ahead of me that my best years were yet to come.  This was also before I started this job with the football team in which all my time became dedicated to football.  Regardless, I didn't have the feelings for her that she had for me and there didn't seem there was a way to change that, so I broke up with her, ultimately breaking her heart.  Something I later apologized for as I was a real dick about the whole process.  A year and a half later, I met another girl, who went to my high school.  We'll call her ""B"".  What began as summer love turned into strong feelings for me, which I never felt before, even in the year I was dating the first girl.  She was younger than me and went to community college back home, forcing us into a long distance relationship.  After 3 months of skypeing every night, I finally asked her out and we dated for another 3 months.  I'd always been the type of person to poke fun at people who were in love so fast after beginning dating.  I was in my first season of my internship and wasn't traveling with the team, therefore anytime I got a weekend off, I was making my way back home to be with her.  By the third month, I knew my feelings were unlike anything i'd ever felt before so I automatically assumed I was in love.  For the whole year I dated the first girl, ""I Love You"" only came out when we were drunk and usually I realized what I said and would take it back.  I thought it was such a big step in saying something like that because I wanted it to be for real.  During Christmas break with B, I was laying down with her telling her everything I loved about her and eventually I said it, that I loved her.  It felt so right saying it because I knew the feelings I had inside me.  She said she loved me too and for the first time, I was the happy with every single aspect of my life, minus the fact she was still 200 miles away and i couldn't see her everyday, but just talk.  Eventually, she began getting the feelings I had for the first girl and broke up with me one weekend I came home to spend the weekend with just her.  It was literally the weekend before my 21st birthday.  The weekend of my 21st while celebrating my birthday, at some point while I was blacked out called her crying begging her back.  I have no recollection of the phone call but it almost certainly put the nail in our relationships coffin so to speak. It absolutely broke my heart and I had no clue how to handle it.  I begged her to come back almost to the point now looking back, I was boarderline crazy.  The week after my birthday was valentines day so I automatically felt jaded at the day, only to find out that same day that she had evidently been hanging out with her ex boyfriend who in the beginning tried to get her away from me, bringing me down even more.  Months passed and some things were forgiven and forgotten, we had our ups and downs, and summer finally came around which gave me a chance to go back home and rebuild our relationship once more.  I went to the first session of summer school and 3 days before I came back home, i caught wind that she had been hanging out with my then best friend.  By reading ""then best friend"", i'm assuming you can put 2 and 2 together.  The whole time she was talking to me, she was also talking to my best friend.  I asked both of them about it which they both of course denied so I had no choice but to let it go.  3 weeks after I come home, I'm at a party with my friend where he's talking to a girl about how he's found a new girl, yada yada, and then her name pops up.  He was talking about how he was talking to her and liking her literally 3 feet away from me.  This is all after he'd been telling me the whole time i needed to get over her.  Fuck him.  I called him out and he went off into a tangent about how he made me and I wouldn't have been popular without him.  Mind you, I didn't even start hanging out with the guy until my last semester of high school.  I'll say it again.  Fuck him.  Two days later, I packed my bags and came back to college just to get away from the drama.  For a little while things were getting back to normal and both of those people left my life.  Like that, I lost the girl I loved and my best friend all for a stupid reason.  The hurt and anger I had built up was numbed by my friends back at school.  Here I am, a year and a half after the breakup and approaching a year after all the drama.  I'm on the verge of completing this semester finally after a shit ton of work and I couldn't be more excited.  Truth is, deep down, I'm still hurt.  I'm over both of them and haven't really spoken to them except to close out everything (a kind way of me telling them fuck you).  Since then, I haven't really tried talking to any girls.  Again, no girls have really come across as being interested in me.  I'm the type of person that would rather have a girl come after me than I go after them.  It's so much more of a turn on to me to be wanted and for it to be so apparent it slaps me in the face.  I've never been the ""player type"" and usually end up coming back home from bars with my friends and just them.  I don't pull numbers, I don't really pull girls, but I'm still incredibly social with them.  There's the gap between acquaintences and fuck buddies or even getting to the relationship aspect I still don't understand.  I hate putting myself out there only to be rejected so i avoid the confrontation all together.  This strategy hasn't helped me either, hence me writing this to you.  I have so much frustration and hurt and anger built up inside and I don't really let anyone, not even my friends here know about it.  I'm at peace on the football field, but it seems the second I'm anywhere else, these feelings come back.  I feel like I'm wasting my life here and that I'm miserable.  I have so much fear for growing up and getting a real job if I can't stay in school as a graduate assistant.  More than anything, I just want someone here to care for and to come home to.  I have a great respect for women as I had two sisters growing up to show me how to be a man.  None of the things they told me really made sense until recently.  Like I said, I'm no player and I just want to give a girl what any girl deserves, just someone who will care for them.  I have so many friends who are girls who traditionally bitch and moan and complain about other guys that did them wrong and I'm too afraid to make an attempt to resurrect their faith in the male population.  I feel so different from anyone else because of the fact that I don't ""spit game"".  That's such a childish and immature thought process to refer to women as game as if they're a fucking deer I have to shoot at.  Again regardless of the fact, it never fails that the prettiest and most deserving girls end up with the biggest douches and wonder why they keep getting hurt, meanwhile, i'm on the sidelines with my helmet just waiting patiently to get in the game.  I feel like because I don't feel this way, that it's set me behind in social skills as well.  I don't always have the cool thing to say, and sometimes, I feel no urge to say anything at all.  I hate small talk which doesn't help either so just meeting and getting to know girls at social events is a marathon itself for me.  I'm not much of the hey i got your number from a friend lets have a full blown converstion despite the fact ive been to about 5 parties with you.  I've googled how to talk to girls and all that crap and it's all the same cliche ""be yourself"" bullshit.  Sorry internet, that doesn't help at all.  Like I said, I have a dream life and I wouldn't trade anything for it, but I want to get rid of this frustration.  I want to scream as loud as I can to get it all out but I know it won't be enough.  I'm so mad at the world for being the way it is.  I'm mad at things I have no way of controlling.  I have thoughts I shouldn't have.  I think to myself I'm of no use to the world and that I'm not meant to live in this time.  My family and friends keep me alive.  If I knew they wouldn't be effected at all, I would have ended myself a long time ago.  I think about suicide from time to time, nothing too serious though.  Just thoughts like well I wouldn't have to worry about whatever it is i'm worried about anymore. I know my life is of much importance and the entire scenario of my suicide would crush many people that are dear to my life so that takes it completely out of the question.  I just want relief.  The world despite how small in retrospect to everything else is still big to me and I don't have the first clue on how to live in it.  I want to get over the hump of being a good friend to everyone.  I want girls to want to be with me.  I feel like i'm an average looking guy, but regardless shouldn't have that hard of a time finding a good girl.  I know I'm young and have absolutely no business feeling like this.  I know this whole thing comes off as a frustration towards girls but in all honesty, there's a lot more behind my frustration.  Like I said earlier, I hate the way the world is today.  I feel like people are incredibly hypocritical which pisses me off more than anything.  I blame this fact alone for most of the feelings I have.  A few months ago, in conversation with a friend, I said I'd lost hope in humanity, something i never thought I'd say.  I'd like to think there's still hope but at the same time, there will always be dumbasses put on this earth solely to fuck with other people.  I'm hoping you're still reading this and for some of you, I hope we share the same unfortunate feelings.  I want to tell you just as I'm sure I will be told to keep your head up and that things will get better.  I dunno, maybe this is just a terrible case of the monday's and i'm just feeling sorry for myself."

First off, thanks to everybody that reads this. It means a lot. Here's my situation: I'm a senior undergraduate, about to graduate with a degree in Biology. I'm taking a year off before starting grad school, so I've been trying to find some internships or short-term jobs. I've applied to a bunch of places relevant to my field, but haven't heard back from any of them yet...of course, if I do hear from any of them, it's almost certain that I'd have to consent to a drug test.

On the other hand, I do have a job interview tomorrow for a job that's not related to my field. It would be good to have a source of income, but it would look better to graduate admission panels if I get a job related to my field; thus, if another opportunity arises from one of the jobs related to my field, I'm going to apply for them.

This leaves me in a strange position - I'll almost certainly get the job that I have an interview for tomorrow (one that doesn't drug test), but if I happen to hear back from any of the jobs that do drug test, I'll go for them and definitely need to be clean for potential drug tests. It's a shitty situation, because I haven't been smoking for about a week now and really want to (I have minor depression issues and weed helps a bunch). Thus, I'm not smoking for an indefinite amount of time, and I'm really disliking it.

Could somebody give me some advice, or offer any insight? I'm trying to tell myself that it's for the best and that if I get an interview for a bio-related job then I'll be clean. On the other hand, I hate not smoking just because there's a chance that I may get one of those interviews.

**TL;DR: Can't smoke weed on the off-chance that I'll get a job interview that drug tests. Have minor depression issues and weed helps.**"

I have spent the last 7 months jumping through hoops, making random phone calls to pharmacies all over my state, interviewing, traveling all over, and doing everything in my power to secure a Summer internship. 

The market is saturated. I have no Idea where I will be able to work. Many of my classmates worked as technicians and simply transferred into being an intern while I worked tirelessly in various organizations and academically to attempt to differentiate myself but it is of no Avail. I also worked as a technician, but my pharmacy is unable to take summer internships! Its not that my classmates do not deserve their position, they absolutely do, but I worked hard and strove to get myself on the honor roll and become president of various organizations and involved in even more, this apparently gets me nothing. 

Even the career services center cannot seem to help me. 

Sorry I am just irritated and need to vent. If someone would have told me all I needed was too pick the right pharmacy to tech at and I could have saved myself the trouble, I certainly would have.

Anyways, back to the Job hunt

I am moving out to California this summer for an internship.  I am from Minnesota.  I am heavily considering just bringing my motorcycle to California as my only mode of transportation.

I wouldn't want to have to ride through absolute downpours or anything, but from my experience rain heavy enough to not ride in doesn't last too long.

The reason for doing this would be so I could sell my bike at the end of summer and fly back home / on to other adventures.  So yeah, would relying on my 1999 Ninja 250 with 16,000 miles be a good idea for a summer in the California Bay area?  Thanks!"

He is a Senior in high school now and I am a Junior.

We were each others first true loves at everything. We both cried in each others arms on saturday whenever he told me the news. He said the reason why he doesn't want to try a long-distance relationship is because he will be doing a lot of hard work to become the best he can be, trying to become valedictorian and wants to intern in Spain. Which he has possibilities of doing. I am so broken. I love him so much. We've been through so much together. We are an openly gay couple at a homophobic high school and he loved every moment of it. He cares for me deeply, this much I know. He doesn't want it to hurt in the end but I have trouble explaining to him that it will hurt more in the end knowing that we didn't even try rather than knowing that we gave it a shot and it failed (if it does). He said he would feel bad if I wanted to call him to talk one night and he was out studying which he will be doing a lot of and he thinks that it won't be worth it for me waiting around to keep in contact with him. For now he wants us to make the best  of the remaining months we have left, but slowly break ourselves away from each other so it won't be hard for when he leaves. I don't want this at all. 

I just love him so much. I don't want to loose him. This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do. My anxiety is killer and my appetite is gone. 
Every song reminds me of him and I break down crying every night. He made me promise that I would keep strong for him but I just can't. It's so hard to even wrap my head around what is happening so quickly.

So, currently I'm in college. I'm entering my second year. I've landed a cool internship related directly to my major (Computer Science), working in a network admin's office. They pay very well, I love the job, and they have offered me to stay and work over the summer, 40 hours a week. When the summer is over, I will likely be promoted and get a decent pay raise.

My boyfriend of three years and I are planning to get a house or apartment with another couple we know very well. The other couple is very stable and well-off. We'll likely only be staying in the place for the summer, then we will all probably move to the on-campus housing. My current boyfriend has a decent amount saved up from his last job, PLENTY enough to pay for his share of rent.  He has already agreed to it, and said he'll do whatever it takes to stay with me.

Problem is, things aren't working between me and him anymore. I can't stand him sometimes. He annoys me. He pushes me around and hits me sometimes. He yells. He disrespects me, and is extremely immature and childish. Being around him feels like babysitting, because I have to monitor his behavior in public. He doesn't know what he's doing for his major, and he's used to his mother paying for all of his bills. He throws a hissy fit when people make him do things he doesn't want to do. When I bring these things up, he also throws a fit.
Overall, he's not who I want to be with long term.

He has also told me he really hates the house we're moving into and doesn't want to spend his savings on it. He'd rather go back home and live there with his mom for free, but he's renting this place with me and the other couple to stay with me.

We are due to sign the lease in a week or two. If I break up with him, he'll be out of the lease and we likely won't be able to afford the place comfortably. The other couple who is entering into the lease with us will likely also be very angry with me/us.
         
           
           
      

TL;DR: Boyfriend and I supposed to be renting a house with other couple. Want to break up with boyfriend for several reasons. See above.

Reddit, I really need your advice right now. You've helped me through a lot before, and I really need some input on this. What should I do? :[


EDIT: I understand I need to leave him. I just don't know when//how will be most convenient and cause the least amount of shit for everyone else. I don't want to screw up everything for everyone else, if there's another option. If I could tough it out for the summer, etc. I'm looking for ways to go about this, I already know what needs to be done.

Also, thank you all for all your concern &lt;3 Reddit is full of such amazing people. "

I don't really own any business-casual type clothing. I'm willing to spend a bit on timeless pieces like a nice pair of black dress pants, but since money's tight, it's just an internship in a rather casual environment, and I don't plan on getting much use out of this clothing or being seen by more than a few people, I'd like to keep it pretty cheap while still looking put together. Although it would be nice to buy something cute enough to get some use out of on my days off, style is not really a factor here, price and professionalism are my main concerns. I'm 22, slender, on the tall side, with a small bust and behind with broad shoulders, to give you an idea.

Another issue is that I'm a size 24 (or 0/00 depending on the brand) with a 34 inseam. A lot of women's dress clothing is cut rather large and doesn't fit my figure well, particularly pants. This makes me tend to wear a lot of skirts when I have to dress formally, but it'd be great if I could find pants that fit! This also means that I usually have to buy pants online, because even if they make my size, it's not usually in stock in stores. 

My height and issues of practicality makes me want to avoid high heeled shoes, so I also wonder what kind of shoes would be appropriate. Are open toed shoes acceptable at all, like when wearing a skirt? Again, unless they're very comfortable, stylish, and high quality shoes, I don't want to spend a lot."

First I want to apologize to the mods if this isn't what this subreddit is for. 

Second, I want to invite all graphic design juniors and seniors to apply for [Portland Advertising Federations Colaboratory Internship.](http://www.pafcolaboratory.com/) I did this two years ago and its opened so many doors for me. Many of the people get jobs soon if not immediately in Portland in some of the best agencies in Portland, Oregon (W+K, CMD, Nike etc). 

Whats great about this is you're placed into 3 agencies for two weeks each and you get to work on real client projects. On top of that all the interns are split into 1 of two teams where they will compete for a campaign with a company. (one year was Columbia Sportswear, another was Tillamook Ice Cream and another was Moonstruck Chocolate). 

Please apply!

If you have any questions please ask me on this or PM me. 


Note: if you don't have a place to stay they will hook you up with a dorm room at PSU, which is in downtown Portland. "

I think I'm repeating my thesis. For the second fucking time. I don't even like me groupmates, and I'm pretty sure they don't like me. I should be afraid of failing right now but I'm not. It's like don't care if I fail or not. I'm expecting to be dropped from them so I have to find another group. I find it very hard to care about my thesis after I failed the first time. At the same time I need to find job (internship of some sort) as a final requirement for passing/graduation. Every time I remember that, I feel so fucking incompetent. I have nothing to my name. I'm 20 years old, I've never picked up a hobby or anything like that. I don't have skills or talents, I'm not even an exemplary student, I barely pass. I have no motivation to learn, I don't have much motivation to do much for myself at all. I feel like a lazy uentitled 20 year old, with no talent, skill or worth ethic and I feel incredibly guilty. My parents have been paying for my education, and what have I got to show for? Nothing. I've got bad grades, can't pass my fuckin' thesis, and I have nothing to show for for that internship I need. I really wish I wasn't like this just so my parents can be at least a little more proud of me. Compared to my sister, double degree, worked in one of my university's publications, good grades, I feel like trash compared to her. I'm 20 years old and I don't have a hobby or a talent or a skill I can actually use.

I currently have absolutely no idea what to do right now. I have no motivation of doing anything to make a solution. I just don't want to do it anymore. I just want out of it now.

Not sure if I have it in me to pull myself back up this time. ,[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/s4m90/everything_went_to_shit_again_not_sure_if_i_have/,"I don't know why I'm posting here. I barely have the physical or emotional energy to do so, and I'm not sure it'll help. Maybe it's because I don't have anyone in my life I can vent to like this, and I feel like someone out there should know my story. 

The last few days suicide has been on my mind, especially the past 12 hours or so. I'm okay with that. I'm okay with death. My belief is that death is nothingness, and that empty nothingness will be far superior to this pain and suffering I currently experience. 

I don't think I've ever really enjoyed life. Maybe I did, sometime around 20 or 21. I had a fiancé, a cute little house, and the best job ever--I sold weed. Well, for a couple of years anyways. I ended up getting ratted out, and my nice little life with the fiancé and house transformed to prison walls. I did a year there and when I got out, she dumped me almost immediately. It was a combination of things; my year-long absence, her cheating, my neediness and vulnerability at the time, my gender identity issues... I was left solo in a new city, fresh out of prison, with no support and no money. 

I'm really proud of what I did for myself after that. I found a job right away working in a small, dark, miserable smoke-filled taxi office. During that time I re-enrolled in college. I ended up graduating with flying colors, did tons of internships, extra-curriculars, everything I could to build a resume. After school, which was just last Spring, I landed two jobs that I loved. One as a journalist and the other working in administration at the university. My journalism job was years in the making, with internships, lots of freelancing and hanging on before finally getting offered a part time position. I got really lucky with the admin position, with a super new-agey boss that disregarded my felony. 

During that last year, with my newfound money and stability, I transitioned from male to female. This is something I'd wanted to do since my childhood, and was the most difficult thing I've ever done. On March 19 of this year I started living full time as a woman. Both my jobs were supportive (they led me to believe), all my friends were on board, and I seemed to pass just fine in public. Having my body and mind congruent felt so good, and life seemed to finally be falling into place. I was seriously ready just to sit back and enjoy myself, maybe find a new girlfriend to live in a new cute house with, and let happiness come to me. 

Well, last Friday, out of the blue, my boss at the university informed me that my job is being eliminated. Just yesterday, also completely out of the blue, my boss at my journalism job informed me that it too is being eliminated. Both jobs gave me the same story--it's not my work performance, it's money issues and that's just how businesses work. I'd almost rather it have been something I did wrong, then I might not feel so powerless. On top of all that, my housing situation is uncertain because my housemate randomly bailed. 

So I went from on top of the world even just a week ago, to some of the lowest depths of my life. I'm a felon and a trans woman, and in spite of my skills and abilities, I'm fucked when it comes to finding jobs. So I'm pretty down and out right now. I'm not sure if I'm feeling up to trying to piece things back together again.  If life is just a cycle of getting shit together and then having it fall apart, that's not really cool with me. It's just not my thing. I've tried my hardest, given it my best shot, and things insist on not working out for me. Okay, universe: you win. My hands are in the air, my white flag is waving. "

I live in Chicago and am seriously considering going back to school to become an RD/get my masters.

After that, though, I cant really afford to quit my job and go to UIC fulltime for three years.

I can, however, apply to eastern michigan university's online coordinated MS program which is 2 years long. I have a pretty flexible job with tons of downtime, not to mention the weekends off, during which I can complete courses. I would also take a few extra days off to complete internship . It seems like the perfect fit.

But in a place like Chicago there will no doubt be plenty of graduates from traditional programs, some with their masters, some with just their bachelors.Will I be at a severe disadvantage when trying to find a job given that I received my degree online?

If so, why doesn't she just say it?",genuinelydontknow,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/s4fx3/are_we_broken_up_if_so_why_doesnt_she_just_say_it/,"I'm 24, she's a year older. She lives in another country but we met about 2 years ago when we both lived in the same country.  
  
Things have gone through a rocky rollercoaster ostensibly because her circumstances in her country are changing and she's trying to find work and not having much luck. Throughout this period she's gone from brief phases of affection calling me her rock as she deals with her troubles and other times she's considering me a nuisance she needs to deal with on top of her other problems.  
  
This situation wasn't the best, but honestly, we were still keeping the semblance of a relationship, even if just by the phone. Unsatisfying though that can be I was still glad to be with her. But then she got an internship which she hoped would lead to a job, it was very intense and stressful and during that time we spoke often, but less so and she was sad, stressed, angry and far too preoccupied to be particularly interested in me. The internship ended and it didn't lead to work, she went to spend some time with her parents and that's when she started not answering her phone.  
  
She'd wait a few hours after I tried to call to send me a message with an obviously spurious excuse why she couldn't talk every time. I confronted her about it and she said that when she went back home from visiting her parents things would be different, that she was just preoccupied and trying to enjoy being back with her family.  
  
She's back but she still doesn't talk ever. Thing is, I know I'm representing myself here as just letting things happen, and being passive in the situation and I guess I am, part of me just wants to be patient with her and give her what she needs if she genuinely needs not to talk to me but I guess another part just doesn't want to hear that she's lost interest. I have however actually gathered the courage to ask the simplest questions: what do you want? Am I still in a relationship with you? Why don't you want to talk to me anymore? But she just reassures me, says she still wants me as her boyfriend, that we're still together as far as she knows and that she's just been busy.  
  
But something is very obviously wrong and has very obviously changed, she recently lost an opportunity to visit me in my country this year and when I said I'd go to hers instead she said she'd be too busy trying to find work. 
  
She doesn't want to talk to me, she doesn't want to come see me, she doesn't want me to go and see her frankly I'm not really sure what the difference would be between us breaking up and us continuing in this 'relationship'. 
  
What I really don't understand and am asking advice about is this, I can see from the signs it's probably over, that she's for whatever reason ceased to be interested in me. I could end things myself, but frankly I'm still stubbornly holding on to hope for a resolution because I do still care for her despite it all.
  
Why then, if she doesn't want me, never sees me and doesn't like talking to me, would she say she still wants to be in a relationship with me? What's she getting out of this? Is she being sincere?

UPDATE: Oh god. It was once something so sweet, it kills me to see where we've ended up. I can't imagine how I'm going to tell her I can't keep doing this but I really can't. Fucking long distance, maybe this would have happened anyway, but maybe not. If only we'd never had to move. She used to love me so much and I've always loved her. Thank you for your help agony redditors even you Nuitaqui, that's some dedicated trolling of r/relationships. I guess I'm going to have to contact her somehow and tell her the score. I wish I could go back to 2 years ago things seemed a whole lot nicer then."

So I was working as an intern at a software dev company while 1.5 years through a degree. And the boss decided that I should quit uni in order to help deliver some project. Here's the email he sent me

Subject: deal
1. Suspend university now (tonight)
2. [CompanyName] pays all uni fees incurred to date since commencement i.e. beginning of first year uni
3. Can choose to complete uni degree at any time after [ProjectName] go-live at which point [CompanyName] will pay all fees through to completion of undergrad degree
4. Plus at any time (post [ProjectName] go-live), irrespective of whether degree is finished or not, [CompanyName] will provide whatever support (including visa sponsorship) necessary to relocate to any country where [CompanyName] has product development (customer engagement or dev centres)

I thought it was a pretty sweet deal so accepted.

2 years later, that projects still in progress and I've been reassigned to something else. And I haven't seen any of the money from point 2.

Is an email legally binding? When I ask him for the money he always says he'll pay it and that he's a man of his word, but it's been fucking ages.

I'm wondering if I should just cut my losses and leave. But it'd rather leave with some cash. I'm in NZ not the states so afaik I can't just sue him or put a hit out on him or something like you guys do.

Any suggestions as to my best move in this situation?"

Being able to experience and explore a character, their world and their story that you created and designed from the ground up is simply incredible, its an experience that a painting simply can't give.  I have been drawing, painting and sculpting since elementary school through high school and majored in studio art at a liberal arts college. I have been out of school for a year and have been working a part time job at a deli in a super market. I feel that i should have gone to art school so that I could have learned the technical training for the digital arts for web design, 3d animation, etc so i could make stepping stones into the gaming world. I took a flash and Dreamweaver class in the last year of my schooling, but I am not a programmer, I feel that i am much more of a visualizer or concept artist.  I was lucky enough to attend PAXEast last weekend and the attitude towards new and aspiring video game enthusiasts is exhilarating. It was my second year at PAX and I don't just want to attend the gaming community, I want to be a part of it. I am willing to start anywhere, through any design, testing, or even intern. I just need to break into the community. How do I start? I just don't even know where to begin. I know I need more training, would school be the best choice? If so which school? I am fortunate enough to have that option. I would just love any type of advice. Anything and everything would be extremely appreciated. Thanks and I really look forward to your responses!!"

A year ago I graduated college. At the time I was still in a 3-year LTR with my now ex-girlfriend. About two months after college I took an internship over 1,000 miles away. It was there, in this new city, where I met my current girlfriend. 

Once again, you'll have to pardon my clichés, but it was love at first sight. She was everything I'd ever hoped to meet in a woman. Fiercely intelligent, gorgeous, funny- I could go on forever. I courted her and when it became apparent we were falling for each other, I broke up with my ex. After that, my new girlfriend and I were inseparable: we did everything together and never got bored of each other's company. I couldn't imagine ever being with anyone else, and each day seemed like a gift.

We'd stay up at night - after mind-blowing sex - and discuss our future together. She'd tell me I was the one she'd been waiting for her entire life, I'd tell her the same. She'd say she felt complete, never felt like this before, etc., etc. It was, without a doubt, the best thing that has ever happened to me.

For five months we lived in this bliss. It was absolutely wonderful. In December we decided to move to a new city to start our life together with new jobs, new people, etc. Truthfully, I convinced her this is what would be for the best. At the time I honestly believed it, but now I'm not so certain it was the best decision.

Flash forward the last 3 months. Things have been lopsided. She has a job and is successful. She makes all the money and has been supporting us by herself, much to my shame. Fortune has not been so kind to me: the job I moved here for folded, I am unemployed, and spend my days writing cover letters and filling out applications.  I feel like I could go on an Occupy-themed/Millennial-unfairness rant here, but I won't. Simply put, I've been having difficulties financially.

This, as you can imagine, has impacted everything... although perhaps not as much as you would think. Until April things between her and I were still going well, if a little stressed because of my unemployment. She makes enough money to support us, and although I objected and floated the idea of going back to my home state to find work (I believe I have a job waiting there), she told me she'd rather have me stay here than be alone. Because this woman does not sugarcoat at all, I took her at her word. Perhaps this, too, was a mistake.

These last two weeks, however, have been particularly rough. A trifecta of issues has appeared, one after the other: her mother injured herself somewhat severely and had to undergo surgery to fix a broken bone, her job is *incredibly* intense right now (financial work, quarterly yearly report time) requiring long hours, and I - also much to my shame - did not get into my the type of law schools that I wanted (should have mentioned I was applying for law school earlier, sorry). In addition to this, parts of our relationship have become sadly routine: we wake up, she goes to work, I look for jobs, rinse, wash, repeat. 

All these issues culminated last weekend. We had an argument on Thursday of last week, during which she said she hadn't been happy for 3 months (which I really hope was not the truth). I stupidly lost my temper and yelled at her, something I have never done before and completely regret. She went home to be with her mother. I sat in our apartment, alone, looking for jobs/playing video games. When she came back I knew something was wrong. But I still wasn't ready for what was coming.

Monday, Monday, Monday. Is there a more despicable day of the week? Even unemployed I still despise it, and now I have more reason to than ever before. When she came home Monday night she told me the worst news I've ever heard: she wants to break up, she doesn't love me anymore, she wants me to move out (and by extension, move back home with my parents). I was (am) completely crushed. I knew things hadn't been perfect between us lately, but I still am in a state of despair and disbelief. The worst part of it was when she said she didn't view me as a partner anymore, and felt like my mother. Soul = demolished.

I told her I was the same person she fell in love with. I begged her not to give up on me yet. I know how important stability and ambition are to her, and these last 3 months have not been my best in that regard. But I have had a job interview this week and things are finally starting to look up; I was also able to sell my old car for a couple thousand dollars to help pay the rent for the immediate future. I used my gift of gab to talk her into giving me a stay of execution, if you will. I told her by the end of April I was going to be the man she wanted me to be, that the man she loved no longer wasn't me but an awful figment of my true potential. She said okay. But she still claims she doesn't know if she loves me anymore; that knowledge alone has caused me to be unable to eat or sleep for the last two days and is destroying me with every second that ticks by. Melodramatic, I know, but it's how I feel.

I guess the worst part is that I have always viewed love as bound by Newton's first law of motion. I don't believe she could just stop loving me; there had to be a force there to cause the love of my life - whom a month ago told me she wanted to get married someday, 6 months ago told me she couldn't live without me - to ask me to pack my things two days ago. I have nominated my unemployment/bum-like state these past 3 months as the obvious culprit, as I know it has been awful for both her and I... this makes the situation all the more agonizing, as I am finally starting to see the light in this regard. I feel I am on the very cusp of being financially independent and able to support her and give her the life she deserves, but she has given up on me. It is a terrible, terrible feeling.

Last night I tried to show her I was the same man she fell in love with. After my job interview (which went really well, fingers-crossed!) I took her to dinner. We stopped by the river where I recited a love poem that I know means a lot to her (cheesy, I know) and tried to convince her this moment was the darkest hour before the dawn, that if she just believed in me for a little longer we could go back to the way things used to be. She seemed to be feeling it, and I was overjoyed to think I was saving this relationship. We went home and slept together (literally, slept) in the same bed. I was happy.

Then came this morning.

Mornings are the hardest because I can tell she doesn't want to talk about her feelings as she's preparing for a grueling day at work. I've respected this, as much I can, but right before she walked out the door I slipped. She kissed me, which I thought was a good sign, so I asked her what she was feeling. 

**""Nothing. Perhaps I just need more time?""**

God, it hurts. 

So here I am, writing this to you fine people and hoping against hope that you can provide me some sort of viable strategy to save this relationship. I love this woman with all of my heart, and I feel like I am *this* close to being able to provide the financial stability she needs to feel happy. How can I rekindle our love and prove to her I am not a loser? I know landing this job would really help, but I need other solutions, too. I did cut her a check for my half of the rent today, something I'd been unable to do until now, so I am hoping that helps... but I know I can't ""buy"" my way back in, even if finances are at the crux of the matter. I have to make her see me as she used to, I think, and I really could use some help with that.

I can't imagine my future without her in my life. Moving back home and living in my mom's basement or having to find another living situation here, hundreds of miles away from anyone I know besides her, both seem unimaginable right now. And I would have lost the one person I love more than anything in the entire world. I can't face it. Please help me.

**TL;DR Love of my life is disappointed with my recent inability to be financially independent and doesn't know if she loves me anymore. Wants me to move out of our shared apartment. Please help me show her I can be the same person she fell in love with originally.**

[How did he feel about the new definition of Santorum?  Did he actively have people working on changing the google results in the earlier days? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4as983?context=5)|He would never stop talking about that. He hated it so much. He did have many people working on it. I actually made an effort to contact google (although I knew it would be fruitless) to remove it.
[Who do you plan to support as a republican candidate now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4as9s9?context=5)|Ron Paul.
[If i was an American I too would support Ron, but in all honesty, do you think there is a chance that he could become the Republican presidential candidate?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4asbj8?context=5)|As Joe Shmoe, I would say no. But after taking years of Pol Sci, I have learned that it is a possibility, I would give him a 1:4 chance 
[Now we all know Santorum was a bit *enthusiastic*, to put it nicely, as were some of his followers... But what people didn't focus on it seems... Were people who protested his ways were equally or even more *enthusiastic* sometimes...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4aro3e?context=5)|Good question. A popular thing was to wear ""spreading santorum"" shirt to his rallies, speeches, etc; that reeeally got on his nerves. Another was many gay couples would get as close to him as they could and kiss. Although I found these both humorous (as they arent violent or very insulting), he didn't like it, and spoke out about it a few times 
[**Question**: What was the craziest thing you say someone do to protest his campaign?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4aro3e?context=5)| 
[One thing Santorum said that made you lose respect for him?  One thing Santorum said that made you gain respect for him.  Best and worst memory of your time employed there? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4arxg0?context=5)|Best is when one tie Karen Santorum wasn't replying to his calls for ab out 30 minutes, and he got very nervous an worried that she was in an accident or something. It really showed a compassionate human side to him few see. Worst memory was the one listed above, it demoralized many staff members.
[Which one of the last two ""Won out""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4arxg0?context=5)|Obviously the first one, which is a reason I left.
[Alright... Since you're unemployed you should spend some of your free time watching Doctor Who... It's really good, and reddit becomes much more interesting when you get **all** the references...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4as3q6?context=5)|Hahaha, thank you. I will check it out.
[Did you actually support his opinions or were you in it for the money?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4arli5?context=5)|To be honest, I did this for the work experience, as a younger guy with a pol sci major, not many jobs are available, and within those, it's better if you don't pick and choose with your beliefs. My beliefs never interrupted him, as I never brought them up much. So, this is really just to get deeper into the political field  
[Hate to tell you this, but in the world of DC, it's pretty much impossible to switch sides. Once you've worked for a republican, it will be VERY hard for you to get a job with a democrat.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4asczm?context=5)|I understand that. But, as said, I am conservative. I just don't agree with all of Santorum's ideas.
[Did he ever have any advisers tell him that he was already seen as so far to the right, it would not hurt to make some comments that would make him more appealing to the middle? To a lot of people, he just came off as crazy, and even if he won the primary, would stand no chance to Obama. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4asrkj?context=5)|Many did. One said that ""the trip going back to the center would be a tougher one than staying where you are""
[How did you get the gig? Are you from PA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4arxl9?context=5)|I spent my childhood there. My aunt knew him and knew I had a pol sci major, and she helped me out as an intern, but when the camp found out I had a major from a good school, they told me I could be an aide. Really straightforward. I did hesitate though.
[What were your responsibilities, and how much did you make?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4arqm5?context=5)|Another good one. It ranged from helping his wife on camp-related errands, to researching speech venues, to typing up posters, and writing letters to various organizers and event hosters, to even getting him things he needed (yes, I did get him a Peets coffee one time)
[Have you ever noticed the religiousness among his staff members? Are your colleagues as religious as Santorum?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4asbu4?context=5)|Most were, I tried to keep my atheism downplayed. There were a few others like me, but not many.
[What are your personal political and religious beliefs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4arqce?context=5)|Conservative-Libertarian. Atheist.
[*Atheist.*  Something tells me you never bothered mentioning this to Rick...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4artsz?context=5)|Yeah. It somehow slipped my mind when we talked...
[What was it like working for arguably one of the craziest Republican candidates in history?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4arm8p?context=5)|Tough at times, although he was a very nice guy around the office, he did have a bit of a temper. Again, I don't agree with much of his views, but he's a nicer guy than people make him out to be. He was one of the biggest gentleman I've seen when Karen (wife) was around 
[Oh I'm not saying he wasn't a nice guy, but when a nice guy says half the shit he did...kinda scares the shit out of me that a guy like that could be seriously considered a presidential nominee.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4arqis?context=5)|He was a very outspoken candidate. And many are, and that works well for many of them. It didn't work out too well for him though 
[It seemed to me like he was always very defensive and would be hard to correct. Did anyone ever correct him ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4as144?context=5)|Not many tried, he had a temper and he liked to stay in control of things.
[Blah people* What are your feelings about glitter bombs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4arswi?context=5)|More annoying than effective. I've seen two I believe.
[Did he ever strike you as someone who really should be president ? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4as5bn?context=5)|It depends. At times, yes. At times, no. I would say he did have moments where I saw him as someone with really good ideas. And also, at time where he...didnt.
[Is this guy as big an asshole as he seems?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4arkfi?context=5)|I expected this from reddit :) Although I don't agree with his politics or religion too much, he didn't talk turkey with us too much around the office(s). He was actually a very nice, and respectful guy to me and my coworkers.
[Don't get me wrong.  I don't dislike him for his politics.  He just seems to have issues with anyone different than him.  As a woman, I have a REAL problem with many of the things he has said.  College? Not necessary.  Yet, he and his wife have degrees.  Problems with public eduation?  Why fix them, when he has the ability to home school his children?  Black?  Why help them, when they are obviously NOT part of his target market.  Those are the things that make him an asshole, in my opinion.  I don't care if he is too religious or too conservative.  That's his choice.  But does he really have to make off-handed comments that are so hurtful to so many? EDIT: to add words I omitted.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4arpit?context=5)|There isn't a real way to answer that, from my opinion. He could be harsh at times, but so can anyone. Also, the media jumping on him (whether he was right or wrong) just amplified things to hell.
[Have you ever looked back at the Santorum Campaign, with the 'JFK makes me sick' and other recent statements, and say ""I got out at a good time?""  Also, for proof, maybe by showing an official letterhead memo with names/numbers removed in sharpie or blurred.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4aseit?context=5)|Of course, I got out before it really hit the fan. And yes, I'll look for a memo. I had to turn in most of the office stuff I kept, but I should have one.
[Did you ever meet his wife, and if so, were they crazy together?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4arocr?context=5)|His wife is a great woman, and they actually seemed to get along very well. She was supportive of him throughout my time there (til Jan.)
[After Herman Cain, none of the candidates seemed to appeal directly to the Tea Party. Balance the budget immediately, cut back on trade with China, limit immigration. ( my spin of what the Tea Party stands for. ) Why did none of the candidates take the tea party seriously? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4asgp8?context=5)|Again, its hard to answer questions like that. My guess is that Santorum did want to distance himself form the far-right (as you know he didnt do well though)
[Yeah, gonna need some proof for this one before the karma train leaves the station.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s3fke/iama_former_santorum_aide_amaa/c4arl4e?context=5)|Understandable request. What can I do for you? Scan a document from him? (probably with some things redacted)

s42ui,2,2012-04-11,Should i contact an ex after many years together and she does not know i received a transplant? ,Porthios,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/s42ui/should_i_contact_an_ex_after_many_years_together/,"Long time lurker first time poster (i think first time poster anyways) So im sure many people are rolling their eyes thinking not another one of these. But hear me out.

When i was 18 i lost both my kidneys (unknown cause) None of my family members where a match so i had to take dialysis. It was a rough first year my test results would come back horrible. Seem like i was not taking care of myself but i though i did. I would ask the staff for advice and i was getting some but none that help me out. 
Then one saturday during treatment i meet this wonderful tech (lets call her... Jane) Jane looked young to be there and i though she was an intern but lo and behold not only was she not one, but she had been working as a tech for ages. I got to know her through her working every fortnight on saturdays. One day she saw how bad i felt and she began to just sit down and talk. Nothing in particular just sit and talk, and man that helped so much.
Fast forward a few months and she changed her schedule just to be able to see me more often. Shortly after we began to date. Now i know many people say this but she saved my life not once but twice.
Here is why i say that, first she took over my whole medical chart and looked it over, asked questions to doctors and even had me change my doctor for another one. Not only did the new doctor change my medication he also told me about things i did not know. Sure enough a few weeks pass and i began to feel better and my test results proved that. Thanks to her i dont think i would have changed doctors as i figured this was how i was supposed to feel. 
So number 2, there was a time when i began to feel pain in my side. Not horrible pain just uncomfortable pain. She always told me to go get it looked at, but being stuborn i said it would just go away. A few days later she knocks on my door, she doesnt get an answer so she opens it and goes it (yes she had a key) and there i was in bed in extreme agony. She doesnt say anything just picks my butt up, now you have to understand she is like 5'0 125lbs soaking wet she just hauled my butt to the hospital where i had my appendix taken out. Doctors say if she didnt bring me in i would have died because my appendix was ready to burst. 
So basically I hold her in the highest of regards. 

Time passed and i did ask her to marry me, and she accepted, but we ended up splitting up. I think it was due to myself getting too comfortable in the relationship that i just took advantage of her thinking she would always be there. Anyways i transfer clinics because i knew it would be hard to see her, but i always remembered what she said about how to take care of myself and never forgot. 
Two years later i received my transplant. I wished she was there because i know without her i may have never lived enough to receive one. 
Now i think back and i would love to tell her thank you, thank you for what you taught me for what you did for me but also thank you for loving me at a time i though i was done. I know she is married now and i am happy for her, all i wanted for her is to be happy and if that was not with me then oh well. But i sit here and think, i would love to tell her thanks.
So i know where her folks live and was thinking, should i go and just drop off a note? Maybe ask her mom for her number? 
Its been around 5 years since we last spoke and i just feel if more time passes the more likely it is something will happen where i will never get a chance to say thanks. By that i mean she moves i move whatever. 
So Reddit what do you guys think? Im i just being retarded and should just leave well enough alone, or should i try to thank her?

Thanks for any advice guys and gals.

TL;DR  Girlfriend showed me how to take care of myself after losing kidneys and wanting to know if after 5 years and a transplant later should reach out and say thanks. "
s40fm,4,2012-04-11,How can I get some momentum back in my life?,Mayotte,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/s40fm/how_can_i_get_some_momentum_back_in_my_life/,"Reddit, I realize this question is absurdly broad, and most likely something I need to solve myself, but at this point I could use any input whatsoever.

Here's a little back-story for the doldrums I'm stuck in:

I began college intending to complete a 3-2 program in Engineering (Aerospace), but after two years I changed my major to English. It wasn't because I couldn't handle the coursework, I was rocking mostly A's, one or two B's, but I just wasn't happy. In the end I graduated in English, with a minor in Japanese. For the record, I found my English coursework far more taxing than the technical courses I'd been taking, reason being that you can't problem solve reading or writing-- it takes loads of time no matter what. 

It's been two years now since I left school. In that time I worked a bit and travelled to China to pursue martial arts for most of a year. Now I'm back home, and I find myself feeling helpless. 

I wasn't proactive with internships during school, and I fear that switching majors was the worst decision I've ever made. Nobody tried to talk me out of it, nobody advised me of the risks, but in the end it was down to me. It's my fault. I should have seen more clearly. 

Now I'm stuck considering the possibilities. It feels impossible to find work with my current credentials. What can I do? Do I suck it up and work any dead-end job I can find? Is it possible to salvage those Engineering credits in any way? This worry is sickening, I feel like a kid who let his balloon float away.

Thanks to all who undertook this wall of text.

John is a friend who's family has sacrificed a lot (as I'm sure you ALL understand) in order for his dad to serve our country. He is currently taking classes online, is very interested in gaming, and is honestly the most humble person I know. His morals are strong, and he has a great heart. Due to his father being away, he doesn't generally get to go out and do things that a young man would do with his dad (sports, etc.). So he is reaching out. John entered a contest through Monster Energy to win an internship with a skilled athlete to ""find something I'm good at."" This opportunity is something that could really change his life, and I feel that because he gives his dad to serving all of us, we can serve him by helping him achieve this opportunity.

I have obtained an internship in the beautiful state of Colorado for the entirety of the summer. I will be living in housing provided by the internship site. I suffer from hyperhidrosis-induced anxiety and chronic, clinically detailed back problems. My question is, being a non-permanent resident of Colorado for the summer, would I qualify/be able to obtain a med card during my stay? How long would the process take and would it be worth it? If I pursue it, should I speak with my internship site supervisor about the facility's policy on cannabis? Thanks everyone and, med card or not, I cannot wait to spend time in Colorado!"

I only know the very basics of only 3 programming languages.  Java, C, and Python.  Not enough to code anything fancy.  I have no projects outside of school because i don't like programming enough to do it outside of school.  I spend most of my free time working on recording and playing music.  I've been reading some posts here and have read that a lot of companies ask ""so what projects have you been working on, on your free time""  it makes me laugh to think that i would be replying with ""nothing"".

I feel like if i were to go in to a technical interview right now, i would not know how to go about doing anything, and would just stand there like an idiot.  Yet somehow, i've gotten A's on all coursework relevant to my major.  I still don't know how i managed to get any of that, surprises me.  I don't think it's a good representation of what i actually know at all.

so some might ask well then why are you a CS major?  Well the answer is because i'm doing it as a compromise.  I sit in front of a computer for a majority of the day so i felt it was natural to get a degree in something computer related.  I wasn't expecting this though.  The alternative career path i used to pursue (music) is not an option at this point, as it very difficult to make a decent living at it.

Oh and to make matters worse, the internship that i thought i had set up for the summer just fell through.  I need the internship for college credit, and without it, i won't be able to graduate when i planned to.  At this point it's really difficult to find a replacement,  basically causing me a crap load of stress, something i don't need right now.

At this point i'm just taking it day by day, and trying to ride the wave as long as i can.

One thing i realized that i do not want for a career is one where it seems like i am constantly working.  I know people who are programmers and they work 60 hour weeks and then bring work home almost every day.  Screw that crap, that's something i don't want.  My motto is that life is too short to have to endure a garbage life like that.  My goal is to find something where i can comfortably support myself while maximizing my free time to pursue things i actually like.  I understand a lot of people never achieve something like that, but it's what i am going to strive for.

At this point i'm just going through the motions of school,  and i have this overwhelming feeling that I won't be successful in this field.  I do not know what I am doing."

Am I insane for wanting to stay/forgive him, and can we make this work? [Lengthy] details inside.",advice_for_me,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/s3u5s/please_put_in_your_two_cents_rockyvery_eventful/,"Posting on a throwaway simply because I will be disclosing a LOT of information about myself/my life in this post.  I apologize in advance for the lengthy post **(will include a TL;DR)**, but I want to include the full context and honestly also really need to get it all out.


**I am currently 20 years old and my boyfriend is 24.  We have been together for 2-3 years, since I was 17 and he was 21.**


 My teenage years were rocky to say the least.  When I met my boyfriend, I was in a bit of a hopeless position.  I had been kicked out as a teenager, and with no real friends left at this point I didn’t have many places to go.  I was a recovering drug addict and made the stupid decision to give up and relapse because it seemed easier at the time.  I had been renting a room in a drug-trafficking house full of meth addicts for about six months.  I had just lost my job and although there was a part of me that really wanted to get sober and escape, it seemed very difficult at the time with my parents unwilling to take me back and having absolutely nothing to my name, and also still being a minor.  I had been a very bright young woman before, but had spiraled to an all-time rock-bottom.  


He came to the house through a mutual friend, not knowing what type of place it was.  We met but didn’t talk much that night, but he came back and we were basically inseparable after that.  He knew I wanted to get sober and get out, and stayed by my side for a few weeks until he brought me to my parents to talk it through and find a solution.  He brought me to my residence to pack all of my belongings and drop them off at my parents.  I stayed with extended family a few hours away for about a week until he found us an apartment to move into, then picked me up and brought me to the apartment to have a fresh start.


Since then, I have gotten my high school diploma, completed an internship, started as a data analyst at a great company and have went back to college.  I have been sober from meth since we packed my bags and left that house over two years ago.  To say the least, he has helped me become a better version of who I was and to rebuild my life and self-esteem.


Other than that, we have worked through various other issues.  He was an opiate addict (oxycontin) and when we met he was occasionally using.  I also tried it for the first time and would occasionally use as well.  Throughout the first year or so of our relationship, he and I worked on the issues with opiates and went through a relatively long stint of sobriety.  When heroin started becoming popular with his old friends/the town, we both tried it.  I won’t go through extreme detail, but it soon escalated to regular use, and we were both so far into it that we would become deathly ill if we went without it.  It was a little easier for me mentally to quit, and a bit harder for him.


After about six months of this going on, he entered methadone maintenance treatment with counseling to kick the heroin habit and I got a prescription to suboxone (both methadone and suboxone are drugs to stop withdrawals from heroin).  He has had his rough patches, but we have both been clean now for a long time.  Some months after kicking the habit, his best friend (and a good friend of mine) died of a heroin overdose (in November).  It was really rough for both of us, but it strengthened our resolve to stay clean.


Last summer, we were going through a really rough time in our relationship.  There were some issues with staying clean, and it was putting a major strain on our relationship.  There were a few times where we would consider breaking up and our fights got really bad, and things just weren’t healthy between us.  Neither of us were treating each other with the respect or love that we should have.


I just found out in February that he cheated on me last summer.  It confirmed the worst of my insecurities and fears.  He cheated on me with the girl that at the time was my best friend.  I had known her in high school, but became friends with her after hanging out a few times when she was dating my boyfriend’s good friend.  Her and his friend only dated for a couple of months, but our friendship continued after they broke up.  She was my best and only friend for a long time, until she also started using heroin and it ruined our friendship.  When he cheated on me with her, we were still friends, but I was well aware of the damage drugs had done to our friendship.


What had happened was she would start texting him and flirting with him, and would always ask him for drugs (**pretty** much saying she would do *anything* for it).  He eventually responded and when she came over to pick up one day, they made out and they used together.  The texting continued and a couple days later she came over again and again they started getting heavy.  They hung out a third time and they started to have sex, and they quit, because apparently *it wouldn’t fit* (which just makes me feel terrible).  He gave her drugs afterward.  After this meeting, he responded to her texts for a few more days, afraid that she would tell me right away, but would not meet up with her.  After another couple days went by, he just stopped responding to her texts at all.  This was all over about the course of a week, a week where he wasn’t sure we would make it through the week (because things were not going well **at all** between us at that time, I also remember the time not thinking we would make it through either).


This came out after trying to reconcile the friendship with the before-mentioned friend, as I knew she had gotten clean a few months ago.  She told me and tried to apologize, and gave her side of the story.  I was completely blind-sided.  I immediately texted my boyfriend saying that he was a pig, I was disgusted, etc.  He was supposed to pick me up shortly from work.  He at first denied it, and said he was upset I would believe something like that and got angry with me and said that we were done. 


 He ended up picking me up in the end, and after a long drive and a lot of crying on my part, we got home.  Initially he said he was going to get some things and leave, but shortly after we got home said he was really sorry but he needed to talk it through with me and explain everything and put everything in the open regardless of what happened.  He proceeded to tell me everything about the situation, what happened, etc.  His story matched up with my friends, and although it still hurt very, very badly, he told all of the truth. 


When I asked why he hadn’t told me in the six months since it had happened, he said at first he wasn’t sure we would make it through, and then once things started to go well, he didn’t want to reverse everything by revealing his wrong-doings.  He said that he planned to discuss it with me when we were both in a little better position mentally and emotionally, and that he knew it was a mistake but wasn’t sure how to handle it and he was selfishly afraid.  He said that he thought it would maybe be better to end things, but after having a discussion I said that I wanted to at least see how things could go and if I could forgive him.  We had been doing very well, and I knew we had both made our mistakes in the relationship, so perhaps this was another major obstacle we could overcome.


Since this came out, it has been a bit hard for me to cope, but he has been willing to talk about it openly with me and has been very sensitive about how I feel and when I may be struggling with it but not admitting it openly.  Our relationship honestly has never been much better and we are both at a good place mentally/emotionally and in life.  I often find myself wondering though, if I will ever be able to let go of it completely and trust him again if he earns it.  I do understand the reasons behind why he did what he did, as I have went through some of the same emotions when our relationship was very rough.  The thing that has been the most difficult for me is the fact that it was with my best friend and that to me, he essentially paid her to have sex with him, even if they didn’t follow through and that’s not the way he sees it.




 **My question is this:** am I insane for wanting to stay in the relationship?  Does it seem like this can work and we will be able to have a future together?  Everywhere I see people asking for advice regarding cheating, people say that it’s something that can never be overcome and that somewhere down the line it will result in a breakup and wasted time.  I know we love each other very much, and we want it to work, but I don’t want to continue if it’s really not healthy or if we can never restore trust.  He did something horrible, and not just once, but at the same time I feel like he’s being genuine and he would have eventually come clean.  We have been through a lot together, and with open communication I am hoping we can work through it.



 I’ve came across some texts he sent to his friend since it came out saying that even though it wasn’t a good decision, the mistake he made proved to him that freedom isn’t all it’s cracked up to be, and that he doesn’t want to stray from me or be with other women.  He said something along the lines of it took being with another woman to really realize that it wasn’t at all what he wanted.  Part of me almost thinks that’s why our relationship turned around after it happened (or it very well could be that he quit talking to her because our relationship was turning around, since he saw her a few times until it was over).




**I AM LOST; PLEASE BE FRANK AND OFFER YOUR TWO CENTS.**



**TL;DR**: I have been in a relationship with my boyfriend for 2-3 years.  We have went through a lot together, and at the moment are doing very well and have grown a lot throughout the past few years.  I recently discovered that he cheated on me about six months ago – is this something that can be forgivable, and am I crazy for wanting to stay in the relationship?

Dexter's world has been crashing down since we met him, and it (I predict) will come full circle with Brian (via the intern) in season 8. 

It is like a Kurt Vonnegut novel, starting as close to the end as you can. 

I must say, I've loved the ride of watching Dexter go from a true pyscho to a really disturbed individual who struggles with good and evil every day and hopefully one or the other will win.

edit: just to be clear, I'm not trying to complain too much about the set up. I realize that I have the choice to work or not to work, and that many internships do pay.

For a while I've been looking at majoring in actuarial science (I've discussed the matter with /r/actuary as well) but I'm starting to think that I want a more diverse field of employment options. I am considering majoring in statistics and studying for the actuarial exams on my own, so that if actuary doesn't work out I can drive for a career as a statistician (I fell in love with stats after taking AP Stats in high school). I am debating between UIUC and Drake University (so if any of you have experience with the schools, it'd be appreciated. Drake doesn't have statistics as a major but they do have a great actuarial science program).

First question: Is it a recommended path to major in statistics, possibly minor in something like finance, and study for exams separately? What kinds of internships should I be looking for during college with this setup, and what burden would I be facing with my exam attempts and schooling combined?

Second question: what career options are there with just a bachelors degree in statistics, and what is the outlook on such careers? I was told that if I study statistics, I should go for a Masters... but I don't even want to think about grad school right now. Also would greatly appreciate input on the current employment levels at the bachelors/masters thresholds.

Third question: What things should I be doing in college besides trying exams and working on GPA/internships to display myself as a quality stats student? I want an outstanding resume after graduating so I'm not stuck in the unemployment pool.

I know I asked a lot, but I'm just weighing my options right now and want to make sure my decision will set me towards success. Thanks guys!"

I'm not sure if its because I've been there for two years already and the grass always appears greener on the other side or what. The company is huge and I could see myself moving up the ranks, which is a plus. This position pays the best out of all 3 and also has the best benefits.  They also take into consideration my two years I've spent there, so the benefits would only get better sooner. I have already established myself here and people are beginning to respect my opinion (not too common with an intern). But like I said, the work there would not be too exciting. Its a lot of writing and not a lot of engineering.


* Option 2: This would be an embedded software engineering position.  This seems to be the most fun option in terms of work. I've done a lot of embedded systems in school and I enjoy it. The problem is, this is a small company (like 30 guys) but it seems like they are growing.  I'm worried about when times are slow and also, they do a lot of contract work for Option 1 above. I could just end up doing the same thing that I would be doing at Option 1 but for less money. This offer was $5000 less than Option1 and not as good of benefits (still decent).


* Option 3: I would be a controls engineer at another international company. This job requires 60% travel. At first I was a little wary of the travel (I've never been on an airplane) but I feel like this would be a great opportunity to get out there. Most travel would be the US but once a year or so I would go to Germany to learn the new machines. The company is trying to sell me a ""special"" position in which I would learn the specialized machines that the other engineers don't. This job requires a lot a programming which I don't mind at all and I can see a lot of debugging when I travel to the machines which I enjoy also. However, they talk about a lot of overtime which I'm not paid for until I go over 50 hours.  I'm not sure about how I feel about that. This position is $7000 less than Option 1 with good benefits but with travel bonuses and flat rate overtime once past 50 hours. I may get them to match Option 2's offer. 


All of these jobs are in my hometown and like I said, I am extremely grateful to be in such a position. I go back and forth with this decision and have talked to so many people about it. I'm trying to get some more opinions. Any advice is greatly appreciated. 

Thanks!"

I'm a college student working towards a BA in Marketing, and possibly Management as well, and am looking for the ""mandatory read"" book for those in the marketing field. My business management professor recommended that I read the book ""In Search of Excellence"" by Peters and Waterman saying that it was ""practically the bible of business management"" and I've really been enjoying it and the employee/customer oriented business model it proposes. I have a huge passion and admiration for companies that support this belief. That said, Zappos' CEO Tony Hsieh's book ""Delivering Happiness"" really struck my attention, considering the company's dedication to customer excellence, but realize it's not necessary focused to the marketing aspect. I figured I'd come to you guys for references to books that are considered mandatory readings for those in the marketing field, as I'm still relatively new to the field, but am very interested in learning more about the aspects.

I've checked out the [Marketing Library](http://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/qdm4g/help_build_the_rmarketing_library_books_blogs/) on the sidebar, but as that's quite a list, I was hoping for the top recommended read, as I've got a summer marketing internship starting in about a month.

Might be a long one.

My boyfriend is 25(m) and I am 25(f). We have been in a relationship for about 6 1/2 years. So, we've been through a lot. A bit of back-story: I helped him through and supported him through college, putting off my own formal education in the process. I was patient waiting for him to acquire THE job he wanted, one that was in the field he obtained schooling for. We were unable to get a place to live together due to a lack of funds since he was semi-unemployed. I live at his parent's house with him, now, and we are in the process of looking for a place together or possibly even buying a house.

Now, the issue that has come up time and time again since he was in college is that I feel like I am not a priority in his life. Schoolwork was put ahead of me, which I understood. Then his free internships, I also understood that. Now, his work is very time-consuming, which I also understand. Point is, he has very little free-time. He recently took up P90X (a workout routine) and he spends everyday working out. When he is not working out, he is with his best friend of many years, planning camping trips, hiking, going on jogs. He also took up designing his sister's wedding website.

I had one day with him really, because yes, my work also takes up a lot of my time as well and also causes me to be very exhausted. Recently, however, he has been cancelling our one 'date night' for other things he deems more important. The website, his best friend, whatever else he comes up with. He says he ""has too much to do and not enough hours in the day."" I've asked him to maybe cancel some workouts, put off his best friend every now and then.. to maybe spend some time with me. He gets really quiet or condescending and tells me why that isn't possible. It's been upsetting me a lot, to the point I start crying, but that doesn't change anything. I have no idea how to talk to him and tell him exactly how I feel. He never shows much emotion or interest in making me feel better.

**TL;DR:** My boyfriend keeps me on the backburner and he doesn't care that it bothers me so much; how do I talk to him and try to remedy this? I'm not really okay with throwing over 6 years of a relationship away."

* How much can i expect to pay for rent?  I'll need a 3 month, temporary residence.  Where is the best place to look for this?

He charms his way into getting things and he also has this attitude of ""God Loves me so much"".  The thing is everyone buys his crap.  He is lying to my grandfather about getting an internship in Switzerland (the ticket is $2000), granted his home town and his father are in Switzerland but he chose to come to the states with his mom (my aunt) and left his family behind.  He is also not getting a job which he desperately needs for the summer.  The only reason he is going to Switzerland is because his girl friend is going over there and he didn't tell my grandfather that.  He needs the job because my aunt left Switzerland and refuses to get a job so she and consequently my cousin are living off of the money my grandfather is giving her.  

I am not mad about my grandfather giving them money.  The thing I am mad about is the principle of the situation.  My cousin is going to be someone who does not respect the meaning of hard work, just like my aunt.  I know that when the tough parts of life come he will just quit or beg for money because that is what the rest of my family has taught him (this is also the trend I see in his mother (my aunt)).  I don't want this to happen to him but I know it will if he keeps this up.

Fast forward to today, when I arrived I was immediately pulled in to a meeting. There I was told basically this, ""you've done a great job around here and we want to thank you, but we're cutting you back to 20 hours a week since things are running so smoothly.” I told them this would be a financial disaster for me and their only response was ""well, have your parents help you"" which is definitely not an option.

s6wjv,1,2012-04-12,"Hi reddit! Student here, repeated pattern of harassment by college security + bullshit ""disciplinary hearings"", crushed my spirit + mental health. Should I sue? Is there risk in suing? ",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/s6wjv/hi_reddit_student_here_repeated_pattern_of/,"[apologies, but this was extremely long. If not interested, skim or don't read!]

OK, throwaway account because my primary is for joyful humor. But this is personal and painful. I'll try not to vent and write this factually instead of emotionally...

During my 2 years at this fucking hellhole, I learned that students were to show no evidence of any conflict with staff whatsoever. It was like they had an itchy-trigger finger when it came to calling security, and then charges and punishment were doled out without ever understanding WHAT crime had supposedly happened. I believe it was a clear case of mis-using (illegally?) security to retaliate against complaints. It was like they had used Kafka's The Trial as a how-to-manual.


I had never seen a campus, (or any community institution besides a jail) with such a mercilessly authoritarian attitude. Being a jewboy hippy who does not take bullshit from any petty tyrants, I stood up for myself when the epic incompetence of the college reared its head. There were 3 occasions over the last 2 years in which my solidarity with the underdogs of this earth called me to action. Each time, security was used (illegally, I'm assuming) to retaliate against my complaints. The main part of this story are the three confrontations by security, so skip to those below if you want.) Alternately, here's some back-story to put those events in perspective:

***


**BACK-STORY: (skip this part if you want)**
I have attended 4 colleges. Good grades, full-time class load. Unfortunately, each time I transferred (for marriage/divorce/relocation reasons) each new college summarily rejected about half my earned credits. Due to this, I am now in my EIGHTH year of college (finishing my very last class now!) but I will only have achieved a (standard 2-year) associates degree. Needless to say, 8 years of debt (near $50,000) for a 2-year degree is depressing. I could have been on my way to a phd by now! I was shocked to learn that my human services program requires 90-some credits, yet I had by now earned **233** credits, almost all in my field of study! Needless to say, by the time I enrolled in this college 2 years ago, I was fed up and determined to just finish school and get the damn piece of paper as soon as possible. Attending this college was one of the worst mistakes of my life.


Now, due to my previous 6 years of education, I expected to be advanced toward the end of their human services program and wrap things up with an internship and a few classes. Instead, I was actually denied information on WHICH classes I still needed for my degree! The best anyone would do is give me their ""best guesses"" on what courses to take-- many of which had taken 2 or 3 times before, and had to pay for. After 6 terms of these best guesses, I was sick of it and began demanding some answers. There were also many, many mistakes by the degree evaluators such as losing my official transcripts, getting my name wrong, etc. that held up the process. To give you an idea of the incompetence, even last term, two years into their ""program"" my advisers told me to register for 4 ""best guess classes"" (well over $1,000) and later told me I didn't need any of them! (this was not an isolated incident, it was what I'd been dealing with and paying for for 2 years). After 6 terms of these best guesses, I was sick of it and began demanding some answers. I had reached the limit of my patience and started demanding some answers. Thus begins the tale of my harassment by security...

***

**Bullshit Event #1-**
-Was given a grant from the school, an advance on my financial aid so I could buy books at the bookstore. Waited in line over 2 hours (they pack us in like sardines here), they told me I didn't have access to that grant. I showed proof, asked for manager. She personally ok'd my proof, sold me a computer and signed the form. Go back next day, wait in line 2 hours, cashier again refuses to accept my grant money for books. Told her I already went through this with the manager and showed her proof. She refuses and gets very ghetto and macho with me, while 200 students wait in line behind us. As I leave, defeated + book-less a security guard approaches and gives me a piece of paper. This tells me to appear at a ""judicial hearing"" in which I am sat down in a creepy back office with security guards and college officials who tell me I could be expelled. Outraged, I tell them that a disagreement in the bookstore has nothing to do with security-- I hadn't broken any rules or done anything wrong besides disagreeing with a cashier about my right to spend my own money.
They act like they are doing me a favor by banning me from the bookstore. When I take one step toward the bookstore window to simply ask if I was allowed to get my bus-pass they hand out there, they call security again. I never yelled at or threatened anyone ever.

***

**Bullshit Event #2**
As I say, this gulag is incompetent. Their system seem to generate alot of automated form letters cancelling our financial aid over + over, and then when you go to dispute them (since they make no sense), no one will take responsibility- they just say ""our computers sent the cancellation, whether we agree with it or not you need to do an appeal (40 day process). I've gotten 3 such letters, and each time after the appeal they put you on probation for a term. The 2nd one, well, I got this one week prior to an internship at a homeless shelter. I had spent the last month interviewing at places to find an internship as I was told to, and was hired at a great place. (they later offered me a job!)

Now, even though they admitted the financial aid robo-cancellation was bullshit, they insisted I go through the 40-day apeal process. I explained that I could not start my internship without financial aid, since I couldn't pay out of pocket, and that I needed someone in administration to waive the bullshit rob-cancellation so I could start work. I began seking a meeting with anyone who would listen in the administration building- BIG. MISTAKE. The attitude I found was that student DO. NOT. request meetings with administration. Even to walk in and speak to secretaries there was regarded as ""suspicious"". I was actually told it was ""illegal"" for students to speak to the vice president. When some nasty woman told me it was illegal, I took out a pen and asked for her full name and if for the record she was stonewalling me, that I was not allowed to even make an appointment with someone. Never yelled at or threatened anyone. She was not concerned about her safety- she was obviously angry and disgusted with me, and she grabbed the phone, called security. 

As I left the building, defeated, 3 security officers drove up to me on scooters, surrounded me, and told me ""the vice-president's office wants me ""trespassed""  (odd, since I was not allowed to make an appointment with her)..... They said they might have to track me by my cell phone (I did not have one) so they could tell if I was near campus. Luckily, one guard took a liking to me since I was from NY (City, USA, once upon a time), said people talk differently there than the ""flakey west coast"" (true) and told me to go home and have a beer. I did. However,  I also filed a formal student complaint (in hopes of getting approval to start my new internship). They never responded to the complaint, one woman said ""because I didn't remember to sign it"" (I did, had photocopy to prove it). They did informally respond to it by waiving my 2nd financial aid cancellation and letting me do my internship, yet they made me attend another creepy back-room disciplinary hearing with security guards and officials who now had ""proof"" I was a repeat-offender with some kind of supposed aggressive tendencies, and acted as if I was menacing or harassing staff. They made ALOT of references to school shootings (I found their use of that tactic *unbelievably* offensive.) and said if anything happened again I would be expelled.

***

**Bullshit Event #3**

After 2 years of endless meetings with my advisers, the dean, degree evaluators, and counselors, they still would not give me any information on when I would graduate or what classes I actually still needed to get my degree. Keep in mind I had been relentlessly seeking this information for 2 years and was at that time (as usual) being told to take over $1,000 of classes they then admitted I did not need. I had just dropped a grueling writing class near end-of-term which they casually mentioned I didn't need, and my bill for next term (based on bullshit ""best-guesses) was comming due soon. I had had enough. So I went to disability services. I have a disability (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) but in my 8 years of college I have NEVER mentioned that to any teacher or counselor before- I wanted no special treatment and I wanted to prove I could graduate without their ""accommodations"".  I filed an Americans with Disabilities Act Complaint (like my formal student complaint, no response to this either after months, other than an email saying ""this doesn't seem to apply to you"").

 I also went to the regular counseling department and said I felt like I was heading for a nervous breakdown. The counselor sent me to her superior, I told him the same thing and then asked for help. He was not there to help me. He chastised me for seeking guidance from too many people and smugly said I should get a lawyer."" I asked one last thing- I said ""So 8 years of full-time credits, $50,000 in debt, and no answer on even when I could HOPE to graduate?"" He told me again to get a lawyer and so I just picked up my things, shook my head in disgust, and walked out. I think it was my evident disgust that unleashed the most epic shitstorm yet: A woman came out and said the head of the counseling department wanted to see me. I thought ""OK, I'll give this one last try"" and sat flipping through a newspaper. In a minute SEVEN security guards filed into the room and I could see them talking with the smug tool I had just seen. I knew they were for me. The head of counseling came out and asked me if I was alright in a condescending voice, like she was talking to a small child. I said ""Sure. These seven security guards aren't here to see me by any chance are they?"" She said no, and I got up to leave. The security guards followed me and surrounded me. I asked if they were ticketing me with something. They said no, so I went to walk away. They followed me and surrounded me again (at this point I was confused- like ""either give me a damn ticket or let me go, don't fricken stalk me!"" They acted like they were in riot formation or something, like football players in a scrimmage line, trying to pen me in. They eventually let me go and told me they wern't going to charge me with anything. I went to class. 

As I was leaving psychology class two security guards swooped down on me and took up their formation/scrimmage line thing. They gave me a ticket and had me backed up against a wall in front of my peers. This is when I cracked. I said rather loudly ""IO HAVE POST TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER. MY FATHER BEAT ME AND MY MOM TO A BLOODY PULP ALL THE TIME. I AM NOT DOING ANYTHING WRONG. YOU PEOPLE ARE STALKING ME AND IT IS WRECKING HAVOC ON MY MENTAL HEALTH!""   (true story. oh well, at least he's dead. rot in hell dad!)

Thus begins the final chapter of this long macabre tale. I attend my 3rd disciplinary hearing in that creepy back-room with security guards, some semi-judge dude, and a friend and a Disability Services counselor there as advocates. [20/20 hindsight- should have brought a damn lawyer!]. I was sure I was getting expelled. The meeting was 2 hours of hell. I was sweating bullets and just generally miserable in life. I wanted nothing more than to never step foot on that campus again, but I COULD. NOT. let them steal my degree after 8 years of college. They didn't expel me. They pulled my file and finally made a judgement on when I could graduate. They said I needed only ONE more class (obviously someone was pulling strings to get me out before I either went nuts or sued them). But the guy who made the decision to put me on probation told me not to speak to anyone besides one disability counselor. He has since been tracking me, and appearing out of nowhere, as if he has appointed himself my watchmen, and very aggressively threatening me for such things as sending an email to the financial aid department (to appeal my 3rd financial aid robo-cancellation) and for requesting a form from the registration window. I have alot of rage toward this guy, since he has the power to expel me and has basically said ""you cannot speak to a single person (except the one lady) or use any services at this school, nomatter how trivial. If his goal is to make me feel as alienated, isolated, and quarantined like an infected outcast, he has. The good news is my very last class is an independent study I can do from home and I don't need to go to that macabre place ever again, except to walk in graduation which I have mixed feelings about to say the least.... I'm almost free!!!


The End...?

1) Do I have grounds to sue?  (I have kept every complaint form, scrap of paper, email, and timeline of events in case I do). What would my accusation(s) be legally? What would I be asking for besides a letter of apology? I don't really crave money, but is that how it works?

2) Is this wise?  The corruption of this institution knows no bounds. Nothing would surprise me at this point, such as the school claiming I was harassing, menacing, or terrorizing staff, or just fucking lying in any way that could hurt me if I sue?

3) Should I play the disability card? It's true I have PTSD, but it's embarrassing to me and I hate the idea of having to admit that I am broken in some ways, and that the real damage the school caused me was exacerbating the symptoms of that (nightmares, panick attacks, etc).  I have wondered if some kind of Americans with Disabilities complaint to some college-oversight ethics committee might be more appropriate than a lawsuit.

4) I should mention, I HATE anything to do with lawyers and court. I had one minor trial that was hell, and I have seen court destroy a dear friend of mine. Reddit always say ""lawyer up"" but could I be getting myself into a HUGE mess here if I do? Does the college have the right to counter-sue me and could I get charged and convicted of their bullshit claims?

5) If I decide to just put this behind me, do you think I should walk in graduation? (Or is that like having a cute little tea party with your previous captors, if you know what I mean?) And most
important of all, how do you think I should get the feelings of rage and resentment out of my heart now?


**TL;DR: I had genuine complaints against an incompetent college. They used campus security and judicial hearings to retaliate and make my life misreable for 2 years. Wat do?**"

I accepted the offer because I want to have work guaranteed after I'm finished with school, but its a job that I really, REALLY don't want.  The more I think about it the less I want to work there.  I plan on looking for work elsewhere in the very near future, but am in a bit of a predicament.  The only relevant work experience I have is from my internship from my ""current"" employer.  Could including this on my resume result in a withdrawal of my current offer if they are contacted by other companies interested in me? What would be the best way to go about finding another job without losing my current offer? (In my mind, if another employer called my current one asking about me, red flags would be raised...)

I think it'll be great idea to worked on.

What if our Universities and the government worked together to build an internship program to allow students with low income with limited resources to pay for school to help teach the K-12 schools? Of course many strict rules apply but let me lay out some general ones. 

1. Students can start this internship at the beginning of their sophomore year 
2. Students must have a 3.5 GPA or higher. 
3. Students cannot have another full time job -- and a part time job is lowly looked upon

This will help both sides of the fence. College students will be able to avoid massive debt, build leadership and other values such as patience, etc. The k-12 education public schools can mitigate any further financial devastation's and look forward to strengthening the system rather than finding out they cant afford any other teachers.

Of course the monitoring system must be highly critical due to many liabilities with young adults teaching. I'm a little busy but i'll go into details later...

gotta get back to work. we'll build on my ideas later tonight!"

It's almost the end of the year and my District Manager still won't promote me to intern. All my classmates I've spoke with (who also work at CVS) are interns. 

I've had an interview with the Intern coordinator and I felt it went OK. I have lots of work experience with the company, obviously, and all three pharmacist's I've worked with love me. They think it's nonsense I am not promoted yet and even spoke with the DM about it.

My current PIC spoke with the DM and said CVS is concerned that I don't agree with all their programs, such as PCQ. This stems from a conversation I had with DM where I said CVS calls the customers too much and it bothers people. I said I get prescriptions at CVS, my sister does, and my mother, so I can understand when patients complain about all the calls because it is annoying.

She said I should know why we call customers and it's for their benefit.

Don't know if I should stick it out with CVS or try to get hired somewhere else. My salary isn't the issue. I already make $13/hr so that's not the reason for not promoting.

So my question/situation is as follows. I'm going to be gone from end of June to end of August, with *no* computer access. The folks over at GW2Guru seem absolutely convinced the release date will be end of June (though I'm not entirely sure...) but I know Arenanet has their ""When its ready"" mindset. *Regardless.* 

IF the game were to release in the end of June, and I (and anyone else in a similar situation) were 2 months late to start - will we be missing much/behind? For those of you who have been part of a lot of MMO launches, what do you think?


I've been following this game since it was announced, and have played GW1 since it first came out. So obviously I'm being selfish hoping the game doesn't come out right as soon as I leave. But I'm also asking now before the release date is actually announced, because once it has this subreddit is going to explode.


Anyone else in a similar situation? 

EDIT: Thanks all for you answers. I mentioned it in a response but I should say that the reason I'm gone is for an awesome internship, so I'm not upset about missing the game. I just wanted to hear what everyone thinks may be different for those starting late. Also, I'm responding to almost everyone here, and for some reason they're not showing up - hopefully that fixes itself."

I can afford any kind of treatment and neither can my parents. I don't want to be on medication my whole life for it either. I've gone through some shit these past 2 years. My family has moved twice because my dad went through some shit with his job and we had to move. Then he lost it and we had nowhere to live. We finally found a place amongst some friends. We've been here about two years now. My dad is working night shifts for very little pay while my mom is homeschooling my 14 year old brother. My mom has literally told me she wants to die but can't because of my little brother. I go to school full time, work full time, work a 2 day a week internship, and have a small computer repair business. It's killing me. I've done pretty well every semester since I graduated highschool, but I've gone every week since 2010. Every possible semester. So I could graduate, marry my girlfriend and get out of this hellhole town. My girlfriend was raped almost 3 years ago. I didn't find out until almost 7 months later. She didn't do anything and wouldn't let me do anything. The guy harasses her every day through text messages and phone calls. She doesn't reply, but it still messes with her because he will send her audio and pictures of him (and his brother!) raping her. She is very protective of her phone because of this. To the point where if I try to take it, she will literally hit me. I know she's not cheating though because I've seen the hateful messages he sends her. We changed her number once to try to stop him, but apparently he has all of her friends numbers and just asks them for it. We can't block his number because she's with AT&amp;amp;T and they charge for that (and he has a new number almost every month somehow. He works for verizon but I don't see how he could get a new number. Maybe friends phones? I don't know). I think she may have PTSD because it REALLY messed her up. We can't have sex anymore because it hurts her. She feels distant. My family has been all over me about random stupid shit like school. Even though after 9 semesters I have a 3.7 GPA. I don't really know other than these possible reasons why I'd be depressed, but for the past month I have skipped 80% of my classes. Skipped my internship and didn't go to work for 3 days. I may have to drop 3-4 of my 6 classes this semester. I can't have this and I really need help. I turn to you guys because I don't really have any friends to talk to.

TL;DR
I'm depressed and broke. What can I do?Edit: just to sum up what I've said in the comments and to add a little more information,I know who the rapist is, but he is psycho. I'm pretty sure he is bipolar. He will send her messages one day telling her how much she means to him and how they've dated the past six years (she's only known him for 3 wtf). Then the next day he will be telling her how she should die and that he's glad he raped her. I'm currently trying to convince my girlfriend to do the restraining order I i don't know if she will  she's pretty scared of him because he will come into where she works and he knows where she lives. we live an hour away from each other so if something happens, i wouldn't be able to do anything. I've been losing a lot of weight lately.  starting out i only weighed 130.

Obviously my motivation is getting a job in the end and also to avoid an embarrassing conversation with my family about how I fucked up the first job offer I have ever received.

I think to myself if they can do it then there is no reason I should fail, is this a rational way of thinking? Or is this comparing apples to oranges?

Also note that I am not completely sure about returning to the habit after my 40 days, I may consider quitting but only time will tell.

I have slipped into the sysadmin arena over the last month or so messing with AD on Windows Server 2008 as I would like to have a little background in this. Our domain is at a 2008 level if that needs to be said too. 

Let me start off by stating how they add users to the domain:

1. They copy a current, lets say customer service account, and create the new user.
2. They then plug-in the pc at the desk, etc, etc.
3. The domain admins log in to the pc with their domain accounts and add the CS users domain account to the local admins group, and then they are done.

To me this sounds TERRIBLE, local admin domain accounts? This is not the way it should be in my mind. How would you traditionally in a business structure add users to the domain? I don't think adding them locally to the admins group is correct, but I could be wrong since I am new to this.

EDIT: I just learned 5 minutes ago, this is how they do it on servers as well. WOW. I just looked at the file server, and there are atleast 50 accounts in the local admin group that are non-existent or the employee left."

I am writing this because I need to point out some things. I don't think you realize your actions and their effects. I really can't forgive you for all the shit you've done to me over the years. Your recent bullshit has sent me way over the edge and I'm not going to keep silent on it anymore.


When I was 11 you decided to get rid of Mark who was the only person that was a good influence in my life. I know he isn't and wasn't a bad guy. Who did you replace him with? That asshole Nick, the guy I got into 2 physical fights with as a kid. I had to put up with his shitty parenting up until your divorce, which by the way was shitty of you to cheat on him with Rob. That's dirty shit. But even before that happened you were a raging alcoholic who would argue at night and keep me up. Remember that time when I was 10 and you and Igor went to the bar and I wanted to go home but you wanted to stay and drink? I do. Fucking shitty parenting. Remember that time I got an internship and you and that fucking drunk Alex decided to get shit faced until 3am  and cause a ruckus? Remember how I had to sleep on the train before i went to my first day to that internship? I DO. Remember how you called the cops on me when I wanted to pull your ass out of the bars because you were getting shit faced? I DO. Remember that time you called the cops on me when I wouldn't clean my room? I DO. Remember how I left the house when I was 21 working a full time job and going to school because I couldn't live with you because you would talk shit when you got home drunk? I DO. You remember how you asked me to come home and help pay rent when you lost your job and to pick up sophia? I DO. I didn't give you shit about it I helped you without giving you shit about anything. I can give you so many more examples of how fucking shitty you've been during the years but I think even you can maybe get the point.


You know why I have asthma? It's because second hand smoke from when I was 12, you deffinetly needed to smoke in the kitchen and now I have asthma because of your selfish shit. You don't like calling the doctors for me? IT""S YOUR FUCKING FAULT I HAVE THIS SHIT TO LIVE WITH FOR THE REST OF MY FUCKING LIFE. You are the direct cause of my disease, fuck you.

You upset you need to help me when I'm 27 so I can finish school? Guess whose fault that is? It's not mine, you created such a shitty environment for me and no stability whatsoever. Every time I do something good, you're there to fuck it up with your selfish bullshit and how you're suffering by having to deal with my mess. 

I grew up alone. I grew up with no father figure and a mother who put herself first. Literally from 18-27 I raised myself. And you wonder sometimes why I don't show my affection to you? Are you fucking kidding me? You're one of the shittiest people I've met. Any time I give you some trust you fucking shatter it, consistently.

This is how easy it is to prove you don't know shit about me:

What's my favorite music band?
What's my favorite video game?
What's my favorite movie?
What do I really want to do with my life?
Where is the first place I want to take a vacation to?

Can you even answer those questions for Sophia? You think you're so much better then Nick but you're the same, you think spending some money on someone is enough to pass the good parent test.

Now yet again you're fucking up my life with your most recent shenanigans, I now have a strained relationship with Qi the kid I knew since 5th grade. Real nice of you to put your problems with me on him, but then again that's what you do. Me and Diana didn't work out because of you, because you ruined my ability to trust in women.

You have a drinking problem and you can try to convince yourself otherwise but anyone whose spent a night with you and has any kind of brain whatsoever can tell you act like a complete senseless idiot.

In conclusion, I don't give a shit anymore. Cancel the phone, I am going to get a new one this weekend, you want to take me off your insurance, go for it I'll survive. I never deserved the shit you put me through , NEVER. 

You've done good in my life but it's doesn't outweigh the shit. To be frank I lost all respect for you since I was 18. I haven't had love for you since the day you kicked me out when I was 21. The only reason why I decided to do the things I did for you was because I am better than you. I don't shit on people when they're in need. 

I'm an amazing person. I have my faults and I've made shitty mistakes with Sophia. But I know more about her then you ever did about me. My greatest faults is that I'm messy, poor and take things for granted sometimes. All in all that's not bad and everyday I try a little harder to be better. But instead of recognizing this you decide to pick at the little shit all the time, you're a negative influence on my life. You couldn't keep your shit together for the 2 months I needed to graduate? 

When I yelled at you , you deserved every word and I hope that shit burns into your memory forever. The only thing that I feel bad about is that I let someone get to me like that.

The thing is, I am absolutely not interested in teaching at all. I've tutored and it was horrible and it seems whenever I try to talk to counselors they immediately jump onto the whole ""you could be a teacher!"" thing. 

Obviously that's not the only choice out there, but I'm drawing a blank and Googling career choices hasn't helped to narrow it down. Instead of taking random courses until I reach some sort of epiphany, I'd like to actually start aiming for something. Is there anything else I can be working on in the meantime that could potentially help me in the future?

Even if they are true? ,help12me34,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/s5qc9/can_sending_conversations_to_a_persons_spouse/,"Okay reddit I really need help with this.

To avoid a long backstory (although details can be provided with requests), my ex-girlfriend made horrible false accusations against me to get marijuana charges that were not yet filed against me filed. She was successful, and while I got nailed with a felony selling three grams of weed, her felonies were all reduced to a summary offense and a one year no-contact order. Meanwhile, I had to transfer schools, lost a special degree I was going to get, lost my internships that would have given me a future career, and suffered from depression and anxiety from the reality that a girl I loved could do such a horrible thing to me. 

Well today, that no-contact order is long over, and now she's engaged. The thing is, she cheated on her fiance at least two times, and multiple people saw and know about it. I don't know this guy, but he needs to know what he's about to get into....quite literally. 

I have written conversations I had with one of her roommates who goes into detail about how many guys she cheated on her current boyfriend with (both she and her BF are named in the texts). They were on facebook, so you can clearly see who she is. I, however, am not visible.

If I were to print those out and send them to her BF (who is the fiance) - the guy I've never met and have no legal quarrel with - can I get in any kind of trouble? Especially legally - could it come back to bite me in the ass?

I also have pages and pages of private investigators reports on how she is a manipulative liar who fucks anything that moves from all of her friends and ex-boyfriends....so her credibility fails to exist with far more people than just me - it's more or less everyone she knows. 

What do you think? 

EDIT: whoops - poor choice of words in the title. SOON TO BE SPOUSE - they are engaged, not married yet. the point is to save this mans life from having to marry a sociopath. "

s5kgl,6,2012-04-11,"31, and we haven't made sexytime for almost a year.  Maybe other problems, too.",dunno_wha_do,DeadBedrooms,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/s5kgl/31_and_we_havent_made_sexytime_for_almost_a_year/,"Ok folks, I don't even know where to begin, I hope someone can help.  My wife and I have been married for almost 8 years now, and we were dating/living together for 4 years before that (college).  I love her very much, but we haven't had sex for almost a year now.  This is a long one, I apologize in advance!  Also, as I write this, I cannot express how uncomfortable I feel discussing sexytime in a serious way on the internet.  Please don't judge too harshly!

I would like to think that it's not all my fault, but I don't know how true this is.  Here are the issues as I see them:

*  Weight/physical attractiveness.  I don't expect my wife to look like she did when I first met her, time passes and all of that.  She has, however, put on quite a lot of weight since then, and this has affected my attraction to her sexually. However, I feel like there's no way to bring this up without grievously hurting her.  Once, earlier in our relationship, she asked if her weight was a problem, and I answered truthfully ""yes"".  Before I could clarify or expound, she locked herself in the bedroom, and didn't speak to me for two days (last words were ""Don't talk to me!"").  To add to the fun, in high school, she was borderline anorexic, due to stress from her parents divorce and subsequent remarriage.  So, I feel like I have no way to express one of the things that's holding me back.  Recently, I would like to add, she has initiated a workout plan, gym 3x a week, personal trainer, cutting some of the crap out of her diet.  I am so proud and happy for her to be doing this!

*  Touching again on her parent's divorce:  I feel like this is a constant cloud over her view of our marriage, that it's doomed to failure every time we have a fight.  I guess my philosophy is that there are going to be occasional fights, but you try to do better and you keep working at it.

* She's also very insecure about her general appearance.  I am constantly having to defend my opinion when I get the question ""do I look nice/pretty."", she complains of hair going grey, wrinkles,  etc., honestly I tire of it (because it's unwarranted!).  For the record, although I think she needs to loose weight, I think she's **very** pretty, and I tell her all the time!  It's like she doesn't even hear it.

*  The other side of this insecurity is she's very worried that another woman will sweep in and try to steal me.  I'm at my flabbiest now, 6' and 195 lbs.  She says girls think I'm hot, but that certainly wasn't my experience growing up (will discuss this further down).  She doesn't have anything to worry about, infidelity is NOT my way.

*  Time.  We both work, she's getting her master's degree.  The bigger issue, however, is that she's an ""A"" person (morning), and I'm a ""B"" person (nite owl).  I have no desire to go to bed at 9pm, and she seems unwilling to consider sexytimes at any other time of day but bedtime.  Some of this is her body insecurity, I think.  For some reason, I'm at my randiest in the morning (when she doesn't want to go to pound town), and right after getting home from work.

*  Depression.  We've both got it in the clinical sense.  Lately, it seems one of us gets over a bout right in time for the next one to sink in.  While this at least lets us keep the house going, and one of us is able to cheer up the other, it's difficult to work up the desire to wrestle when your neurotransmitters are actively trying to eff you in the a.

*  Sexytime ""style"".  I'm not against foreplay, but sometimes I just want to casually go at it!  She doesn't seem to be in this camp anymore, is it so wrong to just want to bang my wife on the couch every once in a while?  In other ways we are generally compatible, I really like doggy style, she doesn't care for it much, but humors me (and I always emphasize my appreciation).  I think it would be very hot to blow my load on her face or boobs, she's definitely not into that, and I can understand how that could be, and I'm ok with it!

*  In addition, it seems like we're at an impasse when it comes to initiating an encounter.  I think we're equally to blame here, because we both want the other to initiate.  I need to do better about this, but goddammit, so does she.  One quick kiss in the kitchen isn't enough of a signal for me sometimes, is it asking to much to just take me by the hand and tell me ""we're doing this now""?

*  Kissing.  I'm not a big kisser, I guess.  She is.  I try to kiss her often, lately it seems that when I do, all I get is complaints that ""I don't kiss long enough"".  Actually, now that I think of it, that complaint has been going on since the beginning, despite my efforts to improve.  How do I make her understand that when I kiss her and she complains, it makes me *less* likely to want to kiss her, not *more*?

*  My own inexperience.  I was a social recluse in elementary/middle/high school.  It was a **very** clique-y place, and I didn't fit into the athlete/pop culture mold.  Consequently, I never had a date in high school.  My wife was my first girlfriend, first sexual experience, you name it!  I don't regret this (well, a tiny bit, but honestly not a big deal), but it does make me wonder how I would deal with these problems if I had more experience dealing with the opposite sex.  I see this as a big problem, because I just don't have that much experience dealing with the female mindset, I have to learn it all with her.  I see the ""crazy"" in some of our friends' relationships, but I don't know what it looks like from the inside, other than what I'm seeing now, if that even counts.  This is very frustrating.

*  Babies.  She want's one.  I finally feel like I'm adult enough to have one, and once we get her a little more stable in her career (read: out of grad school, and a full time job as opposed to internship), we will be ready to make it happen.  I think she sees that this is the *logical* way to plan, but I also think she's a little ""baby crazy"", especially as our friends are all having kids right now.  I'm just not willing to have a kid and figure out the details later, and that's one of the few things in our marriage I'm not willing to budge on.

Does it not bother you folks when you see ""stoner"" comedies like Wilfred and Pineapple Express re-enforcing negative stereotypes about weed smokers? You know, the ""durrrr I'm so high man lol"" kind of thing? I personally find such things as beneath my contempt and wonder why weed smokers seem to enjoy reveling in the media generated stereotypes perpetuated by these things as well as other films/TV shows/comics/etc. (I like playing video games too while baked, but not all of the time; besides more than an hour or 2 and I get bored and want to do something else)

What do you think about all this? What are some of the things that YOU do to break the stereotype of a lazy stoner? What do people in your lives who know you well think about it? 

Let's discuss. :D"

Monday I came home from school to find a package from the company. Within were some new hire papers to fill out, an invitation to come in today to discuss projects, and a drug test kit. So I booked the drug test appointment for this afternoon, long after the meeting. Well, the meeting went very well, and in high spirits, I set off for my drug test. Well, being the bright do-bes that you all are, you've surely figured out that they want to test my hair. Yeah. My buzz cut is about 1/8"" long. My goatee matches my head. The testing people want a sample about the size of a cotton ball, comprised of hairs 1.5 inches long or so. The nurse took one look at my head, ""Let me see your legs"" says she, and so I pull up my pant legs. Not enough hair there.

I've been trying to get better, but therapy isn't having a lasting effect. I'm taking antidepressants, but the medicine can only do so much.

I guess I was smart, but now seeing people go about their lives getting internships and having hundreds of friends and making lifelong memories drives me to panic. I have wanted to do so much, but I feel that with my leave, all these plans will be postponed. 

Loneliness is at the core of my daily life. I'm an anxious person and can't help feeling inadequate when talking to mostly anyone. Going to school at an Ivy League, where people are rich and amazing, is a brutal reality check and reinforces my insignificance.

Despite my efforts at optimism, I really do feel excluded from everything interesting going on in the world. The depression is swamping me, and it's hard to hold back tears as I type this. There is this monster that has ripped me from my tentative spot on a trampoline to success, dragging me down into a canyon of despair.

I feel like I suck at everything. I even feel bad when I browse Reddit, because the experiences of people on here seem to outdo my own. 

I have contemplated a number of ways to end it, and I'm feeling that a train would be the most efficient course of action, as I don't own a firearm. I don't think anyone would care about a collision as much as they would cleaning up my guts if I shot myself. 

My only regret would be not having been born a different person, one with a rich social life, successful academic career, and life prospects. I will never have a wife, nor children. I would be ashamed for such people to exist when I am in this state.

s8g27,93,2012-04-13,"If your question is ""Should I get into graphic design?"" then the answer is probably ""No."" If you are meant to be a designer, you will know.",sealiontamer,graphic_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/s8g27/if_your_question_is_should_i_get_into_graphic/,"I've seen/heard this question too many damn times and wanted to offer my take on it. 

If you don't have a passion for design in your heart you should NOT become a designer. ""I like to doodle"" and ""I have used photoshop"" are NOT good reasons to become a designer. I graduated with a bunch of people like this, people who chose design because they thought it was going to be an easy major and they fancied themselves ""artistic, creative free spirits"". The majority of those people are now servers, retail employees, and realtors.

Design is NOT easy, and it is by and large NOT an artistic pursuit. (Unless you consider a page from a picture-less novel ""art"") 

You will be getting paid to deliver brand messages and hawk product. You will be producing banner ads that no one will ever see/click. You are not painting Guernica or even drawing Garfield. 

You will be busting your ass to sell your ideas to dimwit clients who typically don't know shit about design and don't place ANY value on you or your skillset. 

You will be working with and taking direction people who get to positions of power by brown-nosing, being tall, and having a nice haircut.

You will be focusing primarily on typography and content organization, and typically only dabbling in what you might call art — color, image, illustration, icons, etc. (about 90%/10%)

Unless you truly enjoy all the anal, tedious minutiae that comes along with ""designing"" - (and by that i mean typography, kerning, leading, grids and guides, stock image/footage searching, color correcting, clipping paths, endless revisions — NOT crosshatching a portrait of your cat wearing a beret), you are guaranteed going to hate your existence and be one of many simply adding noise to a landscape already overflowing with bad-to-mediocre design.
___

Yes I realize I am an asshole and that this post is rife with potentially-unfair generalizations... if you disagree, please share why!

**Update:** I was always a lefty, artsy kid who enjoyed all creative pursuits — drawing, crafts, acting, music, etc. They were all hobbies and I never took any of them seriously and was never the best artist in class. I sucked at sports and had a passing interest in most other studies — enough to get decent grades but I never really considered a career in math, science, or ""business"". I always knew I wanted to be an ""artist"" of some kind, but didn't even have a concept of ""graphic design"" until I was in high school. I image most designers or people who consider getting into design fit this bill.

But I also clearly remember being impressed with certain logos as a kid and considering how the creators managed to create such recognizable images with such few shapes. being blown away by album artwork and t-shirt designs and silkscreen rock posters and wishing so badly that one day I could make something as awesome as the stuff I found cool.

I went to college for photography at 18 (but took the general art curriculum, including intro to GD) and dropped out after a semester. Then to a trade school for audio engineering — did that ""professionally"" for a few years. Went back to school for Graphic Design at 23. I became a paid design intern at 25 and am now an ACD at 31.

Lots of creative people are drawn to the idea of design because it's one of the few ways to actually make a living doing something ""creative"" — where less than 3% of painters, sculptors, actors, musicians, etc will ever make enough money to support themselves, there's a lot of money being thrown around in design and advertising — enough to feed many a family. That said, I know a lot of folks (some who are ex-designers) who make a respectable salary via other less traditional creative pursuits — baking, crafts, jewelry, custom murals. The world needs these creative people too!

The title of this rant is perhaps a bit much. As a few of you have said, people (creative or otherwise) should dabble in lots of different things before committing themselves to one specific career path (especially with the cost of quality education/software/hardware/etc). Exploring on your own (via the internet, self-initiated projects, libraries) over time is the only way to see if something really interests you enough to make a career of it. "

About START.ac: START.ac is Complete CrowdFunding. Raise cash. Get advice from Mentors. Fund new businesses, products, charities and creative projects. It's not about where you are.  It's about your ability, your team, and how great your idea is.

General Qualifications:
Self Motivated and Hard working
Strong written and verbal communications
Ability to exercise flexibility, initiative, good judgment and discretion
Ability to work well independently as well as part of a team

Not opposed to working long hours sometimes.
Not opposed to working in teams.


If you're interested, PM me and I can get in contact with you and we can get started asap.

Also AMA about Crowdfunding, I guess. Not many people know what it is and it is going to be a booming industry. It's is a really cool concept that will be changing the way people invest in start ups.

EDIT: looking for around 10-15 hours per week and, being a web based company, location is not an issue.

Offering academic credit and the chance to gain extensive experience in business operations as well as opening a doorway for incredible connections. There is also the potential that, once we grow and gain scale, this will turn into a paid internship or part time/full time job.

Not to mention the many cultural and religious differences. We dated for almost the whole 3 weeks I was there (most amazing three weeks for both of us) and then decided to leave it at that, when I went back to my home country as it seemed crazy and not realistic to build a long distance relationship on such a spontaneous, short summer relationship. After I went back, we still talked a couple of times a week, and I couldn´t forget about him. And although we never talked about ""us"", I always hoped that he was still thinking about me too. So after 6 months of almost daily talking via Facebook and sometimes Skype, I decided to fly back to visit him and see what would happen. The moment I rang his door bell...most exciting moment of my life. When he opened the door, he kissed me almost immediately and we continued our relationship from the summer as if the 6 months hadn´t been between it. By this time I had already applied for a 6-months-internship in his hometown (I had to do an internship abroad for my university degree anyway), hoping that - if I could live there for a longer period of time - we could give this great relationship a real shot. Shortly after I left his hometown for the second time, I got accepted for an internship there. The minute I told him, he decided to come visit me in my home country for the first time and that´s the moment we decided to officially and exclusively be a couple. That was April 20th, 2011. Only two months after he visited me, my internship started and following were one of the best 7-months of my life. We are now back at a long distance relationship, but he´ll be moving to my home country in a couple of months and I couldn´t be happier. Had I not decided to fly back to visit him half a year after I had met him, I would have missed out on this amazing relationship. People told me I was crazy and that I didn´t even know this guy, when I decided to visit him again. Even he himself didn´t believe that all of this could ever work.

I'm staying in a hostel in Bellavista. As I understand, this is a good area for clubbing and what not, but I'm also in Chile for an (unpaid) internship and to learn some Spanish.

So, questions...

1. I'm a fashion management major at my college in Toronto... As such, though my internship is based around journalism, I want to discover the Chilean fashion scene (street fashion, high end Vitacura fashion, everything). What would be the best place to start?

2. Phones... I read in another thread that it's apparently near impossible to get prepaid voice and internet... Not a problem. However, which company is going to rape me the least on prepaid data? 

3. Learning Spanish... I don't want to pay for a school. They're expensive and not worth it from what I've heard. What's the best way to go about getting a Spanish tutor and how much should I expect to spend? I'm also a pretty awesome cook, so bartering would be awesome as well.

4. Football/soccer... La U is doing rather well in the Copa Libertadores, and I must see Colo-Colo play. How do you buy tickets to these events?

5. Another soccer related question... Speciality stores. I want the jersey Colo-Colo wore for the last Copa Libertadores with their anthem in the background. As it's not current, I imagine I'll have to go to a speciality store or the Museo de Colo-Colo. Any that you would recommend?

6. Safety... Is a money belt necessary? I'm already picking up a small netbook so I don't have to lug my giant 17 inch laptop around (and it's a Mac... Even more encouraging for snatch and grabbers), but are pick pockets that bad? I'm avoiding this topic on expat forums as they blow everything out of proportion.

Hopefully I can meet up with some Redditors on my 1st &amp; 2nd days there, and get acclimated a bit. The main point of this trip is to gauge if Chile is the kind of place I could live once I get my degree (and to go to a wedding...), so anything else you can recommend I'd love to hear."

I know it depends on the field, but I have many interests and I'd rather not bog this discussion down by getting overspecific.  These are the questions: how much will classes I take after I graduate affect my chances at admission into a good graduate school, or really any graduate school?  If I take three or four (relevant) classes and get all A's, have I improved my chances?  For the record, I have received A's in at least *some* classes every semester for the past two years; my cumulative GPA is pushed down by two Cs (in difficult classes) and a solid B average during my sophomore year.

edit:

I am considering graduate programs in physics or a master's in economics/political economy or a related field.  I have access to excellent recommendations.  I have not engaged in much extracurricular activity at school, but I do have two pretty solid internships under my belt, in addition to Arabic proficiency (not related, really, but hopefully impressive).

Hey LoseIt,

First of all, I just wanted to thank all of the wonderful people in this community who have helped me make this possible. The advice, support, and motivation I find here is indescribably amazing.

Here's a bit of background on me and how I changed my life for the better:

I graduated from college back in May of 2011. Right after graduation, I continued working as a finance intern for a technology company -- long, sedentary hours which left me mentally exhausted at the end of the day. The fatigue was usually so bad that I would just end up eating something frozen or delivered for dinner because I was too burnt out to actually cook something decent for myself. 

That summer is when I discovered r/LoseIt. Seeing all of the wonderful advice being exchanged inspired me to make my first post. At the advice of some amazing Redditors, I began to keep a simple daily log of my weight and everything I was eating. I also started to cook a week's worth of food on the weekend and portion them out into individual meals for the week so that I would have no excuses to eat poorly at the end of the workday. My go-to meal was oven-roasted chicken breast with a heaping helping of mixed vegetables and a small side of quinoa. Lunches usually consisted of salads or homemade chicken/tuna wraps. Also, I ditched my morning bowl of cereal for eggs and vegetables -- kept me so much happier and more satisfied during the day. The difference I saw in my weight, mood, and energy levels even after just one month of eating better was phenomenal. But there was still the pesky matter of exercise -- I was still very out of shape.

Now, exercise and I have a long and tumultuous history (middle school and high school PE, anyone?) I was wracking my brain over the options I had -- gym membership? Yoga? Spin? I didn't know what the hell I was going to do. I then received an e-mail that made it perfectly clear. Groupon -- $39 for 6-weeks of fitness boot camp:

The offer promised highly rigorous 30-minute workouts at 7:00am three to four times per week. I signed myself up and eagerly awaited orientation. When orientation day came (on a Saturday, with class to start on the following Monday), I found myself sitting in a fitness studio with a few dozen fellow Groupon'ers, absolutely befuddled and wondering about this huge mistake I was about to make. I thought to myself, ""In my 4 years at college, I can count the number of times I went to the campus gym on one hand, and I'm about to start something called 'boot camp'?! What the hell am I thinking?"" I spent the rest of that weekend ruminating and trying to think of excuses not to go.

Fast forward to Monday, August 1st. Alarm clock goes off at 5:30am -- thankfully, I'm very much a morning person. I fix myself two eggs and a 1/2 cup of rice, and pack a gym bag for the first time. The ""before"" picture above was taken in the morning right before my first boot camp session.

Now, this particular gym facility is over 5 driving miles from my apartment -- any San Franciscan will tell you that 5 city miles is a voyage. I get to the facility early as instructed, only to see the pained faces of the brave souls from the 6:15am class as they finished their last set of lord-knows-what. I was literally shaking in my gym shorts.

After they finished their warm-down stretches, it was my turn to hit the floor. After a bit of group stretching, it was finally time to begin circuit #1. I'd be damned if I even remember what we did in our very first circuit, because 30 minutes later, I found myself in the bathroom, on the verge of throwing up. It was then that I realized just how out of shape I was.

I managed to get myself over to work and into the showers in our building. I got dressed and headed up to my desk, and fought to stay awake for the rest of the morning. I returned home from work that day absolutely exhausted and wondering if I was gonna make it to another session. I spent all of the next day intermittently popping ibuprofen and trying not to move too much. As much as I was hurting, I was determined to make it on Wednesday morning.

And make it I did. And on Friday. And all three days the next week. And every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for 4 weeks afterwards. Each time, the workouts became easier, and I found myself getting less and less winded after each one. Soon, I was feeling more energetic during the day -- no more 2:30 crash at work. But the good changes didn't stop there. My clothes began to feel more like blankets. I went through each item in my closet individually, and had to say goodbye to so many clothes that had served me well in the past.

Although I loved the boot camp immensely, it was too expensive to continue at a non-discount price. Since then, I made the resolution to be more active in general, and to capitalize on my alumni membership discount for my old campus gym.

While I had slimmed down considerably during 2011, I neglected the importance of strength training, and ended up in the awkward ""skinny-fat"" category. That's when I decided that it was time. for me to hit the weight room. At the recommendation of a friend (who happens to be a personal trainer), I picked up the book [The New Rules of Lifting](http://www.thenewrulesoflifting.com/), and I'm glad that I did. Armed with the knowledge and confidence to hit the weight room for the first time, I started right after the new year. The energy, confidence, and muscle I've built from a few short months of lifting weights has been nothing short of incredible, and I can't stress the importance of strength training enough.

Now that I have lost all the weight I wanted to lose for medical and health reasons, I am now focused on improving my general fitness and physical appearance (as vain as that may be :P). I have shifted my diet to a high-protein, low-fat, adequate-carb approach, maintaining a sufficient caloric deficit in order to further reduce my body fat percentage. My eventual (but lofty) goal is to have visible abs at some point, and I'm determined to get there one way or another.

I am also ridiculously excited to be participating in my first mini-triathlon in two weeks! Something I never thought possible months ago is now the main focus of my efforts.

Lastly, for anyone who is looking to lose weight or get healthy, just remember this: **there is no magic pill, shake, or gizmo that will take the place of clean eating and personal diligence**. It is remarkable to me how quickly the weight came off once I took control over what I was eating. At no point in this journey did I feel starving or deprived -- when you're full on tasty, nutritious, wholesome foods, your body no longer craves the processed junk anymore. Losing the weight and getting fit has simultaneously been the easiest and most difficult thing I've ever done; the diet and exercise is easy, but casting aside all of the self-doubt and excuses was definitely the challenging part. 

Sorry this ended up being such a long post -- I just felt that there was so much to share! I am so honored to be a part of this wonderful community, and I look forward to reading about all of your trials, tribulations, and SUCCESSES!

Cheers,
Dave 

[TL;DR -- Started cooking for myself, eating more nutritious wholesome foods, and became active for the first time of my life. More protein, less starches. Weight came off so easily it's almost ridiculous.]"

He hit on our 26 yr old engaged intern (who got a job after a few months and left). Made comments in our office about her being his girlfriend. Made comments about a female in the student activities office being his girlfriend. Flirted with a female in our organization. She told him to stop and he laughed at her. He's the president of another club. Would bring random people into our office to have business meetings. Didn't do the things he was supposed to in his position on the exec board. I caught him lying. He always blamed other people for everything.

I go to the advisor and talk to the student conduct officer on a thursday. The next day at our meeting five people quit. He steps down from his position but continues going to meetings.

In the other club, he decides to have an event for speed dating. Puts an ad in the newspaper saying that wings is sponsoring it. They aren't and threaten to sue the school. The event never got approved and thus the ad was never supposed to go in the paper. He's friends with the editor in chief of the newspaper.

He decides to run to student trustee. Another candidate discovers guys passing out flyers smearing her name. She asks if the guy send them and one starts to say yes before the other shushes him.

I quit the organization I was in. He's still in it and is still president of the other thing. The results of the winning candidate are not in yet.

Can anything be done? Nobody else went to the advisor out of fear he turn everyone against them and make them look bad."

My partner recently got accepted for an internship at MIT. This is a dream come true for her (and for me, because I'm very proud of her), but now that the excitement is 'wearing off', reality is kicking in.

She's going to stay in Massachusetts for about 3 months. She's never been to the States for this long (we're both European) and the thought of going somewhere new, where she doesn't know anybody, is pretty scary.

Do you guys have any tips for great places where she can socialise and hopefully not feel alone? Bars, cinema's, parks, etc...

Also, since she will be an intern, she can not get a room at the MIT campus (sup with that? ;p). What would be a great way to find a place to stay? We know of craigslist and /r/bostonhousing, but maybe you guys have some interesting tips. As you can imagine, going to a different continent and moving in with someone you haven't met before is kind of scary.

With no previous experience with either Android or Java I set out on the most challenging development journey I had ever ventured. 

Today I released an early version of my app. I'm head over heels excited. Even though this is a small feat for many I can't help but feel a certain amount of pride thinking about actually having a piece of software that I made myself out there, on the market for the whole world to see.

[Here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=lite.ipinion) is a link to my app on Google Play. It's not much and it's practically useless for non-customers but it's given me so much in terms of pure teoretical knowledge, know-how and a general idea of what it's like to develop an entire product from scratch.

I guess the point of this self-post is to simply encourage anyone starting their development career to stick with it and follow whatever path your product may unexpectedly take you through. It's really worth it in the end :)"

My name is Hasan, a 22 year old Tourism student looking for a new challenge. I live in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.

I started studying sociology at the University of Amsterdam in 2008, found it interesting and passed my exams, quit because I didn't see me doing anything with it afterwards. Didn't know what to do after and chose tourism based on my desire to travel. I'm in my final year now and am looking for a 5-month internship in Shanghai, starting in September.

Why Shanghai you say? 

A close friend of mine decided to go to Shanghai to study Mandarin and has been there for almost a year now, I visited him in december and had a blast(without being the usual tourist). We've always been very entrepreneurial together and need to be reunited again:) Above that, I really felt in place in Shanghai.

I don't know whether he is very active on here or not but I met up with redditor 'adt', he can vouch I'm an ok dude!

I think an internship in Shanghai would be beneficial to me on a professional level and provide me with new opportunities, and I'm always looking for new opportunities. 

Reddit, are you or do you know someone that could use a young mind in their (tourism/leisure-related) company? 

My CV is available upon request.

s7qkf,1,2012-04-13,My girlfriend got sexually harrassed by an ex-coworker yesterday and she's talking to the offender today on MSN like nothing ever happened. What do I do?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/s7qkf/my_girlfriend_got_sexually_harrassed_by_an/,"Here's the full story:

Yesterday, my girlfriend had to go back to his old work place to get some internship certificates she needed to graduate. In the middle of that, she runs into one of her old co-workers who had a -major- crush on her (and still has, it seems.). They were good friends, and she told me all about it and how he kept gifting her roses and chocolate when she was doing her internship over there. I was like ""Well, you're being pretty straightforward and honest to me and I appreciate that, you can be friends with whoever you want anyway.""

Well, seems like he got pretty confident about himself yesterday, because he pulled her to a secluded place and ran her against a wall and tried to kiss her. My girlfriend got out of that position, in the meanwhile one of his bosses is walking down their way so she started talking to him normally so he wouldn't get in trouble I guess, I don't know why.

Fast forward today, she tells me everything that happened yesterday (the story above). We started chatting like the lovebirds we usually are until around 3am, since I had to go work early I give her my good night, sleep well etc. But she tells me she'll stay online for a couple more minutes since she's chatting on msn with someone else. I ask her who, out of curiosity?

The ex-coworker.

Naturally, I flip my shit at her asking her how the hell can she still talk to that son of a bitch after what she did to her. Then she literally tells me ""Well he tried to kiss me but he didn't make it, that's what counts right?""

I turned off my pc right away.

Am I overreacting here? She looked pretty surprised that I was mad, but come on, I was already lenient enough about her having him on his contact list even after the repeated attempts to take her away from me. But this is the straw that broke the camel's back.

It's strange because, we spent the whole night talking about our future and all that, I want to believe we're both in love and I don't want to do or say anything that might hurt our relationship without necessity, so that's why i'm asking here.

What do I do?

**Edit:** I might have been a bit extremist with the ""sexually harrassed"" on the post title, I don't know.

I'm in my early 30's, which makes me feel too old at this point.  But better to start doing what I like now, right?  Anyways, I'm taking a C++ course while deciding if I want to go for a BS or MS.  I'm a molecular bio major, which has completely nothing to do with CS.  Anyways, I have a few questions that needs answers in order for me to decide which route I want to take.
1. Does school matter?  I've read somewhere that the drop off is so significant between a school like MIT and Madison that unless this is what I have to choose between, it doesn't matter.  I would love to hear your opinions as it would help a lot with my decision.
2.  MS or BS?  I still need to take a handful of basic computer courses that are required for entry into a Master's program.  I probably have a lot of the gen-eds completed from my previous degree that would also fulfill CS BS requirements .  These required classes would also fulfill a BS requirement as well.  However, for a BS,  I would probably have to take Calc based physics and math beyond Calc 2.  I'm approximating about 2 years for either degree.  I guess my biggest concern is skipping undergrad and all its foundation courses to plunge into a graduate program.
3.  Is there anything else I can do to get a head start?  Time is definitely not on my side so any suggestions, even ""internship, ASAP"" would be wonderful.  I really have no idea where to start except enrolling community college courses.  I had a conversation with someone from work and he suggested looking for collaborative ""open source projects"".  And I found out about project-Eula on reddit, which I will check out after this.  Any other suggestions?

Thanks in advance for your input!

Currently I am in my second year, and will be graduating next year. I am 19 years old

Right now I am very worried because my problem is that I do not have any experience and am not very confident.I have no networks whatsoever. The Big 4 does internships during the summer for students on their second last year of university such as myself. However I did not apply for it this year.

On the side, I am also studying to receive a Japanese diploma. 

My main question is, when I graduate I am thinking of not jumping straight into the accounting field, but instead take a year to teach in Japan as part of a program. 

When this is over, I feel like I will feel more confident and ready to enter into the business world.

Is this a good idea? And will such an experience help me get a job in accounting in the future when I, or will it be too late, as I hear that companies such as the Big 4 like to recruit graduates straight out of university? 
Though i am not saying I Big 4 is my only option, but would working for other firms, e.g. a bank or other companies as an accountant be as good? 

Thank you, I am very inexperienced but very ambitious, so would appreciate any responses!"

Should I follow up? ,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/s7oft/weird_job_interview_response_should_i_follow_up/,"Bit of background: My college program requires the completion of an internship. I'd had one particular place in mind for a Public Relations placement, and after some dogged pursuit, I finally landed an interview as part of their summer internship cycle. 

It was your standard panel interview, with the exception that the other two candidates lined up for the day didn't show. Everything seemed to go great, at the end of the interview and writing assessment, I was told I would hear back in ""a couple of days"" while  they figured out which department was best-suited for each intern's skillset.

This was early last week. I didn't get a call Thursday, didn't expect one Good Friday, didn't hear anything this week. I tried to call the interviewer who'd originally scheduled me, but after failing to reach her twice, I left a voicemail. 

Nothing. 

I arrived home late last night to discover a message left at around 7 PM. It was really... awkward. No other way to describe it. It was from one of the three interviewers, albeit not the one who I'd left the message for.

""Uh, hello, yes, this is X... uh, I first must apologize for the delay in me... I mean... Y... getting back to you... uh... she wanted me to call you... uh... well, you know, we're really short-staffed and... I don't know if we have anyone who could... you know, look after you at this time... (long pause)... and, uh, well, we were looking more for someone who had experience with Z... uh, you know, you have some really great experience with working in the media... but... uh, you know, I talked to a couple departments I thought you might be better-suited for... but... they were short-staffed too... uh, if you have any questions, here's my number.""

The nut of the message is there- I didn't have experience in a particular area they were looking for. But the entire tone was off. For one, why would they go through the process of screening interns if they knew it wasn't possible? The voicemail was also some three minutes long; it honestly sounded like the woman was drunk.

Is there any point in me calling her back? What do I say? "

In 2008 I worked as an intern for a Republican Congressman. I genuinely enjoyed the experience and loved seeing how politics really played out in Washington. My responsibilities primarily were the usual grunt work- answering phones, organizing files, and preparing constituent response letters to be sent (random aside, but most offices have machines that are supposed to fold and seal envelopes- they are a piece of crap and the bain of my first week). After a few weeks as I got more involved in helping with various projects and by the time I ended my internship was placed in charge of more substantive work. 

My political beliefs have changed substantially after my internship and I no longer identify as a republican. Figured I do this AMA to give some insight, albeit limited, on what it's like working in DC and some of the practices I witnessed working with congress.

I am in the middle of taking introductory (Java) programming series at community college (no prior programming experience). I also have applied to my state university's CS program, but it is very competitive and I won't know if I'm accepted until July at earliest. I think these are good first steps, but I really want to be doing more to learn and get experience. I am not really being challenged at all in my programming class. I could (and likely will) learn the rest of the course material within the next week or so. But other than that, what can I do? Learn another language? Try making Android apps? Read more advanced level textbooks? I tend to struggle/lose motivation with learning things on my own because I don't know what to learn next, but I can learn/work extremely quickly if I have some sort of structure to follow or a project to work on.

Another thing I have been thinking about is summer internships. Does already having a bachelor's degree disqualify me from internships? Is it even possible that anyone would hire someone with as little experience as I have? I live in the Seattle area if that's relevant. I know it's unlikely but the sooner I can get experience the better, and being unemployed I have ample time to learn."

It wasn't easy but we got used to it and had something really nice going on. We would see each other roughly every 3 months including winter break and summer vacation. School became more challenging and taxing for us but we still pulled through. She got an internship one summer which kept her from coming home but we still pulled through (I would drive down every now and then). The next summer we BOTH got internships that kept us in our cities but we still pulled through (skype is great)...

So we've conquered various levels of LDR but now I'm facing our biggest challenge yet. She moved to Amsterdam for another 4-month internship (during the semester, for credits). I stayed in Canada for a job offer and to finish school. Now there is a 6 hour time difference between us and it's brutal. We are accustomed to not seeing much of each other but this is ridiculous. When I wake up, she's already busy at work. When I'm at work, she's free to skype/phone. When I'm done work (and classes) I'm free to skype/phone but she's usually fast-asleep. When she wakes up, she has little time to talk as she has to get ready for work. I savour this time, despite it being 2am for me.

So, I just got an email from her saying that she is angry with me, due to the fact that we don't talk much (we've spoken maybe 40 words to each other in the past 3 weeks). She said she doesn't feel like there isn't anything left in this relationship.

Reddit, please advise. I'm caught in a downward spiral of having no time for my girlfriend and not being able to do anything about it.

1. What skills should I try to gain before graduation?

2. Do you have any tips on how to make myself more marketable?

3. How should I go about looking for and applying for jobs? No preference in location (would like to relocate even).
4. What type of position should I am for?
5. Any advice for my cover letter/resume?

Any other advice would be appreciate as well. Thank you in advance everyone, everyone on Reddit has helped me a lot already, just by reading your posts. :)"

There's a hiring freeze which means I won't be able to get an offer. In your opinion, how long should I stay at this internship? It has been a bit longer than 3 months so far. I actually really like the department and the work I'm doing, as well as gaining a lot of experience, but I'd much rather get a full time job. I haven't really been looking elsewhere after I landed this internship, but I think I'm going to start applying again after I finish preparing for my upcoming exam (April 25 so stressed out T_T!! ). However, it appears that almost all of the postings out there seems to be asking for 1-2+ years of experience for entry level jobs. Are there specific actions that you'd recommend? I landed this internship through sending emails to actuaries on the SOA directory (networked with a few more that way), so I may start doing that again. 
Any thoughts/suggestions/recommendations would be welcome. 

Background: B.S. in math, P,FM passed, studying for MFE. Did investment banking internship prior to this actuarial internship.

I have the worst luck with everything.,[deleted],MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/s78e2/everything_in_my_life_is_literally_horrible_i/,"First of all, I'm eighteen and a girl. I'm supposed to start picking colleges soon, but the only problem is I have absolutely no money to pay a deposit. I lost my internship that paid 12 bucks an hour 2 and half months ago and my parents are so poor, we're essentially getting evicted from our house and we have 5 days to find somewhere to live. I got a job and started this week, but the job is about 45 minutes away and my mom is trying to force me to quit because she doesn't feel comfortable with me driving that far and my car has a donut spare tire. I can't get a loan because I need a cosigner and my father's credit is terrible, we can't find another place to live because they keep denying him due to his credit and my mom refuses to work.

My boyfriend of 4 months is really rich and I feel so embarrassed telling him about it. He dropped me off and been to my house before and now we're moving to a dinky townhouse in the ghetto. My job told me I probably won't get my first check until the end of the first week of May, and my college deposit is due on May 1st. If I don't pay it, I'll have to go to community college and I worked *so hard* to pay for my college applications, sat scores and everything because my parents didn't pay for it. The school is pretty prestigious and I want to go so badly. The only thing that makes me happy is the car I worked so hard for, and I'm about to not be able to drive it because my hundred dollar premium is due in ten days and I have no money. In addition to that, my last job listed me as a ""contractor"" for my taxes so now I owe 1200 dollars in back taxes, due the 17th. Everything in my life is pretty much awful, I want to cry, but I look so ugly when I cry. I need help."

s758i,0,2012-04-12,Help me choose a school clinic this summer,[deleted],LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/s758i/help_me_choose_a_school_clinic_this_summer/,"All of the 2L summer internships I got this summer were unpaid, can't get school credit for them, and don't have a reputation for hiring interns after graduation, so I'm leaning towards doing a school clinic for credit this summer. It's close to my home and I get credit towards graduation for doing so. I'll also be able to research for a professor on the side for pocket money. 

The only thing is, I can't decide between two of the clinics. The first is a general practice clinic for indigent clients. Some characteristics of this clinic:
| It is a 45 minute drive away, but my school compensates me for gas AND something like $0.75 per mile for wear on the car.
| General practice, but most covers family issues (divorce, custody, protection from abuse, dependency, etc.)

The other option is an environmental law clinic. 
| Close distance, on campus, about 1 hour walking or 20 minutes by bus.
| Covers land use issues, clean water act cases, etc.

Here's the thing, though. I'm already enrolled in the Environmental clinic for the fall and spring semesters anyways (It's a year long commitment during the academic year). 

So the concerns running through my mind are these: will doing the general clinic (with the Enviro clinic during the year) make me stand out more to employers than committing to three semesters of the Environmental clinic? Would an extra semester of the Enviro not really do much for me in terms of attractiveness or can a case be made that it shows my dedication to that cause?

If the answer to my first question is yes, would the benefit of the general clinic alongside my environmental clinic be worth driving 45 minutes each way and sitting in traffic and all that? 

Should I consider the possibility that I will hate the Enviro clinic, and after a summer in it, will want to drop out for the year, saving me a year of trouble? 

What do you all think? Is there anything else I should be asking myself for making this decision? For what it's worth, if I had my choice, I would love to work in environmental law, but would be happy working in any public interest/non-profit area, and would take anything I can get in any of those fields after graduation. Thanks in advance for your thoughts!"

I am open to males or females. I work at SIS as an intern IT (the only IT they have &gt;.&gt;) and have online classes at Strayer. I have a girlfriend that I have been dating for a little over a year but she lives 2 hours away now so she won't be living with us. I am an avid gamer (mainly Call of Duty recently) and I am quite competetive, in a healthy way of course. NES and SNES bring me back to my favorite classics though. I own the following: Xbox 360, PS3, 3DS, Sega Dreamcast. I play anything and everything. I really love to go bowling or go out and play basketball or something but I don't do much of that because I don't have many friends in the area. I don't smoke or drink at all and I don't want to be around it.

.

I am Agnostic (Christian for about 16 years and now I lean more towards Atheism but I can't rule anything out) and I am very knowledgeable in both views so I can fit in and respect your views. I don't talk about it a lot. I do have fairly high morals that I have kept from the religious background but I have always listened to heavier music and cursed and everything. I am a very calm and laid back type of guy.

.

I have been living in the area for almost a year now. I only have 3 friends that I really talk to anymore and none of them are able to get an apartment right now. I had 2 apartment situations that I got out of and I am now living with my cousins. I don't like living here because they are raising a family and I often feel like I'm intruding.

.

First off I'll explain to you what was up with my apartment situations. I was attending school at DeVry and I got the apartments through them. In the first apartment I had roommates that were pretty douchebaggish. I was able to stand it for a while but then they started smoking weed and getting drunk everyday and the were worse while they were in these conditions. I don't approve of either of those and I couldn't handle living with them so I asked to be moved to a different apartment.

.

In the second apartment everything was fine for a while until I started noticing things coming up missing. It started with small things like a 16 GB SD card that I might not notice. That turned into $50 Christmas week (I had to have a friend give me gas so I could drive home for Christmas...), my class ring, and a laptop. Needless to say I got out of there the week after Christmas when I came back missing those things as well.

.

I was pointed to a set of apartments by another redditor. The price is $395 for a 1 BR and $495 for a 2 BR. The person who linked me there said they pay around $120 a month for utilities. They are about average sized and seem to be pretty nice. I personally have a lot of things that you need in an apartment, all the kitchenware, a bed, a kitchen table/chairs. I have a mini-fridge for the living room and several TVs. I think I can supply a Futon or couch from a family member as well. If you want to check out the listing for the apartment, [click here!](http://www.apartmentfinder.com/Ohio/Columbus-Apartments/Colonial-East-Apartments)

If you are interested shoot me a message. I am actually available to move in any time pretty much."

Anyway, yesterday, a close friend of mine called me at work, panicking, asking if I needed anything, why I didn't tell her, etc., and I was very confused. There were absolutely no problems in my life that merited this level of concern. I asked her to calm down, and tell me why she was making this call. For a moment, she seemed even more confused than I was, until it finally dawned on her. She told me, ""I saw your fiancé with another girl at a restaurant this evening. I thought you guys had broken it off."" I wasn't the least bit concerned, I explained to her that it was probably just a coworker, that I had to work overtime that day, so they probably just went out for a friendly dinner. She then explained that they held hands and kissed during the dinner and in the parking lot. At this, I was stunned. My fiancé has been with me since our freshman year in college, and it was preposterous to me that his faith would ever waver.

I left work immediately, and made it to my apartment as quickly as I could. I demanded an explanation from my fiancé. For a while, he resisted, insisting that he was only meeting a coworker. At this point, I was too scared to think rationally, and began sobbing, telling him I valued our relationship too much, and that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with him. I guess this hurt his conscience, and he confessed to seeing another girl. They've been going out for a couple of months. When I asked him why, he angrily told me that I was never home, that I was always working and going overseas. To be clear, we're both recent graduates, and while he pursues a graduate degree, I was offered a permanent position from my place of internship. I work in consulting, and have been shipped overseas occasionally. However, I believe that I take much of the initiative to spend time together, and he's never brought up my work schedule as an issue before. I've been on this schedule for over a year now. 

Reddit, should I forgive him and make an effort to spend more time together? Or is cheating still cheating, regardless of any excuse he makes? I really need your opinion in this, because he's been such a major component of my happiness outside of my career for such a long time. Even at this point, I cannot fathom what I would do if I lost him.

Edit: Sorry for the verbose post! 

**TL;DR:** Fiancé cheated on me, claiming it's because of my busy work schedule. Should I stay or should I go?

Edit again: Thanks for all the replies! It'll be hard, but I won't let our time together cloud my judgment, and I know there's better out there."

I was raised very conservative, and I was very conservative for most of my life. I grew up pretty privileged--middle-class, white--and had plenty of opportunities to go to college after high school, but for some reason I wanted to be out on my own, self-study, and work to support myself instead of attend college. 

Eventually I ended up working minimum wage jobs during a recession. I was barely scraping by, living in a warehouse, and having trouble even affording food. I worked with so many other smart and capable people with no opportunities to escape poverty. I knew that I could go back to school at anytime and get my parents to help me with expenses, which is what I ended up doing a year later, but these people were really stuck. 

This is when I learned that the system fails so many talented and intelligent people. My political beliefs were based on everyone having relatively equal opportunities to succede, but I learned that chances of success have much more to do with where one started than how hard they work. This realization rocked the core of all of my conservative/libertarian beliefs.

The people I got to know during this time still haunt me. They are probably in the same place right now, while I will make more this summer in an internship than I made during that whole year of working minimum wage jobs. "

Since it is pretty much the norm over here, I'm going on to study for a master's degree in IS (CS master's are hard/impossible to get into with my bachelor's, especially because it is low on math) and want to use the two years this will take to move over to the programming side of things.
What are some steps you would recommend? I am working on the SCJP certification and am planning to get at least three programming internships in before the end of my next degree as well as to take as many technical classes as possible (and IS degrees are often significantly more technical here than in the US, with the sad exception of my bachelor's degree). I also know a programming language specific to a certain large German ERP software product.
Is my best bet to get as much personal and open source programming experience as possible? Are there even any ""enterprise"" open source projects (as that is the area my IS degree may help a bit in)? Are Java EE, multiple other Java frameworks, .NET and ABAP (SAP) good choices for areas to build skills in?"

A person with 3/5 years experience of studies can much easier get a job than a person with 20 years of experience in the workfield (I know that this might not be true in all cases, but I hope you get the gist). I have a relative that started as a trainee and now he's the CO for three companies, he did that with no education at all. That rarely happens these days. 

Of course some occupations, like doctors, really need it, but even them say that they learn more their first few months of work than all their years studying. Personally I think that society would function a lot better if people got the chance to maybe combine their educations with an internship (with a minimun wage or something) so that they could get more REAL experience.

If anyone could tell me what they think, it'd be a lot easier to get it all started :)

",its-never-lupus,ask,https://www.reddit.com/r/ask/comments/s94f0/is_it_possible_for_someone_to_be_so_naturally/,"It all started when the hospital I work at got this new nurse intern. On the outside, he seems like a normal guy, but after being around him for awhile... something felt amiss.

Im asking you Reddit for two reasons.

1. He came to me upset asking for advice.
2. My sister said something to me at her wedding. ""Be the change you want to see in the world.""

Lemme list some things about him that may be it..

- He's quiet.
- According to some of the female nurses, some think he looks good.
- He can be sarcastic and cynical at times, but its rather funny. (I happen to be the same way.)
- He smiles a lot.
- He may not have any self esteem or be socially awkward. (Im not sure because he is never down on himself nor acts like he is confident.)
- He seems tired all of the time and sometimes comes across lazy.
- He seems like he doesnt like to talk to people because its a waste of time. Either that or hes not comfortable with it.
- Hes really nice.. always willing to scrub in on mundane slice and dices.

Really.. the list goes on and on.. but I think he may be super average. Doesnt stand out. 

Thanks Reddit, I need advice for him. I want to be able to save a life emotionally and not just through medicine.

PS: If anyone has any questions, I can shed more light."
s92sm,1,2012-04-14,Undergraduate political science student looking for clarification on just about everything about consulting,[deleted],consulting,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/s92sm/undergraduate_political_science_student_looking/,"I am a current Political Science student (with a focus on International Relations) at McGill University. I'm around the time where I want to start looking into my possible employment opportunities, consulting being one of those fields.

First of all, consulting is such a vague term, and I wouldn't mind getting a short line or two just describing what it is you DO as a consultant, maybe just what a typical day looks like. I understand case studies are an important part of the job, are there any good sources for these?

Secondly, as somebody who has a great deal of knowledge within International Affairs on a wide variety of subjects including terrorism, the Middle East, and the study of the causes conflicts and peace-building, I am curious as to if there are any ways I could contribute that knowledge to consulting. Are there any specific types of consultants, or companies, that have some relation to these kinds of topics? I understand Booz-Allen performs this kind of work, but they require me to be a US citizen so I can get a security clearance (which may end up being my goal within the future). Are there any organizations similar that may not require those kinds of prerequisites, so I can get some experience while I wait to get my citizenship? Are there companies similar to the level of Booz-Allen that perform outside of North America, such as in London or Paris (in which case I would strive for citizenship there if required)?

Finally, I am interested as to what kind of skills, qualifications and experience I require if I wish to find employment in the industry. Alongside my major, I am also minoring in Economics and Chemistry (which I majored in for 1.5 years prior to switching into Political Science). I plan to attend UBC for my Master's in Political Science. I am also fluent in French, and plan on acquiring a basic/intermediate knowledge of Java, Python, and HTML within the next 2 years on my own time. With these things in mind, are there any other extra skill sets you suggest I acquire? What consultant jobs/companies would best suit my current skill set? What kind of internship experience should I get? If my goal is to find work preferably in America or somewhere else abroad, would you recommend I attend a different school for my Masters?

The answers to my questions and any other information or links to good sources of information would be greatly appreciated. Thanks a lot."
s920g,2,2012-04-13,"My friend's belongings were stolen from my car. What other kinds of bad luck did Redditors have today, on Friday the 13th?",SoundVU,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/s920g/my_friends_belongings_were_stolen_from_my_car/,"Today, my friend and I were discussing headphones in our office. He's an international student, completing an internship here in the U.S. I recommended a pair of headphones to him, and offered to take him to Fry's Electronics to try them out. He has no car, and trying them before buying would be preferable.

So we drive off to Fry's Electronics. In the parking lot, he takes his backpack and jacket, and puts it in my trunk. Off we go and browse around the store. We leave, and I take my friend back to the lightrail station to drop him off. I pop my trunk for him to get his stuff. Through my rear view mirror, I can see him pausing in confusion. He asks me, ""Is this come kind of prank?"" I am confused at this point. I get out of the car, and we both look on in shock and surprise at an empty trunk. Someone had taken his backpack and jacket from my trunk. I had a two toolbox sets in the trunk as well, but that wasn't taken. The backpack contained a changed of clothes and my friend's laptop - the laptop being the most valuable thing in there. We both stare at each other with a WTF-look on our faces. Neither of us could understand how the trunk was accessed if the doors were still locked.

I take him to the police station to file a report, but it was closed. One of the officers exiting the building instructed us to file a report online. With that, I take my friend home. On the way, we dropped by a nearby restaurant for dinner. I thought it was the least I could do to make up for the shitty day. My friend was down about losing his belongings, but I have to commend him for not letting it get to him.

So Redditors, what kind bad luck did you encounter today?



P.S. - Does anyone know if I need to file a police report as well? Nothing from my car was stolen. And is there anything I can do that might improve the chances of recovering my friend's belongings?"
s90vd,1,2012-04-13,Need career advice. Company A or Company B?,SdotM0USE,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/s90vd/need_career_advice_company_a_or_company_b/,"I'll try to make this as short and sweet as possible. 

I am 23 years old, graduated with my bachelors in information systems this past December. 

For the past 2 years I have worked part time in the IT department at a small-ish (300 employees, 6 people in IT department) non profit that helps out people with disabilities. I did basic desktop support, active directory, setting up projectors simple stuff mainly. Very friendly environment, get time off as I please, though there is nobody else my age there (closest is probably 26 year old girl that is just eh :/ looking), and I work in a different location from the other IT people , so it can get lonely some days.

When i graduated I was applying for jobs at all of the large, local companies, and I didn't have much luck. There was one company in particular, Company A, we will call them, that i really wanted to end up at. They have an amazing work environment and are known throughout the nation as a leading tech company in their field. The only way to get into Company A right out of school is through an summer internship. I applied and got turned down.

Shortly after (a month ago) I got offered a full time job (although I am technically a contractor, which I don't care for because of the lack of benefits) at the non-profit I have been at for two years. I accepted! I got a bump in pay from $12/hour to $17.50/hour and 40 hours/week. I get increased duties (while keeping all of the old still), even some **very** basic information system stuff. I figure I'll work during the summer make some money, start working on my masters in the fall by taking night classes at a nearby university. Also, this job is 15 minutes from my house.

Then I get a call and a job offer today from Company A, and that they have a new technology internship opening that does pretty entry level stuff (inventory, setting up stations, swapping machines, swapping phones, some active directory stuff). It pays $11/hour and is full time, but only 3 months long. Again, this is a ""cool"" company to work for. They treat you to sporting events, would look great on my resume. Only thing is after the internship is over, there is no guarantee that I would get hired into the company. Also, this job is an hour drive, each direction.

Do I take the internship and risk not having a job at the end of the summer?

Or

Do I stay where I am now?

Need to make a decision by Monday!

**TL;DR**: Company A is a large growing ""cool"" tech company that I want to work for someday. I would be a tech intern doing really simple stuff and would have no guarantee at the end of the summer that I could get hired into the company. Hour drive to work, hour drive home. $11/hour pay.

Company B is smaller non profit company that I am comfortable at, but work is sometimes slow. I am just getting into some work that is what I am interested in, though it is just baby steps. No room to grow as its a small company. $17.50/hour pay, no benefits. 15 minutes from my house.

Which one do I pick??

If you made it this far, thank you! If not, I think typing all of this out and re-reading it is helping me with my decision, so thank you again!

So much for short and sweet :P"

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[I live in a somewhat poor neighborhood and hear horror stories form some of the teachers I know. I can't imagine how bad it is in New York with the population. What's the craziest thing a youngster has done that you would think only a life life long criminal would do or say?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7xou/i_taught_at_the_worst_lowest_performing/c4bt68a?context=5)|We had some really disturbed kids that are basically already criminals, ie 3rd graders dealing drugs (yes, seriously). There were kids that not just beat other kids up but basically tried to kill another kid before a teacher pulled them off. There was a kid who made it up to the roof and threatened suicide once.
 |The kids that really scared me though were the ones with sociopath behaviors like a 4th grader who bit another teacher on the ankle for no apparent reason and would sit quietly in class pointing a fake gun at other kids. Scary stuff.
[Honest opinion:  Think those kids will grow up to be a benefit to society?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7xou/i_taught_at_the_worst_lowest_performing/c4bt9r7?context=5)|Honestly no, I don't think so. Poverty acts in a cycle.
[What kind of drugs are kids selling to each other in third grade?!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7xou/i_taught_at_the_worst_lowest_performing/c4c0as6?context=5)|Pot.
[*sociopath.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7xou/i_taught_at_the_worst_lowest_performing/c4bu44n?context=5)|That particular child had been in and out of mental health hospitals for a number of reasons. I mentioned the biting because it was so unusual. The unusual things were, in my opinion, the most difficult to deal with most of the time. Sure, teachers often suspect kids have this or that wrong with them but most schools, at least around here, have a school phycologist to take care of the diagnosing part.
[Sunds like a kid acting out to me, is it common for people in your profession to diagnose the children under your care with mental or social problems and does that have an impact on how you treat the children in your care?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7xou/i_taught_at_the_worst_lowest_performing/c4bu44n?context=5)|Of course it impacts how we treat them! Kids like that need a lot more supervision and need to be talked with differently. 
[So what do you think should be done with them?  What benefit does the school bring to their lives?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7xou/i_taught_at_the_worst_lowest_performing/c4btkb1?context=5)|I hope my previous responses didn't people to think that school is ""pointless"". I just don't think it's THEE answer for getting kids out of poverty. It's part of the answer. They need a stable home or a good mentor and school.
[An emotionless response to this would be: if nothing of benefit will come from expending the resources, redirect the resources to something that will produce a benefit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7xou/i_taught_at_the_worst_lowest_performing/c4btkb1?context=5)|For many of the kids, school is the only safe and stable place they have. Imagine if they didn't even have that. 
[How do you reach those kids?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7xou/i_taught_at_the_worst_lowest_performing/c4btako?context=5)|It wasn't easy :-)
[That is a pretty poor answer for an AMA.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7xou/i_taught_at_the_worst_lowest_performing/c4btf61?context=5)|Guess i took the easy way out there because there's so much to it.
 |Basically, I just tried to set really clear and high expectations. The kids know when you think poorly about them. I know that they were capable of what suburban kids could do so i pushed them to do it. Those high expectations were probably the best way I ""reached"" them.
[Possibly you were the first to beleive in them, help them and set clear boundaries?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7xou/i_taught_at_the_worst_lowest_performing/c4btqh9?context=5)|The other teachers I worked with were very talented, many of whom believed in them :-)
[What kind of changes would you propose in order to help the students in that situation the most?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7xou/i_taught_at_the_worst_lowest_performing/c4btatt?context=5)|Besides mandatory abortion? ;)
 |Smaller class sizes is the biggest thing. You can't teach with 30 kids in a room, particularly kids from this area.
 |The state is pumping money into those school left and right. I worked with an amazing staff of very dedicated and talented teachers yet our test schools did not improve. parenting is really the biggest issue though.
[At the risk of sounding moronic, can you clarify the mandatory abortion comment? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7xou/i_taught_at_the_worst_lowest_performing/c4bw6g9?context=5)|It was really a joke that I guess wasn't taken too well. So much for dark humor?  In truth though, I have witnessed so many kids who are abused and neglected. I know a lot of people with disagree with this, but there's got to be some action taken at the source, ie birth control. Is it really Ok for some people to pop out like 10 kids and take no responsibility for them? Look, I have no idea how it would actually look in society, but I do believe some type of control over who's having kids needs to be in place. However, for all the people who had a heart attack about my comment, I do not actually believe that girls should be given mandatory abortions. 
[I was talking to someone yesterday who said that poverty in America doesn't really exist - in that even the poor will generally still own plasma TVs and other mod cons. What would you say to that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7xou/i_taught_at_the_worst_lowest_performing/c4bu8ig?context=5)|They had very nice electronics. 5th grade kids with iphones and nike sneakers but somehow still needed to get free lunch.
 |Poverty definitely exists but maybe not in the same way other countries see it. I think for the USA it's a lack of education and high crime. I think americans in poverty feel entitled to the same things that every one else has, despite not having a job, etc. 
[1\) Is there any way the teachers could REALLY change anything longterm?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7xou/i_taught_at_the_worst_lowest_performing/c4bt3ca?context=5)|There are some very talented teachers but I think what most people don't realize is that teachers only have one year with a kid. That's not a ton of time.  For a kid to get out of poverty, they need to have a mentor type figure through out most of their child hood or have some huge talent like music or sports. That is how teachers will really make a change and there are teachers who stay with the kids even after they leave their particular class.
[2\) Most awesome child you teached?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7xou/i_taught_at_the_worst_lowest_performing/c4bt3ca?context=5)|I had a ton of great kids! As a music teacher, it was the really talented ones that stand out of the most for me. I had one kid who I'm sure is going to end up as a star some day. Damn it! didn't get his autograph before I left! haha.
[What if the school had the teacher s move with the kids? Teach 1st grade this year, second grade next year and so on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7xou/i_taught_at_the_worst_lowest_performing/c4bumqq?context=5)|Actually, that's *sort of* the format of the school. the kids will be with the same teacher for 2 years in a row. I'm sure it helps. However, there's two big flaws here. 1. teachers would have to be trained in a new grade level curriculum every year and 2. if a kid/parent of didn't mesh well with a teacher they're s.o.l. for their whole schooling. furthermore, what if you get the shitty teacher and you're stuck with them for like 8 years. I like the idea a lot but it would need some serious thinking through before being put into action.
[What did you think of ""Waiting for Superman""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7xou/i_taught_at_the_worst_lowest_performing/c4btgs6?context=5)|It's been a while since watching it but I remember needing to turn it off half way through haha. A lot of Moore's info is really biased and inaccurate. 
[Do you mean Moore as in Michael Moore? I haven't seen it but I didn't think he had anything to do with that movie and he isn't listed in the credits anywhere on imdb.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7xou/i_taught_at_the_worst_lowest_performing/c4bub82?context=5)|My bad.. like I said it's been a while since I've watched the movie.
[What subject do you teach? and what grade?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7xou/i_taught_at_the_worst_lowest_performing/c4btcfg?context=5)|Music k-5.
[What is the easiest thing the school could change to cause a big improvement in childrens grades.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7xou/i_taught_at_the_worst_lowest_performing/c4btcfg?context=5)|Smaller class sizes.
[Have u had any students under you progress from bad performance to good performance? if u can give details.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7xou/i_taught_at_the_worst_lowest_performing/c4btcfg?context=5)|I had students improve in music, but you know, not that big of a deal. Sorry I can't answer that one like maybe a classroom teacher would.
[What are some easy ways parents can help in the process of students learning? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7xou/i_taught_at_the_worst_lowest_performing/c4btcfg?context=5)|I think having consistency at home is the biggest thing. So many of the kids lived in really chaotic households. How can you learn like that?
[I can re-emphasize that smaller class size deal. I'm an English teacher (9th- 10th grade\) and have between 40-45 students per class. Try grading and giving feedback to written assignments, especially essays, with those numbers. It is ludicrous. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7xou/i_taught_at_the_worst_lowest_performing/c4c9kvc?context=5)|Yea, I wouldn't want to read 45 9th grade essays ever! thanks for your hard work :-)
[Proof?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7xou/i_taught_at_the_worst_lowest_performing/c4btg20?context=5)|Pic of my old classroom with the kids... blurred out their faces and now they look like they don't have heads lol.

[Looks a lot nicer than I imagined, only 6 kids per classroom?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7xou/i_taught_at_the_worst_lowest_performing/c4btv0d?context=5)|Haha! I wish! the other 20 are sitting out of the pic.
[26 isn't bad! i am lucjy enough to grow up in a smaller town with lots of schools, max 30 when i graduated grade 12, less than that as i went through the grades.. but i hear of some classes in denser areas wup to 45-50.  How big is your school? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7xou/i_taught_at_the_worst_lowest_performing/c4cabq6?context=5)|About 500 kids total between k-5. yea, 45-50 is nuts. I can't even imagine!
[Have you watched Season 4 of The Wire and if so how accurate is their depiction of inner city teaching? Did your school's administration use or recommend techniques like keeping the windows closed or turning up the heat to make the students less disruptive in class?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7xou/i_taught_at_the_worst_lowest_performing/c4btf0m?context=5)|Haha no we didn't use those techniques :-)
[What made you wanna become a teacher? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7xou/i_taught_at_the_worst_lowest_performing/c4bt8un?context=5)|One of my teachers, as a kid. I also wanted to do something with music. It seemed like the right path. I love it.
[Was there a specific reason you left? Couldn't take it? Found a better job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7xou/i_taught_at_the_worst_lowest_performing/c4btck9?context=5)|The district was eliminating a huge % of the staff because of budget cuts (of course!) I thought I was going to lose my job so I applied else where and got lucky. Turns out I didn't get let go from the city schools but decided to take the better opportunity anyways.
[What is the teacher attrition rate? Is there anything redeeming about the situation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7xou/i_taught_at_the_worst_lowest_performing/c4btbme?context=5)|A lot of teachers leave after a few years. Hey, I did.
 |There are success stories with the kids. It's not all bad. Even minor improvements in kids behavior and academics are good to see 
[What laws could our government make to improve the situation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7xou/i_taught_at_the_worst_lowest_performing/c4btezm?context=5)|I wish parenting laws would be put in place but I don't see it happening. That would cause huge change. Other than that, making class sizes smaller is really the biggest thing.
[How many teachers in the school district and at your particular school have been there for so long that they are apathetic to the plight and genuinely don't care, thus contributing to the low performance of the students? If this isn't a large phenomenon, what would you say the main reason for the low performance? Students simply don't care?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7xou/i_taught_at_the_worst_lowest_performing/c4bv61n?context=5)|Just a guess but I would say about 10% are the really apathetic, shitty teachers, 70% are average to good and 20% are really excellent within the district. My school had more really excellent teachers, I believe.
 |Yes poor teaching is contributing factor but certainly not the main cause of kids ""not caring"" or performing low.
 |The main cause for low performance is parenting and living in a culture that doesn't value education. There are kids that graduate from this district and go on to ivy league who are in class with kids that drop out at 15. The ivy leaguers had the same teachers as the dropouts. 
[What makes you call it deplorable?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7xou/i_taught_at_the_worst_lowest_performing/c4bt5zi?context=5)|Don't know a ton about it, but from what i hear they hire teachers with little or no training and put them in the worst schools. They also don't really get paid because TFA takes care of their student loans.  
[No, they do get paid a regular salary direct from the school. And TFA doesn't pay anything, they get the Americorps stipend which they can put towards loans ($5000 per year for two years\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7xou/i_taught_at_the_worst_lowest_performing/c4btdl7?context=5)|Good to know! Thanks for clarifying.
[What did you learn the most?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7xou/i_taught_at_the_worst_lowest_performing/c4bt9ib?context=5)|As a teacher,  I learned classroom management skills. I work in the ""burbs"" now and never really have any issues because I basically dealt with every possible situation I could have.
 |As a person, I have a way thicker skin 
[Sorry if this is cynical, but do you believe a lot of the kids are simply beyond help?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7xou/i_taught_at_the_worst_lowest_performing/c4bty5j?context=5)|The teacher in me says ""No, everyone can be helped!"" but the pessimist in me is saying ""fuck it, what more can we do for them?""
[In high school, my administration cycled through five different principles before I graduated. How much is the atmosphere in a school affected by the way the administration presents itself and handles conflict resolution in  a school like that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7xou/i_taught_at_the_worst_lowest_performing/c4bv5mr?context=5)|It makes a huge impact to have a great administrator. We were very lucky to have 1 excellent principal and 2 excellent vice principals. As a teacher, it helped me do my job properly to know that I had those people backing me up which of course has an affect of the kids.
 |Sad to see schools that don't have the same support.
[This wasn't through the deplorable TFA program, was it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7xou/i_taught_at_the_worst_lowest_performing/c4bt567?context=5)|Nope although I would be nice to have some of my loans paid for :-)
[What are your thoughts on No Child Left Behind?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7xou/i_taught_at_the_worst_lowest_performing/c4bsznp?context=5)|There are constantly children left behind! Schools are much more affected by Obama's Race to the Top now. I didn't start teaching until 2008 so I can't speak on NCLB as much. I can say that there is a huge emphasis on test taking now which is certainly not the best thing for kids. We had a disgusting percentage of failing kids, according to state tests. The testing was not a true reflection of their learning or the quality of the teaching. In all, I would have to say education reforms are not thought through or carried out well.

[What was your best and worst experience with parents?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7xou/i_taught_at_the_worst_lowest_performing/c4bvfjn?context=5)|Honestly, my best experiences have been with parents in my new school in the suburbs.  Generally speaking, The parents in the one I'm talking about in this thread were basically nonexistent in the school. There are a select few who are very nice people. But even at concerts and such, most parents didn't really show up.  The times when I felt the worst about parents was when I would do something way outside my job duties like drive them to an event and they wouldn't even give a simple thank you. 
[I see that you're a music teacher. Do you think the music these kids listen to influences their ""bad"" behavior?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7xou/i_taught_at_the_worst_lowest_performing/c4btavp?context=5)|No way.
[Expound.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7xou/i_taught_at_the_worst_lowest_performing/c4bumw8?context=5)|They learn those behaviors way earlier then when they pick up that music. I teach elementary so i think most of them probably didn't even know what it meant.
[What city are you in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7xou/i_taught_at_the_worst_lowest_performing/c4btoj7?context=5)|Syracuse.

However, there were definitely some people on their last leg. One in particular that called the kids ""stupid"" and another that cried a little too regularly in front of the kids. 
[""cried a little too regularly""  What would you call a reasonable frequency for crying in front of students?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7xou/i_taught_at_the_worst_lowest_performing/c4bwmeu?context=5)|Lol true.
[What the worst example of humanity you've seen so far?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7xou/i_taught_at_the_worst_lowest_performing/c4bv0jp?context=5)|Sooooo many parents. It's pretty awful to see how many of them speak in front of their kids or come in to school ""dressed"" to pick their kids and that's just from my personal interactions with them. Imagine how it is at home.
 |I also witnessed a lot of fights in the neighborhood driving to and from work.
[Wouldn't  you agree that everybody has their own maximum level that they can learn at their given age? I mean, not every student or person is create equal as it relates to how much you can teach them. Everyone has their ""limits', right?  Also, would you agree that economics play an very important role in a student or a person in general success or failure in class. Generally, kids with financial resources do better than children with less money?  I am for webcams in classrooms so that parents/guardians can monitor their children at school, as well as their their teachers, would you agree?  How has technology affected your ability to teach your children?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7xou/i_taught_at_the_worst_lowest_performing/c4bvr7q?context=5)|Of course, everyone has their own limits but we try to push it to the max :-) Economics is HUGE but I don't think it's about the resources you get with having money like a computer or whatever. i believe there is a culture related to poverty and part of the culture is a lack of respect for education. I can see the web cam thing getting way out of hand. Some parents can be a little nutty things like that. I would have to see it in action to know. Technology is great! It's an awesome resource. I had a smartboard in my old classroom and used it all the time. It helps keep things interesting for the kids and helps me to be a little more creative with lesson plans. 
[Any of your students pregnant already?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7xou/i_taught_at_the_worst_lowest_performing/c4by0p2?context=5)|I've seen a few with kids actually but it was from when i taught middle school in '08.
[I've always wondered what things are like at a failing metropolitan school. I teach at one of the lowest-performing high schools in Mississippi and we have VERY little oversight.

I believe the school has another 2 years to improve or it will be closed.
[Did you get any training on the effects of trauma on children and their ability to learn, concentrate, behave etc.?

Yes, I could be open to anything that helps me improve my teaching.
[I just watched the movie 'Precious', and this post reminded me of the classroom there. Was your school anything like that?  On another note, what's the average teacher salary for a NYC metro area teacher?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7xou/i_taught_at_the_worst_lowest_performing/c4bx5uz?context=5)|I taught elementary, so not really.

[How hard was it to get a job there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7xou/i_taught_at_the_worst_lowest_performing/c4bz7yz?context=5)|I was already working within the district so it wasn't but in general it's not easy to get a job as a teacher in Ny right now.

[Have you learned anything (beyond teaching\) from your experience with these children?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7xou/i_taught_at_the_worst_lowest_performing/c4c1913?context=5)|I learned a lot about the way the world works. You can always read about poverty but being a part of it is a totally different experience. I learned why people succumb to things like crime, drugs, etc. It also made me have a greater tolerance to petty shit that I thought were problems. I definitely appreciate what I have more.
[Did you teach at one of the current ""bottom 10""? - Link to www.schooldigger.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7xou/i_taught_at_the_worst_lowest_performing/c4btt1x?context=5)|Yup, the worst one.
[I have a friend who is doing her internship at a low income school. she's always complaining about how the school sucks and it really bothers me because I imagine that it's a whole set of problems they're dealing with.

[I see you are a music teacher like myself. How did you approach teaching music to the students? Did you use any methods or did you develop your own? Can you give us an idea of what a typical lesson looked like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7xou/i_taught_at_the_worst_lowest_performing/c4bty8i?context=5)|Awesome to see another music teacher here! I'm Orff certified but use a lot of kodaly also.
 |A typical lesson? play a singing game for them to hear the song over and over with out using teaching by rote. Then I might teach them a dance that goes a long with it. Then we'll probably figure out the rhythm or solfege of parts of the song. Next I'll have them begin learning how to accompany themselves on that song using Orff instruments.

I don't think teachers would be paid as well as they are with out it and that's certainly important. This is a really tough question...sorry, the best way I can answer is ""kind of""
[How would you change the system so that teachers have the ability to actually make a difference?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7xou/i_taught_at_the_worst_lowest_performing/c4btrxn?context=5)|They're working on rewards for better teaching in New York right now. I think that will help a lot. Like I said a bunch of times in this AMA, small class sizes is the biggest thing.
[Were you always hopeful?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7xou/i_taught_at_the_worst_lowest_performing/c4bzhqn?context=5)|I was always hopeful that the kids would improve and that I would become a better teacher. teaching in that environment made me very pessimistic about society, though.

[Do you think you'd see better results if the school and classes were smaller and had more social services and support services available for the students? I only taught public school for a few years but that's what I came away with.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7xou/i_taught_at_the_worst_lowest_performing/c4btrs4?context=5)|Yes definitely smaller class sizes. There seemed to be a lot of free services offered to the kids like counseling, after school programs, etc.

I guess that's why I'm not there any more. There were many times in which the students behavior was really awful and I felt like I had no control to teach properly. There were also plenty of great moments, too :-)
[How many hours per week would you say you spend on teaching/preparing/grading etc. in and out of school? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7xou/i_taught_at_the_worst_lowest_performing/c4btp6t?context=5)|Maybe 8 or 10... sometimes a lot more depending on the week.

[I'm a sped major and I keep hearing that low income schools have higher rates of students with special needs, yet get less funding for those individuals' needs (e.g. OT, sensory tools, students aides\). Is this true?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7xou/i_taught_at_the_worst_lowest_performing/c4c1f7m?context=5)|There's definitely a higher rate of sped in the city compared to the burbs. In my experience between this particular city school and the school I work in now, there is a big difference in sped services. The kids in my suburban school are offered a lot more. There seemed to be many kids in the city who got pushed through the system because you couldn't place them into the exact box that is required for them to get a specific service. It was really sad to see 3rd graders who couldn't write their name but were placed in reg ed. I can't speak on the exact numbers of funding.
[What was your upbringing like? Why did you decide to teach at this school when you believe most of the kids won't achieve anything in life?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7xou/i_taught_at_the_worst_lowest_performing/c4c68yx?context=5)|I didn't said most of the kids won't achieve anything in life.

Anyway, what was YOUR upbringing like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7xou/i_taught_at_the_worst_lowest_performing/c4c84ok?context=5)|That's OK. I grew up in the suburbs in a middle class family. My parents were divorced when I was kid... all pretty average stuff.

s8xtz,0,2012-04-13,"Feedback? New here, new to writing. ",FxtrtUnfrm,writing,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/s8xtz/feedback_new_here_new_to_writing/,"Hello Reddit. Below is the beginning of a short story I'm working on. I've recently become interested in writing as a creative outlet since I get no such satisfaction from my work. I'm looking for any feedback. Since I'm just getting into this I would like to avoid getting in to any bad habits. The story is about a man who can dig into and influence peoples minds. He sells this talent/service to individuals looking to influence politics. 

---------------------------------------------

The guy in front of me stepped away and the security guard suspiciously looked me over.  I got a little nervous.  It happens every time.  Are they going to see through my phony invite and identification?  Then the real questions would start.  The who’s, what’s, when’s, where’s and why’s.  None of which I felt inclined to answer.

I took a cautious step forward and presented my invite.  The guard grabbed it and looked it over.  It was painfully obvious he was looking close, but more so concerned with the appearance of it.  I smiled and took it back when he handed it to me.  What a clown.

The guard told me to raise my arms and spread my feet and proceeded to pat me down.  My palms were sweating a little.  I never carry anything on me, but getting through security is always the toughest part of the job.  When you’re up to no good you think everybody around you has some kind of sixth sense about it.  All this time and I still succumb to a little paranoia here and there.  When he finished I shook his hand and thanked him for good measure.  Contact made, his mind was open and I peaked inside. It was cluttered and unfocused, the connections were a mess, but I found what I was looking for.  No issue, all he cared about was when he got off shift.  He probably forgot my face as soon as the next guy stepped forward and handed him their credentials.

The guard waved me on and I left my anxiety behind at the checkpoint.  I stepped through the open double doors into the foyer and the party was in full swing.  I smiled again.  It seemed so cliché, waiters in tuxedos carrying glasses of expensive wine on a silver platter.  Those people do love their opulence, don’t they?  I grabbed a glass as a waiter floated by.  No sense in being the only person in the room without a drink, right?

I surveyed the crowd.  The sooner I spotted my target the sooner I could make an exit.  The mansion was big, but I had a feeling it wouldn't be too hard to locate my target.  Off the foyer to my left was a large sitting area filled with couches, chairs and other butt-holding instruments.  Directly in front of me was a staircase with an ornate banister, gold trimmed and spared no detail.  To my right was the busiest room in the house.  The bar was packed from wall to wall and the bartenders moved with speed and grace to fill orders as fast as they could.

I decided to head left into the sitting area.  I imagined that my target would be just as enthusiastic as I was about the prospect of pushing my way into the crowd at the bar.  Besides, he probably had some lacky intern at his beck and call to fetch his drinks for him.  The guests adorning the furniture were contributing to a dull roar.  It was hard to make out any specifics, only words plucked from the air here and there.  As I moved deeper into enemy territory I could hear the soft call of piano music.  It was slow, but melodic, carrying a deep sense of emotion.  My curiosity peaked and I sought to discover the source.

I turned the corner and spotted my target.  The Senator sat, dressed in a black business suit, behind the piano.  Surrounded by an awestruck crowd the room was still, his practiced movements the only source of motion.  I took a spot in the back of the room. I would have to wait until this performance was finished before I could get in close and make contact.  

As the song began to display the tell-tale signs of winding to a close I began to plan contact.  Some targets in the past have been easier than others.  Sometimes, though rare, they have taken steps to limit physical contact.  This presents a unique challenge, one that often involves one of those ""Oh, I tripped. Thanks for catching me.""-type moments.  If I was lucky the Senator would be in full politician-mode, schmoozing, meeting and greeting to the fullest extent.  The music had stopped; I would soon find out.

The Senator rose from the bench to raucous applause and gave a small bow.  His mouth was forming ""thank you's"", but I couldn't hear them.  He moved into the crowd and began shaking hands, this was my chance.  I repositioned myself into his path and acted the part of an admiring constituent.  

""Senator,"" I said. ""That was beautiful""

The Senator shuffled near with his hand out and I grabbed it.  He felt my grip and turned to lock eyes with me, his mouth smiling, but his eyes calm and unaffected.  There it was!  My mind flooded with foreign images, memories and thoughts of a man well exceeding me in age.  It was overwhelming at first, as it sometimes is.  His mind was so much more structured and disciplined than the security guard, the difference was as stark as day and night.

Right now, I'm just thrilled to be employed and paid decently, and the job is sort of in my field, which is even better. However, it's pretty boring and has about zero room for advancement. I want to be an editor, and right now I'm working in the editorial department for an academic journal, but all I really do is send form letters - no actual editing. The editors all have advanced degrees (in a field I'm not particularly interested in), and copyediting is a completely separate department - which might be a good horizontal move at some point, but it seems like people don't move horizontally much in this organization.

I feel like in a different economy I could have ended up as an assistant editor somewhere. I interviewed for a couple positions like that but was always told I didn't have enough experience. I think I'll be able to make this position look good on my resume so that I can land something like that in the future. However, I'm just wondering how long I should be staying in this position. I'm concerned because my resume already has several short-term positions like internships, retail positions, etc. that lasted about 2-3 months each, although I did have two part-time jobs in college that lasted 1.5 and 3 years, respectively. How long should I stay here? Is one year too little time? Two years? I'm definitely not looking for anything else at the moment, but just want to get an idea of when I should start looking again."

I also have international experience and speak Mandarin Chinese and Spanish.

I'm looking primarily for summer internships with **start-ups, non-profits, boutique consultancies, law firms, hedge funds, or private equity firms**, but am absolutely open to anything interesting. I'm applying to several internships through my school's career services, but also decided to post on Reddit because I thought I might find some promising and unconventional opportunities here -- ones where I can learn from what I'm doing, have actual responsibilities, and have a real impact.

I know that you may be reluctant to hire a student just after her freshman year, but my youth doesn't in any way reflect my capabilities or my professionalism.

My gpa is on the low end (3.0), though my degree is from a non-HYP ivy league school if that helps. I've done one internship so far, during which I picked up a decent grasp of excel. 

What can I expect at this point in terms of getting a job? Are companies recruiting at all during this time of year? Should I be e-mailing actuaries from the SOA directory, as opposed to applying through company websites, or perhaps both?

Thanks for any advice. "

I also have international experience and speak Mandarin Chinese and Spanish.

I'm looking primarily for summer internships with **start-ups, non-profits, boutique consultancies, law firms, investment banks, or private equity firms**, but am absolutely open to anything interesting. I'm applying to several internships through my school's career services, but also decided to post on Reddit because I thought I might find some promising and unconventional opportunities here -- ones where I can learn from what I'm doing, have actual responsibilities, and have a real impact.

I know that you may be reluctant to hire a student just after her freshman year, but my youth doesn't in any way reflect my capabilities or my professionalism. Give me a chance to contribute to your firm and I'll do my best to prove it. I'm ready to work hard, meet great people, and learn new things.


I'm willing to travel; however, the most convenient locations would be **New Haven, CT; New York City, NY; Los Angeles, CA; and anywhere in NJ.** 

Available from **mid-May to late August.**

Please PM me for a full resume, and thanks in advance for your consideration!"

I am 23 years old, graduated with my bachelors in information systems this past December. 

For the past 2 years I have worked part time in the IT department at a small-ish (300 employees, 6 people in IT department) non profit that helps out people with disabilities. I did basic desktop support, active directory, setting up projectors simple stuff mainly. Very friendly environment, get time off as I please, though there is nobody else my age there (closest is probably 26 year old girl that is just eh :/ looking), and I work in a different location from the other IT people , so it can get lonely some days.

When i graduated I was applying for jobs at all of the large, local companies, and I didn't have much luck. There was one company in particular, Company A, we will call them, that i really wanted to end up at. They have an amazing work environment and are known throughout the nation as a leading tech company in their field. The only way to get into Company A right out of school is through an summer internship. I applied and got turned down.

Shortly after (a month ago) I got offered a full time job (although I am technically a contractor, which I don't care for because of the lack of benefits) at the non-profit I have been at for two years. I accepted! I got a bump in pay from $12/hour to $17.50/hour and 40 hours/week. I get increased duties (while keeping all of the old still), even some **very** basic information system stuff. I figure I'll work during the summer make some money, start working on my masters in the fall by taking night classes at a nearby university. Also, this job is 15 minutes from my house.

Then I get a call and a job offer today from Company A, and that they have a new technology internship opening that does pretty entry level stuff (inventory, setting up stations, swapping machines, swapping phones, some active directory stuff). It pays $11/hour and is full time, but only 3 months long. Again, this is a ""cool"" company to work for. They treat you to sporting events, would look great on my resume. Only thing is after the internship is over, there is no guarantee that I would get hired into the company. Also, this job is an hour drive, each direction.

Do I take the internship and risk not having a job at the end of the summer?

Or

Do I stay where I am now?

Need to make a decision by Monday!

**TL;DR**: Company A is a large growing ""cool"" tech company that I want to work for someday. I would be a tech intern doing really simple stuff and would have no guarantee at the end of the summer that I could get hired into the company. Hour drive to work, hour drive home. $11/hour pay.

Company B is smaller non profit company that I am comfortable at, but work is sometimes slow. I am just getting into some work that is what I am interested in, though it is just baby steps. No room to grow as its a small company. $17.50/hour pay, no benefits. 15 minutes from my house.

Which one do I pick??

If you made it this far, thank you! If not, I think typing all of this out and re-reading it is helping me with my decision, so thank you again!

So much for short and sweet :P"

The locations are both great, but in different ways: one is in Sherman Oaks near the elementary school, while the other is in Hollywood near La Brea and Hollywood Blvd, but on a side, quiet street. I've only been to LA once on a short trip, so I don't really know the nuances of what day-to-day life is at these two locations.

Both are a 15-20 minute drive from my office in the worst traffic, and about the same rent. So it's really down to location. I'm going to be turning 21, so I want to be able to experience some of the bar scene. At the same time, I don't want there to be TONS of noise right up in my face at all hours. I certainly want to be able to get some sleep during the week. I do want some good restaurants in the area, though, because I'll likely be eating out a lot due to my inability to cook anything complicated.

sbhjn,26,2012-04-15,Any advice for asking for a raise when the company is in a down time?,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/sbhjn/any_advice_for_asking_for_a_raise_when_the/,"Here is my history with my company, followed by the **TL;DR;**

I can’t think of a better subreddit to post this in, if there is one please let me know.

I went to school for web design and got a job at a marketing/design firm while I was still in school. The position has evolved into more of a web developer position, and I love it.

I started as a paid intern at $10 an hour doing design as I taught myself how to build websites, they had been using a company from out of state to build all of their websites and I made myself the goal of replacing that company. Within six months I had reached that goal and they hired me on as a salaried employee at 25k a year.

During this time the company was doing extremely well. It's a relatively new startup, and they were going into their fourth year. At our Christmas party they said that because we were doing so well that they started a profit sharing program, and we all receive bonus checks. My boss took me aside and said that they had hired a consultant to help with the company’s growth, and that part of that was going to be a salary review in order to insure that we were making fair market wages. 

He said that they knew that I was being underpaid but wasn’t sure by how much, but that it would be a few months before they finished the review process. They gave me a raise to 30k that night, and said that I could expect another one when the review process was finished. A few months later I received another raise that put me at 45k.

This was about 14 months ago, and my 2 year review is coming up in June.

I actually never really planned on at staying in this city, and had planned on moving when I graduated college. But in the time I’ve been here I’ve really fallen in love with my job. 

I want to ask for a raise, and a fairly substantial one. My goal is to make 55k, which would be about 20% more than I make now. The problem is we’re not raking in the money like we were before. We’re going through some growing pains and the owner mentioned about a month ago that we had been living payroll to payroll. 

But even knowing that I’m honestly not that worried. We landed a few biggish contracts and are hiring for 2 more positions (going from 9 to 11 employees). I think we’re all really excited about making the next year a good one. 

(On a side note, I have been saving up an emergency fund just in case, but honestly the unknown is part of why I love this job)

We are in a small town, and we are the only company of its kind here. If I ever need to find a new job it will involve moving away, which would be fine with me. The closest town and most likely destination would be Ft Collins CO, and according to indeed.com the [average salary for web developers is 68k](http://www.indeed.com/salary/q-Web-Developer-l-Fort-Collins,-CO.html).

The other piece of  information that I have which I probably shouldn't share with them is that I talked to the only other web developer we've ever hired, and he was making 62k. He was fired for poor performance, but he had a lot more experience than I do. I am a much better developer/designer than he was.

I feel like I’m in a good position to ask for a raise, except for the slow business. 

So here is my idea. I thinking about in the review telling them that I want a raise, and backing it up with the 68k theoretically available in the next town over. The honest truth is that if they say no I’ll still want to continue working here. The raise would make life a shit-ton easier, but I’d rather work somewhere that I love and make less than make more and be stuck in a cubicle somewhere. 

I’m going to collect my thoughts and arguments and write them down, and in my review tell them the salary I want. I’m going to ask them what I would need to do in order to earn the 55k, and give myself 6 months or a year to reach those goals.

Is there any advice you guys can offer me? This will be the first time I’ve ever asked for a raise. I think the fact that I wouldn’t quit if they said no might be apprenant, which probably isn’t ideal. And there is the concern about the tight budget we’ve been working on the past few months. But that’s why I’m going to propose either the 6 month or 1 year timeline. 

**tl;dr;**

I want a big raise, not willing to leave my job if I don't get it, I believe I've earned it, and I'm willing to prove that I can earn it. I'm planning on asking in June, so I have time to prepare. But I want to know what I should bring to the table in order to make my case."

sbb80,2,2012-04-15,Guilty Using Google?,Sarkar9,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/sbb80/guilty_using_google/,"Hi Reddit. I wanted to inquire about your use of Google / stackoverflow / etc for any of your programming projects, whether they were professional or personal. 

I'm currently a junior working towards a CSE degree &amp; work as a software engineering intern at a company, and I can't help but notice that as the classes have gotten harder and I've been writing professional code that I've been googling a TON more. Not necessarily for full-fledged solutions, however. Let me explain with an example. 

One of our projects for a web infrastructure class was building a tool that let us retrieve an HTML page. I knew how to do the TCP part but had no idea how to do the HTTP component on top of TCP, so I googled questions on how to write an HTTP component; I ended up finding a fully working solution. I didn't copy / paste the code, but I understood exactly what the solution was doing and re-fitted the function calls and steps to my own program. I feel sorta guilty that I googled a solution to a problem and ended up using it, but this class doesn't have a book nor a reference guide, so we're kinda on our own. Not only that, I made sure I understood WTH was going on, e.g. building a HTTP query as a string and sending away. So, I did feel like I learned, and I did not copy/paste because I altered the GET statement to my own needs. 

However, how often is this done? Is this something many other programmers do? Can you guys share your stories and perhaps let me know what it's like in a professional setting? I completely understand having things like php.net always open and googling for random errors, but what about situations like mine where you don't exactly know 100% what's going on, but use search engines to figure out what it is?"

She had been cutting herself for quite some time at that point, and I took care of her, I was 15 at the time.
But since then we have been together on and off, I have had another relationship in between for 13 months.
 But I kept coming back to her, because I was worried what happened to her and what she was going through. 
After my 13 month relationship I went back to her and we got together for quite some time, but everything as always had to be secret because her parents were still against me.
 We had intercourse once, and that was the last time I had seen her for half a year ( I didn't want to abandon her, she didn't contact me, I didn't have the time because of my internship).
But now she has found a new guy she is dating.
And he is accepted by her parents and is welcome there and they see each other often.
I still like her, and I am eaten by this feeling of them having the opportunity to be together.
Why didn't I have that when we were together.
Why did I have to go through all this shit for some other guy to just walk in and have none of those problems.
I asked her if I would have asked her for another shot at a relationship after we last saw each other before my internship she would have said yes.

If only I would have followed my heart we would have been together she would never had met the other guy and I would have been happy. Why is life doing this to me, she was the girl I loved for so long who I held most dear and who I have taken care for for al those years. The fact that a new guy comes in and has all these things I didn't have with het is just something that eats me from the inside.
And she gives me all these signals I don't get, one time she is very friendly and almost affectionet (sorry for the lousy grammar) and the other moment she is saying it isn't going to be anyting.
I don't know it anymore, I don't know how I can block the feelings and thoughts of thinking about what she and that new guy are doing together and why I'm still alone. Have I done anything to deserve this, I don't know.

It feels so unfair and I don't know what to do anymore and what to say and how to feel and to proceed. We still have contact and we still speak each other over msn, and I have tried blocking every contact with her.

But that resulted in me being depressed and almost hanging myself...

Why did I have to go through all this shit for some other guy to just walk in and have none of those problems.
I asked her if I would have asked her for another shot at a relationship after we last saw each other before my internship she would have said yes.

If only I would have followed my heart we would have been together she would never had met the other guy and I would have been happy.
Why is life doing this to me, she was the girl I loved for so long who I held most dear and who I have taken care for for al those years.
The fact that a new guy comes in and has all these things I didn't have with het is just something that eats me from the inside.


And she gives me all these signals I don't get, one time she is very friendly and almost affectionet (sorry for the lousy grammar) and the other moment she is saying it isn't going to be anyting.

I don't know it anymore, I don't know how I can block the feelings and thoughts of thinking about what she and that new guy are doing together and why I'm still alone.
Have I done anything to deserve this, I don't know.

It feels so unfair and I don't know what to do anymore and what to say and how to feel and to proceed.
We still have contact and we still speak each other over msn, and I have tried blocking every contact with her.

But that resulted in me being depressed and almost hanging myself...

Sorry for this super long rant, but I don't know what to do anymore."

I really didn't have to drive over there to ""diagnose"" this problem - at this point, dear reader, I'm sure you have a pretty solid guess as to what had led her to this startling conclusion - but it was a gorgeous summer day and we were paid for mileage. 

She had somehow gotten it into her head that URLs typically ended in "".it"" instead of "".com"". She tried a few - yahoo.it, google.it, msn.it - and her worst fears were confirmed. "

Now it's been two years, and last Friday she went off to her farm internship (estimated to last 5-8 months).

I didn't treat her like the amazing person that she was, and at times I got real bitter that she was leaving for this adventure. It was selfish of me, but I owned up and we had a very sorrowful goodbye the morning of her departure.

She kept assuring me before she left that it would be hard, but we could get through it. Fast forward not even a week, we've been texting, etc, but I notice it's steadily become less and less. Talk to her on Thursday and everything seemed to be alright, Friday the 13th, I text the usual ""I love you, good morning.""

This is the beginning of the end, she replies cheerfully, but doesn't reciprocate an ""I love you."" Eventually, after some more texts, I realize that she isn't saying it at all, so I call her. 

It's over, apparently she had been putting a lot thought into it over a couple of days, and it was too far and too long for us to be together. And ultimately, ""it shouldn't be this hard to date someone.""

One thing I noticed, she would always browse this subreddit and I'd ask her if she was reading it because she was troubled, she just liked to read the stories. I don't know if that was true, but this is just a tangent.

I asked her if we could ever be together again, she said she didn't know, but maybe when she got back. Was this her just saying that to let me down easy, she did say she had already hurt me enough.

I logged out of her facebook, erased the saved password. I still live in our room, but am moving out when I graduate college (2 months left). I'm shattered. 

It seems though, from her sisters and family friends that I've spoken to, she's alright. She didn't cry nearly as much as me through out this. She even seemed a lot stronger about leaving then I did, before she left.

Do I have any hope? "

I picked biology because science was the only thing I knew I could tolerate learning after high school.

I couldn't pursue any internships because I had to work the entire time I've been in college. I guess my mini-tip here would be **if you don't have to work through college, do internships!!** Goddamnit do I wish I didn't have to work.

I'm a 25 year old hard worker who moved down to this area about 6 months ago. I'm getting married in June, living with my in-laws, and looking for a career path slightly different to the one I'm on now.

Currently I'm working as a Certified Technician at Staples. While I'm very good at my job, sadly it's about 90% focused on selling. I was told I would be selling every now and then, but it's become a big part of this job. I like it, because it's a job, and it helps pay my bills and helps me treat my fiance (who is working as an unpaid intern) to a weekly date night, but I don't like it in the sense that the pay is embarrassingly low for a Computer Technician.

Previous to this job I worked at an independent gaming store in Columbia, SC and developed my own process to repair gaming consoles. It was very hardware related, and I really took pride in it. I worked there for a year until I realized I needed to get out of that city (seriously, it's crazy up there). Previous to that job, I operated my own business repairing game consoles out of my home. I did this job for a year also.

I don't have any formal training other than being a Staples Certified Technician, but I *have* gone to The University of South Carolina, University of South Carolina - Lancaster, and Midlands Technical College. I basically just do not have the money to finish the last 1.5-2 years of schooling for a degree, but I DO plan on finishing it out, whether it's taking online classes when I find a decent paying job, or joining the Air Force.

I can also provide a resume and cover letter to any employers who may be reading this.

Even though this may get lost in the depths of Reddit, it's worth a shot. If anybody knows anybody who is hiring, please let me know, any help would be appreciated.

I can answer any further questions also. Thanks [/r/Charleston](/r/Charleston) !"

It's the story of how a good friend of mine roped me into going to a furcon, then introduced me to a really neat person while I was hammered.  [This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kEjHgFlJ9c) is the best clip I could find of the system I got to mess with, but it really only shows off 1 pattern of the 30 it was capable of, which is a shame.  It's kind of a long ramble, but I've tried to make it funny.*

It started inauspiciously.  After much gnashing of teeth and a bit of panic, I obtained a job for this summer in Farmington Hills, Michigan (basically Detroit).  The job itself was excellent, having a competitive salary and a generous housing stipend that was to cover the majority of a furnished apartment for myself and the two other interns I was to be rooming with.  The company I was interning with had recommended two apartment complexes to stay in.

I had resolved to go up to the Detroit area to see the apartments for myself before making any choices about where I was staying.  Enter one of my best friends, who I'll call Aestuo.  Aestuo, before transferring to a different college midway through Sophomore year, was my roommate.  After he found out I was going to Detroit, he immediately perked up and suggested a weekend.  When asked why, he simply said ""Oh, a group of us are going to a furcon up there.""

Now, while I love Aestuo to death, and after living with him for a year and a half am no stranger to the furry community, I had no intention of going to a furcon.  However, he won me over with a few simple concessions:

1)  The group would pay for my gas

2)  Staying with the group would drastically cut my hotel cost

3)  He'd pay for my badge

4)  FCN, the con we'd be attending, was well known for the quality of its Saturday night rave and light show

and most importantly 5)  The group would pay for any libations I desired that weekend.

At this point, despite my initial reluctance, what essentially amounted to a weekend in Detroit for $30+food and getting to chill with a good friend that I get to see maybe twice a year was enough to win me over.  I acquiesced and arranged my weekend plans around this con I was now going to.

I'll leave the details of the con itself to the imagination.  Let it simply be known that it was one of the more surreal experiences of my life and that some things, once seen, cannot be unseen. It wasn't a bad time overall, just... a strange one.  But I digress.

Saturday night began as expected.  For those unaware of general con culture, during 3-day cons Saturday tends to be the night things get a hair crazy, when any parties that might happen will happen.  I had begun my Saturday night in grand fashion:  After splitting a bottle of gin with another member of the con group I was with, we traveled over to the main con hotel and proceeded to make our way to a room party.

The room party did not excite... That is, until I found one of the most beautiful sights I have ever laid eyes on:  The was bathtub filled with ice and Killian's Irish Red.  I immediately set up camp and began my grim duty of emptying most of the tub.  About thirty minutes and an indeterminate but gratuitous amount of Killian's later, Aestuo, who is forever sober, came up to me and nudged me:  ""Chalc, we've gotta go.""

I had no intention of leaving this *gorgeous* monument to debauchery.  However, my somewhat-slurred objections died on my lips as he pointed out a rather irritated looking guy standing in the corner and whispered: ""That's the host.""  Said guy was giving me a glare which very clearly translated to:  ""You have 10 seconds to excuse yourself or be forcibly excused.""  After looking from him to the impressive collection of bottles I had created, I took the hint and abandoned ship with Aestuo.

Feeling a bit sheepish, a bit like an ass, and a bit too hammered to really continue drinking anyway, I quickly realized that I was being led to the elevators by Aestuo.  Upon inquiring where we were going, he simply responded ""We're going to meet Fizz.""

Over the course of the weekend, I had discovered something:  Aestuo spent most of his time at cons attempting to meet people he found interesting, or that were in senior positions at the con.  It was why he was able to get me into the con on the cheap (in with the administration), why he was on a first-name basis with Kage (who is apparently a big deal among furries), and why he was able to introduce me to ""Fizz,"" who was apparently in charge of lighting and effects for the rave currently thumping along in the main ballroom.  Fizz also apparently built custom laser and lighting show systems for places like Disney's park in California.

Down on the main floor, I was taken to the bar and lead to a built man with a blonde mohawk, who turned, cordially greeted Aestuo, and introduced himself to me as Fizz.  As we began talking, I quickly remembered two things about myself:  I really, REALLY like talking about things in my field, and alcohol makes me extremely chatty.  These two things combined led Fizz and I on a winding conversation covering topics from Fast Fourier Transforms of laser waveforms, efficient assembly for TI C6000 series DSPs, using Bezier curves to track paths for individual lasers in systems to follow, and all manner of technical jargon relevant to the design of the circuits and programs that comprise lighting systems.  I was actually fascinated that I was able to lucidly discuss things I hadn't dealt with in years while occasionally shaking my head to keep Fizz from completing the mitosis he appeared to be attempting.

After something around forty minutes, Fizz leaned in kind of close and said:  ""Do you want to go to the booth?""  My heart skipped a few beats:  ""What booth?""  Fizz leaned in a little closer:  ""The booth where laser system's control panel is.""  At this point, I held in a bieber-fan-esque squeal of joy and just nodded dumbly.  I was beginning to sober up, and as we wandered towards the sound of pumping bass it was difficult to suppress my mounting excitement.

Once inside, we quickly arrived at a simple control setup:  There was a touchscreen with about 30 different patterns displayed, and a basic control board with 8 sliders and a number of buttons.  Fizz explained that this was the previous version of the control software and upcoming versions would look better.  He then sat down and showed me how it worked:  Select a pattern, and the sliders automatically move to default locations on the board.  You could then modify things such as pattern size, speed, color, and intensity with the sliders, and using one specific button you could pause a pattern for effect.  After explaining the system and letting us watch him work, Fizz looked at me and said:  ""Hey, the next set is an Electro-House set.  I'm going to go back to the bar.  Do you want to take the system for it?""

My jaw dropped.  Yes.  Yes I did want to take the system.  I had sobered up enough to grasp it adequately, and as the set started, I settled in for what would become one of the best hours of my life.  I was pretty awful for about the first ten minutes, but I quickly got in the groove and made some effects I was extremely proud of.

As the set wore down, another person who was *actually* on the AV staff came and replaced me.  I wandered back to the bar where Fizz was, thanked him, found Aestuo, and retired back to my room.  Sunday rolled around, and after I felt well enough to be vertical I made sure to track down and thank Fizz while sober.  We had a short conversation involving swaps of contact information, then went our separate ways.

The rest of the weekend went down as expected:  I had to leave early and drag a few unwilling people from the con group to my car to leave.  I drove the 4 hours to drop them off, and then the 3 hours to get back home in time to make a meeting with a project group and client.

I don't really think I'll be able to top this past Saturday for a while.  It was an absolute ball.  Either way, that's the story of how a buddy of mine knew some people and got me an in to do some really cool stuff.

I am socially awkward. I have a hard time connecting with other people, but am doing well academically. I am in shape and workout at the CRC more than a couple of times a week. 

I have recently overhauled my wardrobe a little by following some advice from [/r/malefashionadvice](/r/malefashionadvice)  and searching former asksubreddit posts, I have started being myself? (not sure whether I am doing this wrong). I am a pro at small talk and then ejecting (Hey how's it going...nice..take care/have a good one) but I am so fucking alone that it kills me. On Fridays, my limited friends are playing some videogames, but mostly I've spent the past couple of weekends alone in my room or walking out and about because I am clueless about clubs/bars that I can get to without a car. Even if I did, I don't know people to go with. It seems like being in a frat, would have been a great option to have something to do on weekends, but I am 2 semesters away from graduation, and it's a rather fucking lonely place to be. 

Most of my attempts at talking to girls are epic fail too. I have been on a grand total of 2 dates this semester, but most girls I like, I am too chicken to talk to, or they are taken or the others I don't want to mess up the social friendship/acquaintance thing that I have going. In my classes, seems like everyone has their own groups, so I feel alienated in the class. And the only other place that I see girls that I'd be interested in talking to are at the CRC which I made a pact with myself not to do. Mostly because I'd much rather do my workout and let the girls do theirs besides I couldn't engage in such behaviour because if I were a girl, I'd probably think of the guy as creepy? Unless they know each other which seems like the norm for all frat/sorority people at the crc or in classes/etc. 

Anyway my life seems to be in a funk and I am not even sure why I am studying to be an engineer anymore. I am unsure about life post graduation as the limited (two) summer internships that I've had have lead me to believe that I fucking hate my guts working on some stupid analysis and optimization stuff.

sd6ri,0,2012-04-16,Those inside the film industry: Please give me some advice. Any insight is greatly appreciated.,[deleted],Screenwriting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/sd6ri/those_inside_the_film_industry_please_give_me/,"I'll try to keep this as straight to the point as possible:

I'm a 4th year Economics student at UCLA graduating in 2 months. I originally came to UCLA in pursuit of a Film major, but I was not one of the fortunate few accepted into the program. Regretfully, I have taken most of the film minor classes but did not bother getting the minor in the end.

I knew since I was a kid that creating films was all I ever wanted to do (specifically writing and directing). I'm sure most of you understand where I'm coming from. I didn't do anything about it before college, figuring I would begin my path in Film once I was there. After I didn't get into the Film program, I shifted my plan to: 1. Getting an Economics degree 2. Getting some overpaid shitty desk job just to pay off my college loans 3. Write screenplays on the side and develop my craft 4. Hopefully sell a script by the time I turn 30.

As I approach graduation, I'm having second thoughts. I feel like I am in denial. This whole approach seems faulty because I know that unless I get lucky and happen to break into the industry solely through my writing, I will be extremely depressed and unfulfilled from my day job. I tell myself that I can get through it, and the money will allow me to support my passion by paying for a camera, script doctors, masterclasses, and other things of that nature. But now, I'm not so sure I want to live two lives.

A very good friend of mine that I respect a lot has given me the advice that I should get into the Film industry as soon as possible if I've already decided it's what I want to do with my life. Delaying it would just put me at a disadvantage. I agree with the advice logistically, but I'm just afraid of certain aspects.

First, I'm 100% reliant on financial aid right now. I have absolutely zero experience in film production. All of my professional experience lies in the marketing/public relations field. I would be willing to work for low pay/no pay to gain experience at a Film internship, or working my way up as a PA. But how will I pay the bills? Living in Los Angeles is expensive, and I have over 30,000 to pay off in student loans after I graduate.

Second, I have no interests in simply working in the industry. My sole interest is to be able to write screenplays and possibly direct them. I could care less about being involved with films that aren't mine. The idea is that getting a job in the industry will gain me connections that would gain more exposure for my writing, but I feel an entire day/night job devoted to networking might be excessive.

Someone has suggested that I combine them and use my degree to get a related job, but in the film industry. I've been applying to these and would be ecstatic if I could land one of these positions, but I'm the type to expect the worst to avoid disappointment. Assuming I cannot land one of these ideal jobs, I'm really at a loss of what to do.

Now that I think about it, anyone with life experience can help me out here. At the end of the day, a job is a job, and very few people have the luxury of actually enjoying their job. One part of me is telling me to suck it up, take a regular 9-5 and write on the side, and have enough faith in my work ethic and dedication to get me through these 5-8 years as I master the craft. Another part of me is telling me life is too short to be wasting time delaying my ""inevitable destiny"". As melodramatic and romantic as it sounds, I'm at the point in which I do not give it my all in screenwriting, I will live a life of regret and failure."

Empirical analysis/askscience preferred, since I've seen lots of methods that say they never fail.**

I was recently selected for an internship with a Fortune 500 company, and I'm thrilled. It was a last-minute opportunity, so I didn't get as much advance notice as I thought I would, and found out that I have to drug test. 

**My data**

* 145ish lbs, 5'8, not particularly athletic, not terribly out of shape. Think indie-rock physique plus the Curse of the Reefer.
* Last smoke was Friday the 13th. The earliest I'll have to test is the 24th, but I can very possibly get it delayed some-- I have no car and am a uni student in the middle of a major US city, the kind where you need a car to get anywhere. Given that it'll also be the middle of finals, those together seem like a pretty good excuse. However, I want to prepare for the worst, so let's assume the 24th-25th.
* I am not typically a very heavy smoker, but my recent use history has been more so. I bought 4 grams of pretty good stuff on the 3rd and finished it on the 10th.
* The only other drug I've taken recently was 40mg of Adderall for an all-nighter two nights ago. I know that amphetamines tend to take a maximum of about a week to clear your system, so I think I'll be okay on that front. 

I am aware that the only things that will actually remove the THC from my system are to stop smoking for sustained periods of time and to exercise the fat storing it away. I'm not going to be able to exercise as much as I would like due to circumstances, and I'm pretty short on time. Any help trees can offer would be amazing. Thanks!

**Substances**

* Niacin
* Creatine (supplements or foods like red meat, to hide dilution)
* Aspirin (4 hrs prior to test)
* Vitamin B2/B12 (yellowing)
* Furosemide (prescription diuretic)
* Certo 
* Strip drink

**Fluids**

* Cranberry juice
* Gatorade
* Water (Duh.)

**Techniques**

* Exercise (stopping three days before)
* Sauna
* Synthetic urine

Good, I need some smart help around the office. You already know our business: big law firm, expensive clients, late working hours, etc. But what they may not have told you in the interview are some of the personal touches that will be needed if you want to succeed.

First, dress code. What you are wearing now won't do. Skirts are preferred. Short skirts. Short tight skirts. Button up blouses are also best, for reasons I will explain shortly. Leggings are up to you, but we want see your legs, however you choose to dress. Also as part of the dress code, there will be occasions when I ask you to go without a bra and panties for a given time. So be sure you wear something that is sexy, but easily removed.

Second, office demeanor. At least once a week, please set an appointment on my calendar to clean my office. During these times, I will still need to work at my desk, but you will have to clean around me. This may require you to bend over the filing cabinets, to climb a stepladder and reach the high shelves, and even to get on your knees at my desk to reach the lower drawers. It will be during this weekly appointment that you will be required to remove any underwear. I prefer to enjoy the view while you clean.

Third, making the boss happy. In addition to the cleaning times, there may be some late nights worked in the firm. I keep a supply of condoms and toys in my bottom drawer for such occasions. I expect you to willingly give blow jobs and to be fucked on my big desk when I demand it. My preference is bending you over the desk and taking you from behind. We can discuss more details of this if you have questions.

I hope you are ready to start your new job duties. I for one, am excited you are here.

Best,

The first year while I was undecided and messing around with courses in the college of arts and sciences, I ended with a 3.86 GPA. 

Now that I'm in the engineering college pursuing a major in CS, I've been doing terribly. Last semester I dropped one of my two math courses, then got a D in the other. I also got a C in another class, dragging my GPA down to a 3.33. 

This semester it looks like I'm going to get a D in the CS weed-out class for my major (I need a C- to pass), and I'll probably have another C.

This is all so stressful and I don't know what to do. Currently I'm looking at having to take 5 classes per semester, and since I will most likely fail a class this semester, I'll have to take that one again (it will be with another professor who is really easy). 

I don't really want to switch majors. I *like* my major, and it's really the only thing I can say interest me, but it's just so damn hard. It's given me so many opportunities to travel, plus the program has 100% job placement rate. I'm just worried about graduating withing my 4 years. I can take this class I'm failing over the summer, but it costs money I really don't have. I'm already going to be spending thousands on going to Europe for an internship and taking the math course I got a D in once I get back. I was thinking, ""Well, my parents are going to kill me, but *maybe* I can convince them to let me dish out another $2440 to take another class this summer. Even with that I got screwed over. The class meets 4x a week, and one of the meeting times would interfere with the math class. 

I really don't know what to do. I can't take 6 classes one semester. It'd kill me. I can barely handle 5. I become so sleep deprived and lately have felt physically ill very often. I get frequent headaches, and this is just making it so much worse. I get so upset over my courses that I begin to feel nauseous. I've briefly considered staying one extra semester to lighten the load, but I really don't have that kind of cash. 

I was the perfect A+ student in high school and I feel like since being in college, and switching colleges (within my university), I'm slipping.

Note: I talk to my professors. In the class I think I'm going to fail, the professor told me today I need to get an 80% on the final to be on the border of a D+ and C-. I could study extremely hard, but realistically I doubt I'll near an 80% (I'd have to practically double my performance based on the past 2 exams) , especially since I'll have two other exams to study for before this one.

I don't really know what you can do. I don't know if anyone can really give me any guidance, or just a cheerful thought. I got back my exam grade today, so the reality is sinking in that I'll have to take this class again and I really don't have the time for it. I'll have to plan the rest of my college life (again, as far as my schedule goes), even though I did this already and said, ""Ok, but this will only work if I never fail a class.""

Tl;dr: I'm not doing great in college and it's becoming both physically and mentally exhausting."

Today I really didn't want to go to school because everything seemed so meaningless. The thought of cutting my veins kept occurring to me. I learned from an online post long ago that cutting your veins and soaking in a bathtub with warm water is the least painful way to die. I wish I do not need to live with the guilt and unbearable pain of loss. I wish death is the easy escape. However, I still managed to go to school with 15 min late, because I needed to turn in a take home exam; because I needed to get good grades from my class; because I needed good grades to get a good job; because I needed the money from the job to repay the tens of thousands of dollars my parents paid for my college, and make them happy the rest of their life. I still cannot let down the people that still love me.

 

But with the unbearable pain that I was afraid I was not the girl they thought I was. Yesterday I told my mom that my boyfriend proposed to me, my mom and I were both so excited and thrilled. From my mom's loving and happy expression, I suddenly felt I grew up and I was no longer a little girl, and I was a whole new fully matured woman capable to take responsibility in life. Yesterday at this moment I felt like the happiest woman in the world with my boyfriend getting me the perfect ring I wanted. It was like I finally found the meaning of life.

 

My boyfriend is the nicest guy in the world, even though at the beginning he was flaky; but later on, he fully devoted himself, and I never felt so good with a man. It was like my dream from my childhood came true. I was his princess and he was my prince. I never felt so secure and right with a man, and we could see our future together.

 

Forgive me for not being able to describe in full what happened that made me realize how sinful I was. Last night he checked my cellphone messages and found out I cheated on him when our relationship barely started.

 

I was different at that time and I had my dark side. When I felt depressed about relationships, I looked for attentions from some other guy, even it was just purely physical attention from the person. I was not confident about our relationship at that time, and I thought cheating without emotions involved did not count. Of course, it was just my own utilitarianism to justify my actions at that time. The worst part was not about cheating but lying. Later on in our relationship, he did ask me once if I ever slept with any other guy after we started sleeping together, and I gave him an affirmed ""no"". And I believed all my action convinced him that I would never cheat on him, because I never acted I was guilty. Yes, I never felt guilty about the short-lived affair, because I justified myself that I wholeheartedly loved him, and I was just being insecure at the beginning.

 

Life is so ironic that he found this out the day he gave me a ring. I realized how horrible I was at the beginning. I was not being sincere and I pretended I was someone more mature than I was at the moment. In reality, I was a childish and selfish bitch. Even though he was acting flaky and uncertain about us at the beginning, he was sincere to me and his feeling. However, I was not. I pretended to be the person I wanted to be and allowed myself to have the dark side. The worst, I lied. I was so afraid I would lose him so I lied. Now I realized being afraid of losing him was still a selfish reason to lie, because I was only considering my own feeling that I would lose him. 

I felt my sin. I felt my soul was contaminated. The worst, I never noticed this until now. When I was sitting in class, part of me tried to understand what the professor was talking about; and part of me felt so shameful that I should not even sit in here. I felt I did not deserve anything good in my life, such as my parents, my best-friends, my school, my internship, and of course my loving boyfriend and fiancé-going-to-be. I was too shameful and sinful to tell them I was a cheater and a liar. The easy way out of this mess was so tempting. So I was in class, picturing out the wounds and red streams in the water; somehow, I felt this was alleviating my sin. If I chose the extreme way to show my apology, would it purify my soul? I needed the compatible pain to purify my sin.

 

Then I thought about if I should leave a note and tell my parents and my boyfriend that I love them one more time, but then I could not picture them reading my note. I was already a damned soul and how I dared to add more pain to them? 

 

I should suck my pain up, and do more good in the world as I could. Not as if doing good is a way to wash off my sin, but as if a damned soul just wants to do good in rest of its damned life. How dare I to even think about purifying myself? Suicide was the wrong easy way out. Suicide would be as bad as cheating and lying. They are all the same easy routes that do not go anywhere. I really want to do something good to my boyfriend. But I do not know how. Maybe my disappearance in his life is better for him. Maybe he would take another chance to love me again. If he would, I would do as much as good to him. To love him as much as I can in the best way and the right way as a human can. Not for his forgiveness, but just because this is the thing what I wanted to do the most in the world to make things right. His forgiveness and acceptance would be too much luxury for a person who could never change the past and who could not undo his pain. 

 

I already told him that we could take a break and he could decide what would be the best for him. That was the only thing I could do.

 

Maybe I can start doing good to the other people that love me. My parents. I know that loving myself and being a decent person is the best way to make them happy. I pretended I was. I neither loved myself or being decent. I still do not know if I should tell my parents what happened. I would definitely upset them, and I do not know asking for their acceptance do any good to them.

 

I probably do not need my parents to go through this, because I already accepted myself. I accepted my past wrong-doing. What has been done has been done.  It is true that my own forgiveness was my ultimate reason not to kill myself. I should not punish myself for what was in the past and could not be redone. However, I do not ask for relive from my suffering. Maybe there is no relive. Now I see my suffering as a way to straight things up and being a noble person in the future. Because if I can live with my suffering and do things right, I live through it like a triumph. This is the meaning of my suffering.

 

""We must never forget that we may also find meaning in life even when confronted with a hopeless situation, when facing a fate that cannot be changed.

scsa0,0,2012-04-16,This is my own story of avoding suicide and my interpretation of suffering,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/scsa0/this_is_my_own_story_of_avoding_suicide_and_my/,"I really didn't want to go to school because everything seemed so meaningless. The thought of cutting my veins kept occurring to me. I learned from an online post long ago that cutting your veins and soaking in a bathtub with warm water is the least painful way to die. I wish I do not need to live with the guilt and unbearable pain of loss. I wish death is the easy escape. However, I still managed to go to school with 15 min late, because I needed to turn in a take home exam; because I needed to get good grades from my class; because I needed good grades to get a good job; because I needed the money from the job to repay the tens of thousands of dollars my parents paid for my college, and make them happy the rest of their life. I still cannot let down the people that still love me.

But with the unbearable pain that I was afraid I was not the girl they thought I was. Yesterday I told my mom that my boyfriend proposed to me, my mom and I were both so excited and thrilled. From my mom's loving and happy expression, I suddenly felt I grew up and I was no longer a little girl, and I was a whole new fully matured woman capable to take responsibilities in life. Yesterday at this moment I felt like the happiest woman in the world with my boyfriend getting me the perfect ring I wanted. It was like I finally found the meaning of life.

My boyfriend is the nicest guy in the world, even though at the beginning he was flaky; but later on, he fully devoted himself, and I never felt so good with a man. It was like my dream from my childhood came true. I was his princess and he was my prince. I never felt so secure and right with a man, and we could see our future together.

Forgive me for not being able to describe in full what happened that made me realize how sinful I was. Last night he checked my cellphone messages and found out I cheated on him when our relationship barely started.

I was different at that time and I had my dark side. When I felt depressed about relationships, I looked for attentions from some other guy, even it was just purely physical attention from the person. I was not confident about our relationship at that time, and I thought cheating without emotions involved did not count. Of course, it was just my own utilitarianism to justify my actions at that time. The worst part was not about cheating but lying. Later on in our relationship, he did ask me once if I ever slept with any other guy after we started sleeping together, and I gave him an affirmed ""no"". And I believed all my action convinced him that I would never cheat on him, because I never acted I was guilty. Yes, I never felt guilty about the short-lived affair, because I justified myself that I wholeheartedly loved him, and I was just being insecure at the beginning.

Life is so ironic that he found this out the day he gave me a ring. I realized how horrible I was at the beginning. I was not being sincere and I pretended I was someone more mature than I was at the moment. In reality, I was a childish and selfish bitch at that time. Even though he was acting flaky and uncertain about us at the beginning, he was sincere to me and his feeling. However, I was not. I pretended to be the person I wanted to be and allowed myself to have the dark side. The worst, I lied. I was so afraid I would lose him so I lied. Now I realized being afraid of losing him was still a selfish reason to lie, because I was only considering my own fear that I would lose him. 
I felt my sin. I felt my soul was contaminated. The worst, I never noticed this until now. When I was sitting in class, part of me tried to understand what the professor was talking about; and part of me felt so shameful that I should not even sit in here. I felt I did not deserve anything good in my life, such as my parents, my best-friends, my school, my internship, and of course my loving boyfriend and fiancé-going-to-be. I was too shameful to tell them I was a cheater and a liar. The easy way out of this mess was so tempting. So I was in class, picturing out the wounds and red streams in the water; somehow, I felt this was alleviating my sin. If I chose the extreme way to show my apology, would it purify my soul? I needed the compatible pain to purify my sin.

Then I thought about if I should leave a note and tell my parents and my boyfriend that I love them one more time, but then I could not picture them reading my note. I was already a damned soul and how I dared to add more pain to them? 

I should suck my pain up, and do more good in the world as I could. Not as if doing good is a way to wash off my sin, but as if a damned soul just wants to do good in rest of its damned life. How dare I to even think about purifying myself? Suicide was the wrong easy way out. Suicide would be as bad as cheating and lying. They are all the same easy routes that do not go anywhere. I really want to do something good to my boyfriend. But I do not know how. Maybe my disappearance in his life is better for him. Maybe he would take another chance to love me again. If he would, I would do as much as good to him. To love him as much as I can in the best way and the right way as a human can. Not for his forgiveness, but just because this is the thing what I wanted to do the most in the world to make things right. His forgiveness and acceptance would be too much luxury for a person who could never change the past and who could not undo his pain. 

I already told him that we could take a break and he could decide what would be the best for him. That was the only thing I could do.

Maybe I can start doing good to the other people that love me. My parents. I know that loving myself and being a decent person is the best way to make them happy. I pretended I was. I neither loved myself or being decent. I still do not know if I should tell my parents what happened. I would definitely upset them, and I do not know asking for their acceptance do any good to them.

I probably do not need my parents to go through this, because I already accepted myself. I accepted my past wrong-doing. What has been done has been done.  It is true that my own forgiveness was my ultimate reason not to kill myself. I should not punish myself for what was in the past and could not be redone. However, I do not ask for relive from my suffering. Maybe there is no relive. Now I see my suffering as a way to straight things up and being a noble person in the future. Because if I can live with my suffering and do things right, I live through it like a triumph. This is the meaning of my suffering.

""We must never forget that we may also find meaning in life even when confronted with a hopeless situation, when facing a fate that cannot be changed. For what then matters is to bear witness to the uniquely human potential at its best, which is to transform a personal tragedy into a triumph, to turn one's predicament into a human achievement.

scraq,3,2012-04-16,"Dear U.S. Immigration employees/Lawyers, I need your help to know if I will be banned from the U.S. if I return(throwaway)",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/scraq/dear_us_immigration_employeeslawyers_i_need_your/,"I am a British Citizen who came to live in the U.S. when I was 12(until I was 23), I was on my father's E-2 Visa originally, and Believe I had one of my own.

When I went to College I had to transfer my visa to an F-1 visa, which was not stamped in my passport until my junior year when I left to visit home for the first time: in Dec2007. Nobody ever told me what I had to do legally if I did not find a job once I graduated(may 08) I figured if it were a big deal someone would outline/police it. I did not think anything was out of place until My drivers license expired and I could not renew it in march 2009.

I graduated from school in may 2008 I applied for the 1 year practical training/work visa, which I think went from march 08 - march 09(not 100% sure on the date on that one). I never found a job, and prepared to move back in with my parents who live in the U.A.E. thinking oh well, I'll just find a job there since the economy was booming at the time. I did a couple internships and found a perm job in early 2010 with an American company.

Before I left the states I visited with an immigration lawyer to see what it would take to get a green card and was told NOT to leave the country If I was going to go on for a grad degree, and she advised me to marry someone. I would of left in march '09, but looked at grad schools and applied. I stayed and eventually decided to forget about the expenses of Gradschool until I had at least a year's experience and left, since I also had no girlfriend to propose to, and I'm not privy to commit fraud.

My visa officially expired 31st may 2009(1 year after graduation, is this an error?). And I left on August 16th 2009. (less than 3 months)

I have not been back since and have no real yearning to try to live in the states, I have found a job here in the U.A.E. with an American company.

The problem is, the company now wants me to go to the US headquarters for a few weeks to sort out an issue we've been having. This is a massive opportunity for me to further my career, and meet some of the people running our company.

I want to take them up on this, but I don't know if once I reach the states if I will be eligible for the visa waiver program which normally can be used for a Brit since I overstayed.

I am also unclear on the exact length of my overstay. Does it count from the end of my visa, my 1 year work allowance, or from the date I graduated.

I imagine since I was out of work, and did not re-enroll at a gradschool I may be considered overstaying by 1 year and 3 months, which will probably incur a ban. though if it was the actual expiry date then it would be less than 3 months where I cannot find a definite answer from the online resources available to me

What options do I have? I don't want to ruin my career because of my youthful ignorance. in hindsight I realized what I did was reckless, but I had lived in the states since I was 12 so at the time I knew nothing else.

Again I do have a fulltime job, with a company that deals with the U.S. Military often. they want me to come to the States for a few weeks. Can I do that on the visa waiver program still, or will I get a ban and deported upon re-entering the US?

Thanks in advance,

I'll clarify things when you ask"

scpeg,0,2012-04-16,I work in a small business and my colleague does absolutely no work. What can I do to have her evaluated and possibly fired?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/scpeg/i_work_in_a_small_business_and_my_colleague_does/,"Like I stated above, I work in a small business. Its a federal contracting firm, and there are probably ~15 people in the office. I have been working here around 6 months as my first job out of college, and I work hard every day (until i get on reddit). I have a colleague that is female, and black. I have nothing against women. I grew up in a heavily populated area with very diverse nationalities, so no, I am not racist.  I along with many other colleagues before I entered the company have had multiple conflicts with this woman--multiple times. She causes problems. Every time you disagree with her opinions, she gets extremely defensive and begins to undermine your position, stating that you are not qualified to make such an accusation. (I'm an engineer, she claims to be an architect but she does no architectural work....but she is a ""project manager"") I asked her how to read a drawing in a particular architectural scale (1:50m) and told me to ask someone else. I'm not an architect but I can definitely read that scale.

The most recent event happened on last Wednesday. She stayed on the office phone for FOUR HOURS trying to figure out a cell phone bill issue. Then the following day she was on the phone for an additional TWO HOURS just to re-order a coffee table that wasn't the color that she wanted. This entire time, I am at my desk working my ass off. She sits there speaking under her breath on the phone for four hours. Then better yet, I see her time sheet for the last two weeks and she BILLS the hours saying that she worked. She is the last to come in, and first to leave.

I constantly interact with my colleagues. I get work from multiple people in my office, and I always turn it in on time and in great quality. I work easily 9 hours a day, and stay after work just to get some more experience. This work habit is consistent to everyone in this office, except her. I am already involved in more work in the company than her, and she has been here for a year and a half. I applied to jobs for 6 months straight after graduation and FINALLY got employed, so I am trying to make the best of it.

This is the part that REALLY aggravates me.  I am working at my full potential, because I have what a lot of my college graduate friends STILL do not have. But I work next to someone that myself and a few colleagues consider an overpaid paper-pusher. Someone my age could easily fill her overpaid salary position in this company, that is not only more qualified to do the work, but can generate work at a higher quality. We don't even need one person to fill her position, we could hire 2 people each with half of her salary. More work would be done, and a friendlier work environment would be made. We work as a team here, and she is the only person in the whole office that works solo. It has come to the point where colleagues cannot ask her for help on something. Her work quality is terrible, so anything she works on has to be redone. We recently got two part time interns, and now all she does is push her work to the interns. Her work is simple enough to have these interns do it. All of the others in this office are skeptic to dish out our work because it is too technical for someone to understand without prior engineering experience. I have written emails to my boss twice on how myself and a colleague have been personally offended (in an extremely unprofessional vocal manner) by her, and nothing seems to be done. My boss is completely content with his situation, and wants absolutely nothing to do with these events that seem to keep reoccurring. It has gotten to the point where no one talks to her unless they HAVE to. I feel like my boss is too scared to make a move towards questioning her, it would just release a disaster of arguments and self defense. 

What to do reddit? 

What can I do?

scp7z,1,2012-04-16,Hooray!  I got to have a great first two days at the video/audio/internet media convention in Vegas.  :),sezzme,SezzThoughts,https://www.reddit.com/r/SezzThoughts/comments/scp7z/hooray_i_got_to_have_a_great_first_two_days_at/,"4-16-2012 (monday)

A longtime friend of mine who I haven't seen since 1999 has been staying in touch with me by phone ever since he left my former city. He had moved back to one of the flat Plains states in the middle of the USA where his family lives.  

He was unemployed for quite awhile, then eventually he got a job with a tiny company which does some kind of engineering-level,  I'm-not-sure-quite-what, high-tech stuff with high-definition video cameras.

Anyhoo, before my move, I got to find out that my old friend was coming to Vegas to help his boss with the company's booth at the convention.  While he was telling me this, I was busy freaking out over not even knowing if I was going to have a safe place to live, much less going to the convention myself. Would I end up not being able to see him while he was here?  That would have been pretty sad.

After the unexpectedly-successful move, I wasted no time exploring the major streets in my new neighborhood.  Whoa... check it out...  a local east-west avenue known as Sahara intersects with a north-south major street called Decatur - and nearly EVERYTHING you ever need is within a mile or two of Decatur and Sahara.  NICE.  I used to live too damn far away from anything either interesting or convenient. This was a fantastic change.

So there I was last Wednesday, standing in the middle of a parking lot with a Lowes (huge lumber and hardware chain), a Michaels (crafts store) a Walmart Supercenter, a Payless shoe store, a Smart and Final (awesome grocery store aimed at restaurant people) and a 99 Cents Only store.  A whole bunch of major fast food chain places was located between me and home. There was also a Trader Joes and well as a bunch of other stuff in between I won't mention.  

Right then and there, I called my friend back east and told him that all this stuff was within 15 minutes from the Las Vegas Convention Center where he and his company would be setting up his booth.  If they were planning on renting a car, I was willing to be their local navigator and show them where to get necessary supplies for their company booth.

When I came home, there was an email letting me know that I now had a badge/pass that named me as part of their company.  Suddenly I was their new, temporary intern. COOL.  :)

I put a LOT of thought into how I could be a real asset to this company.  They were due to arrive at the convention center after 2pm Saturday.  I figured that they would bring their own tools, but figured a few extra items from my own tool collection would not hurt a bit.

I arrived at the convention center around 1pm and got my badge.   I've been there before when the show was in full swing, but NOT during setup time.  Wish I'd brought a video camera!  Forklifts zooming everywhere, crates flown in from all over the planet being unpacked, lots of building, lots of busy, techy people trying not go get in each other's way.  That was fun.  

I found the space where my new friends would build their company booth along with their two HUGE shipping boxes.  I left my can of black, matte spray paint (as requested).  I also left some box cutters, a hot glue gun and a few other things.  I then wrote a note saying ""I hope this stuff helps, I'm off to get a burrito now"" and happily left for my home neighborhood for awhile.

Two hours later I got a call that my pile of supplies had REALLY helped them start their work.  They didn't have box cutters since they had just gotten off their plane - and were happily surprised by my little gifts.  Seriously cool.  I was on my way back from the burrito place, so I was able to join them within 15 minutes.  Awesome reunion ensued with my old friend.  :)

During the next few hours I helped them set up their booth.  Turns out my old Macguyver-like talents were still in force.  YAY!  I taught them about my favorite, magic [two-way tape](http://ml.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/olwe0/something_to_add_to_your_toolbox_worlds_toughest/) which they immediately found to be incredibly useful.  I observed how they were putting their components together and loaned them tools to make it easier.  I felt proud that I could help them.

As I expected, they found out that they were missing some vital components.  So plans were made that evening to go to my favorite new intersection to go to Lowes and Walmart to get supplies.  We piled into their rented SUV.  I made a point out of teaching them how to easily drive to Sahara and Decatur and head north to the place which would make their goals so much easier.  I made sure that they could recognize the local road signs so that they could go there on their own.  When my friend asked ""Is this Decatur?"" I replied: ""See that street sign?  That's an in-decatur!""  Got a laugh out of that one.

Yesterday they made it to the same intersection on their own and then picked me up at Trader Joes where I'd gotten some snack bars.  I then spent the rest of the afternoon talking and occasionally helping them with tasks in their convention booth.  I fixed a couple of broken chairs with my Dremmel tool and that magic tape I talked about earlier.  

They dropped me off at my place last night, and I proceeded to crash.  Today, Monday, I have my doubts that I'll be spending much time at the convention today.  I REALLY blew my small reserve of energy and now I am pretty much splat even after a good night of sleep.  That's ok... I have the rest of the week to enjoy the convention.  :)

My silent half didn't take the option of being part of the setup.  He's going to the convention now that it's official start has begun.  I'm still stuck in bed and it's almost noon.  I REALLY gotta get up and get some breakfast before Reddit completely sucks me into it's vortex and I'll wonder where the day went.

scos1,3,2012-04-16,Depressed,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/scos1/depressed/,"Well i am depressed for the last 2 months so i will explain the situation i am in right now. (sorry for bad grammar English is not my first language)

I am 20 years old and my girlfriend is 17, we are now almost 3 and a half year together. Last November she cheated on me, it was the first time she did that. my heart broke into a million pieces but after a couple of weeks it was all fine again. Then a few months ago she did it again, her mother has schizophrenia and its going real bad with her, my girlfriend got the worst of the worst internships you can get. i did everything in my being to help her to save her, nothing helped so she went to a therapist, that didn't help either. we came to the conclusion we do an open relationship cause she is worried that if we are married and all she will then cheat and wants to be a teenager. I can understand that, of course we have rules and everything.

I had my mask of happiness on the whole time but everyday little by little did my mask crumble away, when she knew i was depressed she knew it was her fault it is her fault, but it's just that i could not save her, only sex can apparently. she does it with one guy, but i just get more and more the feeling that they have more a relationship then she and i do, i feel like i will lose my mind and go crazy one of these days, the only one that helps me is the girl that i am seeing in the open relationship although we do not have a lot of contact she helps me, more then my girlfriend does.

I don't know what to do anymore, i cry when i am alone, i think of solutions but nothing helps. And she is suicidal.

What can i do? and don't say break up with her, she will only get worse she was like this before we met, this time its really bad if that happens.

Thank you for reading, i wanted to get this of my heart.

EDIT: All of my girlfriends cheated on me, i get the feeling i just have to live with it. Like its a curse."

She adopted them and asked me prior-to if I would mind the cats moving in, and I said I wouldn't mind because I was under the impression that they would be well-mannered, well-behaved cats and I am a cat-lover myself.  There was no written agreement or anything involving the cats living here. 

Now, the cats are very cute and sweet for the most part, but they are also the most destructive, annoying cats I have ever known.  Of my belongings, three pairs of shoes have been damaged, one of which I can no longer wear, a clutch purse, and two brand new reusable ziploc bags (the washable, $10 a piece kind).  That may not sound like a lot, but I'm an undergrad college student that worked an unpaid internship this semester.  One of the bags was even stuffed into the very bottom of my double-zipped book bag and on a low lying table...I came down one morning to find it pulled off the table onto the floor with both zippers open and the ziploc bag demolished.  This cat eats plastic, yes.  All kinds.  I can't leave my bedroom door open for even a minute because they'll get under my bed and start eating things that I am trying to keep protected.  I can't leave my belongings downstairs besides books and things because they will get chewed up.  I can't even eat in peace because of the incessant meowing, prancing around the tables and counters, and one of the cats will literally steal the food off of your plate if you get up from the table to go 10 feet into the kitchen for a moment.

I am at my wits end, despite the fact that my landlord/roommate has done her best to try to train the cats.  My main issue is that I start all distance education courses in the end of May as I finish up my undergrad degree this summer and I will need a peaceful place to study.  Here I can't even peacefully study anywhere besides my room because one of the cats repeatedly bangs the cabinet door that hold their food as he tries to open it.  It has a kiddy lock on it but that doesn't stop him.  He also noisily vomits up the plastic he eats pretty regularly.  My dilemma is that my lease isn't up until over a month after I start classes, and given the intensity of summer courses it would be extremely stressful to try and move in the middle of them.  And I seriously don't think I can last until the end of my lease with these cats...I really am miserable and am not feeling safe or comfortable in my own home.  I apologize for the long rant, but I want you to understand that I am not just a crazy cat-hater.  I love cats and these cats are just insane with their behavioral problems.  

I've told her how I feel and that I would like to terminate my lease early, but she said she is still going to hold me responsible for payment of rent unless I find a subleaser.  I looked through my lease agreement and it does say under a section, ""Quiet enjoyment.  Tenant, upon payment of all of the sums referred to herein as being payable by Tenant and Tenant's performance of all Tenant's performance of all Tenant's agreements contained herein and Tenant's observance of all rules and regulations, shall and may peacefully and quietly have, hold and enjoy said Premises for the term hereof.""  Does that mean anything?  Has she violated her agreement as landlord by putting animals in the home after the beginning of my lease that disrupt my ability to leave peacefully and quietly?

Can I do anything at all here or am I just going to have to suck it up?  Any insight or help would be much appreciated.

**TL;DR** My landlord acquired two cats since the beginning of my lease and they have become incredibly destructive and disruptive, including doing monetary damage to my belongings that I have not been reimbursed for.  Do I have any options as far as terminating the lease early and moving out because as they are interfering with my right as a Tenant to ""peacefully and quietly have, hold and enjoy said Premises for the term hereof""?"

At the beginning of the semester, we get a list of ""Sponsored Projects"", which are essentially semester long assignments for a customer.

I later find out that these customers are companies that pay the university $8,000 to have their project put in the list for a semester. Then the students pay thousands of dollars to enroll in the class, and work as programmers for the companies for the semester.

My question is this: Is it really legal for the university to accept payment from both sides of this transaction? It almost seems like they are selling our work without us getting any cut. Is this an opportunity I'm taking for granted? Is this common in CS programs across the country?

I've already had an internship for a couple years so the idea of doing the same work but paying out of my pocket to do it makes me feel like I'm being cheated."

scg9v,8,2012-04-16,Day 9 - I survived the weekend!,I_PISS_Bong_WateR,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/scg9v/day_9_i_survived_the_weekend/,"Background: quitting 40 days for a drug test for an internship, i may decide to quit for much longer but only time will tell. I have been a regular smoker for ~3.5 years.


As the title says, I survived my first full weekend without weed. My GF came in town this weekend so she helped keep me distracted from thinking about it (she tokes every once in a while but can easily spend a weekend without). but It is going to be a long week, especially will school slowing down!!


I spent part of my weekend cleaning all of my pieces and finally putting them up for this time period. I had a half loaded bowl that I have kept around as my ""crutch"", just knowing I had weed easily available was kind of a relief for me. Anybody else use this tactic? In the end I ended up throwing it out, but I really considered hitting it as a reward for going more than a week without smoking. I am glad I refrained from it, as my clock would reset to zero.


I will continue to update /r/leaves! Stay strong former-ents!!

Is anyone here from the chemistry department? Would you perhaps  have any interest in a summer intern? Or better yet, would you be able to put him in contact with a professor/lab head?

scbib,7,2012-04-16,Australian biomedical science student wanting to do an internship (or some such thing) overseas. Does anybody know how I could go about applying?,[deleted],AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/scbib/australian_biomedical_science_student_wanting_to/,"Hi guys, I thought this was the best subreddit for my question. As I said, I'm an Australian biomedical science student in the fourth year of my degree. At the end of this year, I'll have had one year of experience working in a laboratory. I'd love to apply to do an internship overseas, as I know that some universities have those kinds of programs for students, but have no idea how to go about applying. I've asked around at my university, but they haven't been very helpful, so I thought I might have more luck asking some overseas students such as yourselves if you knew of such a program. 


I've been working my ass off this year, however (unfortunately) I only realized I *really* wanted to stick with science and do research until it was too late. Meaning that I had plans to go off and get another degree after I was finished with this one and never look back. I developed my passion too late. As such, my GPA stands at about 2.6, or something equally as depressing. I'm really annoyed with myself as I know that this will impact my chances of universities accepting me for any sort of project they have. I feel like I'm at a disadvantage and need to make up for the time I wasted not doing research or making connections in my early university years. 

I guess my questions are

* Do any of your know of a university who runs these types of programs?

* How would I go about applying? I've looked on the internet for a bit and all I've learned is that I should apply to the lab I'm interested in directly, instead of going through the administrative channels.

* Would my year of research experience make up for my incredibly average GPA?

* If I can't get past the GPA issue, is there anything I could put on my resume to help me stand out?

Just as a side note, my main interests are in neurogenetics/neurogenomics, intelligence, consciousness, stem cell research and genetics. I enjoy...building things. "

[What was your favorite part about working with the cast of Lord of the Rings?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sbhw7/hi_i_am_dean_wright_a_film_director_but_used_to/c4cpp68?context=5)|All the Hobbits were awesome!!! As nice as you think they are. Viggo was so f-ing cool. In one scene, his tooth got knocked out when he got hit in the mouth, and he picked it up, shoved it back in, and said he was ready to go. (They stopped the scene and sent him to the dentist of course).
[Thanks so much for doing this AMA!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sbhw7/hi_i_am_dean_wright_a_film_director_but_used_to/c4cpp68?context=5)|Andy Serkis (Gollum) became our best friend...
[How do you feel about the prevalence of 3D?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sbhw7/hi_i_am_dean_wright_a_film_director_but_used_to/c4cofr6?context=5)|I'm as opposite from Jim Cameron and Peter Jackson as I can be on this. I agree with Chris Nolan's recent comments (check out his interview at the DGA site). Movies are already 3D. When you put the glasses on, all you're doing is putting a barrier between the audience and the film, pushing them further away rather than pulling them in.
 |I can't say that I'll never be forced to release a film in 3D, but I can't imagine why I'd choose it.
 |Also - shooting on film is far superior to any digital camera currently being used. I've spent hours (years actually) working with footage from both and there's no comparison. Film has a much wider dynamic range in capturing color and contrast. Projecting digital vs film is less of a concern for me.
[As someone who appreciates well done 3D (even saw waiting until I could see ""Dial M for Murder"" in 3D\) this makes me sad.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sbhw7/hi_i_am_dean_wright_a_film_director_but_used_to/c4cqif1?context=5)|It's my own prejudice.  The keep saying 3D *without* glasses isn't far off however...
 |I think it should be a case by case decision.
[Also, if you're still answering questions, how do you feel about 3D for animated movies?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sbhw7/hi_i_am_dean_wright_a_film_director_but_used_to/c4cu08h?context=5)|3D for animation makes sense if the film is designed that way. I have to say I'm happy watching almost every film in 2D though...
[Any thoughts on The Hobbit being filmed and projected at 48 fps?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sbhw7/hi_i_am_dean_wright_a_film_director_but_used_to/c4crqoo?context=5)|That's going to be really interesting to watch.  I believe I read somewhere that it was still going to be projected at 24fps - so it'll be fun to see how it all comes out...
[What was the weirdest thing ever to happen to you at work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sbhw7/hi_i_am_dean_wright_a_film_director_but_used_to/c4coeeh?context=5)|Hmmm...  Good question....  I'll come back with more - but right off I can mention that I had to paint out all the dust spots on Kate Winslet's breasts on the famous shot where she's posing nearly naked for Jack. Frame by frame.... 
[Oh that must have been SO terrible lol.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sbhw7/hi_i_am_dean_wright_a_film_director_but_used_to/c4cpyjq?context=5)|Again, my first VFX job. I wondered, are they all going to be like this??
[What do you mean by dust spots? Literal dust on her skin? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sbhw7/hi_i_am_dean_wright_a_film_director_but_used_to/c4cr006?context=5)|When the film was scanned, dust was picked up and needed to be painted out - or you'd see annoying pops everywhere.
[Did you work with Matador? Or perhaps an early version of Nuke?  Awesome AMA by the way, thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sbhw7/hi_i_am_dean_wright_a_film_director_but_used_to/c4cvfvq?context=5)|I think it was Matador actually. I wasn't a proper digital artist, but it was all hands on deck (pardon the metaphor), so everyone got work to do. I didn't mind it too much... :)
[What's been your favourite film to work on? (Besides your own\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sbhw7/hi_i_am_dean_wright_a_film_director_but_used_to/c4cog8f?context=5)|Terminator 2 - was my first BIG feature film and it was awesome working with Jim. It was the beginning of my stumbling onto projects that would somehow always become the most difficult movies ever made (at that time).
 |Lord of the Rings - what an incredible experience helping make the books I loved so much come to life - plus living in NZ. But the best part - Peter let me be a 2nd Unit Director for him on The Return of the King, mentoring me while he was editing the film.
[Is 2nd Unit Director a big role? I think that is currently what Andy Serkis is doing for The Hobbit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sbhw7/hi_i_am_dean_wright_a_film_director_but_used_to/c4cuoqt?context=5)|Depends on the movie. For Peter - it can be huge because there's so much footage needed.
[*, mentoring me while he was editing the film.*  Would you be so kind as to share what wisdom he conveyed to you? :3.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sbhw7/hi_i_am_dean_wright_a_film_director_but_used_to/c4cu8n1?context=5)|I can't put it into words and give it justice. Both Jim Rygiel and I got to direct for 2 months with Peter watching what we were doing, guiding us, letting us try stuff, steering us back when we didn't capture what he needed.  Having those conversations and then watching how it all came together was the ultimate lesson in filmmaking from a master. I can't thank him enough...
[What exactly did you work on in Titanic or LotR? I'll be sure to check out your new movie!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sbhw7/hi_i_am_dean_wright_a_film_director_but_used_to/c4coerk?context=5)|I was the Visual Effects (VFX) Production Manager on Titanic. I was originally hired to help produce the miniature shoot (miniatures of course meaning 200-300 foot sections of the ship that we would crack and smash and sink in a tank we built in Acton, CA). I then moved over to help manage the digital side and had the extreme pleasure to be the person who had to face the execs at 20th Century Fox when we told them we couldn't finish the film in time, pushing the release date from July to December. (it all worked out okay!)
 |On LOTR, I was the VFX Producer for The Two Towers and Return of the King. I ended up moving over to the Narnia films afterwards ultimately living in New Zealand almost 7 of the last 10 yearsd.
[Maybe it's the few years of programming I dabbled in, but does anyone else always notice unclosed parenthesis?  Edit: he fixed it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sbhw7/hi_i_am_dean_wright_a_film_director_but_used_to/c4cs76q?context=5)|I spotted it as soon as I posted it... left it that way to see how many other OCD people like me there were....
[Could you elaborate about the Fox execs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sbhw7/hi_i_am_dean_wright_a_film_director_but_used_to/c4cs5s6?context=5)|I (along with the CEO, lawyers, etc from DD) sat across the table from about 20 Fox execs explaining what happened and why it was going to cost millions more...
[I've heard that the filming of Titanic was quite harsh for the cast or stunt doubles ... But what about the rest of the crew? Did you still enjoy the experience?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sbhw7/hi_i_am_dean_wright_a_film_director_but_used_to/c4ctx8c?context=5)|It was a great experience, and nearly all of VFX crew knew we were working on something very special. Of course no one could have predicted the success it ultimately enjoyed, but at the time, we were all killing ourselves to make it great.  Part of that came from fighting the strange desire floating through Hollywood that truly wanted the film to fail. Many people were openly hostile to it - really annoyed that Jim would be so bold in making a $200mil movie about the Titanic (the biggest budget for its time). In *Daily Variety*, there was a column every day called ""Titanic Watch"", where they printed the latest *bad* news - all of course signaling the imminent disaster mirroring that which the film depicted.  The film didn't open to huge numbers either. It was solid, but not spectacular, but it just kept going... on and on... until it became a phenomenon. Interestingly, the film just opened up in China over the weekend posting the largest numbers ever for any movie.  I've seen this on many films, we as filmmakers knew what we had, but no one else did or believed in us. Success has many authors...
[I would like to know their reactions after the Billion income .](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sbhw7/hi_i_am_dean_wright_a_film_director_but_used_to/c4cv2ug?context=5)|All was forgiven, Jim even got the points back (profit participation) he had given up to convince Fox to pay for the cost overruns.
 |Remember, the same thing happened with Avatar. No one was going to see a movie about tall blue smurf-like aliens...
[*no one (except Jim\) knew it was going to be a smash hit.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sbhw7/hi_i_am_dean_wright_a_film_director_but_used_to/c4cu1bg?context=5)|Jim knows everything... trust me.
[Best advice for someone with a B.S. in Film wanting to break into the industry, but living in the middle of nowhere? Do you feel that you need to be in a certain place with thriving industry work like California or Louisiana to get started? Also, thank you for doing this!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sbhw7/hi_i_am_dean_wright_a_film_director_but_used_to/c4cpste?context=5)|I got my start working on films (and TV movies) in Arizona after film school. I ended up working there for about 3 years making contacts before moving to Los Angeles. I worked really hard trying to make an impression on the LA crew.
 |Once I got here, I had a number of people I could contact (borderline harass) until I got my first job. After that, one gig led to the next, and so on...
[How many directors in Hollywood do you suspect of being members of the Communist Party?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sbhw7/hi_i_am_dean_wright_a_film_director_but_used_to/c4cp3s5?context=5)|None that I've met!
[How is Pete Jackson like in real life? I bet he is the coolest person on the planet.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sbhw7/hi_i_am_dean_wright_a_film_director_but_used_to/c4cpm75?context=5)|PJ (as he's known down there) IS the coolest guy on the planet. He loves movies, all the coolest geek stuff (his Laserdisc collection was 10x mine!), appreciates everyone who works for him, and built a state of the art new Hollywood in Wellington, NZ!!
[How many hours a week did you put in for the movies? I've heard people of those occupations can put in over a hundred hours a week.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sbhw7/hi_i_am_dean_wright_a_film_director_but_used_to/c4cofhh?context=5)|My partner, Jim R (who won 3 Oscars for LOTR), and I worked 18-22 hours a day, 7 days a week, for 7 months to complete The Return of the King in order to make the release date!
[Why were you not nominated along with him and the others for the Oscar? Seems a bit unfair given you out the same amount of time as him.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sbhw7/hi_i_am_dean_wright_a_film_director_but_used_to/c4cqeto?context=5)|VFX Producers aren't eligible for the Academy Award (by strict rule). I was very happy to watch my very good friends win theirs - plus I picked up a VFX Society award (which specifically mandated that the VFX Producers must be included).
 |Ironically, I became a VFX Supervisor on the Narnia films, and was nominated for *The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe*, but lost to all my friends back at Weta who made this little movie called *King Kong*!
 |I love many VFX houses, but I have to say that Weta Digital is the best in the world! - for now! ;)
[Nice work. That must have been very draining. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sbhw7/hi_i_am_dean_wright_a_film_director_but_used_to/c4cq1zu?context=5)|I felt like Sam and Frodo on the side of Mt. Doom, with the entrance always just above us...
[Sorry for the invasive/personal question, feel free to disregard it, but do you have any form of ADD/ADHD or OCD?

It actually helped me in my role as a VFX Supervisor/Producer as I had literally thousands of shots and details to track on these massively huge productions and I was able to keep my focus in constant movement to deal with everything.
 |I wasn't diagnosed though until I became a director, as I began to notice my mind wandering when interviewing actors.
 |I'm much better now... :)
[Do you remember USA, Mr. Wright? It'll be spring soon and the orchards will be in blossom, and the birds will be nesting in the hazel thicket.

Do you remember the taste of strawberries?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sbhw7/hi_i_am_dean_wright_a_film_director_but_used_to/c4cqea8?context=5)|Hahahaha...  I'll tell you, when I heard the music for that scene for the first time, it really helped inspire me to make it through (I told Fran and Howard that as well).
[What is one film you would want to do a remake of because you know the effects could be done better?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sbhw7/hi_i_am_dean_wright_a_film_director_but_used_to/c4cpurm?context=5)|Don't kill me, but remaking a film like Forbidden Planet would be very cool... (it's actually already in development at Fox with Mr. Cameron producing).

[Are there any movies you hope to make in the future (in terms of plot\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sbhw7/hi_i_am_dean_wright_a_film_director_but_used_to/c4cooga?context=5)|I really want to do a great sci-fi action adventure (that I wrote) that deals with figuring out what exactly this universe we all live in is!!
[How'd you get into Visual Effects? It's an area that's always been fairly interesting to me, as I am a computer science major with a film minor. Took a class on computer graphics that was pretty interesting and would appreciate some tips for getting more involved.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sbhw7/hi_i_am_dean_wright_a_film_director_but_used_to/c4coiof?context=5)|I had worked on films with VFX (T2 for example), but hadn't worked in the field until I was hired to be the VFX Production Manager for Digital Domain (Jim Cameron's VFX company at the time) to oversee the miniature shoot - because of my live action experience - as the physical shooting work was a massive effort. Once there, I moved into the digital side and never looked back. What type of computer work interests you?
[Sorry for highjacking; but I've just finished a degree in multimedia design where I focused on 3D and vfx stuff.  I used Maya for a couple years, but went to 3ds Max (with a few other programs / plug-ins; Vue, FumeFX\) for a few jobs I've had, and I use After Effects for compositing.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sbhw7/hi_i_am_dean_wright_a_film_director_but_used_to/c4cq25r?context=5)|I will reply to this - give me a little time - don't want to gloss over the answer.
[Is there anything else I should know, program wise (I'm sure more I know is handy, but anything detrimental?\), or film knowledge wise? I'm not 100% sure where I want to go with it; pure vfx, and compositing, or something else; unfortunately where I am other than mine site visuals, there isn't much 'fun' stuff.  How would I best go further?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sbhw7/hi_i_am_dean_wright_a_film_director_but_used_to/c4cq25r?context=5)|Those are great packages to know. Nuke (see below) is a great compositing package - it was the in-house developed compositing s/w at Digital Domain and we loved it. The programmers also wrote a flame to nuke script to help get the work done (the flames were VERY much in demand).
[Is there anything that you recommend for building rapport / anything specific people who hire look for? (Outside of *knowing* people for a job, what do you look for personally?\) Creative styles? Being better (focusing\) on a few small talents / or more a jack of all trades kinda thing.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sbhw7/hi_i_am_dean_wright_a_film_director_but_used_to/c4cq25r?context=5)|Obviously the more proficient you get at specific skill sets (character animation, 3D lighting, effects animation, compositing, texture or matte painting, etc.), the more in demand you will be regardless of the specific software. Some companies have their own proprietary stuff and you'll have to learn something new anyway. The skill set will transfer.
[Wish I had something a little more interesting to ask ...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sbhw7/hi_i_am_dean_wright_a_film_director_but_used_to/c4cq25r?context=5)|The one thing I think would help you as an artist even more is the basic understanding of filmmaking as a craft. How the Cinematographer lights the set, how he/she moves the camera and more importantly - why, what the real physics are on a movie set, and so on. It makes a huge difference in the quality of the work and the success of the shot if it's produced with the same philosophy as the live action work.
[Anyways, I wanted to ask.. did you always have a vague carrier path in mind, that would lead you to directing? It seems that I'll be in a pretty big vfx department surrounded by many people doing almost the same thing as me, and it'll be hard to make any progress carrier wise with so much competition.  Also, I've personally never minded working long hours, but I've been  hearing lots of people complain about being put into this position and being taken advantage of. Whats your opinion on this? I guess, as long as you are being compensated enough, and the work is something you truly believe in, and you're doing something you feel is important, its worth it in the end?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sbhw7/hi_i_am_dean_wright_a_film_director_but_used_to/c4cqw4h?context=5)|I always wanted to be a director, but I kept getting jobs on the physical production side. Once I moved into Visual Effects, I found myself suddenly on the creative side, which is where I wanted to be. It still took another 10 years before Peter Jackson (and our producer Barrie Osborne) took a chance letting me get behind the camera.

[What is the most complicated project you have worked on for any of the movies?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sbhw7/hi_i_am_dean_wright_a_film_director_but_used_to/c4coo7p?context=5)|Great question - tough answer. The most complicated films are of course the ones I mentioned (Titanic, LOTR &amp; yes - Narnia). They all required creating technologies that didn't exist prior to our efforts to produce the work(Titanic - CG water, Mocap; LOTR - massive armies, CG Gollum; Narnia - tons of CG characters that had to act), all combined multiple disciplines (live action shooting, miniatures, cutting edge CG, animation, etc.), and all had impossible deadlines.
 |The one connecting thread through them all was the passion from everyone involved to do whatever was necessary to deliver the best work ever seen, for our directors and for the audience.
 |If I had to pick one - I'd say Lord of the Rings - especially the third one (The Return of the King). We produced nearly 2000 shots in less than a year while PJ was still shooting and editing the film. 
[How did you get into the field?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sbhw7/hi_i_am_dean_wright_a_film_director_but_used_to/c4coy47?context=5)|Like many, started making movies in grade school (Super 8 camera) and when I turned in a movie instead of an essay and got an A, I was hooked.
 |I went to the University of Arizona, studied the Fine Arts along with filmmaking. Once out - I started at the bottom, a Production Assistant, and worked my way up for the next 20+ years.
 |At times I would wonder why some kids would come out of film school and start directing, and yet I was taking this long strange road, but in the end - I'll be a much better director now, having learned so much from great filmmakers and actually doing a lot of the jobs (or overseeing them) that I must rely on to make my own movies.
[I am currently a Production student at the University of Florida, and I was wondering what the best process would be for finding jobs in the business. I am more than willing to start out as a Production assistant, or something of the like. However, I have been having trouble finding even just an internship to help me get experience. I graduate in a year and I'm kind of freaking out about it haha. How should I go about finding and applying for these jobs? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sbhw7/hi_i_am_dean_wright_a_film_director_but_used_to/c4cr1ge?context=5)|I was unstoppable in contacting the film commission, local crew members, anyone I could in trying to land a gig out of film school. My resume was very feathered with all my school films listed as my ""work experience"". In the end, it was a letter I wrote to a production coordinator that expressed my passion and desire to work tirelessly that got me an interview, and then the job. She ended up hiring me years later in LA as her assistant. We worked on a number of projects together, the last one being Terminator 2. (She's now a below-the-line agent)
[Is Eva Longoria as nice as she is attractive?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sbhw7/hi_i_am_dean_wright_a_film_director_but_used_to/c4cogyv?context=5)|She's very lovely and amazingly supportive (and just as stunning in person). She gives a great performance in my film (surprising some people who didn't realize her range). 
[When you say VFX on LOTR, did that involve the scenes with scale models of Minas Tirith? What were the main parts you worked on; if it can be narrowed down to that? Will be sure to check out your film too!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sbhw7/hi_i_am_dean_wright_a_film_director_but_used_to/c4cpd4o?context=5)|Yes - my responsibilities as VFX Producer included overseeing the Miniatures team. Richard Taylor's Weta Workshop built most of the Minis, and Alex Funke's team photographed them. We shot many different scales  of the models depending on how close we needed to get to them (and the specific shot design). (I'll continue with more details in a bit..)
[The matte paintings.... phenomenally done and seamlessly meshed! Would that be your doing, an editors or both?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sbhw7/hi_i_am_dean_wright_a_film_director_but_used_to/c4cq5yf?context=5)|While the Matte paintings were supervised by our VFX Art Department - which was under my wing - I can't take any credit for how great they were. Alan Lee is one of the greatest Tolkien illustrators ever. Peter convinced Alan to be a part of the original conceptual design team, then Alan slid into an Set Decorator role (actually painting the sets), then in post, he moved over to VFX. Alan - with help from Jeremy Bennett - provided all the designs for the environments to everyone (Weta Workshop - to build the minis, Alex F - to shoot them, and Weta Digital - to create the matte paintings), then supervised their weaving together for all the VFX shot work.
 |Alex and Jeremy also traveled across NZ shooting stills to provide the photographic elements necessary to build the digital cycloramas.
[What's your thought on this Dean? I've heard some people in the film industry 'look down' on the game industry. Would you, if asked, consider making the transition from one to another?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sbhw7/hi_i_am_dean_wright_a_film_director_but_used_to/c4cqh0c?context=5)|I don't think anyone looks down on anyone in games anymore.

[Roto / paint is becoming a career in its own right. As directors get more comfortable with VFX work they want a lot more complex cleanup doing, often without bothering to shoot clean plates.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sbhw7/hi_i_am_dean_wright_a_film_director_but_used_to/c4cuo29?context=5)|It's a great entry into the VFX world too. Then as you demonstrate more ability, you get more challenging work. 
[After film school work has been so hard to find because I took a writing/directing craft track. I still want to direct but I need to be able to pay my bills living in NYC. How should I proceed? Should I spend time learning a whole new craft (editing, camera operation\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sbhw7/hi_i_am_dean_wright_a_film_director_but_used_to/c4cphj4?context=5)|I think there are two paths - you continue writing and directing movies you can produce yourself and then show those to people and parley that into a gig. Or you go to work on a production and learn the business from the ground up. You can keep writing and making movies on the side (when you have time), but this way you'll make a living and meet the people that just might ultimately one day give you a shot. 
[For someone graduating with a Math BS, are there job positions on the movie set for people like me?

 |Depends on what interests you...  Math and visual effects go very well together...
[How do you feel about the current hot-button issues facing the VFX industry today, like regional tax subsidies and the war being waged on artists' wages and benefits? Do you support unionizing, or a trade association?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sbhw7/hi_i_am_dean_wright_a_film_director_but_used_to/c4cpysp?context=5)|These are really tough issues. I've worked all over the world because of the tax rebates. I think California is finally on the right track (yes - Arnold did get this done), but it's not enough. There are many states and countries willing to subsidize the local film industry including visual effects and other post production areas, and pretending like it's not necessary is like sticking your head in the sand.
 |Sure, in a fair competitive market, it wouldn't be necessary. Unfortunately, that's not the world we live in right now, and Producers and Studios will produce the work for the least possible cost as long as they can get the quality the projects demand.

I'm not sure which houses have union crews and which don't now, and since many companies provide PH&amp;W, I'm sure it's even more complex than before. Bottom line, the crews need to be compensated fairly and have health insurance and the like. The VFX crews are a huge contributor to the production of the biggest box office hits, and they shouldn't be treated any less than the production and other post-production crews.

I'm studying to be a teacher in Quebec, I just applied and will be starting my B.Ed in the fall

In total there are 4 interships :

2x 140 hours

2x 210 hours

I'm very curious as to how those hours are separated.

- Is it  spread out through the 4-month semester, meaning I would have one day of internship per week?

- Is it an intensive 3 to 5 weeks full time in a school?

I'm planning on speaking to an advisor and asking all of these questions, but I figured I'd ask here as well.

Oh and a bonus questions : 
If it is 3 - 5 weeks intensive, how did you guys cope with your current jobs and paying rent?

sc4y2,60,2012-04-16,What is the number one problem with the U.S. education system?,PirateLogic,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/sc4y2/what_is_the_number_one_problem_with_the_us/,"This may have been asked before, but I couldn't find it, and I'm curious to know what reddit thinks. To get things started, I'll say this:

The state of the U.S. education system has always infuriated me. There are so many issues and it seems that there is no consensus on where we should start. Because nobody else could figure it out, one genius came forward and threw out this gem: Children are failing at school, so we obviously need to make it easier.

My biggest problem with the U.S. education system is that students aren't being held responsible for their laziness and lack of effort. Officials are dumbing the system down and making everything easier to get students to pass. Students are catching on to this – whether they realize it or not – and it's making them become incredibly lazy. The parents, in turn, go to the principle and blame the school who blames the teacher for being too hard on the student. This vicious circle repeats it self and the entire system cracks a little bit more during each cycle. 

The fact of the matter is that students aren't being held responsible for what is, more than likely, their own fault. Of course there are situations where it is legitimately not the student's fault, but it seems to be the popular reaction for parents to blame others for their child's failures before having all of the facts.

Another problem is that everyone is scared of their child's feelings being hurt. Name calling seems to be such a big deal these days; one student calls another student a slut and the next day both parents are in the principles office having a shouting match. A much more efficient solution would be for both students to grow up. Children in our country are being babied to the point that they can't take care of themselves while we all just sit by and let it happen. Why don't we do something about it?

I'm a computer science student and I feel very strongly about the state of our country's education system. It saddens me to realize that there is no hope of fixing the numerous other problems we have if we can't even educate the country's adolescents. I feel that everyone should have something they feel strongly about and my goal for next summer is to get an internship at a company like [Khan Academy](http://www.khanacademy.org/). For those of you who don't know about Khan Academy, it is an alternative, open learning platform for students who aren't satisfied with their current education. Maybe my impact on the overall problem will be minimal, but at least I'll be doing something, as opposed to talking about it.

What say you, reddit?

**TL;DR** The U.S. education system sucks. Why?"
sc4da,4,2012-04-16,Should I stay an extra year? ,anonymousperson12345,SBU,https://www.reddit.com/r/SBU/comments/sc4da/should_i_stay_an_extra_year/,"Okay so I am approaching the time when I have to decide what to do for the rest of my undergraduate time. I have the requirements to enroll in the health science program, which is necessary to complete my major. However, the conditions of getting into the program is that I have to graduate right after I complete the program. I cannot stay an extra semester (for this undergraduate degree) to take any more classes - that means no additional minors, majors, anything. (This is what the academic adviser told me. Correct me if I am wrong.) So now I have to think about whether I should delay my graduation for an entire year since the program begins in fall only. I just do not know if it is worth staying an entire year to finish recommended requirements for graduate school which I do not know if I even want to attend in the first place. However, I also feel like I am not emotionally prepared for graduation. On a professional level, I lack internships and job experience. On a personal level, I felt like I never got to truly enjoy college. I am a transfer student so my experience had been mostly stressful, from disliking my old school, the process of transferring schools, and the adjustment period to Stony Brook. Perhaps an additional year could give me some time to actually enjoy college. So in summary, the pros/cons list I came up with for staying an extra year is: 

pros 
- more time for internships/jobs 
- more time to enjoy college
- take the classes I possibly need for graduate school and maybe some other classes I want to take for myself 
- will be much more ready for graduation and the future in general
- can complete a minor

cons 
- $ (The financial aid adviser said I would qualify for a pell grant in my 5th year. However, I am not in EOP so I will not get TAP for my fifth year. I do have plans however to maybe find a place to live off-campus and of course, to get a job.) 
- time

I have two questions:

**What are the options available out there for short term employment in the auto industry?**
I wouldn't be looking for much pay. I would ideally like to work with a racing team, however I don't have too much experience and I was hoping it would be more of a learning experience for myself. I do not have a long summer (2 months) because my school is converting to semesters from quarters, which makes job hunting even more difficult. I was not able to find an internship for this summer so I am exploring my options. 

**If I can't find employment, what would be a decent way to gain car knowledge?**
I am considering do a rebuild of an older car (something like an air-cooled VW bug, MG, or Triumph), however I am worried about the cost of this, being a college student. I have an early 2000's civic as my DD, and don't really want to modify it. The most I've done to it is install a K&amp;N air filter. I am aware any rebuilds will take time and money. The max I would want to spend, car + parts total would be 8000 in the next 2-3 years. However, if this is a good route to take, I would be willing to spend a large amount of time over the summer on this car.

I'm stuck between two colleges.  One is a prestigious state school, the other a prestigious private school.  One a Big-Ten university, the other a smaller, 10,000 odd class.  I feel very comfortable at both Unis.  

My problem lies in the benefits of attending each school.  If I go to the state school I would end up owing 28,000 dollars less than if I attended the private, but I would likely end up attending for a year more.  If I go to the private, I incur more debt but have a more hands-on faculty which provides references and internships much more easily than the state school.

I am planning to major in biomedical engineering right now, and both schools have excellent facilities. I am a top-notch student within the top 98th percentile of my highschool class, and would walk on with enough credits to both schools to qualify as a sophomore.

Alright, so anyway, a little bit about me. I'm a 21 yr old female and I'm graduating this May with a degree in mechanical engineering. My hope is to go into military engineering (I'm not nearly special enough to have an actual job, but I have a cool internship). If that last sentence does not agree with your beliefs in any way, no offense, but you need not apply.  In my spare time I love riding my horses, working on cars, going to the range, and going mudding. I'm into country music, although I will give anything with a good beat a chance. I also read quite a bit and game on occasion. FPS and RPGs are my favorites.

I tried posting this to /r/legaladvice but with no prevail. 

Yesterday at school, I received my second marijuana and paraphernalia possession charge.  I'm really scared, and not sure what's going to happen to me. 
I'm 17. I live in Utah.


I'll lay the information I have on the table from the first offense:

* First charge was almost a year ago for possession of less than a gram of marijuana, and paraphernalia for the plastic bag that it was in

* I was out past the city's curfew too and received a curfew violation

* 3.5 accumulative high school GPA (current as well)

**After court:**

* I kept my license

* Charges are being held in abeyance for a year

* was given 50 hours community service

* roughly $400 in fines

* Lowest form of probation (I've never been drug tested by the courts)

- I have been smoking marijuana regularly since



Yesterday, I received my second offense:


 I was at school and  recieved a text from a girl that I got to school with saying ""I think the cops are searching your car"".  About at that moment an office aid walked through the door of my classroom and told me I was needed at the office. She escorted me down there, and when I arrived found two k9 unit police officers. The officer asked me if there was anything in my truck that he should know about. I occasionally smoke in my truck, but had since vacuumed, so I wasn't *too* worried. I told the officer there was nothing, and he told me he was going to search it. I asked him if he had a warrant. His reply was ""It's on school property, there's signs all over, I'm searching it"". 
  They made me stand 10 feet away while they tore up in the inside of my truck. They couldn't find anything so they began *picking* through my carpet until they found 5-6  months old marijuana shakes. probably no more than 6 centigrams in weight. 

He then demanded that I hand over my iPhone. I told him he needed a warrant for that, and he claimed the same thing as the truck: ""It's on school property. Either you give it to me or I confiscate it for evidence."" I gave it to him. He began reading through my texts, found my texts to a friend where we were talking about him buying  possibly 3 oz of marijuana.
He was immediately interested and demanded to know who this friend was. I refused to tell him, so he began taking pictures on his phone of my phone and the conversation. 

He also found texts to my other buddy that day, talking about our plans to smoke at lunch. He took pictures of all of those too. He took pictures of conversations where I was talking about smoking an entire ounce, also conversations where I talk about having the ""best weed i've ever had"", Conversations where I admit that I was high in the text messages. 

He also found pictures of pipes and other paraphernalia that people have sent me before.

He then demanded to search my house. My parents were not up for this so he told them he was going to get a warrant, and that he had enough evidence on my phone for one. He made a deal with my parents that if we gave consent, then he would only search my bedroom.

There was nothing in my room, so I agreed. He came to my house, I handed him some old paraphernalia that was in there, and he took it without adding any charges.

They're really interested in finding out who my friend is with the three oz is.

**Second Offense**

* Possession of controlled substance
 
* Voided my plea in abeyance

* Possession of paraphernalia

* I was also suspended from school for the rest of the year

**Things that could possibly lighten my punishment:**

* I've made the final choice to be done with drugs, and marijuana completely, and plan to test clean on my court date

* 3.5 accumulative GPA

* Hopefully will have a job before court

* High chance of me receiving an internship from Microsoft over the summer, that I applied for last month. 

* Clean-cut, no shag. Basically, if you met me you would not categorize me as a ""pothead""

* I'm extremely good with computers and have mastered 7 different coding languages(That may help to show the court that I have some sense of direction in my life??)

* Come from a solid family that owns a well-known business in our small community

Thank you so much for reading over this. I would just like to know what will most likely happen to me, and if anyone out there with the experience could help me, it would make my parents and I feel a lot better




I know that nobody will be able to tell me EXACTLY what will happen to me before court, but now that you know the story, and my charges, I was hoping someone out there, with the right experience, could tell me what they think will most likely happen to me now. 

Thank you so much for reading

I did well there (Dean's List, clubs, etc) but hated Peoria and campus so I transferred back here to CU and am currently taking classes at Parkland.  I intended to go into Agricultural Engineering but turns out I was weeded out in Calc II with Jay Ko.  He doesn't like passing..

Anyway, my madre knows a fuckload of people in ACES and says it's a great program to be involved in, plus the majors I'm most interested in are in ACES. Those majors are NRES and TSM.  I've heard good things about both and I'm meeting with some people this week to learn more about them. I would be grateful if someone could share a few words describing how the classes are, what are your plans after UG, internships, etc.  Thanks."
sepxq,14,2012-04-17,The Benefits of Personal Networking:  How I Got to Play with a Professional Laser-Effects System While Drunk,Chalcedon,MLPLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/MLPLounge/comments/sepxq/the_benefits_of_personal_networking_how_i_got_to/,"*I actually emailed this story to my brother a day ago, and I've rewritten it for here (names obscured, mostly, some details added for background).  It's the story of how a good friend of mine roped me into going to a furcon, then introduced me to a really neat person while I was hammered.  [This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kEjHgFlJ9c) is the best clip I could find of the system I got to mess with, but it really only shows off 1 pattern of the 30 it was capable of, which is a shame.  It's kind of a long ramble, but I've tried to make it funny.  It's also a solid example of:  ""It's all in who you know.""*

It started inauspiciously.  After much gnashing of teeth and a bit of panic, I obtained a job for this summer in Farmington Hills, Michigan (basically Detroit).  The job itself was excellent, having a competitive salary and a generous housing stipend that was to cover the majority of a furnished apartment for myself and the two other interns I was to be rooming with.  The company I was interning with had recommended two apartment complexes to stay in.

I had resolved to go up to the Detroit area to see the apartments for myself before making any choices about where I was staying.  Enter one of my best friends, who I'll call Aestuo.  Aestuo, before transferring to a different college midway through Sophomore year, was my roommate.  After he found out I was going to Detroit, he immediately perked up and suggested a weekend.  When asked why, he simply said ""Oh, a group of us are going to a furcon up there.""

Now, while I love Aestuo to death, and after living with him for a year and a half am no stranger to the furry community, I had no intention of going to a furcon.  However, he won me over with a few simple concessions:

1)  The group would pay for my gas

2)  Staying with the group would drastically cut my hotel cost

3)  He'd pay for my badge

4)  FCN, the con we'd be attending, was well known for the quality of its Saturday night rave and light show

and most importantly 5)  The group would pay for any libations I desired that weekend.

At this point, despite my initial reluctance, what essentially amounted to a weekend in Detroit for $30+food and getting to chill with a good friend that I get to see maybe twice a year was enough to win me over.  I acquiesced and arranged my weekend plans around this con I was now going to.

I'll leave the details of the con itself to the imagination.  Let it simply be known that it was one of the more surreal experiences of my life and that some things, once seen, cannot be unseen. It wasn't a bad time overall, just... a strange one.  But I digress.

Saturday night began as expected.  For those unaware of general con culture, during 3-day cons Saturday tends to be the night things get a hair crazy, when any parties that might happen will happen.  I had begun my Saturday night in grand fashion:  After splitting a bottle of gin with another member of the con group I was with, we traveled over to the main con hotel and proceeded to make our way to a room party.

The room party did not excite... That is, until I found one of the most beautiful sights I have ever laid eyes on:  The was bathtub filled with ice and Killian's Irish Red.  I immediately set up camp and began my grim duty of emptying most of the tub.  About thirty minutes and an indeterminate but gratuitous amount of Killian's later, Aestuo, who is forever sober, came up to me and nudged me:  ""Chalc, we've gotta go.""

I had no intention of leaving this *gorgeous* monument to debauchery.  However, my somewhat-slurred objections died on my lips as he pointed out a rather irritated looking guy standing in the corner and whispered: ""That's the host.""  Said guy was giving me a glare which very clearly translated to:  ""You have 10 seconds to excuse yourself or be forcibly excused.""  After looking from him to the impressive collection of bottles I had created, I took the hint and abandoned ship with Aestuo.

Feeling a bit sheepish, a bit like an ass, and a bit too hammered to really continue drinking anyway, I quickly realized that I was being led to the elevators by Aestuo.  Upon inquiring where we were going, he simply responded ""We're going to meet Fizz.""

Over the course of the weekend, I had discovered something:  Aestuo spent most of his time at cons attempting to meet people he found interesting, or that were in senior positions at the con.  It was why he was able to get me into the con on the cheap (in with the administration), why he was on a first-name basis with Kage (who is apparently a big deal among furries), and why he was able to introduce me to ""Fizz,"" who was apparently in charge of lighting and effects for the rave currently thumping along in the main ballroom.  Fizz also apparently built custom laser and lighting show systems for places like Disney's park in California.

Down on the main floor, I was taken to the bar and lead to a built man with a blonde mohawk, who turned, cordially greeted Aestuo, and introduced himself to me as Fizz.  As we began talking, I quickly remembered two things about myself:  I really, REALLY like talking about things in my field, and alcohol makes me extremely chatty.  These two things combined led Fizz and I on a winding conversation covering topics from Fast Fourier Transforms of laser waveforms, efficient assembly for TI C6000 series DSPs, using Bezier curves to track paths for individual lasers in systems to follow, and all manner of technical jargon relevant to the design of the circuits and programs that comprise lighting systems.  I was actually fascinated that I was able to lucidly discuss things I hadn't dealt with in years while occasionally shaking my head to keep Fizz from completing the mitosis he appeared to be attempting.

After something around forty minutes, Fizz leaned in kind of close and said:  ""Do you want to go to the booth?""  My heart skipped a few beats:  ""What booth?""  Fizz leaned in a little closer:  ""The booth where laser system's control panel is.""  At this point, I held in a bieber-fan-esque squeal of joy and just nodded dumbly.  I was beginning to sober up, and as we wandered towards the sound of pumping bass it was difficult to suppress my mounting excitement.

Once inside, we quickly arrived at a simple control setup:  There was a touchscreen with about 30 different patterns displayed, and a basic control board with 8 sliders and a number of buttons.  Fizz explained that this was the previous version of the control software and upcoming versions would look better.  He then sat down and showed me how it worked:  Select a pattern, and the sliders automatically move to default locations on the board.  You could then modify things such as pattern size, speed, color, and intensity with the sliders, and using one specific button you could pause a pattern for effect.  After explaining the system and letting us watch him work, Fizz looked at me and said:  ""Hey, the next set is an Electro-House set.  I'm going to go back to the bar.  Do you want to take the system for it?""

My jaw dropped.  Yes.  Yes I did want to take the system.  I had sobered up enough to grasp it adequately, and as the set started, I settled in for what would become one of the best hours of my life.  I was pretty awful for about the first ten minutes, but I quickly got in the groove and made some effects I was extremely proud of.

As the set wore down, another person who was *actually* on the AV staff came and replaced me.  I wandered back to the bar where Fizz was, thanked him, found Aestuo, and retired back to my room.  Sunday rolled around, and after I felt well enough to be vertical I made sure to track down and thank Fizz while sober.  We had a short conversation involving swaps of contact information, then went our separate ways.

The rest of the weekend went down as expected:  I had to leave early and drag a few unwilling people from the con group to my car to leave.  I drove the 4 hours to drop them off, and then the 3 hours to get back home in time to make a meeting with a project group and client.

I don't really think I'll be able to top this past Saturday for a while.  It was an absolute ball.  Either way, that's the story of how a buddy of mine knew some people and got me an in to do some really cool stuff.

seo49,1,2012-04-17,My new internship and testing,[deleted],trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/seo49/my_new_internship_and_testing/,"I've been dry for almost a month in anticipation of an internship I applied for (which starts at the end of May). They told me at the interview that there would be a drug test so I haven't smoked since (I know I'll be fine for that one).

"" You will be required to participate in a 
drug testing program as a condition of employment on a random unannounced 
basis, in the event of a work-related accident or injury, and in the event there is 
""reasonable suspicion"" that you are using a controlled substance.""

The ""random unannounced"" part is what scares me. Is this normal, or do I have a 12-week dry spell ahead of me?"
senxx,0,2012-04-17,"going abroad this summer, looking for an ultraportable around 400€",allasui,SuggestALaptop,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/senxx/going_abroad_this_summer_looking_for_an/," Hello,

I'll do an internship abroad this summer and I am looking for a laptop that I could bring with me

8) Will you be playing games on your notebook? If so, please state which games or types of games?


I would play with whatever my computer can do, but at least TF2 or N64 will at least be not a problem for actual ultraportable?
 

9) How many hours of battery life do you need?

a good performance/battery life price, but it is **not a crucial point** for me

10) Would you prefer to see the notebooks you're considering before purchasing it or buying a notebook on-line without seeing it is OK?

18) Do you need an optical drive? If yes, a CDRW/DVD-ROM, DVD Burner or Blu-Ray drive?

not really

semma,1,2012-04-17,"I'm worried about a situation with my SO regarding the summer, but he doesn't understand my concerns",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/semma/im_worried_about_a_situation_with_my_so_regarding/,"My boyfriend and I [21] have a great relationship. We've been dating for 7 months, and it's absolutely amazing - the best relationship that I've ever been in. The only thing we don't always agree on is how much space we need - I'm perfectly content not having my own ""personal time"" because I LOVE being around people, but he needs a ""recovery"" day every week where he just completely shuts me (and everyone else) out. This works fine, for the time being, but I'm worried about the summer.

The two of us both got amazing internships on the other side of the country from our hometown...and we were lucky enough to be assigned to the same city. As a result, he suggested we live together. Financially, it makes a ton of sense, and we were both so excited at the idea. I still am, except that this means he won't be able to have the same level of alone time as he's used to.

Every time that I try to talk to him about it, he tells me that the summer will be different from being here at school, and that he'll be fine with the situation, but I'm not so sure. Today, for example, he texted me saying he wasn't going to be around today, ending with ""I've seen you for the past 6 days, ya know?""

I have no problems with him needing space, I just really need peace of mind / advice for what to do to make this summer work out. It's only 3 months, but if he's already echoing concerns about six days, I feel like there's no way that this will end well. When I tried to suggest I find other roommates, he got really upset about it, so I'm torn. Thoughts / advice? I'm sorry for the length; it's really hard to convey everything in one reddit post. 

**TL;DR: My boyfriend and I are planning to spend the summer together, but I'm worried he won't get the personal time he needs. Thoughts / advice?**

seipw,1,2012-04-17,"Charged second time for Possession as a minor. What should I do, and what is going to happen to me?",[deleted],legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/seipw/charged_second_time_for_possession_as_a_minor/,"Yesterday at school, I received my second marijuana and paraphernalia possession charge.  I'm really scared, and not sure what's going to happen to me. 
I'm 17. I live in Utah.


I'll lay the information I have on the table from the first offense:

* First charge was almost a year ago for possession of less than a gram of marijuana, and paraphernalia for the plastic bag that it was in

* I was out past the city's curfew too and received a curfew violation

* 3.5 accumulative high school GPA (current as well)

**After court:**

* I kept my license

* Charges are being held in abeyance for a year

* was given 50 hours community service

* roughly $400 in fines

* Lowest form of probation (I've never been drug tested by the courts)

- I have been smoking marijuana regularly since



Yesterday, I received my second offense:


 I was at school and  recieved a text from a girl that I got to school with saying ""I think the cops are searching your car"".  About at that moment an office aid walked through the door of my classroom and told me I was needed at the office. She escorted me down there, and when I arrived found two k9 unit police officers. The officer asked me if there was anything in my truck that he should know about. I occasionally smoke in my truck, but had since vacuumed, so I wasn't *too* worried. I told the officer there was nothing, and he told me he was going to search it. I asked him if he had a warrant. His reply was ""It's on school property, there's signs all over, I'm searching it"". 
  They made me stand 10 feet away while they tore up in the inside of my truck. They couldn't find anything so they began *picking* through my carpet until they found 5-6  months old marijuana shakes. probably no more than 6 centigrams in weight. 

He then demanded that I hand over my iPhone. I told him he needed a warrant for that, and he claimed the same thing as the truck: ""It's on school property. Either you give it to me or I confiscate it for evidence."" I gave it to him. He began reading through my texts, found my texts to a friend where we were talking about him buying  possibly 3 oz of marijuana.
He was immediately interested and demanded to know who this friend was. I refused to tell him, so he began taking pictures on his phone of my phone and the conversation. 

He also found texts to my other buddy that day, talking about our plans to smoke at lunch. He took pictures of all of those too. He took pictures of conversations where I was talking about smoking an entire ounce, also conversations where I talk about having the ""best weed i've ever had"", Conversations where I admit that I was high in the text messages. 

He also found pictures of pipes and other paraphernalia that people have sent me before.

He then demanded to search my house. My parents were not up for this so he told them he was going to get a warrant, and that he had enough evidence on my phone for one. He made a deal with my parents that if we gave consent, then he would only search my bedroom.

There was nothing in my room, so I agreed. He came to my house, I handed him some old paraphernalia that was in there, and he took it without adding any charges.

They're really interested in finding out who my friend is with the three oz is.

**Second Offense**

* Possession of controlled substance
 
* Voided my plea in abeyance

* Possession of paraphernalia

* I was also suspended from school for the rest of the year

**Things that could possibly lighten my punishment:**

* I've made the final choice to be done with drugs, and marijuana completely, and plan to test clean on my court date

* 3.5 accumulative GPA

* Hopefully will have a job before court

* High chance of me receiving an internship from Microsoft over the summer, that I applied for last month. 

* Clean-cut, no shag. Basically, if you met me you would not categorize me as a ""pothead""

* I'm extremely good with computers and have mastered 7 different coding languages(That may help to show the court that I have some sense of direction in my life??)

* Come from a solid family that owns a well-known business in our small community

Thank you so much for reading over this. I would just like to know what will most likely happen to me, and if anyone out there with the experience could help me, it would make my parents and I feel a lot better




I know that nobody will be able to tell me EXACTLY what will happen to me before court, but now that you know the story, and my charges, I was hoping someone out there, with the right experience, could tell me what they think will most likely happen to me now. 

Thank you so much for reading

Visiting for the summer, anything a Guedo should know?",wayofTzu,Colombia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Colombia/comments/sefgp/greetings_rcolombia_visiting_for_the_summer/,"I apologize for the English. My Spanish skills are not yet suitable for this. Some background: I'm coming to Colombia to work an internship in Bogotá, I will be in the city for around 90 days. I currently study Environmental Engineering in The South Eastern United States. My plan is to work in developing regions of South America after graduation. This internship is my first experience in Latin America so I'm hoping to learn a little about the various cultures and how to work within them. I love the outdoors so my first plan is to buy a bike when I get there (and sell it when I leave). I've heard so much about the Ciclovia, I cannot wait!

So, /r/Colombia if you have time I have many questions:

Where should I look to buy a bike? I'm hoping to find a mountain bike, I'm a student and therefore price is an issue. 

I'm sure there has to be a million good bike trails in the surrounding mountains. Any suggestions on where I can find them? 

I'm not very interested in the highly commercial areas that attract tourist. I'd like to get a feel for the real Bogotá. Any good social places I should look into? Any I should avoid?

The company that has set me up with the internship is seeking a place for me to live, a small apartment would be ideal. Any areas I should recommend they look?

I'm not one for style but I'd like to avoid standing out as a gringo tourist. What cloths always make foreigners stand out?

What do I not know I don't know? I mean, what is the most important piece of advice you have?

Thanks so much for your time /r/Colombia!"

My question is not really technical/in-depth but more about the general philosophy of things. I am currently working as a research intern on a big project that aims at providing industrial actors with an environment for developing critical embedded systems. 

Typically, the company can input its own domain-specific modeling languages and generate a whole lot of tools like code editor, graphical editor, simulator, code generator, etc... from their metamodels.

For those of you who are not familiar with MDA/MDD, i'll use the definitions from [modeling-languages.com](http://modeling-languages.com)
&gt;MBE (model-based engineering) process is a process in which software models play an important role although they are not necessarily the key artifacts of the development (i.e. they do NOT “drive” the process as in MDD)

&gt;MDD is a development paradigm that uses models as the primary artifact of the development process.

&gt;MDA is the OMG’s particular vision of MDD and thus relies on the use of OMG standards. Therefore, MDA can be regarded as a subset of MDD

I would like to know from anyone involved in the computer science field / software engineering what are your thoughts on MDA/MDD ? Do you think it will become more popular as tools develop, or will it only stick to critical embedded software ? What are your experiences with it?

Also, it is hard to talk about MDA/MDD without mentioning UML or a subset of UML which may often be one of the concerned domain-specific modeling languages. Specifically, what do you think of UML's idea of trying to do everything ? I'm talking about the possibility of execution of UML activity diagrams and/or of UML state machine diagrams.

Thanks for your input !"

se6su,3,2012-04-17,Chicago Golf Recommendations?,HairballJenkins,golf,https://www.reddit.com/r/golf/comments/se6su/chicago_golf_recommendations/,"Sup guys. So I am living in downtown Chicago this summer, new to the city, and am looking for places to play. I work an internship 4 days a week and have nothing to do on the other 3 days. Depending on rates I'd love to get in 2 rounds a week.

The internship pay is a little lower so I would like to find mid level quality for mid level cost.

Anyone know some courses in the Chicago Suburb area? Would it be better to try and get a summer membership somewhere or just play around?

I know there are a lot of courses north of the loop but heard they could be expensive.

Any input appreciated and I'm also looking for people to play with!

Thanks

EDIT: Thanks for the recommendations guys I appreciate it. I am compiling a list of all the places. What do you guys think about a summer membership? I assume I'd save money, especially if I played twice a week but I'd prob get bored of the course?"
sdygo,77,2012-04-17,[Q] Did any of you graduate without any internship or work experience? (AKA am I screwed?),jamaljermaine,compsci,https://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/sdygo/q_did_any_of_you_graduate_without_any_internship/,"As the title says, I'm wondering if any of you graduated without any sort of internship experience and I'm curious about how that turned out for you. I'm a Junior at a University very well known for its CS program, and each day as summer draws closer and I still have yet to hear back from any prospective internship employers (wasn't excellent at applying, did poorly in some interviews due to nerves).  I have a 3.4 technical GPA (freshman year was bad for me, but this isn't absolutely awful considering the school average) and I'm wondering how difficult it is to find work after graduating given that you have no work experience whatsoever.  

Even if I do secure an internship this late (school ends in a month) I would be sacrificing a family vacation to various parts of Asia like Taiwan/Japan, which is an experience that I would love to have.

Essentially I'm asking for stories and advice: Assuming I do get an offer, would you say the internship experience is more valuable than a trip with my family to the other side of the world? Assuming I don't get an internship, would you recommend summer courses to remove a humanities requirement so I can focus more on my academia, trying to get Research with a professor (unlikely grad school, but always a possibility), or trying to find some sort of open source project which I hear is also good to do (though I wouldn't even have any idea where to begin or what to do)?

I used to work for Universal Studios in Orlando.  I lost my job for doing something stupid that was entirely my fault, and I hate myself for it.  I wish I could remove the happy memories from my mind, because all they do is mock me now.  My childhood was terrible, abuse at home and abuse at school.  My Dad used to beat the shit out of my mom, and my mom would passively take it out on me.  At school, I don't know why the other kids hated me.  I still don't know. Those that didn't didn't bully or ridicule me ignored me, which is just as cruel.  Teachers and Principals didn't do shit to help either.  If I told my parents, my mom would come to the school and raise hell, but that only saved me for a few days.  The teachers would lecture or punish my abusers for a few days, but in the end they always went back to their apathy to my problems.  My classmates' cruelty knew no bounds and when my father died of cancer, they smelled blood and tore into the fresh emotional wound like piranhas.  

  All I've ever wanted is to be accepted, to feel loved.  It hurts bad, real bad.  

All my life I've been obsessed with theme parks.  My childhood dream was to design attractions for Disney or Universal.  As soon as I got out of high school, I signed up for an internship program at Walt Disney World in Orlando.  It included housing.  I thought I was beginning a new life and leaving the pain of my childhood behind.  The pain only continued.  I was terrible at my job, because it relied on social skills, which I severely lack.  Being bullied and abused for 20 years will do that to you.

  I was a driver at Kilimanjaro Safaris at Animal Kingdom. I loved that job dearly, and found that ""theming"", a form of acting that theme park workers use to immerse guests in the story of the attraction was something I was good at.  It gave me confidence, but it had a side effect.  I loved that job, but I took it too seriously for my co-workers tastes.  I was obsessed with it and felt like my co-workers were half-assing it.  It was the only thing that mattered to me, and that combined with my lack of social skills drove a wedge between my them and I.  I excelled at driving the truck and acting, but as far as actual customer service went, I was pathetic.  I couldn't deal with conflict at all and stressed out easily.  I made it most of the six months, but I was fired with a week to go over a verbal altercation with another employee.  It wasn't my first.  I have re-applied several times, but I'm pretty sure my managers have made sure that I'll never work for Disney again.  My first adult taste of rejection and the heartbreak that comes with it.  I went back to live with my family in Tampa a broken man.

Fast forward three years to the summer of 2009.  I landed another ""dream"" gig in Orlando at Universal Studios.  I started as a Halloween Horror Nights actor, something I had dreamed of doing since childhood.  Again, a wedge formed between my co-workers and I as I took my job too seriously for their tastes.  I gave it 100% every minute I was doing my job, and felt again that my co-workers didn't put in half the effort I was.  A few even tried explaining it to me, saying that to them it was just a job and that they didn't feel like trying so hard.  To me, that was akin to blasphemy.  My superiors were always glowing in their reviews of my performance, but ""Actor of the Year"" went to one of the social butterflies that had tried to convince me to ""tone it down"".  I was livid, but held my tongue.  

   I then applied for transfer to Jaws, as it was an acting role that I felt was well suited to my talents.  I had already found kindred spirits at the attraction, people that had the same level of enthusiasm for the job as I.  Unfortunately, I wound up as far as I could get from my beloved Jaws filling an HR quota at Jurassic Park River Adventure. 

  I once again gave it my all, as I'd been a fan of the movies and books.  There though, I again was met by co-workers that didn't care about their jobs.  They just stood there and barely put any enthusiasm into it.  I gave it my heart and soul, just like I'd done so many times before.  It took a few months, but they eventually started to like me there.  I was regarded as quirky and while I had a few detractors, I found a niche and was regarded as a member of the team.  They accepted me, and I accepted them.  I learned to do my job at my level, and made great strides in the social skills department as well.  My customer service was regarded as some of the best even.  I figured I had finally put the demons of my past behind me.  

   One of my co-workers shared my passion for ""the industry"", as we called it.  We eventually became roommates.  As he was popular with the staff of our ride, that made me popular too.  I was invited to parties.  I had dates.  I was socializing normally for the first time in my life.  Life was good, but it caught up to me.  

   One day, after a night of partying I took my roommie's morning shift on my day off as he had a hangover.  I was generally hangover proof, but I hadn't gotten hardly any sleep.  I was assigned an observation post.  Basically, I was to sit there and watch the ride.  I fell asleep.

   A manager caught me, and that was that.  My beloved job was gone.  I fell into back into a suicidal depression that had been plaguing me since before I can remember, at least childhood.  The only times that depression has gone away was while I was at Disney and while I was at Universal, as my job was equal parts demanding and satisfying.  Once I had a social life I forgot all about it, and thought that I had beat it. I fell into abusing drugs as a coping mechanism.  Nothing hard, just weed, but it didn't help matters. I lived off my savings for three months.  My roommates were understanding as long as I had money for the bills.  They must have seen the handwriting on the wall, but said nothing.  The party invites stopped coming.  I isolated myself as my roommates went on with their lives.  Instead of job hunting, I'd get high solo and play video games.  Eventually, the money ran out.  My roommates gave me a month to get things going, but by then I was so depressed and suicidal that I was going days without leaving my room.  They did what they had to do, and I moved back to Tampa with some old friends.  I got a job and got back on my feet.  I was doing fine until the 7-11 I was working at laid me off when a franchisee bought the store.  It also didn't help that a longtime friend who was also struggling with depression committed suicide.  My depression doubled on itself, as the job hunt, which I threw myself at failed.  After three weeks, I was back to getting stoned in my room and the video games.  One night I came clean to my mother that I was suicidal.  She took me to the hospital straight away.

Psych Units aren't anything like what they show on TV.  It was a rather therapeutic experience, and a revealing one.  I was unable to forgive myself for losing my job.  I still can't.  Even with nifty new anti-depressants, I still can't get over it, which is why I'm posting here.  My few friends have been distant, since they found out where I spent a week and a half.  I now live in a house my mom owns with a pair of alcoholics for roommates.  I am again isolating myself, as I can't stand their behavior.  I'm still unemployed.  I'm not suicidal anymore, but the depression is still pretty nasty.  I sleep a lot and I don't get out much.  Now and then I go back to my happy memories of my experiences and the friends I met along the way, but tonight they've been mocking me like demons.

If you read all this, thanks you.  It does feel good to get things off my chest, but my life still hurts.

sdwx2,20,2012-04-17,How to come off as more friendly/enthusiastic when necessary?,pigeonpanic,introvert,https://www.reddit.com/r/introvert/comments/sdwx2/how_to_come_off_as_more_friendlyenthusiastic_when/,"I've always had a lot of people tell me that my default neutral expression makes me look sad or angry, and also that I tend to speak in a monotone and without emotion. I don't think I do this all the time, but I know it's true some of the time, though not anything I'm doing intentionally. I'm halfway through an ""internship"" as a cashier (study abroad, the idea being to interact with people and improve language skills), and the owner keeps telling me to be more friendly and so on. 

Obviously I understand that this is a requirement in some situations, but I'm apparently not that great at faking it. If I try to make myself go around smiling when I'm not feeling over-the-top happy, it's evident to others that it's forced. The other day, I tried responding to customers using the same intonation they spoke with, and they seemed to react positively, but I felt like I was being ridiculously insincere and feared that it would seem like I was making fun of them, so I stopped. 

Do other people have this problem? Are there ways to change? Or am I just hopeless?"
sdwpo,1,2012-04-17,The Beauty of Failure,pinkfluffybunny,GetMotivated,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/sdwpo/the_beauty_of_failure/,"Its funny, I never really thought of failure as something which would be so important in my life, but looking back at some of the decisions I have made, Failure is what shapes a wolf, not success.  The idea of failure has always intrigued me, how it could bring down even the strongest of people.

Ive been trying to get into medicine and eventually will but academically I was never the strongest student.  I had trouble with tests even though I would study hours and hours on end.  Each low mark (I'm talking C's and D's) would crush me each time like a ton of bricks on my soul.  I would start telling myself I was stupid and internalizing this personal dialog where eventually I would believe it, with my self-image deteriorated.  Also Jobs were always hard to come by for a low mark student where no professors would take you in as a research assistant etc, I mean really, who wants a barely passing student.  I would strike out so many times with jobs and internships... it was a pretty crappy time, compounded by the fact that I needed to pay for school etc.  

Anyways, one day I decided enough was enough and started to find my own experiences, create my own jobs, and try my best to get where I wanted to go.  With that, I started volunteering, and developing my own personal skill sets and eventually (after a few years) have a pretty amazing skills set and have worked on huge music festivals, large beer festivals, and even the odd Live Nation show.  Even on the medical side, I volunteered at hospitals, cancer clinics, eventually getting on a board for a health clinic and starting up projects for an HIV/AIDS organization.  Even today, I continually strive to better myself by finding new ways to get experience, but also spend the time to help others whom are not as fortunate as I am.  But still not in med school.. yet.. damn those academics hah

So what does this have to do with failure?  There are many things I learnt from failing so much, I would like to offer them to you wolves whom may experiencing or may not be experience your fair share of failure.

- It is important to know how failure affects you.  Everyone will experience failure in their life, you might as well get used to it.

- Learn how to lick your wounds... but also how to turn that negative energy into positive energy.  I would never have gone out to volunteer if I was sitting at home depressed.

- Never Give Up, even if the world spits in your face. Life can really suck, but it doesn't mean you have to take it. You have a dream, fight for it.

- Communicate with friends but in a positive way.  No one likes a debbie downer, but failure can sometimes make us this way.  Debrief with close friends about your failure and brainstorm how you could possibly do better. Who knows, they might also have some great insight.

- Eat balanced meals and work out regularly.  Failure will drain you mentally, working out and exercise will help you cope with some of the bad feelings.  Also, working out keeps your mind sharp to find opportunities for you to better yourself.

- Never be afraid to fail, but always work hard to avoid it!  After every failure, I want to be able to say to myself that I did the best I could to avoid this, but sometimes life just has it in for ya.

You guys should share some of your stories of how you overcame failure or are currently trying to.  Failure is never something you should be ashamed of, all successful people fail!  So why not make it something that you are comfortable with?

Sorry for the horrid writing skills, majoring in science has made my writing very bland hah! But I'm writing articles and marketing materials to try and fix it :) Thanks wolves!

We've been together for almost 4 years, and the relationship has been relatively smooth. But now we're nearing the end of our college journey and life has presented us with a difficult option: where to go from here. 

Boyfriend suddenly breaks it to me that he's thinking about returning to his country in a few years, because living here is hard. (However, the job depends where he stays). He's got a paid internship at a big accounting firm (in the US) lined up this summer, and a year of grad school after that. It seems fairly likely that he could find permanent employment here. I'm embarrassed to admit that I don't have anything lined up post graduation. But I'm fairly flexible for any type of job. 

Anyways, at this point in our relationship it will be considered a deal-breaker if I don't consider living out my life in Japan. We will be graduating and moving out of our apartment this May. 

I've studied East Asia for my degree, I've studied in Japan for a year, and know a little bit of the language. While I know it's not nearly enough experience to make a proper judgement, it's enough to make me a little resistant to the idea of living there for good. 

Now my question is, are there any American women who have moved to Japan with their Japanese husband (or met him there and stayed) and are happy with the decision? And if so, do you have children, and how do you feel about raising them in there?

Any type of such experiences are much appreciated!"

Edit2* Edited again

So, I am redoing my cover letter. It use to be a template with about 4 paragraphs, a big read. It has given me a few interviews, but for internships, so now that I am graduating from Software Engineering, I am not sure if this will suffice. I heard that sending a generic template usually doesn't work, so I am going to try something non-generic.

I have been reading some example tips, some of them have been slumbering for many years on reddit. A few quotes that I like and probably use are
&gt; I know that your time is valuable, so let me briefly explain why I feel that I'm the best candidate for your ... position

I wouldn't mind using something like this, however, I wouldn't want to say ""best"" as I know I am not the best, I am probably average, no CS coder. And saying I'm a average candidate, well, no. Perhaps excellent, it doesn't have that over confident and naive sound especially coming from a recent grad.

&gt;with an outstanding work ethic

I would love to say this, it can be true at times, I work for 10+ hours, but either because what I am doing is very interesting to me, or that it's due very soon and I have nothing done yet. Just now I went on Reddit for resume tips and the first few hours it was just checking the top stories and then start working on my cover letter, so I can get off track if I am bored.
Mainly I don't like to overstate my abilities (like saying I am the best at something), although I wouldn't want to understate them as well. Or lying about my abilities, as I know they will come back at me if I do get a job.

Do I also need to make a new cover letter for each job? Or at least have the main stuff similar, but just change around words such as Company X to Company Y, and I want a job as a X to Y.

I took an example from Fuzebox13 in [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/admbw/for_the_unemployed_redditors_are_you_tired_of/) post.

I edited a bit, here is the new version

&gt;I read with interest your advertisement for your Software Developer position at Company X, which I saw on your website. I have recently graduated from Software Engineering, acquiring my BEng, at the University Of Ontario Institute Of Technology. I have studied software design, modeling and project management, and I have worked with Java, C, C++, plus several other languages and I can learn new concepts quickly.
&gt;
&gt;My final design project was to integrate an RFID module on wireless sensor nodes to authenticate and communicate with a handheld. I lead the software development as well as manage the groups schedule, which helped develop time management skills. I did independent research on nesC, an event driven language for the TinyOS platform, in order to implement the software as well as collaborate with other teammates design ideas and implementation.
&gt;
&gt;I am able to work well in a team environment, as well as on an individual basis, and I am very confident that I have the knowledge to be an effective software developer with your team.

sdrap,0,2012-04-17,"Hey r/design, I was wondering if you could offer some advice on a tough college choice: CMU or BYU?",imhungrythatsall,Design,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/sdrap/hey_rdesign_i_was_wondering_if_you_could_offer/,"Senior in high school; I applied to both schools, and got into Carnegie Mellon's Biology Program (but not their design school), and Brigham Young's Pre-Industrial Design program.
 
**Skippable Background information:** 
I understand the reason why I was rejected from CMU's Design School was because, up until last summer, I thought I wanted a career in scientific research.  Then I actually did a research internship during the summer and realized: 1) Research sucked, and 2) I wanted a career that was more creative project based, something that I had always loved doing in school.  Unfortunately by then it was too late to put together even a decent portfolio, so you can imagine how it panned out for me.

Ideally, I'd like to go to CMU and do at least a design minor, and use that (and hopefully the contacts I make) to build my portfolio and enter into their design program and/or transfer into another strong design university.

However, my family doesn't have a lot of money, and although I do anticipate enough financial aid, I'm not sure if this CMU gamble is worth it (because I've heard it's difficult to transfer into their design school), and if I should just stick to the cheaper BYU ID program that I know almost nothing about (although I have a growing dislike of Mormon culture).

**Basically I have these questions**

1. Does anybody know anything about the BYU design program (experiences, job opportunities, etc)?

2. In terms of the design field, how much does it matter where you get your undergraduate degree (will your school help or hinder)?

3.  How much of a gamble would it be to enter into CMU as a Bio major/design minor, and try to transfer to a Design major?  Would it be worth it?"

sdpev,0,2012-04-17,Cover letter help,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/sdpev/cover_letter_help/,"So, I am redoing my cover letter. It use to be a template with about 4 paragraphs, a big read. It has given me a few interviews, but for internships, so now that I am graduating from Software Engineering, I am not sure if this will suffice. I heard that sending a generic template usually doesn't work, so I am going to try something non-generic.

I have been reading some example tips, some of them have been slumbering for many years on reddit. A few quotes that I like and probably use are
&gt; I know that your time is valuable, so let me briefly explain why I feel that I'm the best candidate for your ... position

I wouldn't mind using something like this, however, I wouldn't want to say ""best"" as I know I am not the best, I am probably average, no CS coder. And saying I'm a average candidate, well, no. Perhaps excellent, it doesn't have that over confident and naive sound especially coming from a recent grad.

&gt;with an outstanding work ethic

I would love to say this, it can be true at times, I work for 10+ hours, but either because what I am doing is very interesting to me, or that it's due very soon and I have nothing done yet. Just now I went on Reddit for resume tips and the first few hours it was just checking the top stories and then start working on my cover letter, so I can get off track if I am bored.
Mainly I don't like to overstate my abilities (like saying I am the best at something), although I wouldn't want to understate them as well. Or lying about my abilities, as I know they will come back at me if I do get a job.

Do I also need to make a new cover letter for each job? Or at least have the main stuff similar, but just change around words such as Company X to Company Y, and I want a job as a X to Y.

I took an example from Fuzebox13 in [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/admbw/for_the_unemployed_redditors_are_you_tired_of/) post.

Ill submit what I have now, any comments or wording changes?

&gt;I know that your time is valuable, so let me briefly explain why I feel that I am an excellent candidate for your Software Developer position. I am a keen worker and I am interested in challenging problems. I know Java, C, C++, plus several other languages and I can learn new concepts quickly. My experience may be lacking a little, but not my ambition.
&gt;
&gt;My final design project was to integrate an RFID module on wireless sensor nodes to authenticate and communicate with a handheld. I lead the software development with another group member as well as managing the groups schedule. I had to research TinyOS and nesC in order to implement the software as well as my group mate. I realized that my group mate wasn't doing much work, so I had to pick up the slack, and I finished it, all.
&gt;
&gt;We can further discuss why I am an excellent candidate for your software developer position at the interview. I can be reached at XXX-XXX-XXXX. Thank you, and I look forward to the opportunity.

Him: Chemistry. Psych chemistry. :)

Me: Good. Closer to the ""real"" science of physics. ;)

Him: Somewhat. Ha. How are you?

Me: Pretty good. I'm just here for a semester taking math stuff, but overall things are pretty chill. You?

Him: Just playing world of Warcraft. Getting horny. Wish I had a bf. lol

Me: Haha. I'm a SWTOR / Minecraft duy. Wish I had one too. Don't know how fair it would be for me to start a relationship now though.

Him: Where is home? Maybe it would be good.

Me: Here, actually. I spent the last 1-1/2 years in [location ommitted], transferred here for a layover semester, then I'll be in [another state &gt; 12 hours driving away] as an intern over the summer and [somewhere else] starting in the fall.

Him: Oh see not bad. I can handle that.

Him: I am not hot tho

Him: Chubby but losing it. Heart of gold

Me: I don't care much about looks. Don't think I could seriously consider having a relationship with someone who thought looks were important. I'd be open to meeting sometime.

Him: Awwww \*blush. Thanks.

Him: I am 38 going on 18. Look about 27

Him: Lol

Me: I'm just 20. Don't think I could date someone in that age range. Being friends would be cool though.

It was a really hard assignment for me, even though I feel like I have a good understanding of all the concepts that go into it.

My question is, how can I practice stuff like this on my own? I can't intern yet, but are there any online practicing resources, or books other than textbooks? I know that sounds very elementary, but I love accounting, and I want to get better."
sdmmt,7,2012-04-16,Could use some advice about dealing with sexism at work. ,stretchedtoothin,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/sdmmt/could_use_some_advice_about_dealing_with_sexism/,"I really am out of options and I am not sure the next step to take. 

I've been working in an office for about 9 months now and have been dealing with some mild sexism for a while, and it's steadily getting worse. It's not so blatant as my boss (who is male) saying, ""I don't respect women."" It's very subtle. Things like most of the men do quantitative data work and ""important"" tasks and assignments while the women mainly do clerical and ""secretarial"" work. He also will give undivided support and attention to males who have issues or questions regarding work, but will ridicule and berate the women when they have questions. He doesn't wave hello or say hi to women in the hallways either, but goes out to lunch with all of the male employees and has lengthy conversations with them about their work and personal lives. He makes little to no effort in getting to know and be friendly with his female staff. 

He also recently hired another manager who is extremely sexist. This man has made comments like, ""I don't respect women who don't have higher education degrees."" And continually is micro-managing the women under him. One particular girl was on maternity leave and while she was gone tried to get her fired. When that didn't work, the program she was working in ran out of funding and both my boss and this manager essentially said, ""Find another job."" 

We have taken these issues to our boss directly, and he acted very sympathetic and said he would work on it. Fast-forward two months later and things are getting worse. It's all men who are in managerial and leadership positions and the men who aren't in those positions are getting special treatment, like window cubicles, extra office supplies, and more prestigious and noteworthy job assignments regardless of job description or seniority. 

It's to the point now where I am on the verge of tears when I go into the office, because I feel like there is nothing I can do about it. While none of these actions are huge issues, they add up and I feel completely helpless and overwhelmed. I feel as though everything that is being done is so sneaky and subtle and barely toeing the line of being blatant sexism and discrimination that if I was going to go to Human Resources I wouldn't have a strong enough case. ALL of the women in the office, including interns, are looking for other jobs. But they are too scared to go into Human Resources because they are afraid that there will be retaliation, because there has been in the past. 

What can I do? Should I try going to Human Resources myself personally? Should I consult a lawyer? Call the local newspapers? What can I do to get the atmosphere in my office more friendly without losing my job? I honestly would quit this second if I could, but times are tough and I need the money. What can I do?"

sdlmu,0,2012-04-16,"I don't know what to do. Depressed, isolated, and about to become more so.",George8910,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/sdlmu/i_dont_know_what_to_do_depressed_isolated_and/,"**I know this sounds cliché, but this is about ten times as long as I thought it would be. I guess writing this out is acting as a form of catharsis.**

When I was in college, I had a number of friends, and would see them almost every day, though admittedly, rarely outside of school itself. I was generally in a good mood (if you exclude occasional sleep issues, and recovering from a home invasion), was getting good grades (overall GPA of 3.8), and was generally happy with life.

Then I graduated, moved back in with my parents, and took a 4-month contract with the government, programming, in a department I'd already worked in as a student. I wound up getting ridiculously bored daily; the idea and action of sitting in front of a computer all day long, something I've been doing since I was a kid, was bugging the hell out of me. As the months wore on, I became more and more bored, and started thinking I had ADHD.

There were a lot of people there, co-op students, mostly, that I interacted with, but I always felt an outsider. Nobody made attempts to include me in anything, never came to my desk to chat, and seemed annoyed when I went to them. It was during this time that I wound up feeling depressed most of the time, and spoke to my doctor about it, but nothing ever came of it than a blood test.

Out of my boredom, I did something that got my full-time offer withdrawn. I took this opportunity to take some time for myself, and ask out one of the girls I'd met there. I've been dating her since, and it'd be 2 years next month. Starting my first relationship--at the age of 21--and having a lot of free time (took up Scuba, saw a couple friends frequently), I was feeling pretty damned awesome, other than my lack of attention to looking for a job.

Fast forward 2 months, and I finally get an interview with a company, in a city 2 hours away. I go to meet them, and get offered the job that day. Now, compared to anything, this is a tiny company. There are, at most, 3 of us in the office at any time. There are a few part timers, but I rarely see them, and there was another full time guy that I liked, but he got a better job elsewhere a couple of months ago.

I'm still there, and am once again bored with my work, every goddamm day. Other than some small talk here and there or work-related discussion, I rarely speak to either of the other 2. I was also hoping that, in a new city, I might make some new friends, but so far all my attempts in that direction have failed, and always in the same way: I try to plan things, and 75% of the time the other people cancel last minute, or never reply, and outside of this, they never make any attempt to contact me. After a month or two of this, I just give up on them.

Admittedly, I've become depressed again. I saw a psychologist for a couple of months, but didn't get a lot out of it. While waiting on a referral to a psychiatrist, I wound up breaking down one day, calling my parents for help, and going to the ER, and getting in to see somebody that week. I got put on antidepressants, and have been on them since last August. They seemed to help at first, though lately I've been having bad mood swings. One minute I'm fine, next I feel like offing myself, and my childhood temper has come back.

I'm still seeing a nurse-practioner regularly, though not much has really changed on that front. I've been seeing the psychologist again, and got diagnosed with ADHD a few weeks ago, though it won't be until June that I can see the real doctor and get prescribed something to help with that, where I'm feeling the root of my issues lies.

Now, if that wasn't enough, my girlfriend doesn't believe in sex before marriage. We've done some sexual things (hands, me going down on her), but if she doesn't like something, or we're at either of her places rather than mine, nothing happens. This has bugged me ever since she first mentioned it, but I love her, and haven't wanted to break up. Except for a couple of semesters she's been on co-op (paid internship), we see each other almost daily.

I decided about 3 weeks ago that I would break up with her once she's done her exams, and thinking about it earlier, I'm going to be dumping her this weekend.

Right now I'm feeling like crap, and decided to write this rather than drink myself to sleep or go and smoke my pipe for awhile (though I'll probably do this anyway. Nicotine-induced euphoria is nice).

So, I guess,

**TL;DR:**

* Living in a city 1-2 hours away from my friends &amp; family
* Currently have no friends or social connections in this city
* Depression, despite antidepressants
* Bored as fuck with my job
* Diagnosed with ADHD-PI
* Breaking up with girlfriend soon
* Not sure what I'm really wanting here, other than to vent my frustrations

So... yeah...

**EDIT:**
Forgot to add: She's moving back in with her parents (only an hour away, but still) and never moving back to this city. Guaranteed things will not be long term, and it'd probably be a few weeks before I'd see her again after this weekend.

Also, I'm planning to look for work elsewhere, but waiting until after I get the new meds, so I know how they'll affect me, and if they can give me more motivation. My fear is I'll start a new job somewhere interesting, and be just as bored."

Currently a community college student that was accepted to SFSU, CSUN, and made it to the top 30 applicants/interview round with UCLA (but ultimately didn't make the final cut.) UCLA was my dream school, mostly because of it's quality reputation with relative affordability. 

Knowing that I got so close to my goal (and missing it by thaaaat much) is both gratifying and heartbreaking. Anyway, since I am IGETC-certified and have an AA already (meaning have enough to transfer at junior level), I just don't know what to do next. Should I wait another year and apply to UCLA again? Are there some small things I could do in the meantime? I live a few hours away from LA in a hodunk agricultural town, so it's hard to find relevant work/internships. Not to mention my college doesn't offer academic credit for internships, so finding an internship is pretty difficult.

I really like all aspects of filmmaking, and have recently taking a strong liking to screenwriting. That's what I was originally hoping to do my concentration in at UCLA.

Does anybody have any advice? Words of wisdom? Encouragement? Feeling pretty bummed and directionless at the moment.

EDIT: Thanks so much, guys. It's nice to feel like it's not the end of the world. I definitely took all your advice to heart!"

Ever since I can remember I've had trouble with my weight. Even when I look back at photos of when I was 6-8 years old, i've always been round. I live in Florida, so body image is something i really was conscious about, and was really embarrassed. In HS I always got by b/c of my good grades and I never showed in public that the jokes actually effected me, but they did. Anyways, when I got to college, I decided to get fit and go the gym. Everything was going great my first year, but then i had hand surgery and ballooned to my worst shape ever as in the picture below. The combo of pain meds, terrible diet, depression from losing results i had worked so hard to achieve, on top of the stress of class and funding my education became overwhelming. 

What really changed it all was when I got a summer internship in Charlotte, NC, last summer. I was fed up! I hated the way I looked, the way I felt, and thought THIS would be the perfect opportunity to start fresh: new friends, new coworkers, new opportunities! I worked downtown and found a gym literally 50 feet form work where all the people at my company went to. I buckled down, created a diet for myself, and went to the gym almost religiously. After a great summer I went from 195 to 175 and felt AMAZING!!! I had so much confidence, bought new clothes and was on a whole different level. 

I cam back to school for my senior year of college and unfortunately fell into some bad habits including going out for dinner and drinks with friends, and wasn't as motivated to go the gym. Fall semester I put back on about 5 lbs. Once I saw results fading again, I was infuriated with myself. NO WAY I WAS GOING TO LET THIS HAPPEN! During winter break I signed up at a local gym and since December have lost another 15 lbs, down to 165. 

Just wanted to say that reading /r/loseit and /r/fitness has been all the inspiration in the world and I wanted to say thank you!

In December 2010 I got really into Android development and released 2 apps so far, one paid and one free. To my surprise, both achieved a reasonable success, and right now, after the initial boom, they bring enough money to make a decent living.

The dilemma I'm facing right now is whether to, as everyone else, find a normal programming job, or maybe pursue the freelance path from the very beginning.

I'm very close to the latter option, because I can always - in case of failure - start looking for a normal job. 
But imagine this scenario - I graduate, start making more Android apps and games, and after a year or two I run out of ideas/money, so I start looking for a job. It is worth noting at this point, that I have no real world programming experience (my bad, I know, but I was stupid and didn't look for any internships). So my situation is quite bad in this case - only freelancing experience, year or two after graduation...

Is it worth the risk?"

First off, right now I'm a sophomore in a 5 year program of undergrad, set up for internships throughout. I'm currently working for the US Attorney's office and think I might be getting asked to come back as a paralegal for two years post-grad. Is it worth it? Will it be useful later on in applying to law schools or landing a job at all?

Second, and my main worry, is law school acceptance and the LSAT. I know that the LSAT is a huge factor in getting into a good law school, which can make or break your job offers after law school. I've never been particularly good at standardized tests (got a 1910 on my SAT) and am slightly worried I don't have what it takes to get the scores that I need. How long in advance would you say someone should start prepping for it? 

Assuming I don't get into a high ranked law school, I've been considering ending up in politics, environmental law or business (I'm too bad at math for an MBA). Is the law degree worth pursuing for politics or business, and is there any money in environmental law?

Edit: I should mention that by going into politics, I do NOT mean running for office. I would prefer to be a lobbyist or consultant. I understand that means working on a few campaigns at first.

I've had my undergrad tuition paid for me and will likely be able to afford the first year or two of law school without a loan or aid, if that makes a difference."

I am still hoping for an internship for the summer (still waiting to hear from a few places) but if I do not get one I can still work at my dad's company.

Although working there will give me a lot of experience, I want something that I can design / build that would give me experience. Last year I built a small trebuchet; that was fun and all, and at the time it was perfect, but I need something more challenging that I can really get into and talk to employers about. I am worried that I will be graduating with a degree, but will not have enough experience to get a job quickly.

I was looking into building a small steam engine similar to this- http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xQLL9fxHvM&amp;feature=related

* How large is the Geophysics program?

So I get a call from one of the partners at the PR firm I used to work at. She was an older woman, good at her job but TERRIBLE with computers. That said, she had become reliant on her Blackberry calendar to keep things in order. And she had A TON of calendar entries - stuff she wasn't even going to but wanted to keep track of.

She had an assistant who would plug in all of her hand written calendar appointments into her outlook calender.

Well, her assistant was going on her honeymoon and god forbid this lady learn how to make a calendar entry, so we assigned an intern to manage her schedule for the duration.

So back to the call I got.... she was frantic that her phone alarm had gone off several times during the night and she could not figure out why.

I go to her desk, look at her phone, and I noticed that there were upwards of 10 events scheduled between the hours of 9pm and 6am. It turns out that intern didn't know that you could schedule two things concurrently on a calendar. So, in his infinite wisdom, he assumed tha if something needed to be added at 3pm, and there was already something listed for that time, he would just schedule it for 3am, with a note saying ""*Actually 3:00 PM"". And then of course, he set up alarms for each of them..."

Cool answer for the ""lazy"":


From *wingwalker*:


""I used to intern for MSNBC. When we got word that someone noteworthy was sick and could die, we would go through archival footage to build a ""life reel"" that we would use to pay tribute. When it was a sudden death, we would do the same, but in a much shorter amount of time and it wouldn't be nearly as good as when we have some notice."""

**update**: Is it just me or is it Javik in here?

Original Post: http://www.reddit.com/r/masseffect/comments/sfzcr/st_mass_effect/

Jeff continues to remember...

**Jack** Jennifer Meer, ""Jackie"", ""Cool Pudding Lady"" these are all names that refer to a Shepard Institute cafeteria worker. Abrasive and rude as a convicted felon can get, Jack is ""volunteering"" at the Institute to avoid a trip to the big house. Despite her history, Jackie is often seen delivering food to Tabitha, Jeff, and other children on their treatment days. Jeff noted that each meal came with a cute doodle or a pretty origami crane. When Jeff confronted her about her preferential treatment, Jackie shrugged it off saying that she likes kids, since they're easier to talk to than adults and they understand what she wants. ""I just wanna be free, kid...more ways than one.""

**Jacob Taylor**: Jeff's physical therapist is John Tyler. A firm believer in the ""Anyone can better themselves"" mantra, John openly respects and even admires Jeff's optimistic attitude. He chose to be a physical trainer to help kids especially, admitting that he and his father are not on speaking terms. He pushes himself so he can be a better man than his father.

**Samara**: Dr. Samantha Rogers is one of the three board doctors that oversee major decision-making at the Shepard Institute. A wise woman who, at times, is kind and motherly and at other times cold and distant. She's respected by the Institute's doctors for abstaining from any favoritism when it comes to breaking of protocol, but she's also feared as she's swift to deliver suspensions for even minor infractions of said medical protocols.

**Kasumi Goto**: Mitsune Kiru is a spunky, silver-tongued intern. While she means well and admires what the Institute and its staff does, Mitsune tends to have a very ""laid-back"" work ethic and is often seen cat-napping in the strangest of places. She's almost never caught, much to her ill-conceived pride, and her innocent demeanor and persuasive excuses can even throw off Dr. Rogers at times. Jeff always feels the need to check his pockets, after he talks to her.

**Zaeed Massani**: Zach Masters is a rough ""sunovabitch""...or so he'd tell you. A member of an elite team of Australian soldiers sent to Vietnam during the war, he was the only one of his squad who survived a vicious ambush. He's often seen with Donald, trading war stories. Normally proud and boastful, the proud warrior grows melancholic whenever he mentions a Lt. ""Vido"". He's currently trying to get his old war rifle shipped from Australia.

**Legion**: Larry Jenkins was a computer technician before he was admitted to the Shepard Institute to treat his malformed heart. Treatments have only been mildly effective and his doctors told him that he needed a transplant to live past a few more years. His rare blood type and dilated arteries make finding a donor heart extremely difficult, despite this, Larry has already passed up three matching hearts telling himself and his doctors that there are people who need it more urgently than him. Jeff befriends him when they meet in a quiet part of the Institute's gardens. Larry has been continuously trying to befriend Tabitha, but she's frightened by Larry's ghastly, gaunt appearance, convinced he's a ghost or a monster. He confides in Jeff his fear that there's no life after death and his actions in the world could be meaningless.

**Edit**

**Admiral Hackett**: Dr. Stephen Hackett is head of surgery at Shepard Institute and the second-most senior member of the board, behind Dr. Rogers. ""Hacksaw"" Hackett as he's referred to by his colleagues is a no-nonsense man who seeks to maintain the balance between research efforts and patient treatment. Although stone-faced, Hackett is infamous for his ""Hack it out."" joke during his surgical consultations. Hackett takes a shining to Jeff after he talks to the boy about his future surgical options, and Jeff in return finds some comfort that his surgeon can still laugh at his job.

**Ken &amp; Gabby**: The inseparable nurse pair are almost always working on paperwork at nurse station three. Even Doctor Nagali acknowledges that they somehow work much more competently together. Ken regularly plays cards with the other nurses, and promises to teach Jeff how to play poker, when he's older. Unbeknownst to the pair, there is rumor that several doctors are betting whether they finally work out that ""unresolved sexual tension"" within the next year.

**EDI**: Edith was a miracle born from tragedy. The sole survivor of a tragic aviation disaster, Edith was in a medically-induced coma for five months as doctor's worked to salvage what they could and remove what they couldn't. When she awoke, she was in the sterile white rooms of Shepard Institute, disoriented, unable to move, and alone. Prosthetic limbs still needed to be created, a process of a few weeks, and even then, Edith showed little motivation to do much of anything besides eat, drink, and breathe, let alone go through rigorous physical therapy. Then Dr. T'Soni brought her Joker in; however, to her dismay, Jeff and Edith didn't get along at all. Edith's cold criticisms drawing blood on Jeff's patience. Despite the pleas from Dr. T'Soni, Jeff refused to acknowledge Edith at all afterwards. It was only until Jeff's wheelchair battery ran out outside of her room did the pair finally begin to talk. It was a tense, awkward conversation, until Jeff made his signature snide commentary on the situation. And then a small giggle broke the silence between them. Then a chuckle. Then hardy laughter. Edith was laughing, smiling for the first time in a long time. Jeff would and probably never will admit it, but Edith looked kinda cute when she was smiling. The two would become close friends, helping each other through each others' physical therapy, hoping that, eventually, she can ride on the back of Jeff's wheelchair.      

**Edit 2 EVEN MORE CHARACTERS **

**Javik**: Dr. James Victus is as close to a celebrity as one can get in the Institute. A world-renowned expert on degenerative diseases, Dr. Victus only recently became a member of the Shepard Institute. Dr. T'Soni was initially excited to work with the bespectacled man whose works she studied ever so carefully, but as she continued to observe her idol she realized that Dr. Victus came short of her expectations. He spoke tersely and often relegated most of his patients to other doctors and staff members so he can spend more time in the research labs. Instead of assisting her with oversight of her patients, Dr. Victus constantly criticized and berated Dr. T'Soni for her ""disgustingly unprofessional"" repertoire with them. The pair often fiercely argued over treatment methods and Dr. T'Soni's disappointment and bitter contempt for her fallen idol was not lost on her patients.  However, Jeff notices that Victus does openly acknowledge T'Soni's skills as a physician and often cedes to T'Soni's judgement in their arguments, leaving Jeff confused as to why the pair can't work better together.

**Richard Jenkins**: Richard Jenkins only met Jeff once, sitting in a waiting room together they shared a few jokes.  Most of what he knows about the man were from off-hand remarks by Dr. T'Soni. Jenkins was an incredibly spirited young man who was ready to take on the field of medicine with a fresh mind. He worked under Dr. T'Soni for a short time and showed incredible compassion and promise, but when a small yet critical error in judgement caused the death of a patient, Jenkins broke down. While he was granted a reprieve from the board for his mistake, Jenkins received no such atonement from his own conscience and resigned altogether from the Institute. "

So I'm a graduating college senior with a half-decent GPA and a degree in Mechanical Engineering from a pretty prestigious (and unfortunately expensive) engineering school. I am also 6 credits shy of completing my masters, and have over 2.5 years of relevant engineering internship experience.

My non-academic accomplishments include founding, and acting as chairman for 4 years of my school's chapter of College Republicans as well as serving on the state board for CRs in an executive position.

I am also a member, and part of the executive boards, of the Archery and Riflery teams.

I do not hide these facts, nor am I ashamed of it. They showcase me as a well rounded individual, and show leadership, as well as a good deal of philanthropy (because of all the charity work I've done with several organizations - especially the CRs)


I have been advised by the office of career development not to remove any of this information - for the aforementioned reasons. I know the economy sucks, and the job market is awful, but I can't help but think that, in today's politically charged climate, it may actually be hurting me.

I know that not hiring me because of my political affiliation or sporting activities is discrimination, but I'm not one to make waves, nor would I really be able to prove that methinks.



Can any HR folks, managers, career development personnel, people who see similar things, etc... comment on this?



tl;dr - hold leadership positions in political and other ""non-pleasant"" affiliated clubs at school, and thinking of removing that info from my resume.




**Note - I am not here to debate anyone regarding politics, guns, or anything else. I put the affiliation there in good faith that the good folks of r/askreddit can look past it for a moment and discuss my situation.**

**Edit-** Thanks for the responses guys. It seems pretty split, but the leadership part does seem to be winning over the ""keep politics out of the office"". I appreciate the insight, and look forward to reading more as more comments come in."

I have a question and hopefully it will be a fairly quick one. 
I am transferring to [An accredited Engineering school] soon (see the rest of the question first) and I was presented with two choices.

A.) I could start this summer taking classes, having next summer off leaving a opportunity for an internship and to complete my degree by 2014 (spring)

B.) I could start in the fall while shuffling some classes around and have a short time off again for an internship, start classes again... and then leave for an 8 month Co-op and complete my degree in the spring of 2015..

Some background:
I am a little older than my peers and would like to complete by 2014, but in the end I imagine that is not that big of an issue in the end. I have been working for a large Pharma company already for the past 2 years, but doing work of little to no relevance. 

is the Co-op a no brainer? Is it the bridge between an awesome paying job and an average job (depending on how I do?), like I think it is? I know its not all about the money, but I am thinking it could also lead to some potentially awesome jobs, but I am not sure how much more so than an internship?

We need to talk about shill intern spam. We have had a few discussions about the ""adventures in poor taste"" network and divvvy/fappytaffy, both of which get spammed by shill marketing interns. Personally, I find people ""gaming"" reddit to be disgusting and infuriating, so I am writing this post.

Recently we had a x-post from r/hotties. If you check out r/hotties you will see that it is a small new subreddit with 6 moderators. If you follow the histories of them, the majority of the links you will find posted lead to the AIPT network or divvvy/fappytaffy or some other cable-outlet web site like MTV. They link to the ""other subreddits we enjoy"", a single link going to r/popcult, a subreddit with almost the same moderator crew and less than 300 readers. It is my unsubstantiated theory that the accounts associated with these reddits are being run by a single user. 

You may recognize some of the mods in question:

terrayze (banned from nsfwoutfits for spam)

kellenwelker (banned from nsfwoutfits for spam)

winback099 (banned from nsfwoutfits for spam)

**In other words, the entire r/hotties subreddit is a shill link farm.**

I will not allow x-posts to them. Furthermore, I am posting this to inform the subscribers of this subreddit (some of whom visit or moderate similar subs) that this is happening. I have x-linked this post to r/reportthespammers. I really love what reddit can be, and the communities it allows us to build. Spamming links for off-site ad ridden content breaks reddit. 

Thanks for listening to my rant.

TL;DR: I think r/hotties and r/popcult are shill link farm subreddits, being run by a moderator ""crew"" that links primarily to (stolen content on) their own sites. Your feedback is appreciated. "
sg9fe,8,2012-04-18,"How do I emphasize my current job (""manufacturing engineer"") to be more attractive to employers?",spykid,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/sg9fe/how_do_i_emphasize_my_current_job_manufacturing/,"I currently work as a manufacturing engineer at a sheet metal and CNC fabrication company. My responsibilities have evolved over time, but here is what I have been involved in (relatively chronological order):

-Quality Control: Inspected products for conformity to customer requirements, generated inspection reports, investigated processes if problems arose. The main purpose of this was so I could learn about the manufacturing process in the company and move on to other roles. I no longer do this.

-Job expediting: walked around with a chart of all the active jobs we had and made sure everything was running on schedule (this doesn't seem like engineering, so I don't go into any detail talking about this in my resume or cover letter - just mention it). I no longer do this.

-Quality system overhaul: our company is trying to get ISO 9001 certification. I am responsible for coordinating all of this. Drafting documents, manuals, instructions, creating processes, setting up meetings, communicating with employees, scheduling audits, and probably more I can't think of right now. I like to emphasize this because I went into this with zero ISO experience and I think it shows how I can handle large tasks and adapt quickly. This is my current priority.

-Purchasing: I purchase materials, tools, and hardware for the company. Honestly this doesn't feel like engineering, but I'm told it's an important role. I have to make sure things get here on time and meet requirements. 

-Customer communication: sometimes I talk to customers if we run into problems with making parts or if there are things we can't purchase. This is generally not that common though.



So, my biggest gripe with all this is that I feel like these are ALL things that anyone with general competency can do. I really feel like I could have done all this with just my high school degree and I don't know if this job is giving me any useful engineering experience. I want to find a job at a company that offers me more room for growth. I failed to get an internship while I was in university and now that I'm graduated, most companies aren't interested in hiring me as an intern.

TL;DR I feel like my job isn't an engineering job and I don't know how to use it to find one.

I'm in school and seeking an internship at a studio and I need to send them a resume. Normally, this wouldn't be a problem for a ""normal"" job, because I'd list my previous jobs, etc, like a normal resume. However, even though I know how to make a standard ""office job"" type resume, the only one I have currently have is the one I made in high school to give to the college scouts for theatre that lists all of the shows I've worked on and my knowledge of tools/set construction, etc.  

**SO.**

What should I list on this resume? 

* Should I put all of my previous non-recording jobs? 
* Should I list all of the bands/people I recorded so far?
---* If so, how would I show the quality, or lack thereof, of the recordings, since all of the work I've done has been with unsigned, unpopular acts? 
* Should I list specific classes that I took/am taking at college for recording? (I know most of you will ask why I'm in school for recording in the first place. I don't want to start that debate.)
* I know that I should list my general skills, like DAWs and tape machines, but should I add specific gear that I own/have used?

So, a few months ago I asked here about how to do a ponytail for my shoulder length, curly hair. Keep in mind that I am a guy, so I had no idea what I was doing...

Anyway, fast forward a few months and I'm wearing it almost ever day, not just when I have to wear it for my internship, and now, I've noticed something. My scalp is looking pretty red in the mornings after I've put up my hair into a ponytail. I haven't changed shampoos or anything, nor have I gotten a lot of sun recently for a sunburn. 

Also, when I do have my ponytail up, it feels very, very heavy. So when I tilt my head forward, lets say too look at a test on my desk, I can feel the ponytail dragging me down, almost as if its pulling my hair out, and it is a very uncomfortable sensation.

So, what I really want to know is, how can i prevent my ponytail from hurting me? I enjoy the style and people have complimented me on how I look with it, but I don't want to keep doing this if it hurts this bad.

**TL;DR** - Ponytail hurts after I put it up in the morning and my scalp is becoming increasingly red in color.

Thanks."

Normally I get positive remarks about my speaking abilities, though of course I still have an accent. 

Today, just before I was about to leave work to go to class, this older woman came in. When I told her the total of her order, she asked me to repeat myself. I did. She asked me again. I repeated it again. Then she repeated what I'd said in a bitter, mocking tone, making it evident that she had actually understood what I was saying. My Austrian co-worker then repeated what I'd said, while I took a deep breath and forced myself not to flee from the room. 

As she handed me her money, I apologized and said that German isn't my native language. At that point, she showed mild surprise and asked me where I was from, etc. 

This left me with the realization that she was intentionally making fun of me for what she must have thought was a speech impediment, rather than an accent. This doesn't make me feel any better. Now I just want to go home and not talk to anyone else, ever, though I know that's an overreaction.

I just wanted to tell someone about it, I guess. Thanks for your time if you read this.

Usually the replies go something like ""your best chance of moving to Germany would be to study there first"". 

I just finished a Bachelors degree in Finance (and don't overly love the subject) and really can't imagine doing Masters in it - even if it is in Germany - so I think that's out. 

I looked into Masters in German as a Foreign Language and the like, but they all require you to speak really good German, which I don't. So now I'm considering doing a second Bachelors in German and Slavonic Studies at my current university, and that way I can apply for internships in Germany during my summers and maybe get a good graduate job once I'm done. I am, however, an international student at this university so course fees are ridiculously expensive. Which made me think... Maybe I should just do my second Bachelors in good ol' Germany itself?

Anyway, word vomit aside, I was looking to see what advice I could get from the lovely people of Reddit. Is pursuing a second Bachelors degree silly? Is there an easier way to go about it?

* **Age:** 21.
* **Education:** Bachelors degree in Finance from a New Zealand university.
* **Job skills:** I worked for a marketing firm one summer so I know quite a lot about market research, analysis, and writing up documents based on that analysis. I also did a lot of translations but I don't think my skills in Arabic will be much use in Germany.
* **Language skills:** Bilingual; I speak English and Arabic, both fluently. Unfortunately my German is *very* weak but I'm trying to work on it.
* **Willing to consider alternative destinations:** Sure, but only nearby ones.
* **Temporary or permanent?:** 2 or 3 years, but if I can build a good life for myself there then I might consider staying longer.
* **Nationality:** Bahraini (Middle Eastern), but I went to university in New Zealand."

The senior project course only meets once per week and the capstone twice per week for an hour or so.

At the same time, I'm currently in my 5th year of school and I'm only doing my undergrad. Students are lucky to graduate in 5 years. Do you think my potential employer would be able to see the circumstances or would I have to be committed to the job full-time?

Note that in my area, the co-ops between the industry and the university does not work the way they usually do in other schools. The school doesn't exactly pair up with companies around here. There's no ""co-op"" program. Instead, it's more of a regular job search, such as for an internship, so I am extremely lucky to just get an interview.

I want to pursue an education in Computer Science while I'm younger and spend the rest of my years applying my CS degree to a more artistic direction e.g. Front End Development, Game Design/Programming, UX/UI, or Human Computer Interaction.

I'm certain about this extended amount of time because I struggle in math and science which tends to lead me to retake classes. I wouldn't say my struggle isn't a stress free experience--I work hard to pass my classes, but it does affect my social life and my free time, which I could be using to have a part time job/internship.

Doing the math, it appears I would need a salary of $80,000 (pre-tax) to live comfortably in NYC, this is assuming that rent is only 30% of my expenses (assuming about $1700 a month) but I realize the reality may be that I spend nearly half of my income on rent if I make less than that and/or I am underestimating the cost of studio within the city. Am I right in shooting for this salary if I want to live comfortably here? When I say comfortably, I mean that I have a roof over my head within the city and money to go out every once in a while and I'm not counting pennies at the end of the month.

I will be only in school for 12 hours in the Fall and for only 2 days of the week, so I will be available much of the time needed, but I didn't know if maybe they were expecting something else.

This wasn't an issue with my last job as it is obviously an enriching experience, but now that the date is approaching soon... I would essentially be hired and leave.  I know I need to bring this up, and I would entirely understand the effect it would have on me getting this internship... but, I want this internship very badly.

I know this would be something to come up in the interview, but if I am to contact them beforehand, I didn't know if it would be worthwhile bringing up.

Should I contact the employer ahead of time, or wait to see if I get an interview and bring it up then?  I simply do not want to seem deceiving, yet at the same time I do not want to lay a lot of issues on the employer before they even get a chance to call me in for an interview.

My question however concerns job opportunities for Americans in Japan.  Right now I am only thinking of possibilities, but I would like some info on this matter to help myself make an informed decision.  

I am thinking of pursuing an International Relations major, since world cultures, especially Asian and more specifically Japanese, is my main passion, and Int. Rel. seems to be the only thing that relates to that passion that is somewhat realistic in terms of job opportunities. 

So my question is what are the opportunities for an American college graduate with an International Relations degree, in Japan?  I believe that I heard somewhere that there is some sort of work program, where I could possibly work as a sort of paid intern in a Japanese government office or something along those lines?  Does anyone know anything about that?  Is there anything else relating to International Relations in Japan that you guys could tell me and help me out with?  Again im just thinking of possibilities at this point.  

Also, I was wondering how long would someone typically stay in Japan while working there, and how necessary is it to know the language very well?  

Again im sorry for how long this is, but please any feedback is greatly appreciated.  "
sfags,5,2012-04-17,Will things ever get better? (Long post. I'm sorry.),[deleted],MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/sfags/will_things_ever_get_better_long_post_im_sorry/,"My life has been nothing but painful coincidences since 7th Grade. Here's a summary:

7th grade- change schools from very small, conservative, family-run Christian school where I know everyone to far larger and more liberal school where I literally only knew 5 people, parents get divorced, nervous breakdown, essentially wipe my personality and start over.

8th grade-terrible story gets out about me for no good reason, people I thought were my friends turned against me, mocking and bullying carried on until around junior year, I still carry the emotional scars, another nervous breakdown and diagnosed with OCD.

9th grade- I've pretty much intentionally blacked this year out of my memory due to intense bullying.

10th grade- bullying starts going away, start making more friends, get involved in theater, I was given charge of the school's comedy team, things start lightening up.

11th grade- to date, best year of my life. I had a quasi-girlfriend (we never really made it official and to date my only ""real relationship""), I was the lead in the musical with my best friends. The comedy team was made fun of a lot, though, which hurt.

12th grade- apply to and get accepted at my dream college, which at times I feel like I only attended to give the finger to my family, I get an offer to apply for an internship at College Humor (as a senior!), and then my grandfather, who was the single largest influence of my life, gets diagnosed with cancer, given 6 months to a year. He sees me graduate, and dies two weeks before I move out. I'm left with almost no friends from high school and a bleak future for college.

Freshman year of college: Still reeling from my grandfather's death, I stay in my room almost all year. I try out for and fail at every audition I come across for various comedy teams and singing groups, even though I assumed that my comedy and theatrical experience is what got me into the school in the first place. My radio show flops horribly, so I jump onto another and save it from sinking. Grades are alright, but I have absolutely no friends. Also, on the home front, ugliness stirs up in my church about forcing our pastor, whom my family is very close to, out of his job.

Sophomore year (present): Again, fail at every comedy/singing audition I come across, and now my current radio show is getting stuck in a rut as my character is being dramatically reduced. Still know no one I would consider a friend. My pastor resigns under duress (he did nothing wrong, just very petty people wanted him gone), throwing my church community into a mess. I get into one show, which goes alright, but now my grades are plummeting and currently in freefall as I don't know how to save them.

I'm applying for College Humor again, but that's still very up in the air. The internship process is very long and confusing even if I do get in. And if I do, I'll probably be forced to pass up a once-in-a-lifetime family trip.

I have no friends, my grades are failing, I'm possibly going to lose two great opportunities (one for the third time), and my family has enough of their own problems to deal with without me adding to the pile. I'm just tired of every good thing in my life being met with equal or greater negativity. Will I ever have a moment in my life where things will go well? Will I ever find friends? Lovers? Will I ever get a job? Will the things that go badly for me finally stop being more frequent than the good things?

As I'm typing this, I realize a lot of this may seem quite petty and childish, but it does weigh very heavily on me. I still carry a great deal of shame, sadness, and fears from being bullied so much as a kid that my self-confidence has never really come back. I'm sorry to have taken up so much of your time. I'm sure you have more important things to attend to."
sf79v,0,2012-04-17,[Short Story] She Once Had Me,Glussell,LitWorkshop,https://www.reddit.com/r/LitWorkshop/comments/sf79v/short_story_she_once_had_me/,"I hate this song, really I do.  It sends me to a dark, naive place. I really should have known better.

“*...my belle.  Sont des mots qui vont très bien ensemble.  Très bien ensemble.*”  sings the unmistakable voice of Paul McCartney as I sink lower and lower into my chair.

It didn't always used to be like this.  It used to be my favourite song.  Now I just pretend. 

“*That's all I want to say.  Until I find a way*”  the radio continues to torture me.

Let's see, where do I start?

As Claire and I walked through the night the crisp autumn air exuded from our lungs with every laugh.  I think that we both knew where this was heading.  For most people it was a night not unlike any other.  At least I suppose it was.  

My apologies.  This must be too much for you.  I forget how little you know of this.  Allow me to back up just a little bit.

She first appeared in my life one September.  She was introduced to the whole staff at my office as our new intern.  She was wearing a skirt that came part way up her thigh.  She had her blonde hair clipped back in a professional yet innocent way.  She awkwardly stood up as the boss went on about her role in our company.  She let her eyes meet mine.  She seemed to calm ever so slightly.  She went on about how much she loved and respected what we were doing.  She was so eager to make a difference.  She had all the energy that we imagine ourselves possessing in the forgotten years of our youth.

I knew that I had to meet her.  I pushed passed my colleagues to get to her first.  I extended my right hand and told her my name and she told me hers.  I laughed when she said that all of her friends called her Claire Bear.  I think that my voice cracked a bit when I told her that she could ask me if she ever needed help.  I know that my mind raced when she said that she would take me up on that offer.  I felt so excited.  I felt so awkward.  I felt like I remembered feeling when I was her age.

There were countless moments that took place over the next few weeks between Claire and I.  The lingering smiles, the coincidental lunch breaks, the accidental contacts, the perplexing flirtations.  I could go on about each one forever.  But I doubt that you have time for that.

One day while I was sitting down with a friend from work.  Somehow, we got to talking about Claire.  I am sure that I brought her up.  

“You two seem to be spending a lot of time together.”  He commented.  He was probably right.  “She's cute.  But what about...”

“But nothing.  Her and I are just friends.  Besides she's too young.”  I interrupted.

“She's not much younger than you are.  She's 21.  That's only eight years younger than you are.”

I wish he had never said that.

After I  passed into my late-twenties I seem to forget how young I actually am.  I have somehow become both ignorant of my age and self-conscious of it.  Somehow though Claire seemed young to me.  Was she full of exuberance or was I lacking in it?  Am I old enough to have been crushed by the weight of the world?

Or maybe it is just that the past four years of my life have been very eventful.  But I guess you know all about that.

Sorry, I digress.  To the point.

Our office was having a party some Friday night.  I can't remember what it was for.  Was it someone's birthday?  Or retirement?  Honestly, it doesn't matter.

Naturally I got talking to Claire.  I don't remember about what really.  Honestly, it doesn't matter.

At an infrequent pause in our conversation the music caught our attention.  A song by The Beatles came on.  Was it “Twist and Shout”?  Or was it “Day Tripper”?  Honestly, it doesn't matter.

“I love The Beatles” she said.

“Oh yeah, what's your favourite song?” I asked.  Had it been anyone else I probably would have said “Who doesn't?”.

“Norwegian Wood” she answered without an ounce of hesitation.

“Very good.”  I responded “I love Rubber Soul, I think it's their best work.  I think that my favourite song is 'Michelle'”

I didn't tell her why.  Oh how I should have.

The rest of the night we were glued together, talking about everything we could think of, but especially music.  As the night began to end, she cracked up some excuse to invite me to her place.  I think it was so she could show me her CD collection.  I didn't think to just ask to look at her iPod.

As Claire and I walked through the night the crisp autumn air exuded from our lungs with every laugh.  I think that we both knew where this was heading.  For most people it was a night not unlike any other.  At least I suppose it was.  

When we arrived at her place, naturally we put on Rubber Soul.  I fiddled with my left hand while we talked through “Drive My Car”.  Then during “Norwegian Wood” she leaned in and kissed me.  I let her.  I let her all through “You Won't See Me”.  She continued as “Nowhere Man” played.  It got heavier during “Think for Yourself”.  I don't even remember “The Word” it was so intense.  

Then, it came to “Michelle” my darling of a song.

“*Michelle, my belle.  These are words that go together well*” I ached

Each note made me want to leave.  Each note made me want to stay.

“*My Michelle*”   sang the last line as the guitar played it's beautifully sweet outro.

I felt a sigh of relief come over me.  I eagerly anticipated “What Goes On”.

“*Michelle, my belle.  These are words that go together well*” my shocked ears hear. 

The song played a few more times before we finished our passionate moment.

“Good thing it's your favourite song” she said and proceeded to fall asleep in my arms.

“*I love you, I love you, I love you.  That's all I want to say.  Until I find a way, I will say the only words I know that you'll understand*” I heard time and time again.

I lost count of how many times it played.  I couldn't take it anymore.  I slunk out from underneath Claire's arm.  I gathered my things and opened the door.  I paused for a moment to see her perfect figure bask in the moonlight.  I hurried into the night.  I made my way back to my apartment.  I was exhausted from the walk and the thought.  I opened my door.  I walked into my bedroom.  I crawled underneath my blankets.  I was still shivering.  

“Hey, you're home late” she said to me as I pressed my cold body against her warmth.

“Sorry, it was a wild night” I responded to her.

She nuzzled up into me.

“I love you Michelle” I said as she drifted off to sleep.

And 1 book will go to Africa.

At the time I was still with my ex, and she had a boyfriend that she had been with for a month or two. About a week later I broke up with my girlfriend for pre-existing reasons. We quickly became friends and soon became really close. We would hold hands, cuddle and watch movies, and she would sit on my lap or lay between my legs on the floor. Well turns out her boyfriend was cheating on her and was a complete asshole, so after a few weeks of them fighting, she broke up with him. A couple weeks later we were watching a movie together with her sitting on my lap and she started to hug me and pull me close. i hugged her back and then turned my head and decided to kiss her. She just turned away a little and i ended up kissing her chin, it was a little awkward, but a few minutes later she made a joke about the movie we were watching and we acted like it never happened.

A couple of days later we got into an argument, started by me about what was going on between us, and if she had feelings for me or was just leading me on the whole time for some reason, and she admitted to liking me but she was afraid to get too involved because in a few months we would be leaving to go back home in different parts of the country and she didnt want to deal with that kind of relationship. So I told her regardless of what happens its going to hurt to leave her after how close we've gotten and how much I care about her, so we decide to just be friends for a while. 

Recently over the past couple of weeks, there have been some changes in my plans for the future that involve me transferring schools and getting a job near this girls hometown. At first I didnt want to tell her because i felt like it would seem as if I was either lying or doing it it just for her. So I continued normally, but things started to pick up between us again, the holding hands, the cuddling, leaning against me on a counter in a very personal way one night... We were drinking one night with a bunch of friends and then started to walk home, while walking I told her I had something to say and she asked what? I let her know that I had fallen in love with her and regardless of what happens between us that I've already been planning to move to her home state, and she just smiled and hugged me. (non-relevant, but a few feet later we both saw a shooting star and it was amazing) 

So since then we've been getting closer and closer and i have kissed her on the cheek or forehead a few times after taking her home just because. Now Yesterday we spent an entire day together, something we hadnt done in a while do to work and she had a week off of vacation to spend with family, and we had a great day. she was especially affectionate, holding my hand, pulling for it whenever i got too far, wrapping her arms around my waist, and pulling my arm around her neck all the time, in the car she'd rest her head on my arm and kept looking up at me smiling. We were walking around again and her feet hurt so she asked for a piggy back ride and of course i agreed, shes very light and I carried her for a while, she said she expected me to walk 5 feet and then put her down but when i said I could carry her all night she leaned forward while still on my back and gave me a kiss on the cheek. On the ride home we stopped at a redlight and she put her head on my shoulder and looked up at me, i lay my head on hers and looked down, she got closer to me, i feel as if at that exact time she wanted me to kiss her, but my head filled with so much doubt and fear that i was making a mistake again or just imagining this that I just smiled and looked back up waiting for the light to turn green. the rest of the ride home she just kept smiling at me or making a face like =/. I feel like she either thinks I dont like her like that anymore, or something, but i just really dont know if I should try and get together with her again and go in for a kiss again. 

TL;DR I tried to kiss a girl too early and failed, now we're a lot closer and I think she really likes/loves me and I had the opportunity to kiss her again last night but was afraid I was imagining it or that she wasn't looking for a kiss even though I really feel like she was. I'm so confused and scared, help, I really love and care about this girl.

sik5l,233,2012-04-19,Proper interview attire: from a hiring manager,SweatyButcher,malefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/sik5l/proper_interview_attire_from_a_hiring_manager/,"There's been quite a few posts about how people should look for an interview, with a lot more unnecessary or inaccurate advice. The reason I decided to write this is because I worry that some of you are putting too much time into how you look. **If you can only dedicate *X* amount of hours into preparing for your interview, 99% of your time should be preparing for your answers. Looking better than other candidates isn't going to really play a factor, truthfully.**

Let me preface by saying my perspective comes as a hiring manager that isn't based on fashion or appearances. So if you're applying for a job in the fashion industry, marketing, presentations, or anything like this, then this post doesn't apply to you. This post is meant for people who are applying for most standard behind-the-desk jobs. 

*EDIT: As others have pointed out, this isn't an all-encompassing post that will cover every interview. Every industry is different, and every company within shared industries are different. How you should look for a government job will be drastically different than a small startup, which is different from a law firm. To top things off, the position level also changes how important your look is. I'm simply catering this post to the numerous posts I've seen: entry to mid level jobs in areas that typically don't have stricter attire standards.*

For what it's worth, I work in the software industry. Most of the candidates I interview &amp; hire are fresh out of college, or have graduated 1 or 2 years prior to their interview. As a result, I interview for internships and entry-level positions.

**WHAT TO WEAR**

***To put it simply, all you need to do is to try to look professional. That's it.*** Everything else is pretty much unnecessary. Dressing very nice won't help you that much. Dressing poorly, on the other hand, CAN hurt you. To put it in gaming-numerics, dressing nice, at best, will give you a +2; dressing poorly can hurt you by -15. The only time we notice what you wear is if it's too distracting 

From the company's perspective, they're just looking for someone who can do the job, and if they can work in team to do said job. What you wear and how you look provides almost no indication of your ability to do these things.

**So what does dressing professional mean?**

[Shujin states it best](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/sik5l/proper_interview_attire_from_a_hiring_manager/c4en9up):

&gt;For actual attire: Feel free to call the secretary and ask what most people wear around the office. If no one wears a suit ever, then it might be overkill. For most professional positions (human resources, finance, management, high-clerical, education, sales) you'll want a suit. Some positions will require a simple button-up and dress trousers or chinos (medium-to-low level clerical work, some construction or other labor, some manufacturing, some transportation services, some food services or retail).

&gt;For a suit, you want a 2-button charcoal or navy suit, with either dark brown or black shoes (preferably balmorals). A maroon, navy, or gold tie is fine. Feel free to get a simple stripe tie. Don't get any ties with more than 3 colors. A white, point-collar shirt is the standard. No french cuffs or other adornments, keep jewelry to a minimum. Socks should match the trousers. That's basically it.

&gt;For positions that don't expect suits, most of the time you are fine with a white or light blue button-up (perhaps even an OCBD) tucked into dress trousers (charcoal, medium grey) or chinos (khaki). You can get away with black or brown loafers, but oxfords are a better choice (bluchers are fine with chinos). Feel free to throw on a blazer (grey or navy) if you want to sharpen up a touch. Again, socks match trousers.
Below that, feel free to just go polo and chinos with loafers. For anything below that, use your discretion. Keep in mind that minimal is better. Wear what makes you comfortable in your interview.

**COMMON QUESTIONS**

*Doesn't dressing nicely show an attention to detail?*

Of course. But when it comes to interviews, there are far better indicators. The thing with dressing nice is that you can prepare ""easily"" by getting advice from others. Any decent interviewer will have questions prepared to show how much attention to detail you really have, especially the type that's relevant to the job you're applying for.

*Doesn't dressing nicely give a strong first impression?*

Yes and no. It gives a negative impression, if you dress VERY poorly. Not so much if you dress nicely. There's a process to selecting interview candidates. We don't just interview anyone who applies - that would be a waste of a lot of time. To filter candidates, we have to look at resumes &amp; transcripts, plus ask pre-interview questionnaires. Those are our first impressions. We're far more interested in what you have to say than how you look.

*Can I wear black?*

Most candidates wear black. Like I said, most candidates I hire are really young, and didn't pay attention to their suits. Those that don't know any better (myself included) often go with black.

*What if my suit doesn't fit as nicely?*

Again, just as long as it's close enough. We don't expect perfectly tailored suits. We know for some candidates having a great suit isn't your top priority. For the job at hand, it isn't relevant. Just make sure you're trying. Like we said, fit is only relevant if the what you're wearing is noticeably large or noticeably small. It's at that point we start to wonder ""Why didn't they get a better fitting suit? They can at least put a little more effort into it.""

**FINAL ADVICE**

Again, if it looks professional, then you've done everything you've needed to do. Dedicating more time than necessary on how you look is a waste of time. The biggest general advice I can give on landing the job you're applying for is to check out a book called ""Knock 'em Dead"" by Martin Yates. I literally credit that book for getting the job I have now. Putting a couple of hours into that book will reap SIGNIFICANTLY more rewards than putting those hours into how you look.

NOTE: *I'd also like to mention that suit recommendations for an interview is very different from getting a suit for all occasions and using it for an interview.* ***This post applies to the former.*** If you're doing the latter, then mentioning it's going to be used for an interview is most likely irrelevant. If it looks good for most occasions, then it'll definitely be good for an interview.

***TL;DR: Try to dress professionally, and err on the side of cautious and conservative. All you have to do is look ""good enough"". Dressing nice won't really help you to much, but dressing poorly can hurt you. Interviewers care far more about what you say than how you look.***

EDIT: The advice I provide is based on the idea that you're expected to wear some sort of business attire to the interview. There are lots of interviews that don't have an attire requirement, and that you're free to wear what you please. I think we can all agree that the best play is to simply ask them what you're expected to wear. "

sidam,0,2012-04-19,I'm considering a CS or CIS degree - what are your opinions?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/sidam/im_considering_a_cs_or_cis_degree_what_are_your/,"**TL;DR** I'm considering going back to school to obtain a CS or potentially a CIS degree.  Math is not a forte for me, but people skills are, so I was leaning slightly more towards CIS.  I'm coming to reddit to ask for opinions because A) after some research there seems to be some sentiment out there that these degrees aren't necessary / what they used to be, B) I'm unsure as to which one would be most beneficial / useful, and C) considering I'm not brand new to the college scene and getting a little older, would I be better off trying to teach myself and get work experience rather than get a degree.

Any thoughts or opinions are quite welcome.

**Brief background**: I have approximately 100 credit hours under my belt from hopping around in various degrees when I first went to college (like many, I had no idea what I wanted to do).  I took a couple years off to work and get rid of some of that debt.  I'm 26 - and while I'm still relatively young (obviously I'm not headed for the nursing home just yet) - I feel as though I'm a bit late in the game for a CS/CIS degree.

A lot of people say that ""any degree is better than no degree"", and similarly, that ""you can be 30 without a degree or 30 with a degree"".  I agree with both of those views, and one way or the other I am going to finish my degree, but I'm looking for some practical advice.

After doing some preliminary research, it seems there are a lot of negative views about the IT world out there concerning computer science and information science. H1Bs are taking all the jobs, a CS/CIS degree is worthless without actual work experience, etc.

Would I be making a mistake going for either of those degrees at this point?  Is it *really* that bad out there for these graduates, let alone a guy like me who will be around 30 (give or take) when I complete it?  I have to admit it has me a little worried.

**My thoughts**:  My primary interest is coding and programming, and not so much the theory and math end of things.  Initially this lead me to believe that I should just self teach myself for a while, try to get some internships and an apprenticeship, and get work experience organically.  However after doing some research, it seems that if you go this route you stand a good chance of getting stuck as a ""code monkey"" (saw that term thrown around quite a bit), and have little job stability due to outsourcing and not having deeper technical skills necessary for better, higher paying work.  Hence my thoughts on going back to obtain a degree.

As far as a CIS degree goes, I figured it might be a better fit than a computer science degree as I do have a business background (some of my undergrad classes were in business), and work well with people.  In that sense it might be a better fit than doing the technical work 80% of the time.  However there also seems to be the sentiment that a CIS degree is worthless compared to a proper CS degree, and is for people who can't hack the CS degree.

I suppose it's also worth mentioning that during my earlier studies I only completed math as high as college algebra, so I would need to refresh as well as take Calc 1 and 2 etc.  I'm neutral towards math in general, meaning, I'm okay with it, but it doesn't come naturally or easily so that could be a potential struggle point with a CS degree.

Any thoughts or opinions you have on the matter would be greatly appreciated!

They work on very large and important contracts for large clients (some of them governmental projects). My interview went very well and they seem VERY excited to have me.

They also didn't seem phased that I have much more experience in Java than I do in C++, which is the language we will be coding in at work (using Visual Studio, mostly). I have been studying C++ extensively since my acceptance and really trying to hammer down the major concepts, most of which are quite familiar from my experience in Java.

Here's my question: I start the job in just a few weeks. What can I do between now and then to help myself be a better member of their software engineering team? I can learn C++ concepts, yes, but what can I do to prepare myself to USE those concepts in a fast-paced setting and on a team with people who have been writing in C++ since the language existed?

TL;DR - Starting C++ internship, what can I do to prepare myself to transfer my theoretical knowledge to being a valuable team member?"

si9xv,3,2012-04-19,US to UK (Amersham/London area) - Natural Resource &amp; Energy Policy background,taniapdx,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/si9xv/us_to_uk_amershamlondon_area_natural_resource/,"Well here goes, the decision has been made! After a lifetime of wishing I could move to the UK, it seems to be the right time to start setting plans in motion. 

About me:

* 36 yo, female, US citizen, born in Oregon
* I will receive my Masters of Public Administration this fall/winter from Portland State University, my focus is natural resource policy, with an emphasis on energy policy and conflict resolution. I also have a B.S. from Oregon State University in American Studies (focus on environmental science &amp; history, cultural anthropology, and ethnic studies) and a minor in resource economics. 
* Understanding that course work is not necessarily the same thing as experience, my academic background is in PR, tribal law, HR management, conflict resolution, administrative law &amp; policy, analytic methods/statistics, shrinking cities, grantwriting, finance &amp; budget in the public sector, and comparative cultures/ethnic &amp; indigenous studies.
* My interests, so far as future careers go, are mainly in the public sector, either at the local or national level. Energy, forestry, water, and resource advising, liaising, PR/Community outreach, and conflict resolution/mediation are my overall focuses, and I feel I'm well suited for work in most any agency dealing with some combination of these issues.
* I spent about six years working at OSU as a grant &amp; manuscript editor, secretary/assistant to department heads, a lot of my job was event and travel preparation, document creation (excel, word, mathtype, powerpoint, publisher, etc.) Since moving back to Portland I have worked as a legislative intern with Oregon's Citizen's Utility Board (a ratepayer advocacy group) and I have worked as a field representative with the U.S. Census for a little more than two years.
* No criminal convictions
* I have a bit of high school French and minimally conversational Spanish. By no means fluent in either, but I can usually get by in short conversations.
* I am looking for a semi-permanent to permanent expatriation, depending on how life goes.
* On the personal side, I have two daughters going off to university next year. Having a lot of 'mom guilt', but they seem to have come down on the side of ""we're going away for four years and don't really care where you are because hey, there's this thing called the internet."" My younger one has been asking to move in with her uncle and his wife for years, and seems to be genuinely excited about having a dad figure, so I'm leaving a lot of the 'when' to her. May be next summer when my oldest goes to uni, may be the summer after if my youngest decides she can't live without me...I'm thinking it will be somewhere in between 14-26 months from now.
* My boyfriend lives in Amersham, so I'm definitely leaning towards finding a job in that general area. I'd like to be close enough to see him within an hour...not so close as to smother him after being long (so long) distance for two years. I'm staying with him for about a month this summer and will have a good chance to see the area and surrounding cities better, as I've really only spent time in London and Wales (where my family is from). Hoping to go back in the winter/spring after I'm done with classes to put out feelers for jobs as the actual move date gets closer.
* I'm definitely looking at dual-citizenship, and wondering how much easier (if at all) it will be to go through the Welsh bureaucracy? My family is from Pembrokeshire and Cardiganshire (and my distant cousins still live there). I don't know if one can claim repatriation 150 years after your ancestors fled the country, but while I am also Scotch and Irish by way of my mother's father's family, I would consider my heritage to be 'mainly Welsh' and think that may be the way to go.

I feel like there are about 400 things that have to happen in order, and I'm on number 3, but just deciding that this is happening and having the support of family, friends, colleagues, boyfriend, etc. is making it a lot easier to seriously think about making the leap. Any and all advice/connection/help will be most welcome!"

Well, on Sunday I smoked the last of my stash, and I hope not to buy again and also not smoke again, so that I can try to work out whether some of the issues that I have struggled with over the years really are related to Pot (let's be honest, from reading this subreddit, spoiler alert, they most likely are).

I live in South Africa, just to clarify any strange terms/ideas...
My story is pretty tame really, I first smoked when I was 16, I'm turning 26 in September. Started out very occasionally, at house parties/when I was with my friends with slightly more lenient parents we would go and buy a ""matchbox"" of proper ditch-weed and smoke it through pretty atrociously rolled roaches. 

Anyway, after school I slowly started getting into bong smoking, and also my best friends who I lived with through uni started smoking as well. So gradually we all just started smoking more and more, and from 2006 when I started uni in Cape Town, till about 2009 me and my friends/housemates' usage grew from weekends to daily. 

This didn't really affect my work, I did really well in uni, graduating top of my class with a 1st class (&gt;80% average) degree in Film Theory and Production. 

Anyway, I then went to England for a while, wanting to have both a ""gap-year"" and maybe do a little film work there. While there I became quite depressed, being stuck in various hotel/restaurant jobs, and feeling generally unfulfilled and unmotivated. As a result, and because of suddenly having access to pretty good weed, I started smoking alot. like all the time. mornings before work, after work, at certain points I was sneaking away during a shift to have a sneaky smoke (I was a shift manager at a hotel, so I could disappear for 5 mins without being interrogated). In uni, there was a ""safety net"" of sorts, I had to be clear headed to do my work, and do well, because I wanted to do well. At the hotel, or later the restaurant, I could do the work with my fucking eyes closed, so, often, I did the next best thing, I did it stoned. 

Eventually (about april last year) I realised that London was not doing me any favours work or life-wise (this isn't hate for teh place itself, I actually do love it, it was just my headspace at teh time) and I returned to Cape Town. I moved back in with my friends, and basically resumed my life here. I got a good internship at a good production company through some friends, and have, in the last 7 months already been promoted to junior researcher from intern. But, I was still smoking daily. not before work, hellz no, but afterwards, and on weekends, all day on weekends. 

At a certain point I decided to stop during teh week and only do weekends. Which worked for a while, although I tended to overindulge then on weekends. Eventually I realised that I was, in actuall fact, addicted to pot. I was no longer doing it because it was fun, I was doing it because I craved it, I couldn't be at home, not doing anything and not have it. Add to that me starting to realise (through reading testimonies on this subreddit) that alot of the ""issues"" i had struggled with in recent years (depression, anxiety, social anxiety, paranoia, procrastiantion and lack of motivation) were rather common side effects of the love affairs with the sweet leaf (some of them had actually gotten worse in the last year or two, when I started really smoking alot). 

So here I am, 26 years old, in a secure junior position, with a head full of ambition, and not wanting to compromise that ambition in any way that I have control over. 
I know I am capable of doing this, of kicking this habit and improving my life, but I also know it'll be difficult, especially considering I live with 3 daily smokers, and alot of my friends are regular smokers too. But I have resolve, more to improve my life than to quit, and I think the challenge (but also the key) is for me to keep making teh connection between quitting and improving my life.

Anyway, sorry for the ramble. Not really asking for help (although any advice and/or support will be appreciated) just wanted to write it all out, so I can see it all in front of me. Incidentally, me writing this has already given me more perspective on my dependence on MaryJ.

So keep it real r/leaves, thanks for the great discussions and support you give out, and also for just being there :-)

Does anyone have any ideas on a good way to find one? I've tried looking at sites like myjobs.kr and a few others but haven't found anything promising. If anyone has had any experience finding an internship for the summer I would appreciate any help you could provide.
shk44,2,2012-04-19,Gap between fall semester and spring study abroad program?,strikefreedom1000,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/shk44/gap_between_fall_semester_and_spring_study_abroad/,"Hey guys so I applied to study abroad in Japan next spring and if I get accepted the spring semester doesn't start until April. On the flipside, my fall semester at Berkeley will be done mid December. During those 3 months I was wondering if it would be possible to work full-time here or find an internship around Berkeley. Is this plausible? or should I go back home and try to find a part-time job where I wouldn't have to worry about rent and food since I'd be living at home :( 

Just wondering how realistic would it be for me to be able to stay in Berkeley while being able to find a job or internship that would give me sufficient funds for food and rent here. Thanks!"

My friend Ellen and I are coming to Columbus this summer for a joint internship at a Columbus-based non-profit. We're both from out of state and need a place to live!

The non-profit is in the Upper Arlington area. We prefer a furnished apartment, 2 bedrooms is ideal but a spacious one-bedroom is a possibility.

Please let me know what you have available.

Thanks! - Dave"

So I've been offered an internship in Saarbrücken for this summer and this being the first time I'll be traveling abroad I'm trying to do as much research as possible about living abroad. I've done a lot of research already, but I realized while browsing Reddit that I was looking at an amazing resource and repository of collective knowledge/experience that I hadn't utilized yet! So after some searching it seemed that this subreddit might be able to help me out. (If there is a better/more appropriate subreddit, definitely point me at it!)

There really aren't any parameters on the advice I'm looking for. Next on my ""to-do"" list is to look at cell phone options while over there (pay-as-you-go vs. attempting to unlock my phone), comfort tips for transatlantic flights, and how to open a back account (required for my stipend). However any information/personal experiences/resources/tips/warnings/etc will be more than and greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance and I hope y'all are well!"

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[Thoughts on Invisible Children campaign?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sggc9/iama_reporter_who_traveled_with_the_ugandan_army/c4dtsba?context=5)|I think the campaign raised awareness among huge numbers of people about a man who has brought immense misery to countless thousands, so that's good. At the same time, the first video focused on Uganda and didn't explain the deep complexities of that country enough, or the role of the Ugandan military and government in creating and fomenting the crisis in the north of the country. So that was a problem. 
[Invisible Children's work is not so popular in Uganda. Last Friday, during an official IC screening of KONY 2012 part 2, the audience started to pelt the screen, and IC organizers, with rocks. Ugandan police, in turn fired live rounds at the audience. One death and several injuries were reported.  Link to www.monitor.co.ug.  It was the second riot, or near-riot, that Invisible Children's videos have provoked in Uganda.  What are your thoughts on this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sggc9/iama_reporter_who_traveled_with_the_ugandan_army/c4dwra3?context=5)|I think they have every right to be upset about whatever they want to. They're the ones who live there, who have had to deal with LRA and UPDF atrocities. They are the legitimate voice in all of this.  
[Your Newsweek article lionizes the Ugandan army, which the UN 2010 Mapping Report suggests may be guilty of genocide in the DR Congo.  Uganda was charged by the International Criminal Court, in 2005, with looting and massive human rights abuses in the DR Congo -  the same year the ICC indicted Kony. Your article neglects this.  Thoughts?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sggc9/iama_reporter_who_traveled_with_the_ugandan_army/c4dwsyp?context=5)|I addressed this earlier. But to recap. The article was meant to be focused tightly on the chase for Kony, not on the various human rights abuses of 4 different armies with plenty to be critical about.  It's not just the Ugandan army that deserves more scrutiny. The DRC army is notorious, particularly among LRA victims, for abuses of a very similar sort.  This is important material and is worthy of further examination. I regret that I wasn't able to give it the space it deserved, but I just wasn't.  This was a different story. 
[How safe is it for you on the ground over there? Do Kony's people monitor the western media's analysis of them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sggc9/iama_reporter_who_traveled_with_the_ugandan_army/c4dttll?context=5)|It's interesting. While we were there a Kony 'spokesperson' issued a 19-page response to Invisible Children's movie, and the AU and US participation. It was mostly rambling, non-sensical. But you got the sense they're keeping an eye on things. Oddly, the LRA has a lot of supporters who are part of the diaspora in Europe.  One hears from them now and again. 
[Is that 19 page response posted somewhere? Seem's like an interesting read.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sggc9/iama_reporter_who_traveled_with_the_ugandan_army/c4du87w?context=5)|Yes, just google it, shouldn't be too hard to find. 
[*Oddly, the LRA has a lot of supporters who are part of the diaspora in Europe. One hears from them now and again.*  Can you comment on this please?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sggc9/iama_reporter_who_traveled_with_the_ugandan_army/c4dy418?context=5)|I reported on this more a few years back, so I'm not so up to speed now. But I remember that there are groups of people in Europe who support the LRA to some extent, and then to a much larger extent, the idea of a rebellion of sorts by northern Ugandans against Museveni's regime, which showed them little mercy and a great deal of cruelty for a long time.  And Kony has spokespeople and negotiators and middle men scattered all around, people who feed him info and tips and intelligence, things like that. 
[We've been told that Kony left Uganda years ago. Where were you hunting for him?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sggc9/iama_reporter_who_traveled_with_the_ugandan_army/c4dtues?context=5)|We were in Central African Republic, which is where the UPDF believes him to be these days.  
[But some people say he is already dead?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sggc9/iama_reporter_who_traveled_with_the_ugandan_army/c4du29a?context=5)|People said OBL was dead. And Kony has committed atrocities recently enough that I think the consensus is that he's not yet dead. 
[I've traveled to Uganda and Kenya before and am intrigued about the Central Africa Republic. It is so isolated and we hardly hear anything about it. What is the country and it's citizens like? How do they feel about the LRA and the Ugandan military searching their country for them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sggc9/iama_reporter_who_traveled_with_the_ugandan_army/c4dy4oh?context=5)|It's very poor, very isolated, not many roads, and very little infrastructure.  Lots of jungle and plenty of people with guns to make a bad situation worse.  I think those people affected by LRA attacks would like for Kony to be caught yesterday. I think they're frustrated, as are so many others, that it is taking so long, has taken so long, may continue to take a long, long time.  I think they're surviving and trying to make the best of a pretty crap situation. 
[Was there anything that really made you upset or distressed which you saw when you got over there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sggc9/iama_reporter_who_traveled_with_the_ugandan_army/c4dturu?context=5)|I've reported on Kony for a few years now, and what always disturbs me is speaking to the victims.  It's incredibly sad and most of them are very traumatized.  Some of them, it should be said, have been brutalized not just by the LRA but by the armies of DRC, Sudan, and Uganda as well, so they've been doubly or triply victimized.  They have awful stories of having to kill people by force, or be killed, of witnessing rapes, mutilations, beatings, torture. etc.  And hearing small children say these things is always very disturbing. 
[Do you often find them to be distant or mentally scarred?  Or do most of the victims recover and learn to live with their experiences?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sggc9/iama_reporter_who_traveled_with_the_ugandan_army/c4du18d?context=5)|I think many of them are scarred for life.  But, yes, they do get on with things, they return to work, to families, to life.  Some succeed better than others, obviously. Some don't make it.  But there is a real life-affirming ethos in much of that part of the world, I find, and people survive, and even thrive in the midst of incredibly difficult experiences. 
[In these ""pursuit"" operations, how much actual conflict takes place? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sggc9/iama_reporter_who_traveled_with_the_ugandan_army/c4dtsb8?context=5)|It depends.  We didn't have any 'contact' when we were out, but we heard many stories of recent incidents, including one about two weeks before we were there. So it does happen.  The UPDF claims the LRA isn't on the offensive these days as much as running from them, but they would say that.  However, the evidence seems to bear out the claim that most LRA attacks are against soft targets -- civilians, villages etc. 
[Could you talk a little about how this assignment was set up. How did you go about ""embedding"" with the Ugandan army? I don't suppose they have a public affairs officer or anything.  Also, what effect will U.S. special forces have in this area. Do you think their training of the Ugandan army could have a noticeable effect on the security of the region?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sggc9/iama_reporter_who_traveled_with_the_ugandan_army/c4dtwkb?context=5)|The role of the US forces, I think, remains to be seen.  They could help train the UPDF and improve their capabilities, yes. But they could also perhaps contribute to the existing instability of the region by making 'military solutions' seem like the only solutions. I don't know though, I think we have to wait and see.  And yes, Husky!  Good to see a fellow Washingtonian on here. 
[How did you start your journalism career? What made you want to go into that field?  Also: go Huskies.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sggc9/iama_reporter_who_traveled_with_the_ugandan_army/c4dzjq3?context=5)|I started as an intern and slowly moved up, getting small stories, then bigger ones, then traveling more and so on.  I loved writing, traveling, I loved adventures.  And I had a great mentor and teacher who shepherded me through the whole process, who taught me a lot about writing, about asking questions. So I was lucky, and I loved the work, and it just came as a natural progression over the years.  
[Isn't ""embedding"" a tactic created by the US military for PR purposes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sggc9/iama_reporter_who_traveled_with_the_ugandan_army/c4dxa5x?context=5)|It can be, sometimes.  It can also be a very effective way of seeing things that you might not otherwise see on your own.  Sometimes embedding works well; other times it's a bit of a flop. It just depends on what's happening, who you're with and so forth.  
[Based on your responses here, you seem somewhat aware of the atrocious human rights record of the UPDF, yet I could not find that dimension in you story. Do you care to comment on this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sggc9/iama_reporter_who_traveled_with_the_ugandan_army/c4dx0ue?context=5)|Sure.  The story was mainly a narrative about the hunt for Kony, what it looked like from the ground, not so much about the extensive human rights abused of not just the UPDF but the other three armies that will also eventually form the bulk of the AU force that will continue to hunt for Kony.  I mentioned a bit about Museveni's atrocious record in the north, but I just didn't have the space to go into it in much more detail. It's a worthy story, and one I'd like to tackle in a separate piece. But this just wasn't the place for an extensive review of the history of UPDF.  
[So, a leaked UN report has suggested the army you've just lionized in your Newsweek story, as a great defender of human rights, may have committed genocide in the DR Congo, where you were ""embedded"" with that army -- and you acknowledge being aware that this army in question has committed human rights abuses, but you say you ""didn't have the space to go into it in much more detail""?  That's really interesting. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sggc9/iama_reporter_who_traveled_with_the_ugandan_army/c4dzqgo?context=5)|Well, the follow up story to do now is to confirm whether or not this leaked report is accurate, to find victims who will testify to what the UPDF has done, to dig into it deeper. I'm not disagreeing that it's a good story, it's just not the one I went to CAR to report on.  Doing one does not negate the possibility that the other is still possible.  You're fishing, but the river's dry, dude.  I'm not against looking into the UPDF in more detail. It's just not what this story was about.  This was about the hunt for Kony.  
[Uganda is known for having strong anti-homosexual sentiment (this may be an understatement on my part, but I didn't know how else to word it right now\). What are the factors that contribute to such a high level of rejection of LGBT persons?   In your travels through Uganda and other countries in the region, did you encounter any children with nodding disease?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sggc9/iama_reporter_who_traveled_with_the_ugandan_army/c4dutpl?context=5)|Yes, Uganda certainly stands out in Africa for its rabid homophobia.  I haven't really studied it, but generally I wouldn't say Africa is the most open place to homosexuality.  There's a strong religious culture in many societies. Churches are ubiquitous and powerful. And just culturally, it's not particularly welcomed.  I recall that Uganda had a policy of recommending abstinence, which worked for a while, but I think HIV numbers started creeping back up. But you'd have to verify this.  And no, I never did come across a kid with nodding disease, though as I said in an earlier post, it's big news in Uganda right now. 
[Why is it so hard to find Kony? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sggc9/iama_reporter_who_traveled_with_the_ugandan_army/c4dufk0?context=5)|The area where he's believed to be hiding is about the size of California. It's incredibly dense jungle, no roads, no infrastructure.  It's crisscrossed with rivers, impassable thickets of forest, etc. It's one of the most hostile areas I've ever been to. And there are small groups of people moving and hiding there, who know how to hide, to sneak around, to snatch food and water when and where they can.  It's actually very challenging to find anything in that environment. 
[Ahh okay, One more question, how often are child soldiers shot? is there any hesitance when it needs to be done?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sggc9/iama_reporter_who_traveled_with_the_ugandan_army/c4durod?context=5)|I don't know, actually. I think a lot of the 'soldiers' escape if there's contact. Many are relieved when they are able to flee the LRA, or when a fight enables them to get rescued.  But I'm sure some of them have been shot. I don't have any numbers though. 
[So, how did you get into reporting from dangerous parts of the world? did you start out with that in mind? or did you kind of fall into it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sggc9/iama_reporter_who_traveled_with_the_ugandan_army/c4dty5i?context=5)|I started out as an intern, actually, years ago. And then moved up to smaller assignments. And then on to war reporting, which seemed like the next most logical step. And I've enjoyed it a lot. But I wouldn't want to do it forever.  
[What equipment were you allowed to bring? Did you carry or had to learn how to properly handle any weapons?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sggc9/iama_reporter_who_traveled_with_the_ugandan_army/c4dtw3k?context=5)|Nope, we just had our notebooks, cameras, and backpacks with food and water. Though we definitely could have used more water, both Trevor and I got pretty dehydrated. It was exceedingly hot, humid and we were carrying a lot of gear, and thus sweating a lot!  
[Is going after Kony really worth supporting a scummy and corrupt government like Uganda? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sggc9/iama_reporter_who_traveled_with_the_ugandan_army/c4du4rw?context=5)|Depends.  Consider this though.  Last year there were roughly 287 LRA attacks (I think that's the right number), and those attacks led to about 500,000 people being displaced in three countries.  So even though his numbers are small, his capacity to be a huge destabilizing force in the region remains very potent.  Just something to think about.  
[How was the Ugandan army? Nice guys or mean?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sggc9/iama_reporter_who_traveled_with_the_ugandan_army/c4dtt90?context=5)|The photographer I was with, Trevor Snapp, and I both found them to be relatively professional. Again, they were no doubt on their best behavior. But they knew what they were doing, they were very pleasant to us, kept us safe, and seemed in all matters like they respected themselves and their jobs.  I say all that fully aware of the heinous atrocities they have been accused of in both Uganda and DRC. 
[Kony's actions are clearly atrocious, and he deserves to be brought to justice. With that being said, I've been reading that he's not even close to the worst of his kind. So I guess my question is: why is so much attention/publicity given to Kony and not the others?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sggc9/iama_reporter_who_traveled_with_the_ugandan_army/c4du3mn?context=5)|Well, I think the movie did a lot to bolster attention around him.  That's one.  Also, he's kind of a throwback, don't you think -- to an earlier era when Africa was literally overrun with guys like this?  So I think the pure barbarism he represents is kind of an affront to people. But yes, there are people who do terrible things elsewhere. But maybe they haven't been doing it for as long as Kony?  
[Would any of the rescued child soldiers be able to know where Koney is hiding?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sggc9/iama_reporter_who_traveled_with_the_ugandan_army/c4du0jh?context=5)|Rescued children are a huge source of intelligence for the different people working to find Kony.  They may not know where he is hiding at the moment, but they often might know where he would be headed, or how many troops he had with him, what he was carrying, radios, gps, etc, And whether or not he was moving fast, slow.  That kind of thing. 
[Thanks for doing an AMA! What was the reaction from the Ugandan people when they found out what you were there for?  How many people that you talked to had been directly affected by Kony and the Lord's Resistance Army?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sggc9/iama_reporter_who_traveled_with_the_ugandan_army/c4dtwjk?context=5)|Ugandans I've met have always been very supportive of me when I've visited as a journalist, I've never really had any problems, and that includes both people in Kampala and north, in Gulu.  As for people affected, I met with at least a dozen people who either fled LRA atrocities, or are helping to hunt them down, or have known people who have been victimized. And then there were the dozens of UPDF soldiers we talked to.  In that part of the world, the LRA is a reality, and so virtually everyone has either been affected by them, or has an opinion one way or another about them. 
[I'm wondering what you think the best attitude for North American and European governments and citizens to take towards the chaos in Africa; do you think there's anything helpful or productive that we, as individuals can do? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sggc9/iama_reporter_who_traveled_with_the_ugandan_army/c4du0yk?context=5)|Ooh, that's a tough one.  there are as many opinions on that as seconds in the day.  There is a lot people in the West can do, but first among I'd say is educate yourself about Africa.  Learn what the problems are, where they are, and understand that Africa is an immensely complicated, interesting and dynamic place.  Then perhaps see if there is somewhere you might fit into the bigger picture there. 
[The general populace have a very shallow pool of knowledge regarding affairs, both economically and politically, of Africa.  Do you think the Kony 2012 will help shed more light, or even 'publicity' on Africa, and its problems as a whole?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sggc9/iama_reporter_who_traveled_with_the_ugandan_army/c4duhgi?context=5)|Well, it would be great if it did.  I've heard lots of stories from older people who say their kids come to them at the breakfast table after having seen the video and say, you know, we have to do something about this. They want to learn about Africa, they want to be engaged. It's a start, I think. 
[Well, so much for your posture of journalistic objectivity.  Thoughts?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sggc9/iama_reporter_who_traveled_with_the_ugandan_army/c4dx5cq?context=5)|Well, I said it was a start, and I stand by that. I certainly don't think this video is a panacea for all the problems in the area, or even those just having to do with Kony alone.  But it's hard to argue that raising awareness about a criminal warlord is bad for the people who are learning.  Or do you reckon I'm way off base? 
[As a student of economic development, I was wondering if you can personally testify to the role of NGO's (Invisible Children and beyond\) in combating poverty or in achieving other social goals (education/human rights etc\)?  I guess I'm wondering how the growth of NGO's in the past decade has changed citizen-government relations and how that has, in turn, changed the situation on the ground.  Secondly, I know that most journalists (and academics\) consider the ramifications of the Arab Spring to be limited to the MENA region.  But what are the effects of the revolutions in the rest of the continent.  Specifically, are there localized groups (in Uganda and elsewhere\) who have drawn inspiration or direct tactical knowledge from the revolutions?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sggc9/iama_reporter_who_traveled_with_the_ugandan_army/c4du4g7?context=5)|As for the Arab Spring, I can't say for sure how it has affected the rest of the continent.  I think at least in places like Western Equatoria, where I was, people are just trying to survive, to have a stable home, to put food on the table, to feel safe from the predations of LRA or other armed groups, or militaries.  So the larger push for democracy isn't a massive priority right now. 
[There's an old line from the show The West Wing where CJ says that most African aid projects fail due to a lack of roads and infrastructure.  Is that true?  Is there any progress being made?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sggc9/iama_reporter_who_traveled_with_the_ugandan_army/c4du529?context=5)|Infrastructure in some parts of Africa is, yes, terrible.  It's partly what led to the failure of the so-called ""Green Revolution"" in the 1970's, and remains a problem to this day. It's why the Chinese are making loads of cash building roads and railroads across the continent. It's also why, to get anywhere near where the forces are hunting Kony, you have to fly by helicopter. There are no roads. Until recently, S. Sudan, the size of France, had something like 50 km of paved roads.  Try developing anything with that kind of infrastructure.  
[Have you been shot at or near gun fire?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sggc9/iama_reporter_who_traveled_with_the_ugandan_army/c4dtvgo?context=5)|Yes, I have, but not in Uganda.  But when I was in Iraq for several years, and in Afghanistan, I was. 
[I find it hard to believe that Kony hasn't been captured after all these years, especially considering all the different players involved in finding him. Why do you think this is? Is the jungle so vast it's just very easy to hide, or does he have connections in the right places? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sggc9/iama_reporter_who_traveled_with_the_ugandan_army/c4du7pi?context=5)|This is interesting. It's a complicated story. He has had support over the years from different quarters. For a long time, Omar Bashir in Sudan gave him support with materiel and logistics, plane lifts, phones, food, medical supplies, that kind of thing. Some have speculated that senior Ugandan Army officers have helped him out to prolong his campaign, and thus their own job security as his pursuers.  And others have said that he has gotten support from people in N. Uganda who are, for one reason or another, sympathetic to his cause. 
[In the grand scheme of things in Africa, or even just that particular region of Africa how important is hunting down and catching Joseph Kony? Meaning do people over there really care about this or do they care more about foreigners keeping their hands out of their countires, growing the economy/infrastructure, religios advancement? Just...how BIG is the LRA over there as an issue?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sggc9/iama_reporter_who_traveled_with_the_ugandan_army/c4du5e6?context=5)|It really is an issue with affected communities.  In villages along the S. Sudan, Congo or CAR border, people really are afraid of Kony and the LRA, mostly because when he raids them, it can throw their whole life and/or village structure into immediate and permanent disarray.  But they've also gone through a lot of war, so they do have other concerns.  As I said in an above post, they want to feed their families, settle down, raise their crops, be farmers, be peaceful.  And at least in S. Sudan, the last several years of war has made that impossible. Kony, on top of all that, is like a match in a bowl full of gas. 
[Does Kony's LRA compare in grusomeness to Taylor's RUF? If so, what are some gruesome things that Koney has done?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sggc9/iama_reporter_who_traveled_with_the_ugandan_army/c4due0r?context=5)|I think so, yes.  He routinely forces small children to kill their own parents once they've been abducted. He and his men kill people on the run and leave them in the jungle. He hacks off lips, noses ears.  In one documented case, he made some abductees eat other people.  He rapes, burns villages, tortures.  Yeah, it's bad stuff.

It certainly raised expectations, and upped the stakes for the people who have made it their bailywick.  I have no idea if we got close to him, he could have been hiding 200 meters away and we wouldn't have known it. But we didn't have any contact with any LRA.

I'll stick to doing what I do, telling stories as I see them, reporting, writing. But I will say that I think Kony is part of a much larger dynamic in East and Central Africa.  It's not enough to just do away with him.  A lot of much bigger structural, governmental, economic issues have to be dealt with before the problems in that part of the world will begin to heal.  
[Hi! Do you think that the hunt for Kony is a good thing, and do you think that the Invisible Children charity is doing a good job of spreading the word and supporting the cause?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sggc9/iama_reporter_who_traveled_with_the_ugandan_army/c4dtsnh?context=5)|I think the world would be a better place without Kony, yes.  But I guess you'd be hard pressed to find anyone who'd disagree with that.  But it's complicated.  Yes, the hunt seems to be the only viable option to deal with him now.  I don't believe he will negotiate, he has no incentive to do so, he's an indicted war criminal. He has also lost the patronage of the people who once supported him, like Sudan's Bashir, or at least that's what I've been told.  But the tricky thing is that when you introduce more people with guns into an area of the world where there are already too many, it can often make things much, much worse.  And we'll have to wait and see if the people in charge handle it well enough to avoid the pitfalls of the military solution.

I really want to work in the space industry one day (even sent in my internship applications to SpaceX for the fall, woo!), but right now I spend a lot of my time on classes, trying to find a part time job since I just left my full time one to go to school full time, playing SC2, watching Dr. Who with the girlfriend (JUST started on Season 6, I'm so glad Matt Smith learned how to act angry), and thinking about starting a vegetable garden that will probably never get started...

Right now I typically use Eclipse for everything, which I know can cause more headaches than it's worth on some occasions.  I used RedHat at one of my internships quite extensively, but still did my development on a Windows machine and instead based my project on a network drive that was available to my RedHat machine.  So I haven't truly experienced developing on a Unix system yet.  

My question is how to get started with developing in Unix.  It seems like there is such a steep learning curve and no one ""right"" way to jump in.  I've been looking into Fedora16 because it's similar to RedHat.  Is this a good version to start with?  Can I develop successfully with running it through VirtualBox?  I'd rather not dual-boot because my SSD is only 64GB big, and I'm sure my i5 and 8gigs of RAM can handle the load. 

How do most people code on Unix?  I wasn't a huge fan of vi when I used it at work, but I know some people are crazy for it.  I've been using Sublime Text2 which is pretty nice.  What should I install on my system after I get it up and running?  If somebody could help me get going I would appreciate it!"

We are not going to be getting paid to perform, just having our expenses covered. We will be selling merch, however. 

We will obviously look like a band when we arrive with instruments and gear, so we don't want to just enter as tourists and risk being turned away at the airport. (Which happens now and then to bands trying to get into the US). A few websites I found said that foreigners entering Turkey to participate in artistic events or entertainment (fairs and circuses were mentioned) for less than three months don't need anything other than a standard tourist visa. Then other websites say that you HAVE to have a visa to do anything considered working, even an unpaid internship. The Consulate website seems to primarily deal with Turks trying to enter the US, and the US State Dept site just links to the Turkish Consulate page. Halp??"
shcjt,1357,2012-04-19,[update]A man came up to me and said he was my father (I have a sister),anontw,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/shcjt/updatea_man_came_up_to_me_and_said_he_was_my/,"My question got an amazing amount of replies and I appreciate it, so, not being an ass I decided to give a final update before I go back to my usual account. 

Previous thread http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/senxl/a_man_came_up_to_me_and_said_he_was_my_father_but/

After a lot of thought, I've decided that, all issues aside, I simply have no interest in this man who has my jaw and some shared DNA. I'm a junior at NYU doing a dual major and overload this sem, between that and lining up internships I barely have time to sleep. I have a great family and couldn't ask for better. I was never that kid who wished his parents were anyone else (except maybe batman when I was 9.) I wish I had more time for them than once a week dinner and phonecalls, I don't wish I had some extra father figure and I've got enough friends.

If he were a decent man I might feel like I owe it to him. But considering the fact that his actions resulted in this and if my mom had stayed I would have been raised in an abusive home, likely abused myself, I don't feel bad about this- just relieved.

I also (for those who are worried about any possible truth from fakereal dad) i asked my dad if I could see any of the paperwork on my bio dad, to assuage curiosity. He assuaged my curiosity. The divorce papers were in there, the restraining order, and even pictures of my mom after he shoved her. Yeah, he's an scumbag. 

He was waiting at my usual coffee shop today (will find a new one) and basically was pushy and an ass. He never once admitted any kind of wrong doing or anything. I ended the conversation by saying ""Thank you for contacting me, but I am happy in life right now, if I ever change my mind I will contact you"".

He then got this weird look of outraged dignity and said that I was an ungrateful little bastard and that if were richer than my dad I'd be on my knees. Then he said that without him I wouldn't exist. Said I was his only son and he wished he didn't have one, hell, he wished he didn't have a daughter as she was just as ungrateful. He said a lot more but that's the gist.

I have a dad, it's not this joker. I may look up the sister at some point in the future when I have the time and mind set to explore that. Although, she's probably just a kid.

tl:dr No interest in forming relationship with biodad, due to his past acts (satisfying proof seen) I also don't feel obligated. He stalked me today and confirmed this. Oh, and I have a sister.

Within 6 months I was promoted to an EasyTech expert and got a 50 cent pay raise. I work pretty hard, sell pretty well (even though I admit I'm not the salesman type) and am very knowledgable of the overpriced garbage I sell at the store. Long story short, they LOVE me there, all the employees, and all 3 managers.

I never got a 1 year review/raise like the other employees at the place, probably because the end of the first year is when I started only working temp time like over the summers and winter break because of college. At some point in my time working there they even lowered my pay down 25 cents without informing me, mostly due to being a temp but I never brought it up.

After the first month of summer, I'll be doing a summer internship for a Fortune 100 company making 240% per hour than what I made at Staples. The manager at Staples recently asked me if I'd like to work there again, and is fine with me only being there the first month once learning I got an internship lined up. I'd like to do it because it's extra money I'd like to have, however now I'm pretty insulted by the hourly pay I'd be getting, and I'm unsure if I should just not work there, or ask if I could get at least a 15% raise for the 3 weeks that I would be working there.

I don't want to come off as a greedy douche bag, but being a 'nice guy' as far as my paycheck goes, and being overqualified for what I do, I'm not sure how to properly deal with this."

I also need to do work/study for about 15-20 hours/week, and I'm expected to owe $46,000 in loans including interest after 4 years (though that's assuming I get no scholarships or internships), which will only get worse if I do go to med school. I have more more interest and skill in psychology than I do in engineering (which I am starting to dislike), and would want to become a psychiatrist, ideally. Is it worth the financial risk to change my major to psychology (easier than engineering, but the bachelor's is useless this time) for the sake of my GPA for med school, or should I just stay in engineering and try to like it harder?

When I told my friends about this, they said I was getting ripped off hard and it's illegal for the employer to use an unpaid intern in place of an actual employee and that the work I'm doing is too beneficial for them and not beneficial for me. I am not getting any school credits for this either, I am essentially getting nothing from this.

Should I stick with this? I was only doing it for the work experience, but could I just work on personal projects?"

“I don’t care how good you are at Q-bert, you will never beat my high-score in Frogger”!  Schlotsky yelled as he grabbed another Oreo cookie.  “I saw that”!  Eduardo said as he pointed to the bag of Oreos that had “EDUARDO’S DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT IT” written across the package with a black marker.  “Guys, guys lets all calm down” Sizzler said trying to break up the argument.  “We will settle this once and for all with a game of Pitfall!”


“This was the scenario that took place moments before the scene of one of the bloodiest murders in our nation’s history.  Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, this case has been open since 1987 but today, I want to close it once and for all.  I am going to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that the defendant, Mr. Elmer Butterbur was responsible for the vicious actions that took place at 10:15 pm in that apartment complex on sunnyville drive.”


“We all know that Eric Schlotsky was a master at the game of Frogger and few people could beat Edward Eduardo at Q-bert…these two young men were in a league all their own- a league that Steven Sizzler desperately wanted to be in.  Let me recreate the details of the night in question and paint a picture for you all to see……”


“The year was 1987 and 15 year old Steven Sizzler had just gotten his penis circumcised by a clumsy barber.  Steven was curious about things such as radioactivity, lamp shades, and soup strainers.  He was always volunteering to go on game shows that involved fabulous prizes until one day he got his shot.  The game show was entitled, “Don’t you Dare” and the rules were simple…there were five contestants who were each given an hour to obtain whatever was on their card.  Steven’s card was written, “Three Blind Mice”- he ran out to the closest pet store, bought three mice and gouged their eyes out with his pocketknife and returned in just under one hour.  That was when he first met Eric Scholtsky….who was already waiting at the finish line with a handful of 4 deaf turtles.  Sizzler, being a good sport, shook hands with Schlotsky and congratulated him on winning the game.  The two became friends and Sizzler was eventually invited over to Schlotsky’s house to play Atari.  “This is my friend Eduardo”  Schlotsky said, very proud to introduce the two.  “Hi friend, I am playing Q-bert, wanna play?”  Eduardo said as he munched on some Oreos.  “Do you have the game pitfall?”  Sizzler said when all of a sudden Elmer Butterbur kicked down the door and began blasting everyone in sight!  It was a sad day in the town of gopher that night I can tell you.”


The jury sat upright- they were horrified as they looked at Elmer Butterbur in disgust.  Elmer just put his head down in shame- a sure sign of guilt.  “Objection your honor” Johhny Applebee said as he stood up in protest.  “Sustained” the judge replied…”Mr. Burger King, do you have any evidence other than this ridiculous story, that what you say actually took place?”  Mr. Burger King slyly shook his head yes as if the trap he had set had just caught a big fat gopher and now he was about to have his way with that gopher in any imaginable way he could think of.  He nodded up and down at the judge as he imagined the gopher tied up to a chair with a ball in his mouth and the muffled screams were not going to be heard by anyone….he continued to nod and think of the gopher he just caught and…”Mr. Burger King”!  Are you going to nod at me all day with that ridiculous grin or are you going to show this courtroom some proof?”  Mr. Burger King shook the gopher fantasy from his head and presented the court with a necklace made out of three 6-inch penises marked “Exhibit A”.  “Allow me to call my witness- Edith Fuddruckers!”  Mr. Burger King yelled to a gasping jury.  Edith Fuddruckers made her way up to the witness stand but refused to put her hand on the bible.  She was a notorious cloud worshipper who would never have given the Christians the satisfaction of breaking her like that.  


Ms. Fuddruckers, what were you doing on the night in question at the time in question during the event in question?”  Edith Fuddruckers was no Christian but a devout cloud worshipper with exceptionally high morals and ethics.  She could not tell a lie….”I was masturbating” she said to another gasp from the jury.  “That is all!”  Mr. Burger King said as he looked at a speechless Johnny Applebee….”your witness” he said with a look that said “bring it”.  
Johnny Applebee regained his composure and said, “Mrs. Fuddruckers”….”It’s Ms. Fuddruckers”,  Edith interuppted as she hungrily looked the handsome lawyer up and down.  “Ms. Fuddruckers, has it ever occurred to you that you do not need to masturbate?”  “Surely a woman with your sex appeal could have any man she wants.”  The jury leaned forward….Ms. Fuddruckers was indeed a sexy woman- why would she masturbate?  “OBJECTION!” Mr. Burger King screamed at the top of his lungs with his voice cracking a bit.  “Your honor, the sexual orientation of my witness is not on trial here, it is the fact that three young men are dead and missing their penises!”  


The judge said “sustained” and called for a recess.  The judge really enjoyed recess and had ever since he was a young boy at Stone Hall Pre-Prep.  The teachers would call recess and little Stevie Olive Garden would run outside as fast as he could.  He always envied the teachers and their power to call recess whenever they felt like it.  He made a commitment to himself that he would become a teacher and studied his ass off to get there.  The real world is cruel however, and little Steven Olive Garden did not have the brains to be a teacher.  He was forced to find work as a judge and hated every minute of it until he learned that they too could call “recess” whenever they felt like it.  


Judge Olive Garden ran past everyone to the outside and was the first to get on the swing set.  He laughed and played while the court waited for him to return.  After about 15 minutes he came back in, sweating and smelling of body odor.  He sat back down and said, “Please continue with the closing arguments”.


Johnny Appleby was first.  “Judge, Jury, countrymen….I am not a vegetarian but I do eat vegetables.  Mr. Butterbur is not a criminal but he has committed crimes.  I think that we as a nation at war should be more concerned about what is going on in the world rather than what is going on in this courtroom.  I ask you, no I beg you not to convict this man….do it for me- please.”  Johnny Applebee said with a sincere expression as he sat down.  The jury had just been given a masterful performance by a master.  They were literally eating from Johnny’s hand and would have done anything for him at that moment…but it was a fleeting moment and soon Harold Burger King, the young hotshot lawyer fresh out of his internship approached them.

  
“Steel Magnolias” was a great movie.  “Cagney and Lacey” was a great TV. show.  “Highway to the Danger Zone” was a great song, and Johnny Applebee is a great actor.”  We all want to believe that the world is a great place and guys like Elmer Butterbur do not shoot teenage boys and make a penis necklace out of their private parts.  Hell, I don’t want to live in a world like that either…but guess what folks- we DO live in a world like that.  We live in a world where 6 out of every 10 8th grade boys lose their penis so some sick fuck can make a necklace out of it.  


Now I was on the drama team in high school and I got my degree in dance therapy but are you going to let me sing and dance my way into telling you how you should think on this one?  Or will you stand up and say “I am a free thinker and I know that Mr. Butterbur killed those boys!”?  C’mon, be a free thinker and say that for me, will ya?  Huh?


Judge Olive Garden sat back in his chair and looked out the window at the seesaw…he thought about calling for recess but instead asked the bailiff to escort an escort to his private chambers.  “The jury is dismissed to come to a conclusion on this case” the judge said as he walked past them.  

4 hours later

“Has the jury come to a conclusion” Judge Olive Garden asked.
“Yes your honor we have” a jury member said, on the count of embezzlement we find the defendant not guilty.  On the count of racketeering we find the defendant not guilty”…with every utterance of the word “not guilty” the fist of Mr. Burger King got tighter and the smile of Mr. Butterbur got bigger…until the big one- “On the count of obscene bodily ornamentation we find the defendant……NOT GUILTY!
Suddenly there was pandemonium in the courtroom!  Elmer Butterbur jumped up and down and gave his lawyer a hug.  He then grabbed his penis necklace from the exhibit table and smuggly put it on right in front of Mr. Burger King before walking out the door, a free man.  Johnny Applebee extended his hand and said “you can’t win them all” but no handshake was returned.  Mr. Burger King just stood up and glared at the audience before storming out.  He walked outside past judge Olive Garden who was swinging from the monkey bars….he got in his car and he drove home to his apartment, fired up his Atari 64 and scratched at his missing penis….yes Mr. Burger King was one of those unlucky 6 out of 10  8th grade boys he so passionately defended.


Just then Garrett Goulett woke up from his sleep….”what’s the matter honey?”  His wife said, “Did you have a bad dream?” “I don’t remember sweetie, but I sure feel like eating out!”  The play on words had been made.

I'm more interested in the theoretical aspect and the mathematical logic aspect of computer science; the problem solving, the puzzles, and the computational thinking.

I'll be getting back from the internship in about two weeks. I'll get to see her maybe once before she leaves for the summer, starting her own internship. 

I really like this girl and through our time apart I've realized how much I want her in my life. We agreed that nothing of the relationship magnitude should start until we both return to school. My question is, how do I convey this message to her without looking too clingy? We're both pretty independent people and I know that this sort of thing scares her just as much as me.

My boyfriend, although incredibly smart, recently dropped out, he wasn't really sure what he wanted to study, he knows he wants to be a dad but obviously there isn't a program for that, and didn't want to waste money year after year not doing anything in college. 

In the last few months, any time I've ever done anything wrong, he'll immediately laugh at me and call me dumb, an idiot, and make me feel bad for simple mistakes. This maybe wouldn't be a big deal, if he didn't make me feel absolutely awful about whatever I do. Or he'll make me feel inferior because he's smarter than me. One day, he said, as a joke, that I'd never do as well in my field as a guy would (the glass ceiling affect) because I'm a woman. I've asked him a hundred times to quit saying that, accidents happen, and he doesn't have to laugh and make me feel bad. 

Our fights go like this: He'll ask what's wrong, I'll eventually tell him, and he'll go quiet, stop talking to me for the rest of the night, and then go back to normal the next day acting like nothing happened. Nothing get's resolved, and any time he's ever promised to quit doing something, everything goes back to the way it was in a few days. 

Last night, he kept calling me stupid or retarded for little things, and I finally had enough, when he asked me what was wrong, I told him, what he says hurts my feelings, and I really want him to stop. He kept saying how what he says was a joke, and to lighten up. I told him I didn't find it funny, and that if a comedian said something and the audience didn't laugh, he would cut it out. He said a comedian wouldn't do that, because he would stay true to himself. I said, fine, stay to true to yourself. And he said fine, he will. 

Last night after this he wouldn't even look at me when I tried to talk to him, and when I tried to kiss him good night, he said he was too busy watching the game. 

I'm supposed to move away this summer, and he's supposed to come with me. And maybe this shouldn't be a big deal, but it's bothered me for months the way he makes me feel. I love him, but I also really hate what he says to me. He always complains that I'm grumpy, or he'll call me a psycho when I get upset with him, and I don't want to feel that way, it wasn't like this when we first started dating, and I don't feel like it should be that way now.

Should I lighten up like he says, or what actions should I take?

TL;DR : Boyfriend makes me feel stupid, when I'm not, tired of being sad about it"

I'm going through one of those difficult periods of time where although things are going well enough I feel conflicted. I suppose it's difficult for me to articulate. It's a few simple things. I'm a fairly submissive person in the sense that I actively dislike conflict and would prefer to the cheery pillar of emotional support. The only problem is that at the moment though things are going well for me, there is a lot of turmoil in the worlds of the people around me. 

One specific case. I was recently hired as an intern at an establishment that I adore, something I've wanted so badly and was elated to get, but at the moment the establishment is going through a huge change over in staff. I'm fairly new, maybe six months into everything, and I was already incredibly attached to the people that were let go. The staff I work under have known these people for years (some of them upwards of 20). This isn't the kind of place where this sort of thing happens and the people that were let go were done so mainly for political reasons by the board of directors (who are not onsite often), and were major cornerstones and mentors for everyone at the facility. 

It's a small close-knit group so it's hitting everyone very hard around me, and there are chances of more people being let go. Often I come in to people crying and all I can do is offer them hugs and support, and feel so detached from reality, because while wonderful things are happening for me with all of this changeover, everyone else it suffering. I guess I'm just really not sure how to process it. This place was my haven, and my healing place. Right now there is just such a heavy, off feeling that we're all trying our best to work through. I'm finding it so hard to feel good about myself right now. I feel like I need to be able to go in, and be happy and productive for all of the people I care about that have been hit so hard by this, but I'm not sure how to reconcile my own feelings."

Help.,dyszka4u,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/sjesa/had_my_first_interview_yesterday_turns_out_i_suck/,"So I had my first interview yesterday (well, first serious one, not the very first technically). It was for an internship in a Finance department at FMCG corporation in Poland.

It wasn't horrible and I'm yet to receive the decision; but I expect a no, and I don't think that I made an impression of a hireable person.

To my surprise, interview wasn't with HR specialist - the interviewer was a quite nice guy working in the mentioned Finance department. It lasted about 40 mins. Questions - mostly about facts from my resume, some casual finance talk, and some, but not too many, standard questions as my biggest success etc.

Now, what's the point - I prepared myself to some of the questions. But you can never predict all of them. As for my 'spontanous' answers - I know they weren't perfect. My problem is that I'm afraid **my interview put my competence in a worse light than it actually is**. I think the main cause was stress (even though most of it disappeared as soon as the interviewer entered the room). Once I heard a question that surprised me, my mind went a little chaotic for a while. **If I were given some time to think, my answers would be different than those that I'd given**. But I think it's awkward and unacceptable to sit 20+ secunds in silence just to come up with a proper answer...

Now, I'm far from panic; I know it was my first interview and it's not the end of the world. But I am a bit concerned - my (future) professional field requires good interview skills. And I'm quite sure that my competence is above average for a student my age (3rd year). I just couldn't sell it.  


**So... Is there a way to learn to control yourself better at interviews and give more thoughtful answers?** Any advice appreciated.

Thank you to all of you who read the whole thing, and just in case - sorry for my English.

sj88i,11,2012-04-20,Graduation... What's next?,Vycid,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/sj88i/graduation_whats_next/,"Hi /r/AskEngineers,

This is almost more of a life planning question, but I figure this is as good a place as any.

I'm graduating in about seven weeks with a BS in Materials Engineering. My grades are good (around 3.5), the school is fairly well-known, and I had an internship with a major semiconductor capital equipment company over the past summer. I had a pretty good time and decided I'd be happy to go back.

My emphasis over my Junior and Senior years has been overwhelmingly semiconductor materials: processing (litho/etch/dep), MEMS, packaging... I had anticipated I'd be headed for the the semiconductor industry when I eventually got out of (grad) school.

Due to a variety of factors (including personal interest and the advisement of my co-workers), I chose to apply directly to a handful of PhD programs. In so doing, I declined the guaranteed admit to the MS program at my own college. A director at the company where I did my internship implied that if the search for grad schools didn't work out for me, I'd be welcome to come back and work there.

I didn't get in anywhere, but the schools took *forever* to get back to me (about 4 months). So, shit, I think, I'd better try to get that implicit job offer on paper, because I'm graduating with a BS, and I need to have somewhere to go for a year or two while I figure stuff out.

By this point, the company I worked at is in the middle of a merger with another major semiconductor capital equipment company. They're in the middle of ""eliminating redundancies"" - translating to ""we're firing people now, so there's no job for you"".

So, now I'm graduating from school with just a BS in an engineering field most people don't recognize, searching frantically for a job in an industry that usually demands advanced degrees, with a long-term goal of actually getting one.

Any advice? Anyone been in a similar spot before?

Thanks."
sj705,1,2012-04-20,"For the last 10 years, I've hid my desire to become a graphic novelist, and I’m afraid it’s taken a severe toll on my mental health. The question is, how do I start??",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/sj705/for_the_last_10_years_ive_hid_my_desire_to_become/,"Hello Reddit!
I am in need of some serious help. I'm not the best at forming questions, so I guess I'll just lay it all there. I am very sorry for the ridiculous length of this post.
When I was about 10 years old, I was wandering around in the library, when suddenly I came across a badly beaten up copy of Jeff Smith's [Bone](http://tinyurl.com/6uct346). I was instantly engrossed in his method of visual storytelling. That was my first encounter with graphic noveling.

Years later, I learned about anime and manga and was completely blown away by the amount of detail in the drawing and the wide range of genres that were available (as opposed to just being for kids like most cartoons/comics at the time were geared towards). It was around that time that I somehow got the notion that I wanted to be an animator/manga artist. However, I remember feeling deathly embarrassed about my love of comics/manga. There were a few moments during class, where I would be doodling some sort of character and one of my friends would catch a glance and flash me a ""oh no, you're not one of *them*, are you?"" look. I can still vividly remember the extreme feeling of shame I had.

Towards the end of High School, when it came time to take SATs and apply to colleges, I blocked out any options of going to art school. I applied to local state college as a potential business major. I was running full speed away from any silly ideas of being a comic book artist. Fast forward past graduation and a few internships at various companies (some sales, some marketing) and I started to notice that I was starting to burn out. I quit my job, and moved back home to take a bit of a hiatus.

Then, one day while living at home with my parent's, I had an overwhelming feeling to kill myself. I had bad days before where I all I wanted to do was disappear, but this time was *much* different. I lost all will to get out of bed, to eat, and I didn't want to talk to anyone. I contemplated which means of killing myself would be the best (easiest seemed jumping of the nearby bridge), but luckily my parents had caught on that not was all well with me and ended up taking me to the ER, where I was then admitted to the Psych Ward. Despite the stigma that Psychiatric Wards have, I found it to be wonderfully helpful and a great place for me to get help. I started taking medication, got into counseling, and started working towards rebuilding my self-esteem.

This happened about two years ago. Up until recently, I was doing well, working at a new and interesting doing sales with a small boutique store. However, I was finding that I was still unsatisfied with my direction in life. Every now and then I thought back to my earlier dreams of being a comic book artist, and I would feel a deep yearning to try my hand at it. I started gathering ideas and sketching and drawing more. I even started writing out a story, and then life kind of got in the way (busy at work, dating, family drama, etc). Weeks and weeks went by, and I hadn’t been able to get anything out on paper, and I started to feel hopeless that I would never be able to do what I really wanted to do. I imagined myself, 40 years in the future, still having not written anything of substance and feeling weighed down with the regret of lost opportunities. I started having trouble focusing at work again, and I was starting to have panic attacks. I started having the overwhelming urge to end my life or hurt myself. My sister called me while this was happening and when she realized that I was relapsing she drove over and forced me to go back to the hospital. 

This was two weeks ago. I got the treatment I needed, but now I’m worried about what the consequences of putting off my dream are. I used to write it off with thoughts like, “I’ll get around to it tomorrow”, but that image of me as an old woman having not accomplished what I wanted now haunts me constantly. 

Having given a very long-winded explanation, my question is: How do I start? Do I need to join a graphic novelist’s group? Do I work under someone as an apprentice or find myself a mentor?

I’m so confused about how one becomes a graphic novelist, that if anyone is able to read this long post and offer ANY suggestions, I would be very grateful.

For an idea of what my style looks like [here’s my deviant art page](http://nicigrigg.deviantart.com/).

EDIT: Perhaps I'm also very curious if anyone knows someone who has written/drawn a graphic novel, regardless whether it was successful or not?"

That said, my beef with season 9 is that medical school is Nothing like what they show on scrubs, and I say this as a current med student.  They tried to change the formula by switching over to medical school rather than focusing on interns, and that really ruined it for me.  What was wrong with the interns back in season 8?  They were much more likeable than the students in season 9.  Now I know no TV show about high school or college is accurate, but isn't that why Scrubs was so awesome?

siu1r,1,2012-04-19,Moving minimalist,[deleted],minimalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/minimalism/comments/siu1r/moving_minimalist/,"I'm planning a cross-country move (Portland to Boston) in July, and I would love to get some advice on making the whole process as simple as possible. Here's the story: I'm a 21 y.o. student in Portland. This summer, I'll be starting a six month internship in Waltham, MA. I don't have a car, and I don't have a lot of money or stuff right now. I'll be coming back to Portland in January to finish school, so there's the possibility of storing a bunch of my stuff here until I come back. I also hope to sell a lot of the things I don't need or want anymore.

So the question is, what's the best way to figure out what I need, what I want, and what I don't? And then what's the best way to get this stuff to Massachusetts from here? Like I said, I don't have a huge amount of stuff, but I'm not a ""minimalist"" at this point by any means. I'm learning a lot from checking out posts on this subreddit. Now, I think it would help to hear some words of wisdom from someone with experience in minimalist moving. Anybody care to chip in? I'd really appreciate it!

Here's a close-to-exhaustive list of my shit, with a few notes on my plans for it:

- 2 guitars (1 possibly to sell)
- 1 guitar amp (sell)
- stereo/speaker system (probably sell)
- keyboard
- laptop, phone, tablet, monitor (too many glowing rectangles... but it is my line of work, so...)
- 5 pairs of pants, about 20-30 shirts, 3 pairs of shoes, bunch of socks, 2 sets of bedding, 2 towels
- toiletries
- 2 pairs of glasses
- a few dishes (give away)
- a few pieces of furniture in my room (to be given away/sold)
- bike (give away/sell)
- helmet, bike lights, tubes, other bike stuff
- about 40-50 books (store most of 'em)
- about 15 personal notebooks (store)

So what do you guys think? My current plan is to ship all the stuff I need to as cheap as possible, and fly myself and my guitars out there. Pretty sweet plan? Or is there a better way? How can I make this experience a little easier by getting more minimal?"

slxfp,4,2012-04-21,"""I want you to want to___."" --- Is this a common thought, is it the distance making me crazy, or what?",mdmazinglife,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/slxfp/i_want_you_to_want_to_is_this_a_common_thought_is/,"Disclaimer: A bit of a story/rant that leads up to the final question:

Ok, quick run-down: SO (M24) and I (23F) have been friends for 2 years (met on vacation visiting mutual friends), started dating this past November (LDR from the start), week-long visits in Dec/Feb/Mar with me moving to intern in his city in May-Aug, final end date for the long-distance is Dec 2012 when I graduate. He's graduated college and works full-time now, while I am finishing up my last couple semesters.

Now, this past week was a doozey for me with school and work. Group projects going wrong, next to no sleep...that sort of thing. I couldn't get over this feeling that I hadn't talked to my SO much, actually barely, all week. We usually gchat most of the work day, but I'd barely heard a peep from him. Like, not a ""hey just checking in to see how you're doing"" or anything. Which got me thinking: I'm usually the one to initiate contact. Not just this week, but usually all the time, and I feel bad about it, like I may be interrupting some part of his day when I do. I mean, if I'm not in class (total of maybe 3 hours a day), I'm just working on things. But he has friends over all the time, or places to go, or things to do (situations where he's not going to idling sit and chit chat with me).

So with me calling/txting as the initiator, or being the one that's ""hey, what's up, talk to me"" or ""call me"" or ""poke poke poke"" ... I don't know...I feel like I'm pestering him...or that I'm thinking about him more than he's thinking about me. 

I communicated to him on Friday this is how I'm feeling. I'd gotten a bit irked at the fact that when I initially told him ""hey, let's just talk when you get home, I'm feeling kind of disconnected"" he began telling me about his weekend coming up and all the plans he had. I don't think he meant for it to reinforce my feeling of disconnectedness, as when I said ""Ok, yeah you're gonna be busy. I'll just talk to you later"" he was frustrated with a ""Stop, I'm trying to tell you about my weekend and talk to you now."" Idk...just a poor subject choice.

He said that he usually just waits for me to call him/chat, because he knows that I will eventually whenever it is that I have time. To be more convenient for me? But I'm not the one with so much social time that I'm not readily available. :: shrug :: So we talk for a bit, I start feeling better, all is good until he asks me:

""Oh, hey I just got a text. I'm supposed to play tennis with so-and-so soon, we made plans like 4 hours ago. Is that okay, or should I just tell them no? I mean, we see each other all the time, so if you want me to cancel, I will.""

I respond with a ""Well, it's fine. Do what you want."" And he responds to his friend and the plans are still a go. -___-

I never want to be *that* girlfriend that is like ""cancel your plans, always hang out with me, no you can't do this, yes do that, ect"" I try to be thoughtful and respectful of these relationships that existed way before I did. If he wanted to cancel to talk to me and make me feel better, he would have. The fact that he asked meant that he thought he should, but didn't in fact want to, right? I don't want to be restrictive like that, you know?

I just want him to *want* to cancel his plans to talk to me. I want him to want to call me even if he thinks I might be busy, just because he wants to talk to me.

**So is this idea of ""I want you to want to ______."" a common type of thought? Or is the stress of school, work, and long-distance finally making me crack and be all needy? Either way, is it stupid?**

tl;dr: I want you to want to _____. Stupid feeling?

I just interviewed at a company that I'd like to work at.  They're small, so I would be doing a variety of things.  I had some minor concerns about working there but the one issue that concerns me is that the company is looking to be bought out in the next few years.  

If the company is bought out, of course my job there would be in jeopardy depending on the company doing the buying.  So I could find myself looking for work ~1 year after I start my first job after college.  

My questions to /r/engineering is such...

Even with a ""good"" reason for not being employed at the same place 1 year after school, how much would this effect any kind of hiring decision/resume sorting process.  In other words, could this hurt me, and if so, how badly.

Second is, while I've had experience in the workplace before, I've never worked for a company that's been bought out.  Is it generally accepted that the staff is replaced, or that the staff is kept, or is there really no way to tell?  Basically, I'm looking to evaluate the likelihood of risk.

I thought things were going fine until last Monday when she told me about this guy she works with( once a week, 4 hours a week, for 16 weeks). She told me that she likes him. She told me this is because she would never lie to me. Then said she does not plan on leaving me for him and she just needs time to get over things.

Fast foreword to Friday, she tells me that she needs a break. She said she doesn't want to hurt me, but she in confused and needs to be alone. She is my best friend, and I love her to death. I can not lose her, but I want her to be happy. So it sounds like we are taking a break until she feels better.

Has anyone ever taken a break in a relationship that has not ended poorly?

Edit 1: Thanks for all the advice, and I did hear pretty much any stance that I thought I could take, so I am going to talk to her about 'terms and conditions' of the break. I will tell her that we are not to see anyone else, and if that happens then everything is immediately over between us. After a while I will want to talk to her about how she feels. A big thing that I guess I did not mention is she is done working there is a week -The dorm where she works is closed for the summer- So she may never see him again. I am also leaving her in a week because I have an internship while she is taking classes, but I am pretty sure after a week without me she will want me back. Last summer she wanted to talk everyday because she missed me. If she doesn't choose me then I can find someone else. Thanks all.

Anyone who studies in Quebec knows you need to pass a very difficult French test, before getting your college diploma. Not only this is preventing me from graduating, I've barely passed my programming classes. Potential employers bombard me with questions I cannot answer and promptly dismiss me as a potential intern. I have asked for help from the college and teachers to look for potential employers but nothing is turning out.

I had returned to school go get my life on track 3 years ago, and It seems to be going nowhere. I have no clue as to how I am supposed to advance. The shit has hit the proverbial fan.

No money in account. Going to be thrown out soon, Need to find a good job in the Montreal area with an understanding employer. This is proving impossible.

I got serious about losing some weight in May of 2011 and probably hit my lowest weight in November so this took about 7 months overall. This is a lifelong process though, and I've got a long way to go!


Thanks for reading!

***Updates***

**Diet &amp; Exercise** 
I cut back on calories pretty quick in the beginning by simply cutting out any snacking and switching to water as my only drink. I did, however, still eat whatever my dad decided to make me for dinner. I never counted calories during the summer and generally had little idea of what I was doing. If I had to estimate now I'd say that I was probably consuming around 2000-2500 calories a day, but exercising quite frequently. **I know this is totally against what fittit is all about, but I did not know of fittit at this point and did not lift heavy weights during any period of my weight loss. I would not recommend this to others, but it is certainly possible to lose weight with diet and cardio alone. What's important is that this will ONLY be good for weight loss, and not so good for aesthetics and what not.** My starting exercise was biking as I probably couldn't even run a mile straight at this point. I would get on my bike with some music and ride for around an hour sometimes. I found a pretty long, flattish road and simply rode back and forth on it. I figured from google maps that I was averaging 10 miles a day biking on this thing.


I eventually got an internship that summer which was essentially a full time job (9-5, 5 days a week). This made not snacking much easier and I was essentially forced into a 3 meal day. For these 2 months or so I'd say my calories dropped a bit to 1700-2000. By the end of summer people had taken notice that I was getting pretty small. Lots of concern and what I saw as bitterness came from friends at this point. It bothered me then, but at this point I can guess they were just worried about me. Exercise at this point tapered off a bit, volume wise, but I believe I started running more at this point. I was comfortable enough with my cardio level to run around my neighborhood which was about a mile loop. I would do this at night when I got home from work. I also played basketball pretty frequently, after work when I could and on the weekends other wise. 


I got back to school for fall semester and was suddenly ""the skinny health obsessed freak"" according to all of my friends. This was a pretty harmful to my eating as I felt that if I did anything but eat extremely clean I'd be seen as regressing. I took a strong liking to the salad bar (I still love salad and eat it for at least one of my meals per day) and generally ate less. Snacking was still a no-no and after I had a pretty set diet of dining hall food going I spent a week counting my calories. I rarely came in at over 1300 calories per day. I also upped my exercise quite a bit. I found a nice loop from my dorm through a small off campus community which totaled a little more than 5k distance wise. I ran this once a day for the few months that it was warm at my upstate new york school. I also had my bike at school and would bike to a field about a mile and a half away where I would do a core workout for half an hour or so. It consisted of cherry pickers, leg raises, planks, sit ups, push ups, and whatever else I felt like doing. This was also when I first found /r/fitness and I remember I made some pretty silly posts that really illustrated how little I knew about what I was doing. One time I asked how I was supposed to be at a deficit when I was eating 1000 calories but only burning about 600 from my 5k + bike ride (I didn't even take BMR into account). 


Eventually it got too cold out to run or bike anymore and my only exercise came from core workouts that I would do every day before I showered. Because I knew I wouldn't be burning as many calories anymore, I made sure to keep my calories pretty low. Thanks to reddit I knew about BMR by this point and so I didn't cut back on intake any more than I already had. It was at about this point that I first saw my abs and it felt amazing. **This whole semester was actually probably the best I have ever felt, energy/attitude wise, even though I was cutting back on calories so much.**


Winter break came next and this is probably where I got the least healthy. I was already consuming a small amount of food but I decided to give lean gains a go just for fun. I didn't follow the macro cycling and generally just avoided carbs while keeping protein and veggies coming in. For me it was basically just a 16/8 (at least) fast which helped with calorie restriction. I didn't have a job (the summer internship was well paid) at this point and could basically do whatever I wanted so I had a system going where I would wake up around 12 pm eat some breakfast/lunch, eat dinner at around 6 pm and then stay up without eating until 3-4 am. This was easy for me and although I was hungry at night sometimes, I had grown to enjoy the feeling and knew I would be able to eat as soon I woke up. I also experimented with 24 hour fasts to off-set big calorie intakes like christmas dinner and eating out with friends and such. 


During winter break I also began to lift some weights. All I had was a bench and a very small amount of weights for it, plus some 8 pound dumb bells. I had a system going where on one day I would work on my upper body with high rep (20) sets of bench, incline bench, shrugs and rows. The next day I would do lower body with some squats, lunges, step-ups, and calf-raises with the same rep range. I was doing all of these with only around 70 lbs of resistance so I'm fairly confident I wasn't doing much, but it was something to do and I spent basically all day doing random sets of this stuff. I also continued with my now well rehearsed ab workout every day and did some stupidly high volume bicep/wrist curls with the 8 lb dumbbells on upper body days. I was also experimenting with tougher body weight stuff like planches, hand stand pushups, and dragon flags. I was down around 160 lbs during winter break. 


I went back to school for spring semester (this semester) and they had opened a newly renovated gym on campus. I quickly grabbed a membership and started with a split of upper-body days and lower body days similar to what I was doing at home. I was into fitocracy at this point and would get a little too concerned with the point totals I was getting compared to actually making a good routine. On upper body days I would do db bench, db incline bench, lat pulldowns, tri extensions, db rows, cambered rows, chest flies, OHP, shrugs, basically any back/arm/chest workout I could figure out that didn't involve barbells (I was an idiot). On leg days I did leg presses, leg extensions, leg curls, calf raises, and lunges. I also did core stuff like HLRs, weighted decline sit ups, and weighted hyperextensions on both of these days. I would go for 6 days a week generally. I also still ate about the same I had been eating but perhaps a little more. I'd guess I was at about 1600 calories a day at this point. I also began taking protein powder but very inconsistently and with water. I neglected cardio pretty much completely. I took a week off before the triathlon to prepare a little bit.


**My Current Routine/Diet**

A: (Legs/Shoulders)

* Squats

* Barbell OHP

* Shrugs

* Calf Raises

* Random ab stuff (HLRs, weighted declines)


B: (Chest/Tris)

* Barbell Bench Press

* Incline Barbell Bench Press

* Cable Flys 

* Tricep extensions

* Skull crushers

* Pushups 

* Random ab stuff

C: (Back/Bi)

* Deadlift

* Barbell Rows

* DB Rows

* Curls

* Chins

* Random Ab Stuff


I try to keep reps per set as close to 10 as I can but have to lower that sometimes as my weights go higher on the compounds. I basically start with a small amount of weight and slowly work my way up to my near maxes while keeping my reps as high as possible. I've never actually tested my maxes. **I realize this is not what fittit proscribes but I've found this workout schedule to work for me and it keeps me happy.**

I still struggle with my diet but have been eating about maintenance lately and am eating a good amount of protein. I've never really counted macros hardcore, and will need to get into this soon. 

**Lift Numbers**

* Bench - I work up to 135 for 3x5

* Squat - I work up to 185 for 3x8

* Deadlifts - I work up to 225 for 3x10 (Will be adding more weight next workout)


**Goals** 
I've been saying for a while that I want to bulk and put on some muscle but at this point I think I'd rather just stay on the skinny side for the summer and start to bulk during the fall semester of next year. I will be eating enough for maintenance though, at least, and keeping my protein levels high. I'll also continue lifting and trying to increase my working weights. 

***TLDR***

**What Worked**

* Cut carbs. This was the easiest way to cut calories for me. I honestly had no problem eating very little amounts of calories when I cut back on carbs. I basically had a bowl of cereal each day and got the rest of my carbs from fruits and vegetables. Whether or not this is healthy I do not know, but if your goal is weight loss, this works. Remember though, as long as you are consuming less calories than you burn, you will lose weight. If you want to do this without cutting carbs, go for it.

* Find something you enjoy and do it. I love /r/fitness and spend loads of time on here but if you ask what exercise you should be doing you're basically going to be spammed with SS. The most important thing is to find a routine that you enjoy and that you'll keep doing. Progress will come with persistence. 

* Leangains is cool. This made it pretty trivial to run a calorie deficit. I'm not sure whether all of the science behind it is legit or not but the fact is if you're only giving yourself an 8 hour window for eating, it's easier to consume less. I don't understand why people would ever use this for bulking, though.

**Suggestions (Learn from my mistakes)** 

* Keep your calories respectable and your protein intake high. It hurts me now to think of all the muscle I must have been shedding by running a high deficit for so long without knowing much about macros. Try to keep your protein at 1g/lb of body weight while running your deficit. 

* Lift weights while losing weight. Cardio is fun and if you enjoy it then you should absolutely do it but lifting while you're cutting will help you look that much better when you shed that fat away. I may be skinny but I'm fairly scrawny these days. I'm happy with how I look but there was certainly a better way to do this than simply run at a huge deficit. 



This was a lot to write and remember. I'm sure I've forgotten some stuff but hopefully I'll touch on everything while I'm answering your questions. I'll be answering anything you guys want to know but it may take me some time, as I have a busy school schedule currently.


Thanks again for reading!

sldrv,4,2012-04-21,Advice on an upcoming interview,hikasora,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/sldrv/advice_on_an_upcoming_interview/,"I'm interviewing for an investment bank that I have interned for for three previous summers now. I applied again this year but was rejected in the department that I originally worked with those other 3 summers. Because over the years I've become really close with the HR person who has hosted the summer internship program, she has kept trying to find me positions within the company leading to a interview last month where again I wasn't the right fit. So she has continued to look for a place for me and found another opportunity for an interview for me. Since I still have not found a job for this summer, I will gladly take any help I can get but this is another interview with 3 people back to back which makes me really nervous and since I'm already feeling down about being rejected so much and am not interested in the position, I'm not sure what to do. I feel as though it will be another interview ending in me not being the right fit because of my lack of experience.

The job description is:
&gt;Research Assistant
 
&gt;Research Assistant to support 3 senior sell-side fixed income analysts.  Responsibilities will include special projects (setting up portfolios, spreading financials, industry data, macro data) as well as maintenance of existing spreadsheets and presentations.   Sectors covered include energy, oil &amp; gas, utilities, metals &amp; mining, industrials, financials and well as general European corporates. 
 
&gt;Minimum junior undergraduate level majoring in finance with an excellent understanding of financial statement analysis.  Need not be a “quant” but should have excellent spreadsheet modeling skills.  Should have a good understanding of (and interest in) the global financial markets.  Some knowledge of Bloomberg preferred.

I have worked for this international investment bank since I was 16 but it was mainly designing an internal social network and redesigning departmental websites on the intranet since I was still in high school and just learning about investment banking. Only one summer was I put to work on financial statements to create internal ratings. I'm an Applied Math major with interest in web designing mainly. Because the interview is already scheduled and because any experience over the summer is great in my opinion, I plan to go but I am not sure how to present myself for this position at all. Being humble about my background hasn't worked thus far so how should I present myself to get the job without letting them find out I really don't have much knowledge of global financial markets? (My HR friend has also let me know that he said he doesn't need someone with so much experience)

TL;DR: How do I interview for a summer internship I don't have background in and show them that I am the right choice after constantly being told I am never the right fit? Am I also limiting myself by trying again for a company that is alll over my resume in a sector I'm not interested in?"

I'm new here and stumbled this way because I have recently become more serious about achieving financial independence in the future. I've worked hard up to this point to put myself in a secure situation and have received a largish financial settlement in the past. I was hoping I could describe my circumstances and perhaps get some suggestions about future financial moves or advice.

* I'm 23, living in China until August, then living in Germany for 10 months. Both of these things are completely paid for, and funded (internship and research grant respectively), and I am being paid well enough to live my ideal lifestyle at this point.

* When I get back to the US in Fall 2013 I will attend a graduate program to earn my PhD in Chemistry. The program is fully funded with generous stipend and scholarship for 5 years (at least). The program is easily top 5 for my field, and I should have decent if not better job prospects coming out of school (but you can't really predict stuff like that).

* About 4 years ago I won a legal settlement that entitled me to just about $100k. About $55k is liquid in a high-yield savings account right now, and the rest is in an investment for another 4 years. I had the 55k in a CD, but I couldn't make any moves with it after term before I left for China this year.

* I have about 3k in what I consider my usable savings, which I dip into if I really need to one month. This money comes from the return on the investment of about 45k. I don't save much if any of my income now, nor do I plan to when I'm in Germany for that year.

* My goals are financial independence and a secure lifestyle. I have a great start do to some circumstances and some hard work on my part. After some time working, I would like to be able to work for fun, instead of doing it for money. 

So I guess what I am looking for is some advice about what to do with my 55k, and later with the other 45k. The money I'll be earning from my grant and grad school isnt really enough to establish a savings, but my settlement makes me think I'll be secure until I can get a much better paying position.

Also, I would love any suggestions about things that I just seem to be missing altogether. I'm new here, so I'm not entirely familiar with how things go, but I wanted to provide as much information as possible.

Finally, Thanks!"

I know I love doing finance work, but I am not sure what kind of finance job I want to get. I don't think I want to work on Wall Street, but I am pretty open otherwise. Later in life I think I to do real estate investment/venture capitalism. Other jobs I wouldn't mind having are either financial advising/management or something in retail/commercial banking. Needless to say, I am open minded and don't know what I want to do.

As it stands, I will only have 1 summer to intern which would be next (sophomore) summer. I am currently working on getting a military commission which would take up the summer of my junior year. 

Given my circumstances, do you have any advice on what type of internship to go for or what I should do? It would be greatly appreciated. "

Age: both 24

I am in grad school in an Asian country. My girlfriend (who is in the same grad program) is from this country and has lived here most of her life, but did her undergrad degree in the US. We have been dating for about six months and have a fantastic relationship.


Anyway, here's the situation. She is thinking about going abroad for a month or so this summer for school. There are two options for this, one is a country relatively close to here that I could easily visit during summer. The other is all the way on the other side of the world. If she does this, she will take next semester off to do an internship in her home country. This would mean that I would graduate a semester before her and possibly might have to leave the country if I can't find employment here.


My opinion is this: she has lived in the US (and in the place where she might be studying there), so that's not a valid reason to go. It's super far away and I can't visit her. I don't want us to graduate at different times. I don't like long distance relationships. There is no real benefit for her to do this program other than being able to travel and live away from her home country.


Her view is simply that she wants to enjoy her summer and take one last opportunity to travel before getting a job. I don't really understand this.


I just don't want her to leave me behind and go to the other side of the world. If I were in her position, I wouldn't even consider doing such a thing. I just don't know if I'm being too sensitive and selfish about this. I want to support her in whatever she does, but I just can't get over this. I get a sick feeling in my stomach whenever she talks about it.


Can anyone tell me whether I'm being a selfish asshole or is it okay to feel like this? I'm going crazy.

Parents cause much of my anger, depression, and anxiety.  I finally realize they themselves are very dysfunctional and depressed people.  But I enjoy the easy lifestyle of living with my parents (or at my college apartment paid for by my parents) who are in top 5% of all income earners in the US.  I *feel* like I need to cut them off for my own sake, but at the same time feel like I can't or am unwilling to give up all the perks (money).  Tell me your experiences!**

*Edit:  I've had a job since I was 12.  Worked 30 hours a week in HS.  Work 15 hours a week now in college.  Last summer did a full time unpaid internship on Capitol Hill, this summer will be doing a full time paid internship (not in politics).I've never saved, because I've never needed to.  I'm embarrassed to say but I have difficulty saving since its something I've never had to do before.

 I'm sure others have had similar experiences, so hopefully someone can give me advice.

  I used to be super social anxious and depressed.  I was probably a 10/10 for anxiety and 6/10 for depression.  Now I am a 4/10 anxiety and 2/10 depression, so I feel great.

  I'm 21, and when I did the most personal growth was when I was studying abroad in Europe for 6 months.  It was the first time I ever lived alone, and I loved it.  I think just not being around my parents helped dramatically.  After being abroad, I realized how constantly negative my parents are.  They think of the most negative stuff all the time, and are just depressed sick people.  If I had a choice I would never be around them, and I don't think I would regret it either.  My problem is that I am **100% financially dependent** on them.  My dad is in the top 5% of all income earners.  I enjoy the things I get (clothes, food, car, beach house, boat, college paid for) but I cannot stand either of my parents.  I'm not emotionally close to either of them, and they never taught me anything other than to obsess about money.  Their lesson on sex and drugs/alcohol was taught to me at age 18.  Don't have sex, and don't drink was their lesson.  I am now a recovering alcoholic.  I also now feel like being sexual is a bad thing, but am trying to reverse that.

More recently, I started feeling sorry for them.  They are sick (anxiety, depression) but have no clue they are.  I want to get away from them but feel like they have me financially controlled.

Who else here has been financially dependent on parents and actually cut them off?

My code isn't working and I only have a week left to get results or we have to cancel the launch. Thanks!
  
  
Hey there, my university started this new program where they bring in the smartest high school students in the state and set us up with projects and internships starting our Freshman year. The problem with that is we don't know what we're doing, and it's becoming a very big obstacle to overcome as we get closer to the end of the project.

Our first project is to design and successfully launch a balloon 100,000 ft into space with a payload carrying sensors and a microcontroller to retrieve and store the data. It doesn't seem so hard, but I'm the only computer engineer in the group and I've never worked with the BASIC Stamp language (We're using the STAMP BS2p microcontroller) and I've definitely never worked with integrated circuits on this scale before.

So after completing the circuit board (we're using the BalloonSAT board) and doing the initial tests we were all stoked because it seemed like the project was going to be a breeze. Jump forward a week and a half and I'm still stuck with no results despite looking up and reading everything thing I could find on this darn chip (the ADC0834CCN). I've never seen and much less worked with a chip that takes a code to start so I was lost in the water until I found the waveform diagram. At that point I was pretty sure I could figure it out, but after testing my code and getting a serial output of only HIGH values no matter what we did with our solar power sensor I brought the board down to the electronics lab and used a logic analyzer. Unfortunately for me my code seemed to produce the exact waveform diagram as the example showed, but I didn't not get any values back from the chip.

Any tips or tricks, or even a step-by-step howto would be lovely. I can provide my code if it would help, but it's quite lengthy so I won't post it unless it is necessary."

We've been together about a year, and this distance is killing me. We've had a rough patch or two from stress during school, and its getting better now that classes are over, and we're getting into internships in our fields.

I moved to my hometown, which is about three hours away from him, but will be five hours away from him once he leaves next week for his internship. 

Days like today, when I have a whole day or afternoon off, I usually would get him over and we'd have a date night as I like to call them. But I can't do that and I can't deal with how sad that makes me.

He seems to be doing better than I am. He's keeping busy with the guys and the hockey playoffs and his hobbies and whatnot, and I'm working roughly 8 hours a day plus my hobbies and things, but he's still busier than I am. (I should note I don't have friends here, and I have no interest in reconnecting with people I knew in high school.)

When I'm sad like this and he's busy, I feel even worse. I feel needy and sad, and I feel neglected and ignored when if I were busy, I wouldn't feel this way at all.

How do you keep this stuff at bay? I've already worked out, cleaned the house, walked the dog, spent an hour on supper, watched some tv, browsed reddit....I'm out of things to try. I can't keep going all day like the energizer bunny, and when I stop, I want to bawl my eyes out.

We can't Skype or call every night, he's too busy and has too much going on, but we do text throughout most of the day, light conversation."

I'm a third year undergraduate Architecture student at UC Berkeley. It has always been my dream to attend a top school like Princeton, Columbia, or MIT. I have really big dreams that I've worked hard for my whole life, and I feel like a low GPA is going to ruin them. 

I had a 3.5 GPA at the end of my sophomore year, but when my father was diagnosed with cancer and I had to take on a full-time job, it dropped to 3.1 at the end of this year. 

My portfolio is above average for my college (I think), and I've won 3 awards out of 4 studios for being the best in class (I only stopped winning awards this past year, with the extra job). Also, I've had 1 internship, and am currently applying for another this summer. 

I plan on working somewhere abroad before applying for a masters program. I'm not sure if my GPA is going to ruin my chances at a top school. I've heard completely different stories of schools caring about GPA, ranging from ""don't worry about it at all"" to ""if you don't have a 3.4, don't even bother applying.""

In your opinion, what are my chances at getting into a top Masters program with a good portfolio and a 3.1-3.2 GPA? Be honest. "

sn9lg,23,2012-04-22,Where should I go for undergrad CS: Berkeley or Caltech?,surelyfunke,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/sn9lg/where_should_i_go_for_undergrad_cs_berkeley_or/,"Right now, I'm deciding between Caltech and Berkeley EECS for undergraduate CS. In terms of finding internships and jobs at companies like Facebook, Amazon, Google, etc., is a degree from one of the institutions more prestigious/valuable?


**EDIT:** Thanks so much for the feedback. I have a couple more concerns/questions.

**Waitlists:** Everyone always complains that it's impossible to get the classes you need at Berkeley. Is this true for EECS majors? How commonly are you put on the waitlist for a class/how easy is it to get off the waitlist?

**Stress:** Everyone knows both schools are stressful, but how much stress do EECS majors face at Berkeley? How prevalent are dropouts/suicides? How many hours of work do students typically put in a week?

**Extracurriculars:** What are some common extracurricular activities for EECS majors?

**Entrepreneurial Spirit:** Everyone knows Stanford has this entrepreneurial spirit, and it's something I found lacking at Caltech. What about at Berkeley (at Cal Day, professors mentioned some EECS students drop out to form startups. How true is this/how frequently does this occur?)










**Original:**
Here are a couple of key comparisons between the two schools that I have noticed:

**Class size:** Class size at Caltech is obviously smaller than Berkeley (35 CS majors vs. 300 EECS majors). Some lower div CS classes at Berkeley get as big as 200 students.

**Classes offered:** Caltech only has about 14 CS professors, whereas Berkeley has about 85 professors in EECS. At Caltech, they said that they didn't offer as great a variety of classes as schools like Berkeley because of the small department size. Caltech's CS is also very theoretical, according to both students and professors.

**AP credits:** Caltech does not accept AP credits, but Berkeley does (allows me to get out of more lower division classes)

**Core requirements:** Caltech's core is notorious for its rigor and difficulty (proof-based calculus anyone?) but makes me a better problem-solver and thinker (something interviewers like to see).

**Semester vs. quarter system:** Berkeley is on a 15 week semester system, whereas Caltech is on a 10 week quarter system. At Berkeley, I would have to take on average 4 classes a semester, but at Caltech, I would have to take 5 classes a quarter.

**Cost:** Berkeley is a lot cheaper than Caltech because I would pay in-state tuition (~$30,000 vs ~$55,000)

**Scholarships:** Berkeley is offering me the Regents' Scholarship of $2500 per year. This guarantees me housing for four years, gives me priority registration for classes (a big deal at Berkeley), a personal Faculty sponsor, and the ability to join the Regents’ and Chancellor’s Scholars Association (which hosts faculty dinners, alumni dinners, etc.) I don't know if this would give me a significant leg up over other EECS students in terms of getting letters of recommendation, finding research, etc.

**Housing:** Housing is not a problem at Caltech. At Berkeley, I have the Regents' Scholarship, so I am guaranteed housing for four years.

**Research:** About 70% of Caltech undergrads do research, but only about 1/3 of EECS undergrads do research. Caltech pretty much throws research at you; at Berkeley, professors want you to have more upper div classes under your belt so that you are more useful. Also, I feel like at Berkeley, I would be competing with other EECS students for research opportunities. Caltech is conveniently situated near JPL, and Berkeley is situated near LBNL.

**Internships/Jobs:** Everyone at Caltech says that a Caltech degree opens a lot of doors for you, regardless of your major (one professor offered the example of a Caltech Mech. E student who is now working for Google). At Berkeley, I feel like I would be competing with my fellow peers for the same jobs/internships/positions. However, these Berkeley grads seem to be doing fine (https://career.berkeley.edu/Major/EECS.stm), and Berkeley is conveniently located in the Bay Area (I'm from the Bay). Berkeley has a larger alumni network because of its larger size and because Caltech students are more academically inclined (more pursue academic careers versus professional careers).

**Environment:** Berkeley is known for being cut-throat. Caltech seems very friendly and welcoming (more cooperative than competitive).

**GPA:** The average GPA for Berkeley EECS is about 2.7 to 2.9. At Caltech, 130 of the 230 or so kids graduate with honors (3.5+ GPA)

**Double major:** At Berkeley, I have the ability to pursue a joint major (EECS and Materials Science or EECS and Nuclear Engineering). At Caltech, a common double major for CS students is CS and Business, Economics, and Management (BEM).

**Master's:** Berkeley has a 5 year's master's program for highly qualified EECS students (roughly 10 to 15 EECS students).

**Rankings:** US News &amp; World Report ranks Berkeley higher than Caltech for both computer engineering and EE (#4 and #3 vs. #8 and #7). Among people I've talked to in the Bay, they say that I should go to Caltech (more prestigious)."
sn7rr,5,2012-04-22,"I've read the sidebar. I've read the links. I've read frugalmalefashion. My internship starts next week, and I need to dazzle. Can you help answer some of my specific questions?",bbqturtle,malefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/sn7rr/ive_read_the_sidebar_ive_read_the_links_ive_read/,"Hey MFA! I would love some help.

I am starting a job in two weeks at a local marketing firm, where they want me to wear business casual, but with the ability to upgrade to business professional when meeting with clients.

Background info first:

- [Me](http://i.imgur.com/3nBX2.jpg) (Pretend my shirt is ironed, tie is tied the correct height and I shaved better). That's what we are working with.

- I usually wear 411's and button downs to class, with some bucks, or boat shoes if it's nice weather outside.

- I come from Michigan

- I would like to spend less than $600 to make this work.

- 6'1"", 145lb, skinny.

Are you ready for my questions? Please answer any that you want!

1.  What color suit will give me the most versatility for this summer? The office is very relaxed, but see above for conditions. I was thinking charcoal grey pinstripe or navy blue pinstripe, but I need to be able to wear the pants with just a button down and tie. Please also comment on pocket squares and shoe color.
2.  Where can I purchase a fitting suit for cheap? We have a local express and macys. I know basic fitting guidelines, just wondered if you had any tips. Kalamazoo, MI.
3. Given my price range, is using a tailor wise? I could buy a macys suit, but it seems like it costs 40-50$ to get suitcoats tailored.
4. Because I am just an intern, should I wear exciting socks or boring socks?
5. Pocket squares, should I try them out, or just wait until I'm not an intern? They seem pricey and I'm just trying to be professional. If yes, what is the best way to purchase them?
6. I wear mostly express extra slim fit tee's. I know a lot of people prefer uniqlos. Is it worth transitioning, or should I stick with what I know?
7. Tan or Brown Wingtip Shoes? And Belt? (Keep in mind price range)

Thank you so much for taking some time to talk to me. If you wanted to blow my mind with helpfulness, you would make your answer in starters-kit-style with lots of links and picture and instructions. 

I love this community, and I love how you have changed my casual wear. It's just so hard for me to visualize these things. I hope I can return the favor someday."

He drew his inspiration from Robert Frost, Max Ehrmann and Roger McGough, so if you like any of those poets or poetry in general, I thought I would post this here for anyone who's interested. :)

It was published by a small publishing house that recently came into business. I know that the cover doesn't look as fancy as something Stephen King or J. K. Rowling would come out with, but the writing itself is brilliant if you enjoy this kind of stuff.

The reason I'm posting this here is to help get his name out a bit more. As the publishing house is new, there hasn't been any marketing done for it and as I just started there as a marketing intern, I've been given the job of helping publicize Three Worlds. 

I know you don't know me or anything so it's not like you'd do me any favours for no reason, but I thought I'd give it a try anyway! Better than sitting here, twiddling my thumbs while I wonder how to get the book more readers. 

tl;dr recently published book of poetry for your perusal if you so wish.

Thanks. :)

However, this interferes with plans... my significant other and I (long distance relationship) were planning on moving together in June cross-country. He's now upset that this throws our plans out the window; he's still intending on moving. He's afraid that we're gonna drift apart, is upset that I won't be with him for an indefinite period of time, and doesn't want me to take the job.


I'm torn for a few reasons. I know I won't be 100 percent truly happy living on my own without my mate, but I also know I won't necessarily find a job without a solid internship/previous experience. I don't necessarily want to work at this job for an extended period of time, but I do want experience. I know it isn't right for my mate to try to convince me to skip this opportunity, but on the other hand, I understand why he's so upset.

wat do?

sn4iv,1,2012-04-22,Summer Project,[deleted],LowtechLiving,https://www.reddit.com/r/LowtechLiving/comments/sn4iv/summer_project/,"I'm a programmer.  I spend all of my time on the computer.  I work on the computer, I play on the computer, my hobbies are on the computer.  Ugh.

I'm glad I stumbled on this subreddit, perhaps I've found some like minded people.  This summer I have a wonderful internship programming, so I'm going to spend all of my days programming.  It's a start up and those could be long days.  My plan is to leave my laptop at the office and not even have a computer at home anymore.

For me it's about forcing some boredom into your life. With the Internet and TV I feel hyper stimulated all the time. To find entertainment I merely collapse into my chair, click a few buttons, and begin passively consuming.

Without something neurotically occupying my attention (ie internet) I quickly become bored. When bored I then proceed to think through everything I could possibly do, prioritize the ideas, and choose one to act upon. Even if I end up watching a television show the important thing is that I chose to watch that specific show rather than passively accepting whatever was being played at the time. I have not had TV in a long time, so that's not a problem, but whenever I've momentarily had no internet I find I eat better, exercise more, have a cleaner house, and knock more things off of my to do lists.

So this is my summer project.  Does anyone have any similar plans?  I'd love to use this subreddit for updates and progress updates.  I will probably have to go to the library to access Reddit so I'll write my posts before hand.  Maybe we can make some collective goals?  I have books I want to read, cafes I want to lounge at, friends I want to connect with, and more.

I'd love to hear your summer plans below:"

Universal Helicopter Inc out of Prescott AZ has a deal with Papillon Helicopters (the biggest helicopter tour company in the US) for internships. it works like this, while you are pursuing your ratings at UHI you can intern up at Papillon (grand canyon) for a summer (the busy tour season) and when you are done, the VP of Papillon will give the owner of UHI a letter of recommendation for you if you do a good job. You can then get hired on at UHI (they hire from the inside so you need to at least do your CFI there). Once you hit 1000 hours at UHI, the CEO will then give the VP of Papillon a letter of recommendation for employment. Then you can get hired on, and in two season you can hit 2500 hours easy. This is a fairly tried and true method, I'm doing it right now and I know CFIs that have gone through this route. 

Couple downsides, I'm gonna bust my ass working ground at the west rim of the grand canyon, 12 hour days in 110 heat.

UHI is a pricey school, but you get what you pay for. They don't just teach to the PTS, they go far beyond the requirements.

:--|:--
[What was it that made you decide to drop out and do this instead? Was there an epiphany moment?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4eypgh?context=5)|I went for my first interview at an investment bank for a summer internship. never wanted to step back into one of those again. 
[*•The local gang is on the payroll.*  I would like to ask about this... what do you get out of the arrangement? and how did that happen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4ez8yi?context=5)|Basically ease of mind. they look after me and any guests they see around. point them in the right direction if they are lost. make sure none of them run into any issues with the locals. The neighborhood is still primarily black, and myself and most guests are white, so you stand out. it came about after the 'head' of them kept seeing me leave each morning with female guests or walking with them to local stores. he thought this was countless 'walks of shame' by all these girls and asked my 'secret' haha. that lead into the conversation of what i do and what he does (i already knew what he did from local business owners telling me). its a friendly arrangement (if that seems possible) and its not too much. they have come though on a few occasions and helped avoid what could have been bad situations.
[Would you mind expounding on a situation in which he intervened? This sounds like it could be a good story.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f1ygb?context=5)|One example- there use to be this guy who was always hanging around the block drunk. one day a female guest was buying beer at the deli and he was aggressive towards her and threatening. One of the boys from the gang was in the deli at the time and grabbed the guy on the shoulder and lead him outside. they talked, not even loud enough for me to hear, and I have NEVER seen the drunk guy around since. Previously I would see him everyday.
[How was it attending the ivy league school?  By higher education, do you mean ivy league or university? If the former, how is it a scam.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f01ec?context=5)|I think that the current university system needs a complete overhaul. Especially graduate schools. It is inefficient, cost prohibitive, and in general just held up because ‘thats how it is always done’. More than half the schools need to be shuttered, as well as half the programs at each school.
[What did you think of the people while you were attending school? Now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f01ec?context=5)|My classmates were amazing. Very talented people who were motivational to be around. That was the best thing about the program. I think many of them will waste the talent by chasing the highest paying career as opposed to creating things of value or innovating.
[Do you hook up often with guests?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4eynmb?context=5)|Hahaha. My PR response would be “it is bad to mix business and personal affairs”.
 |The honest answer- it happens.
[Go on....  Best story?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f0z0r?context=5)|I don’t know about a best. i used to write some of the stories on a blog- [Link to hosteltales.com](http://hosteltales.com) a few are pretty funny. most will probably fall into the tl;dr category however.
[Are you financially successful?  Credit cards are a very risky way to finance a business, so I'm worried you'll get yourself into financial trouble.  After expenses, do you generate a profit, and if so how much?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4eyry0?context=5)|The most risky. however, some times you have to just jump in and make it happen. i paid off all initial expenses last month and now generate enough to live comfortably.
[By atmosphere what do you provide? drinks? music? movies?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4eyw6a?context=5)|Rampart on repeat.

 |Most of the time I wake up and check my email. I usually have around 15 emails from people inquiring about staying here.
 |After that I kinda survey the place walk through all the rooms, clean up debris.
 |I look at what check-ins we have that day and get the beds ready. Then I tell my friend who looks after the place who is coming and going.
 |Then I usually bounce into Manhattan to do something. Or go with one of the guests somewhere. Or work on some of the other projects I'm involved with.
 |After that I usually head back to the hostel and sit in the common area (like I am now) and interact with guests/give advice and make plans for that night.
 |Then I usually go out somewhere with some of the guests and mix in some of my other friends.
 |My main 'job' is to make sure all the guests are having a good time.
[Have you got raided by cops for drugs or underage drinking or whatever?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f27b3?context=5)|No.
[What was the most expensive thing that someone broke?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f27b3?context=5)|A framed piece of artwork from a friend. Value +- $5k. It was in my room and someone ran into my door hard enough to knock it off the wall.
[Most disgusting thing you have seen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f27b3?context=5)|Period blood on a mattress after a girl got hers early. then she threw up next to it.
[Most weird question asked by a guest?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f27b3?context=5)|To call them a prostitute and arrange cocaine purchase. when I explained I had no numbers for such things he got really upset and took my phone from my hand and threw it against the wall.
[Do you find yourself learning foreign language from your guests? For example, are you learning much french from having so much guests from France?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f27b3?context=5)|Yes. i knew Spanish before, but I am trying to pick up more french due to the large amount of guests. It is hard to learn! I also know intros in many languages 
[New York. So Columbia I'm assuming ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4eylkb?context=5)|Correct.
[Great idea, NYC is sorely lacking in budget lodging. Where's the hostel? Are you glad you did it? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4eyhj9?context=5)|It has been the best experience of my life thus far. everyone has their own unique interests/passions and talking with people about them everynight I have learned quite a bit. Also, I now have close friends all over the place, which the value was shown recently when I took a Euro trip to 6 cities and stayed with former 'guests' in each city.
[So you are like the manager/owner of this hostel? What does that entail? Is it mostly logistical maintenance like getting enough food, bedding, and other things for the travelers that come through? So far, would you say you've made a good life decision? I really want to travel the world and utilize any hostels and half-way houses I can, my brother and I are planning on it, So my last question is; do the backpackers that come through seem to be enjoying their experience?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f0n0w?context=5)|Correct. I wear mostly all the hats owner, manager, janitor, etc.
 |I also hired one of my long term friends from where I grew up to help me with the day to day.
 |Most of my 'work' is in the reservations and handling them all. We always have more demand than we have beds, so it comes down to choose guests who I think would best mesh with the atmosphere here.
 |I have a local laundromat do all the laundry (big expense).
 |So far it is the best thing I have done. I love it. Hostels are really a great place and I have made not just acquaintances, but really close friends too.
 |All of our guests absolutely love it. It is why we get such a large amount of referral traffic now. We really nailed what we want to be and so far everyone seems to be enjoying it.
[Thanks, that's the answer I was hoping for. Just one more question I forgot to ask. Which country do most of your guests come from?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f0rwh?context=5)|France.

[Are you making a lot of money?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4eygx7?context=5)|Not as much as my friends who got 'traditional' jobs, however, I have total control of my free time to pursue other interests, which to me is far more valuable.
[Do you make enough to do/buy things you enjoy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f2kbc?context=5)|Yes. i can go out on nights I want to go out and go to the occasional Yankees game, which I enjoy :)
[Do you think that it was worth doing? its been 7 months but what do you want to have done in 7 years? I know that in Asia a lot of people make chains out of their hostels but is that possible to the same extent in NYC/USA? If so please do it.

[Do you (or did you, at one point in time\) ever regret dropping out?  What's the most amazing experience you've had doing it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4eypjm?context=5)|I don't regret dropping out. I wish I had earlier. Higher ed is very good at teaching facts, dates, information, well. However, they fail at teaching skills, and skills are what translate into success. It is impossible to broadcasts skills to an audience in a lecture hall.

However, I always wanted to do this, and am 'good' at it so I’m happy, which I don’t think a lot of my former classmates can say with their jobs.

If I keep doing the hostel(s) longer, I would hire more people so I could have less hands on time so I could again travel more.
[Silly question, are you usually able to get a good night's sleep? (what with guests getting locked out, noise, etc.\) As someone considering travelling and working in hostels for a few months, that's a small concern of mine.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f2ebk?context=5)|Haha, the sleep question is great! I NEVER get a good night sleep. Between people coming and going, drinking all night, our excellent sound system, the lazer lights we bought--its a party every night.

Seeing my entire life become utterly predictable. It was like a nightmare--I would complete school, have to get a job to pay off my student debt, have to get a certain type of high paying job in order to pay it off. After I get said job, and work for xyz company for such and such years, inevitably I will fall into the classic routine of meet some girl, move to the suburbs, have the single family house, the BMW, and the family dog. Before I knew it I would be 45, an executive of xyz company, finally debt free, but a slave to my conditions. I would eventually retire around 60, at which time I would be too old to really do anything.
[What would say you decided first: That you wanted to start a hostel or that you wanted to drop out of school?

I moved out to Brooklyn and lived with a very creative friend. We always threw around ideas and one day I brought up the hostel. He really pushed me to to it. Surrounding yourself with people supportive of you and someone to hold you accountable to your dreams is important.
[Are you planning to expand?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4eyq0s?context=5)|We need to. each night we are at or above capacity. but the draw to the place is that it isn't huge, and I can get to know the a lot of the guests. and all hostels are really based on the atmosphere within them, and the people.I've been looking at new places, however still struggling on how to maintain the atmosphere while getting bigger.
[What advice would you have for someone who's looking into trying to start a business rather than going to an expensive college?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f0yml?context=5)|Read.

[On a similar note, about how much money do you make per week?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f0yml?context=5)|Its cliche but do something you love. Nothing about this feels like 'work'. One of your passions you can make into a living some way.  I make enough to live, go out to eat if I'd like, and not stress when I spend too much at the bar :) Never a ton left over at the end of the month, but no real money scares either

When you think of 'absolute worst case scenario' it really isn't that bad. you probably won't starve. it also gives a nice feeling of pride, and makes you want to work harder.
[What made you want to start a hostel specifically ? Passion? Past experiences that made you think, "" I could do it better""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f2afi?context=5)|Past travel experiences. I traveled a lot and stayed in hundreds of hostels. I made some of my best friends in hostels. I researched it a bit here in NYC, and thought I could do it a bit different than what was offered. (smaller more host interaction, better partying)
[Sooo I don't think anyone has asked this yet... but, how long have you been at this hostel and how long does the average person stay? I know it says 7 months in the title, but I'm not sure if that's how long you have been there.. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f1700?context=5)|7 months total! First day we had guests here, even helping set up the beds haha. Average stay is around 4-5 days. I don't like to do 1 day stays because you can't get to know the person much, which I like to do. Longest stay was about 5 weeks.
[Do you notice any common traits in people from the same country or are people mostly the same?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4f1e5o?context=5)|I do. It is one of the more interesting things to watch. After interacting with so many people you see traits not just from where they came from, but their interests or even age. Let me think about the exact examples and I will post another response.
 |Overall too the experience has reinforced that 'people are generally good' which is cool.
[Any particular group of people you dread coming? Though it sounds like you can kinda pick and choose who stays...

I applaud you on having the courage/insight to drop out of such a ""golden opportunity"" to pursue what you want to do. I've also heard, that in relation to ivies being an overhyped phenomenon in particular, that the students they bring in are so talented and driven that even if they were locked in a closet for four years they would still come out and be successful.

 |Whatever you want to do, dive in and get some experience. If you want to have your own business-start one. Be a writer-start writing. Or start working within the industry (whatever it may be). Everything is theoretical until you actually do it yourself. You might fall flat the first time, but you will pick back up and learn from it.
 |Skills are the commodity, education lines on resumes are not. Soon resumes will start emphasizing skill sets. No more lists of achievements and brownie points, they will be portfolios of performance.
 |Find someone to hold you accountable. a friend, etc that you tell your dreams or hopes to and they follow up and remind you that they are watching. 
[Aside from accomodations, have you learned any tricks about travelling cheaply from your guests? Specifically as it relates to air fare? That's always the most prohibitive thing for me when it comes to travelling. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/slifg/iama_25yo_who_dropped_out_of_an_ivy_league/c4flnhl?context=5)|I haven't learned much from guests about this, but from personal experience kayak.com/explore is a cool resource to see how far you can go with what amount of money.

smvfw,2,2012-04-22,Drug test tips?,Forey_,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/smvfw/drug_test_tips/,"So recently I got an opportunity for an internship that would be great work experience and I need to pass a drug test sometime this week to complete the application process.  So I am a casual smoker, poking oneys here and there at night,  I haven't smoked heavily for a month now.  (because I have applied to a lot of jobs and expected a drug test).  So the hardest part was that on 4/20, I had to resist the urge to toke.  The thing is that instead of toking I got really drunk, and am pretty sure I ended up smoking some trees.  So with all that background is there any tips from you Ents on how to pass a drug test, things I can do to get the THC out of my body.  I need to take the drug test sometime this week.  I am 160 5'9.  I know about detox drinks and what not, but I have never tried them or know if they really work or not. 

Anything helps, Thanks guys.

TL;DR I recently smoked, and need to pass a drug test this week.  Any tips to increase my chances of passing."
smsac,3,2012-04-22,"Although anecdotal, here's my own success story (actually, a collection of mini-successes wrapped up in a series) to get you going.  I'm not a particularly talented individual, either.  (Long)",BranchedOut,GetMotivated,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/smsac/although_anecdotal_heres_my_own_success_story/,"I've gotten motivated over the past year, and I've had wondrous results.  I'll begin my story in November.

I was going to a friend's party.  I went to go put on one of my favorite shirts.  *It didn't fit*.  My weight rose to 250 lbs.  At that point, I said, ""Time to do something about this.  Now.""  

Instead of planning a weight loss routine, planning this, making schedules for that, I just started eating better at my next meal.  I didn't change what I ate, I just ate less.  I even went OUT to eat at a Mexican restaurant.  How did I eat healthier?  I just ate half of my meal.  That then made the most delicious, wonderful smelling lunch the next day.  I pretty much calorie counted.  Still ate terrible, but just a little less.  Surprisingly, the weight just melted off.  Over the course of 3 months, I had dropped 20 pounds.  Just from counting calories.

New Years came around.  I made the resolution to lose weight like normal, right?  

Wrong.  I decided the best to way derail my weight loss was to make it a goal.  People ask me, ""How many pounds are you trying to lose?""  I respond, ""Iunno.  I'm just trying to get fit.""  This nonspecific thing I was going toward (it may be a goal, but I'm not calling it one) was the key.  

I bought some new clothes from a thrift store.  Best purchase?  A suit.  For $5.  I then bought a host of nice button-up shirts, and slacks.  They do wonderful things for your appearance.  I'd imagine you could go five thousand miles in any direction from where any of you are, and you'd be hard-pressed to find a girl that doesn't appreciate a man that dresses nice.  

I took a ""Social Dance"" class at beginning winter quarter.  I wanted to be active.  Well, the class wasn't as physically intensive as I wanted it to be, but I did learn a few good dances.  *And* it wasn't that bad that there were lots of attractive gals in there.  I took this opportunity to shamelessly flirt for the sake of flirting.  Got some numbers.  But, I'd say take the class if you ever find one.  I haven't met a girl yet that didn't appreciate a fella who knows more than the ""bump and grind.""  

Spring quarter, I signed up for a swimming class.  It'd be more active than dance!  AND I WAS RIGHT.  Every day we swim until we're out of breath.  And if anyone ever tells you that you can't get muscles from swimming, **punch them in the throat.**  I'm toning up like a sonofagun, and I keep finding new muscles that are getting big enough to notice.  I'm now 210 lbs, 40 pounds lost, and a lotta muscle gained.  

Now, all the while this was happening, I had an internship opportunity going.  A company was at my school's career fair, and was looking for interns.  I'll make the story short, and let you know the company took a month and a half to get me to an interview, but never messaged me back or anything if I got the internship or not.  After realizing they didn't want me, I went to my school's career center website.  I applied to everything with the word, ""IT"" in it.  I just middle clicked everything, went to the tab, scrolled down, and hit ""apply.""  Days later, I get an email from a company that wanted to speak to me that day.  Long story short, I went from not getting an internship in a small town in Louisiana (where I'm from) with nothing to do, to a **Full time job, with really awesome benefits, and a higher pay, in *Washington, DC* **.  Higher pay, I get full insurance coverage, and it's in a city where I'll have a million things to do!

But it doesn't stop there.  From November, my confidence also rose because I decided I wanted to be confident.  Confidence is a really attractive trait, physically and mentally.  I thought I was awesome, acted like I was awesome, and you know what?  People thought I was awesome.  It's a self-feeding cycle.  I just got more and more confident, and looked and felt more and more awesome.  I was talking to very attractive women in a way that seemed I could get them easily.  Although I'm still quite flabby (I'm in an awkard stage between fat and fit.  There's big muscles showing, but most of it is covered by a layer of fat, so I just gotta burn it off and I'll be goooood), I talked like I was the most attractive man on the face of the earth.  And it works.  Next weekend, I visit my hometown.  There, I have a date with this Philipino gal, who's just ferociously good-looking.  And she's really sweet, too.  She can really get any man she wants, and she's a good person, so she deserves a really good guy.  Unfortunately, I'm moving, so I'm not doing anything to get tied to anywhere.  But dates are fun.

**Do you want to know how I did it all?**
As cliche as it is, I followed Nike's slogan of ""*Just Do It*""  Really.  I didn't worry about small details, or anything else that would slow me down.  I wanted to lose weight, so I did.  I wanted a date with a gal far prettier than most guys my appearence would date, so I did.  I wanted a job, so I got one (but luck was a major contributor to this one.)  I wanted to be confident, so I did.  Just do it.

**TL;DR**:  Lost weight, got a job in DC (I'm a country-bumpkin from Louisiana), became confident, got a date with a girl far prettier (and a good person, too) than guys my appearance would date.  If I want to do something, I do it.  "

Within weeks I was visiting some friends in LA, and decided that it was time to make my move out to Los Angeles.  I am a huge fan of the pop culture industry.  If it’s big, I’m fascinated.  After saving enough money, I moved out in October 2011 towards my internship at an online blog.  Within my first six months of living here, I turned the internship into a job, and I’ve interviewed the likes of Jason Lee, Brandy, and I’m soon to head to an event where I’ll be talking to Robert Downey Jr, Tobey Maguire, and Ben Affleck.

She blindfolds me and we get in the car. When the blindfold comes off, we are standing in front of our local teaching hospital, where I normally go for doctor's appointments. Okay. There could still be something cool inside, right?

Nope. Mom then says she's scheduled me for my first ever OB/GYN appointment, because ""I'm finally a woman."" I was nervous to say the least. We sit in the waiting room until it's my turn. My mom asks if I want her to come with me. Obviously no.

As it is a teaching hospital, my doctor is there with an intern and a nurse. So, already 3 people to examine my ladyparts. I sort of laid there with my eyes closed to avoid looking at anyone directly, and they mumble doctor stuff for a few minutes. And then - ""OH WOW GET THE INTERNS!"" I am confused, as I had been completely shutting out their conversation up until this point. I honestly thought something was seriously wrong. 

About 3 more interns enter, so we now have 6 people to stare intently between my legs. Now I know what's so exciting - apparently I have no labia minora. What? Are we done yet? They discuss for a few minutes about how this is unusual, and then everyone leaves again and my doctor, an older man, congratulates me on my cool vagina and tells me to come back soon.

**TL;DR** : First OB/GYN appointment, 6 doctors, OMG LABIA!!!

GF Amber 25f and I 27m have been going out for almost 2 years. I used to love this girl alot, enough to tell her that I would be honored to marry her in the future and start a family as well.  She was everything I was looking for and appeared to be ""the one"".  But recently that girl serves only a figment of my imagination and has been replaced with what seems to be like a truer version of the ""real Amber"".    

We were connected in every which way.  Our sense of humors were almost identical and till this date she is still the coolest, most laid back, funniest chick I know.  Sexually we couldn't keep our hands off of each other.  Compliments were both common and easy to come by.  Expressing ourselves, feelings, and deepest thoughts couldn't have come any easier.  We were open about everything.

But now... now shes confused.  Idk what she expected to happen to her life after college, but all she really wanted to do was travel and see the world.  She got a chance to do that when she got to do a 4 month internship in Switzerland last summer.  Let me also mention that this was 4 months after I had moved back to Hawaii after living in California for the last 4 years, just so we could finally be together after doing long distance for 6 months.  So understanding this was something she had to do for herself, i agreed she should go and that I would stay with her parents for the time being.  I bit my tongue and endured the 4 months that she practically forgot about me and let the relationship fizzle away.  She would later admit to me that if I hadn't worked so hard at our LDR that it probably would have ended while she was in Switzerland.  

Well ever since shes gotten back from Switzerland, Nothing else ever seems to make her happy anymore.  She came back home weighing 20 lbs heavier and she lets that take a big toll on her self confidence.  Before you go off and determine the problem right there, I personally find her more attractive now, or at least don't find any less attractive.  I tell her I like it, I compliment her on her body at least a few times a week and would tell her more but I know when to draw the line of overdoing it.  We actively work out together.  I signed her up under my 24hour membership program, we go to sissy turbo kickboxing/yoga classes together.  I go hiking with her, we do crossfit training, we go on runs around her neighberhood, we go to the beach, and were even planning to go snowboarding in Canada in May.  So I do my part in trying to help her feel more confident about herself physically, even though I love her body as is. 

Shes worked 3 different jobs since being back home and quit one with a major career advancement within a month, allowing a well paying management position to slip right through her hands and opting to work for $12/hr insead of a 55k/year salary.  Her other job (I should also mention is her favorite) is buying back gold at a kiosk at a grocery store.  Its a dead end job, she knows it, but wants to put in full time hours here because she can just relax and not really do anything all day. This is all understandable to me though, finding the right job is no easy task and takes time.  Im also allowing her time to find her base and open her wings.  

But through all this she has lost sight of the girl she once was.  Or pretended to be for me, at this point im not really sure what to think.  

The only thing that is ever on her mind is how shitty life is.  How her schooling screwed her over with grant money going towards her masters degree (which she still cant make a decision if she would with or without the money).  Or how how bad her job is and how it makes her sick, to the point where shes gone to the ER only to have the doctors say shes perfectly fine.  Even after multiple visits to her regular doctor, they couldn't find anything. She was anxious and freaking about if she was termially ill and the doctors can't find out whats wrong with her.  Her father and I would eventually get around to her that she needed to calm her mind down, relax, and learn breathing exercises that would eventually eliminate all her heart problems.  

But weeks after quitting the job that made her sick in the first place, shes still feeling the after effects of the chemicals she had to work with.  She gets dizzy and nauzea spells daily.  Never to the point where she is throwing up or really ill, just on and off slight dizzyness.  But enough for her to tell me how irritating is... not at the time, but days later when I try to make passes at her and tells me how shes too sick to do anything.  When minutes before we could be playfighting and laughing it up like nothing was ever wrong. 

She is no longer physically attracted to me, nor has any desire or need to be please either of us sexually.  Her libido is now non existant.  I have talked to her about this numerous times and she says she will try to do better, but in the end she can't even fake it anymore.  Through this grueling process I have completely given up on trying to get physical with her.  I have come to terms and accepted that I will probably get laid once a month now if im lucky.  I have a strong libido and this was not something I wanted to do for any other reason but trying to make this relationship work.

After a recent fight she has even admitted that she does not put in her fair share of effort into making this relationship work.  

But heres the problem, This type of thing happens everytime we fight.  She will fix the problem for a few days or so, but will fall right back into her old ways shortly therafter.  Until we're back at square one.   IM tired of all the work im putting in and getting the run arounds.  She won't listen to me or take my advice on mostly anything.  She now makes me feel small and even worse about myself because she has become so condiscending.  Can I work with this girl or am I headed down a path going no where?"
smgs9,1,2012-04-22,How badly should I lie/give up?,[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/smgs9/how_badly_should_i_liegive_up/,"I fucked up, guys. I've been going to an amazing school and pursuing a major that I love and am passionate about. I've been going straight through for two years without taking the summer semesters off, waitressing every weekend, and working internships in the mornings before school. I also have an active social/night life, a gigantimo family, and life stuff like laundry. The last two years I've maintained a 3.0 GPA.

I'm exhausted, and these last few weeks I have NOT GIVEN A FUCK. I haven't gone to most of my classes, been drinking days at a time, and hanging out with an awesome dude. There have been times when I didn't go to class because I didn't do the homework because I was on Reddit for hours NOT GIVING A FUCK. 

My school has an attendance policy in which I can be failed for not attending. Not only have I not filed for appropriate leave of absences, but I'm about twice over what I was allowed to have missed. This is my last week of school for this semester and I'm trying to decide how ridiculous of a lie I can come up with or if I should bite the bullet. Bite the bullet? That means my parents will have paid tuition for an entire semester that I will not get credit for, that means I will have to tell my parents this, that means I will have to retake all of the classes. This is finals week. 

The guilt of this entire scenario is crushing me. Nobody has any idea that I'm behind at all, and I had just finally convinced my parents to let me have this coming summer semester off school so I can get a little money cushion behind me when I get my own apartment June 1st. Worse, I am way too old to be fucking up in college. Closer to 30 that 19. 

I fucked up because I was totally in denial about my situation, exhausted, and now I just need some advice. I can file a leave of absence for all of the classes I have missed, but I don't actually have an alibi. I'm not comfortable lying about death (family, friends) for fear of the worst kind of karma, and the only reason I even give a fuck about any of this is the idea of disappointing my parents who are paying for this. 

Ahhh, I fucked up. 

TL,DR: I missed to much school to pass though otherwise have a chance at a passing grade, my parents pay for everything, there are people who  can pass me if I lie. "

so i (an american) met a girl while studying abroad last year in asia.  she's now 26 and i'm 23.  i found out she was dating an american guy who was an english teacher over there, and i was happy for her.  but after a while she starting asking me things like ""is it true in the US boyfriends don't have to buy anything for their girlfriend's birthday?"" and telling me he wouldn't let her hang out with certain people without his permission.  just an overall dick, and the thing is she's the type of incredibly kind person who didn't understand that she was being used.

so after talking with her some more, and hearing that it was kind of getting to physical abuse, she was convinced to break up with him.  i was so happy for her letting go of that situation, and even though at this point i started alluding to her being someone i would like to date and sensing that she possibly felt the same way, since i was going back to the US in two months pretty soon i didn't want to tell her anything.

in late august after getting back i finally asked her if she'd like to have a long-distance relationship with me, and it made her so happy.  normally i wouldn't recommend having a relationship like that, but for our personalities and future plans being so similar i think things can work.  and i hear stories about people cheating and stupid things like that but we were in love and i don't think either of us would ever be the type of people to even think about that.  i also wanted her to know i was serious about this since her last guy wasted her time, so i promised her that if things worked out that she would definitely be the type of person i would consider marrying.

so things were great for a few months.  i'd wake up every morning, talk with her online, chat on skype sometimes, sent letters/gifts back and forth occasionally.  we got to know each other pretty well this way, and i've never been so interested in hearing what a girl had to say every time we talked like i did with her.

but she also also went to school/work a total of 80 hours a week.  i was also pretty busy with school, upcoming graduation and an internship too.  and i didn't realize how difficult it would be not getting to be physically close to her, even when i studied abroad i gave her a hug maybe once since we were only good friend then.  i'm also a virgin, so i brought up the topic of sex sometimes which made her uncomfortable to talk about.  and looking back on things i could've easily waited to talk about some of that but i acted immaturely.

in late january, with all of those little stressful factors involved and a small misunderstanding of her thinking i talked with a mutual friend about some private stuff, which i didn't, but it's somewhat understandable she thought that.  she tells me it's better if we end the relationship.  i ask if we could work things out, saying id come visit her or vice versa in march, but she wasn't interested.  i'm pretty sad/upset at that point and i politely tell her that i can't stay friends and never want to talk with her again even though i respect her as a person.

and i thought that would be it, like i would just forget about her in a few weeks and move on.  but it's not that easy.  she was a pretty important person in my life for almost a year, and even the slightlest little things bring back memories of her that i can't really avoid.  i tried emailing occasionally without making myself look too desperate, but she didn't want to give me another chance.

in march i was back in asia for a week and while there i decided to go to her house and drop off a package.  hopefully i could at least talk with her in person again.  but because of an unknown law about not visiting a person's house after 9pm without prior approval, i was taken into a cop car right after i got to her house.  the cop goes into her house and talks with my ex's mom, who doesn't like me at this point, which only makes things worse.

at the police station i'm interrogated by two police officers, they couldn't speak english to add to that.  at this point i'm thinking i may go to jail so i'm trying to explain my side of things.  they ask to see the gift i brought her, a few small items and a letter i wrote.  at this point after my explanation he's more understanding but as soon as he reads the letter he starts crying, and i'm crying at this point too.  so he understands things a little better now and we work something out where he'll let me go without any questions asked if i just sign a piece of paper saying i won't contact her by email, in person, etc again.  he rips off a piece of notepad paper and i write that i won't contact her, sign my name, and put a fingerprint on it.  we say some sorrys, thank yous, and i go back to the US a few days later.

that's a condensed version, and i know it's a little long just for some context.  basically i'd still really love to see her, but i guess legally i'm not allowed to contact her, maybe indirectly through a friend but even then in her mind the way she thinks of me now she probably wouldn't be willing to meet.  i'm not even concerned about dating her or anything like that, just getting a chance to talk with her in person for a little bit would mean everything to me and it may help her too.  i'm not sure how else to deal with it other than talking with her.  i have plenty of money, let's say $10,000 i could somehow devote to this, free time, and my life in general is pretty good.  it's just this one thing that i'm having a really difficult time dealing with."

Never thought I'd be one to make a post like this, but I'm getting desperate. Hope I don't make this too long...

I'm a senior in college, about to graduate in a few weeks. This is the third year I've lived off campus in my own apartment. Before living at school, I lived with my mother, sister, and grandmother. During that time, my grandmother fraudulently used my social security number to open a credit card and failed to pay it back. 

Let's backtrack. My grandmother was not a very good person to us when she was alive. She was very manipulative, verbally abusive to my sister and I, and had almost every decision that any of us made was based around whether or not it would make her upset. It was a tough living situation, but we couldn't afford to live elsewhere - my grandmother owned the house we shared. Likewise, my mother insisted upon giving her ""second chances"" because this woman was her mother. I understood why she'd often turn a blind eye during less important fights we'd have or whatever, but it was obviously incredibly frustrating when something actually serious would happen and my mother wouldn't do anything about it. I, embarrassed and often really confused about what to do, never told anyone about my living situation outside of close friends, who also never really knew what to do about it. But can you blame me? I was a kid, I didn't want to call out my family on things that I weren't even sure were serious or not. 

That changed after leaving high school. A short time after going to college, I started getting letters from a credit card company that I didn't have an account with asking me to pay a substantial amount of money that I definitely didn't have: over $2,500. I looked into the statements that were sent alongside the bill and found out that the card was opened in 2004 - I would've been only 14 years old, way too young to legally open a card. I assumed the bills were well crafted scams, and didn't pay attention to them (possibly stupidly, but like I said, I was just a college freshman at the time). A short time later, I received a summons - the credit card company was suing me for a card I had never used or even knew about. I went to court, explained the situation as I knew it best, and showed them my driver's license and passport to prove my current age. My case was declared ""dismissed without prejudice."" This means that the court says that I don't have to pay the credit card company right now, but they can still ask me to pay the amount if they so choose. If they were to sue me again and the court ruled in my favor, it would most likely be declared ""dismissed with prejudice,"" meaning the company would no longer be able to ask me to pay. However, because it's without prejudice, the glaring mark on my credit reports that claim I had a card ""charged off"" will still remain until the card company decides that I don't have to pay it.

Because of that mark, I am unable to open my own credit card for myself, so over the last year I have only had bank accounts in my name, which up to this point has been perfectly fine. My mother added me onto her credit card account for a short while for emergencies, which I used responsibly. I had this card from 2009 up until the end of 2011, never missing a payment and only using it when I absolutely needed to. It was sort of a backup plan, as I do not have a proper savings account or emergency fund (I can thank grandma for that too. Apparently, the savings account that she had ""graciously"" opened for me (""But you can't access it, or you'll just spend the money, so i'll watch over it for you."") on one of my birthdays had been withdrawn from enough from her to deem it basically useless.). At the end of last semester, my mother had to take that card back because she fell into debt and had to close the account.

To compensate for not having that card, I picked up more hours at my job. I make $11 an hour there and work basically whenever I'm not in one of my classes or at my required unpaid internship (my major requires an internship for at least one semester before allowing students to graduate and most internships around where I live are unpaid). I also cut back on extra expenses - I stopped drinking completely, started buying groceries on a need base and tried to budget my money as best as I could, choosing to spend every weekend and work night working or doing homework instead of going to bars or other fun outings with friends. I was doing okay. Not great, but okay. I had a little extra at the end of the first couple of months, and started trying to build a bit of a savings account for myself.

I worked my ass off and it didn't help. Life has a way of creating obstacles at the worst moments and decided that this was the semester to send me a lot of them. Last month, my purse was stolen. My purse contained my wallet, my car keys, a camera, my passport (normally this was kept in my safe with other important documents and items but I had gone to Montreal the weekend before and had forgotten to take it out), and a few personal items. Almost everything was replaceable, but at a cost. Whoever had my purse now had my license and my car keys. I needed to get my door locks changed or risk my car getting stolen. I brought my car to the shop and got my locks changed - for a whopping $800. That's more than what I pay for groceries, rent, and utilities every month. At this point, I barely had that in my accounts, but I had to pay it somehow... Without my car, I can't drive to work, and if I can't drive to work then i don't have a job and if i don't have a job... the cycle goes on and on. 

My first thought was to ask my mother for help, but she was struggling with finances as well. I went to my father next, but he is in the same boat. So, I cut into my homework time and picked up any extra hours that I could. Because of this, I am currently struggling to not only finish my school work on time to even graduate without a failing grade, but I still can't cover everything with the money i've earned. My accounts have all been overdrawn and my utilities companies have sent me warning notices about late payments. The worst part about it is that once I graduate, I can no longer work at the job I currently hold because it's an on-campus position, held only by current students. I've been applying for multiple jobs in the area and secured one for after I graduate - finally some good news! 

Well, not so much. See, graduation is still a good three weeks or so away. Because my funds have disappeared and am now in debt, I'm terrified that I'm going to be kicked out of my apartment. I can't put in any more hours at work, I have no other means to pay for anything, my accounts are very overdrawn, and I have no idea what to do or how to get myself out of this situation.

Currently, my total debt for rent, utilities, and car payments is a little over $1,500. That's not even including food or toiletries or dog food or anything else that at this point has kind of become less of a priority over actually having a place to live. Going back to living at home is not an option - I already renewed my apartment lease, having secured a job for myself post graduation. Likewise, up until this semester, I've been mostly fine living on my own for the past few years. However, I am now completely broke and I have no idea what to do.

My question for you, if you've actually read this far down, is what do I do now? I have until the end of the month to come up with over $1k. I've never been in this situation before and don't know where to turn. I know that once I start working post graduation I can get back into the system I was on and be able to pay for everything normally again, but I don't know what I can do about the next few weeks. I know many people suffer worse debt than I do and many other college students suffer with money situations, but I've always tried to be really responsible about money so as to not fall victim to debt. Yet, here I am anyway.

EDIT. Totally forgot to give a little more detail about my current living situation. I live in an apartment with two roommates and my boyfriend. I also take care of my dog from back home that I've had since high school. My boyfriend lately has been paying for almost all of my dog and my food for the past month as I've used that money to try to cover bills. I don't feel comfortable asking my roommates or other friends for that kind of money because I know most of them have their own financial woes. I also don't want to ask my boyfriend for more than what he's already helped me out with."

Someone mentioned offhand that I might enjoy nursing as a career. It's social, it's active, I love helping people and caring for people, I love learning and have always been a good traditional academic person.

I know nothing about nursing though, as a field of study and a career. If I decided to pursue it, it would be through a community college. What are the different branches within nursing? What is the difference between them? What kind of education do you need for them?

Here are the facts: About 4 weeks ago my incredibly cute coworker started to come to my workstation just to ""chat with me"", showing IOI's all over the place. She would wait for me to finish work so we could take the subway together. During those subway rides, she would drop hidden questions all over the place, like 
""Awww, can't wait for the swimming pools to open"" or ""I heard (movie) is pretty good {looks at me}). I noticed all those signals but always thought about them as a weird coincidence. But it went on for 4 weeks. We went to bars together, saw movies and exchanged cocky remarks about me having to go to bed at 7am and her needing a wheelchair to dance in clubs.

I'm writing this at 3:34am after an uneventful night in a club. I tried approaching, but she wouldn't get out of my head. Even thinking about her makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.

I'll be close to the university over the summer, and I figure that I can stay in regular communication with professors if I need guidance/advice. I would document the design process thoroughly/professionally and eventually post to the web and the link to my work could go on my resume.

If my project is impressive enough, could this be a good idea? I know that if I graduate without any work experience, it will be more difficult to get hired. 

I've seen where other students sometimes get internships and end up doing really menial things that they don't really learn much about engineering and industry. In comparison to that, I feel that I would learn a lot if I worked on a design project."

Hit me up if you're in the area and interested in having a chat or a drink or something - first beer's on me!"

How do I handle a huge disparity in income?,ISeekAdviceGreatSage,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/soyru/im_new_at_this_whole_relationship_thing_how_do_i/,"We're both 21, been together for 3 years. Life is great. I live with my gorgeous girlfriend, go to a terrific school, and study what I love (music). There's a huge disparity in our income levels.

I have an (unpaid) internship and go to school full time. I don't work. I do play piano 4 hours on Saturday and 4 more on Sunday at a large cafe near here, and I make about $250 a week from that, but that's my only income. All of that income goes to rent, food, living/personal expenses, and bills. My girlfriend, on the other hand, makes a lot of money. She works at her parent's company and her parents also give her a lot of money.

I really don't care a lot about money, just happiness, but this is really creating problems. The fact is I don't have a disposable income. Whenever we go out, she's always the one paying. We do tons of free stuff together, but she still likes to go on vacations, go to concerts/plays/movies, go out to eat, etc. And she always pays for me. I know I won't be able to pay her back in the near future and it sucks. 

How do you manage through this? I also feel bad that any gifts I give are things I made myself instead of something nice. I guess I don't feel as bad about her buying me birthday/anniversary presents because we share most of our clothes and jewelry anyway, so if it's either of those she can at least use them."

I've seen posts in this sub before about how to properly list languages that you know as opposed to languages that you are familiar with/learning. With that and my current education status, I have a half page long resume and will almost certainly be skipped over.


Is it inappropriate for me to list past work experience if it is unrelated to the field (ie Waiter, Security Guard, Sales) just to prove that I have held jobs before? Or perhaps I could mention projects that I've worked on in school (Build Manager, Project Lead) as somewhat professional experience?

soord,2,2012-04-23,Pent up disappointment- released!,YumYumBlueGrapes,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/soord/pent_up_disappointment_released/,"I have one goal.  After living through the grotesque transformation of the girl I loved into the controlling imitation of her mother, I decided to chase my dreams.  Family vacations to Utah and Colorado got me obsessed over the area, you could say.  Everything I love doing is out there- in addition people who shared my interests and were “like me”.  With a hollow heart I began striving for that destination.

Getting a degree in chemical engineering was the easy part.  I packed on internship after internship and sacrificed personal time for resume building projects.  I became the envy of my peers as I was not as intelligent but had a chip on my shoulder from having work experience.  I first decided that graduate school in Boulder would be a great option- but when a supervisor at one of my jobs failed to write a recommendation letter I dismissed the option of going for chemical engineering graduate school.  I wanted to work.  

I somehow became one of many people being considered for a job in Denver doing natural gas.  I put up with a two day interview process to finally be offered a job in Midland, TX while two of my classmates got jobs in Denver.  My jobs.  I tried going to Midland, and the socialite in me could not take the isolation.  It was good money, though, but the isolation got to me so I decided to not take the job.

Two more job options later, and I’m in a city only two and a half hours from my home town.  Things went well in my new field of Environmental Engineering- I grew to like the field.  However, the last four months of living in this area have gotten me bummed as I became less and less used at my job, more and more worthless.  Still no girlfriend, I had burned bridges with some friends and had failed to find enough more friends in this city, and most importantly, no Colorado.  I tend to think of the girl that started it all.  I tend to think about taking her back- as she is still single.  I would be miserable, but not as miserable as now.  I become angry at myself very quickly because I look at how my life is now and how I enabled it to become.  What if I had gotten the job in Denver?  Fuck that, out of my control.  My self-esteem has plummeted but yesterday I started applying for new jobs, out west.  The graduate school application for Denver is due in October- funding in July.  

It’s all a fucking game, hopefully I get lucky this next round.

A year and a half of interning at this company left me with a completely different view of the business world, and a pile of good stories.  This one just scratches the surface.

Since I was a lowly intern, I shared my cubical with another lowly intern.  I wasn't upset in the least by this, because she was smoking hot.  I assumed hot chicks didn't go to school for accounting (an admittedly sexist assumption).  We sat kind of back to back, and one day she tapped me on the shoulder.

""Are you hungry?"" she asked me.

""I'm always hungry.""

""Do you want the cookies I brought with my lunch?""

I was confused by why she'd just offer me her cookies.  But I learned at a very young age that when you are offered free cookies, you don't ask questions.  As I munched away, my curiosity got the better of me.

""Why didn't you want these, anyway?  Am I eating tainted cookies?""

""No, I was having problems with my internet earlier and IT said that my problem might be related to having too many cookies.""

I explained to her what they actually meant and showed her how to clear her cookies, but only after I finished eating the real cookies.  They were homemade and delicious.

About a year ago I was working a general wage slave job at a grocery store.  There, one of our special needs employees, a bagger came up to me and asked if I could be her friend.  I don't know what mental disability she has, but I know for sure she has a lower IQ.  I agreed because I'm not a bad person, and would text her from time to time when she wanted to chat.  That was fine and all, but eventually she started pressuring me to hang out with her.

I did, because I know that she doesn't really have anyone to hang out with as she wasn't in high school anymore where there are programs and such.  We'd go to the mall, go see fireworks, I'd make her dinner, stuff like that.  But she started getting increasingly more demanding of my time, like she wanted to hang out for more than 4 hours or wanted to spend the weekend with me, things I just didn't have the time for.

I'm a full time student and for awhile there, I was working 2, 3, jobs while having an internship, while taking 18 credits.  I told her I could only see her every once in a while and she got pretty upset.  

Due to her disability she cannot drive, and therefor could only work shifts that were when the public bus ran.  One day she called and asked if I could give her a ride home from a shift so she could pick up an extra one.  I agreed as I live within walking distance of the store, but she lives almost a half hour away.  I did it because I felt bad that I didn't have time to hang out with her.

After this, I ended my employment there but I'm still working 2 jobs (one is freelance, so I have more time to myself now) but school is very busy and finals are ramping up.  After I gave her a ride once, she's constantly texting and calling me, asking if I can give her rides to and from work.  Even on days that the bus is running!  It's expensive and time consuming and quite frankly, I'm feeling upset and used.  I have my own freelance business to worry about but I feel like a complete and total jerk for telling her no.

What's the best way for me to approach this?  I know she lives with her mom and I think the problem is that the mom thinks ""great!  a friend who will do anything!"" and has even asked me for rides which I have said no as well.  I want to sever this connection as I feel like it's invading my time when I'm constantly getting texts asking where I am, what I'm doing, and if I can stop what I'm doing right now and drive her somewhere.  

As of now I've been ignoring the messages as I don't see her because I don't work there anymore, but it's making me feel like an awful human being."

I'd really appreciate any feedback, having zero knowledge in the issue:

I'm going to be doing a summer internship in Tokyo for about 3 months. I will be paid in Yen, so I was wondering what the best plan is to move money to Japan at the beginning, and then move what I get paid during the summer back to the US, keeping fees to a minimum. Here's what I'm thinking about doing right now:

-Get some traveler's checks from my current bank (very small, local University bank)

-Open a Citibank acct in the US, and put money into it

-Arrive in Japan, exchange the traveler's checks for currency

-Open a Japan citibank acct, and transfer money from the US one to the Japan one (I was told by Citibank that there were no exchange rate fees, only a wire transfer fee if I'm moving in between two Citibank accts)

-Get paid during the summer to the Japan citibank acct

-At the end, transfer all the money from the Japan citibank acct to the US one

Does this seem like a decent plan? Is there anything I'm not considering?

snz5c,6,2012-04-23,BF is gaining weight rapidly but is sensitive about it...help!!,physiologist,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/snz5c/bf_is_gaining_weight_rapidly_but_is_sensitive/,"For as long as I knew him (2 years), my bf has been extraordinarily athletic and fit - even a bit on the skinny side. Very tall, very handsome, well-built, and so slender that he totally pulls off dressing in my clothes in drag every halloween. My friends and family have always commented on what a good body he had every time we went swimming. In fact, I was the chubby one. My parents would even say ""look at how bf takes care of himself... why don't you do that as well?"" My bf used to eat really well and work out regularly. He was also extremely healthy and very seldom got sick.

Then depression happened. My bf is in grad school and is totally feeling the pressure. He has no idea what kind of a job he wants when he's finished, and the job market in his field is downright AWFUL. He got rejected for all 8 summer internships he applied for and is now stuck TAing summer school. His thesis advisor is an absentee dickhead who doesn't seem to give a crap about him and he doesn't even know where to begin his thesis. His research turned out mediocre. Everything totally compounded into him playing videogames constantly when he wasn't in the lab or in class. He hasn't went to the gym ONCE all semester.

I'm just trying to be loving, supportive, and encouraging even though he's taking me on his emotional rollercoaster with him and has hot and cold cycles that drive me insane and make me wonder if his love for me has died (his libido is practically nonexistent). He's currently in a cold cycle where he hasn't spoken to me in a couple of days for no reason because he has food poisoning for the umpteenth time because he really doesn't care one iota what he puts into his body. Taco bell, entire pints of Ben and Jerry's ice cream, random sketchy all-night greasy-spoon diners, deep-fried-everything, ""mystery meat"" - the most horrifyingly unhealthy food you could think of. I have the worst sweet tooth and even like deep-fried things but I have self-control and even when i was overweight I was careful about the quality of food I decided to eat. So my bf's eating habits really make me cringe, especially since he's always getting food poisoning. This is so unlike him - he's an ecologist so he of all people knows what kinds of crap easily ends up in our food if we are not careful about quality - I think because of his line of work he is numbed about it. He gained a LOT of weight to the point where his belly sticks out really awkwardly (he carries his weight higher than anyone I've ever seen right underneath his breastbone, mostly above his bellybutton, so instead of a flabby jellybelly he looks like a massive inflated balloon is growing inside his lower thoracic/upper abdominal cavity and expanding his rib cage and stomach area above his navel - i.e. about 4-5 months into high-carrying pregnancy).

Meanwhile, I became quite close with his mother (weird, I know, but she's awesome!) and we started working out together at her gym three times a week. I lost 20 lbs and counting, and am now the proud owner of a six-pack and a pornstar ass. This is not helping his self-esteem. He has expressed that he is intimidated by my hot body and feels like he doesn't deserve my gorgeous self.

Note that taking him to the gym is not an option as I'm currently in his hometown while he is quite far away for grad school.

It seems he hates himself so much so he feels like treating his body like shit because I guess he feels he deserves it. He literally treats himself like a garbage can. Oh, and he drinks a lot of high-calorie drinks like Bailey's. 

He REFUSES to get psychological help because he thinks psychologists are all con artists who don't know shit - he has zero respect for the profession.

Now for the crux - he is EXTREMELY self-conscious about his weight. He acts like a freaking girl about it. Constantly complaining about being fat. He's not officially overweight yet (he's borderline), because he was so superskinny to begin with, but because he's so small-boned the pounds do not suit him. He's always telling me he's fat and useless and ugly. Whenever I confirm he did gain a lot of weight, he goes crazy and gets even more depressed than he was before - and it lasts DAYS. I find myself acting like a boyfriend, insisting he's not fat and that he's gorgeous the way he is. I still think he's gorgeous even though his belly is hugely unattractive... but I feel like I can't tell him that because he stuck with me even when I was even more overweight than he was when he started dating me so it wouldn't be fair - except I carried my weight in a more attractive fashion - boobs, hips, butt, all the right places, that made me curvy at my best, ""could-lose-ten-pounds"" at my worst, until very recently when I slimmed down big time - whereas he carries his weight ALL on his upper-belly and it looks way worse than when I was overweight....but that's not his fault, so I'm conflicted).

I told him he needs to exercise because of his health. He says ""Yeah.... I really should."" but never actually gets around to it. His classes and lab are all less than 5 minutes walking distance from his dorm, and he does all labs sitting down, so he is almost completely sedentary. Furthermore, he is almost ALWAYS sick with something - flus, fevers, colds, and lots of food-poisoning, probably from all the crappy food he eats.

I've been nothing but kind and supportive but I don't know how to tell him to lose weight without sounding like a hypocritical bitch (since he NEVER told me to slim down when I was fat and told me he loves me and thinks I'm beautiful no matter how much I weight because my inner beauty is all that matters to him). I would never leave him but it breaks my heart to see him deteriorating like this.

I am a student doing a university course exchange. I have a long term boyfriend from back home and our 1.5 year anniversary was in February. I love him very much and we had planned to move to the city together when I got back from my exchange.

However, I have extended my stay abroad as I was recently offered a six month internship with a company I really can't refuse. I will be the country for an additional 7 months in addition to the last 5 months. My boyfriend is supportive and says we will work things out, even though we will no longer be graduating at the same time. 

This is where things get complicated. I recently met this really great local guy and made friends with him easily. He has taken me around to several of the local gay bars and been my private kind of tour guide. One night we got pretty drunk and I went home with him. Of course we slept together and since then have become rather romantically involved. This has been going on for about a month now. He is aware of my attachement and is always calling me out on it. 

I realize what I'm doing isn't fair to either party. I can't commit myself to my local man and I can't keep my boy at home waiting while I am having an affair. I really just want to make a fair decision that I can live with and be happy with. 

I want to take a break from my long term boyfriend and spend time with my local man but I am worried this is a wrong decision as my local man just got a job offer in which he could potentially be leaving the country anywhere from 2 months to 6 months.


**Possible Decisions:**

Break up with boyfriend, Date Local for up to 6 months
*cons included breaking local boys heart, local lives earlier than expected, ruined relationship with boyf.*

Date both men
*cons include feeling incredibly guilty about being a player, take all lose all scenario*

Stop seeing local man
*cons include being in a long distance relationship for a year, uncertain future with boyf upon return, lose best friend abroad (local man)*

**I am just  looking for ""what would you do sort of advice."" I don't need anyone judging me for my life choices. I have to live with them not you. Thanks for your opinion.**

Also, does anyone know of a place that would be willing to hire me after about two weeks or so? Or at least give me an interview? I've got 6 years of experience at data entry, 1 month of cashiering and I've been remodeling my entire life. Both the data entry and cashier positions were internships.

... And the last. Is there any assistance I can get? I already have food stamps and applied for TANF, though I won't get it until baby is born. I have enough supplies to last me the first month or two, if not longer, and I have WIC.

I won't adopt out my child (the foster care/adoption system here sucks). I'm due on the 28th of this month (April), though they said they could be a week or two off.

So with this vague info, what would you all suggest as solid/excellent/standout internships or volunteer experience (especially this summer, I'm relatively free)? Where, who, when, what? I know research is great, and volunteering at mental hospitals, but that's about it. Specifics and much more information would be really really helpful- I've googled this stuff but I thought I'd best ask the experts.

I'll throw in that I'm also interested in policy and international relations, so something related to those and psych would be phenomenal, but definitely not expected! (Would experience in those fields be favorable or unfavorable to a psych grad school)?

I'd love to hear all your advice and experiences too, psych kids (and any one else who wants to share)! A comment or PM would be great. A huge thank you in advance! :)"

I'm glad I stumbled on this subreddit, perhaps I've found some like minded people. This summer I have a wonderful internship programming, so I'm going to spend all of my days programming. It's a start up and those could be long days. My plan is to leave my laptop at the office and not even have a computer at home anymore.
For me it's about forcing some boredom into your life. With the Internet and TV I feel hyper stimulated all the time. To find entertainment I merely collapse into my chair, click a few buttons, and begin passively consuming.


Without something neurotically occupying my attention (ie internet) I quickly become bored. When bored I then proceed to think through everything I could possibly do, prioritize the ideas, and choose one to act upon. Even if I end up watching a television show the important thing is that I chose to watch that specific show rather than passively accepting whatever was being played at the time. I have not had TV in a long time, so that's not a problem, but whenever I've momentarily had no internet I find I eat better, exercise more, have a cleaner house, and knock more things off of my to do lists.


So this is my summer project. Does anyone have any similar plans? I'd love to use this subreddit for updates and progress updates. I will probably have to go to the library to access Reddit so I'll write my posts before hand. Maybe we can make some collective goals? I have books I want to read, cafes I want to lounge at, friends I want to connect with, and more.


I'd love to hear your summer plans below:"

Hi everyone, I'm fortunate enough to attend a school with a media planning concentration, but it's in a college city where internships with reputable agencies are competitive and hard to score. I've talked to  a few recruiters who tell me that one of the best ways to stand out is to have a portfolio with work samples and experience... so I thought I'd take a shot at making one. 

Although it isn't a required assignment, my professor gave us a few guidelines as a platform from which to jump, but they were skeletal.

Things I realize...
It's not pretty. Design is not my thing and I'm not trying to pretend that it is. Is that going to hurt me?
It's new, and does not have enough content...but does it have spaces for all the content that's supposed to go on it? (resume, work samples, blog...what else am I missing?)

Questions I have...
Is it professional enough?
Is it too wordy?
Is this appropriate for the landing page, or should it be the blog page I update with posts?
Is this enough of a work in progress to send out to agencies I'm applying to?
Do I have enough work samples?
Am I missing anything?
Should I make a new page for my statement of purpose? I was thinking of making that ""home"" and making the current home page,  ""about me"" a new page entirely.

I promise I'm not fishing, I just need feedback from someone other than my professors or advisors who tend to cheer-lead just a tad, ha. It's much appreciated and I'd be happy to reciprocate!

[And if there's a better subreddit for posts like this (or if there's interest in creating one...) let me know!]

Thanks :)"

I found that housing at College Park is very affordable compared to Bethesda.

Before I start start to look into all the housing options of College Park, I just wanted some tips, or descriptions of different options (off campus, on campus, average rent per month).  I don't mind if it's not too close to the campus, because I am not a student there and will be commuting to work, but I definitely want to live in a college student atmosphere.  I will most likely try to take advantage of the location and go to events and the library at the school (if I am allowed to).

",CO_Coleslaw,eldertrees,https://www.reddit.com/r/eldertrees/comments/snm1p/need_some_advice/,"Hey Elderents,

I'm in need of a little bit of advice from those older and wiser than myself. I am about to finish my sophomore year in college and due to being unable to find an internship or afford summer school, I will be moving back home for the summer to work. I am from and also go to college in Colorado and I decided to get a medical card before going home for the summer and have been trying to figure out what I should do when I get home. My mom and I have talked in the past about marijuana (not about usage particularly, more just general talk) and I have never admitted to smoking but I have made it clear that I am not against it and my mom seems fully supportive of that. My current plan is to find time to talk to her as soon as appropriate when I get home and tell her I got a medical card (which I believe she will fully support due to my chronic back pain). The reason I want to do this is because 1) I think she will be fully supportive of it, 2) because I don't want to hide my smoking from her, and 3) so that we can talk about guidelines for my use (such as smoking in the house, etc). 

Seems pretty simple, but here's where it gets a little more complicated. My only hesitations for proceeding with this plan is that my mom also happens to be my boss, and I don't know how she would feel if I were smoking regularly while my little sister (about to finish junior year in high school) is around. 

As far as the work situation, my work does have a drug testing policy but it is only implemented if someone suspects you are high/drunk on the job (which I would never do). What I'm worried about is that there may be some conflict between my mom, who I feel would support it, and my boss, who could technically fire me for using marijuana. My mom is generally very good about separating the ""Boss"" mom from the ""Normal"" mom but I just don't know how she would feel about it from a boss' point of view.

As far as my sister goes, she is a pretty good kid as far as I know. I don't think she smokes or drinks or has ever considered it. I plan on hiding my marijuana usage as well as possible from her over the summer but I don't want to be scared to leave my room while high for fear that she will notice.

So what do you think I should do? Tell my mom and see how it goes or just keep it a secret?

TL;DR: Going home for summer, getting medical card. Should I tell my mom or not?

I'll start with the good changes: 

* rock-hard boners, and my penis seems bigger now than 1 month ago

* an overall healthier feeling (more stamina, better muscle health - feels as if i can feel and use my muscles better)

* and yes, more confidence.. since I started I managed to talk to 2 really cute baristas and got their numbers, and apparently I'm having an effect on one of our interns (3 female interns.. it's heaven for a chem lab)

bad changes: 

**mental fatigue and stress**; I can't sleep well, I have very stressful dreams, sometimes I wake up crying. when I wake up I feel completely exhausted, and I need about 2 hours to gather the required energy. I've been warned that this might be (the start of) a mild depression, however I have no depressive thoughts or behavior. 

**always horny** as if this is news for nofappers.. but it's bothering me at work.

**uncommon sexual urges** the 2nd week was very weird for me.. I had slight homosexual tendencies (and I'm the straightest man I know), as in thinking how it would feel to have things up my ass; showers started to be uncomfortable.. I considered this as a mechanism of my brain to satisfy sexual needs. this phase lasted about 3 days.

I am happy to see such physical changes, but I must say that the mental issues have a stronger impact: I'm tired a lot, have difficulty focusing, bad sleep, my memory got a bit worse..  it feels as if things are worse than before, or maybe they are the same and I feel them stronger..

however, I do have a thyroid issue, which I suppose nofapping made worse (hormones disorder and whatnot I think).. it's my only explanation so far..

oh well, here's to hoping things get better \o/"

First, I really do like the company. I actually declined another (paid) offer because of the potential of working at the company even though it's unpaid. But I do have a few more interviews and other companies I'm waiting on. 

I don't want to seem disinterested or have them rescind the offer. And I understand that the company needs to know ASAP (they want me to start mid May). How do I ask for a week to think it over? Or should I just accept them and be happy about it? "

I am currently enrolled in a top-50 MBA program attending part-time, expected graduation is Dec 2014... or May 2015 if I need a semester off/have a light semester at some point. I have no issue working full-time or overtime, as needed...only limitation is extended travel, as I need to attend classes.

I was hoping my current company would develop me as a Project Manager, after being accepted into school, and I could stay here (I don't want to be a design engineer anymore, they know that)...but they're not doing anything like that at all.

After 4 months of pleading with them, I'm now secretly looking at getting a new job, but I don't know where to start. I want to focus on the business industry...like business consulting (i.e., BCG, McKinsey) or mgmt trainee positions in finance/marketing/etc. at other companies (which I've found everywhere from AT&amp;T to Waste Management)

Does this seem like a logical step? Or are there other types of jobs I could be looking at...honestly my problem is that everytime I go to indeed.com or something i don't even know what to type in the search bar!!

My only thought is that I am just about to complete my first semester of my MBA, and maybe I should get a full year of coursework under my belt before looking...but I figured it wouldn't hurt to see if i get any bites now....I just don't know what to use for bait.

Any assitance/direction would be helpful. Even if perhaps I need to take a look at my resume...which is very engineering heavy. Also, if it's relevant, I do live in a major US metro area.

Thanks!

**TL;DR** Civil engineer with 2+ yrs experience, recently enrolled in top-50 MBA program trying to change career into business, need help with how to search for a new job"

sqepu,2,2012-04-24,"Getting ""fired"" from my internship... any idea what should I say to my boss to leave on best terms?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/sqepu/getting_fired_from_my_internship_any_idea_what/,"**Background**

For the past year I've been dealing with serious family issues. I started going to therapy and was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, ADHD and PTSD. I've been having a hard time going through therapy/medications, so I took the Spring semester off of school, got a job and tried to relax a bit. But-- I flaked out on this internship I had that I'd done pretty good work for in the Fall. My boss was understanding, but I always felt bad that I couldn't do as good of a job as I would have liked. 

I asked if I could come back and he said yes, and I thought I was doing pretty well. I started back in March and I've not once been late, have done everything they've asked of me to pretty high standards and only took this past Friday off because I was adjusting my meds and wasn't able to sleep. I got an e-mail today from my boss that said I was doing good work but my reliability left ""something to be desired,"" and I'm not a good fit for the position. 

I could say the same thing about my boss and his coworkers, though. They're always leaving early, never get back to me when I e-mail with questions about what I'm working on, and spend most of their work day talking shit on all the other non-profits in our city, eating lunch and getting coffee. They're always complaining about other interns and everyone they work with, the board, this, that and the other thing. They've had me start projects, given me no deadline, and then told me that the ""ship has sailed"" on said projects once I've finished on multiple occasions. 

That really sucks because I have actual school work to finish. Overall, I can see how I could have done things differently in some situations-- but I've felt disrespected as an intern there. Part of the reason I wanted to come back was to do damage control on the inevitable shit they will talk on me as I try to make a career in my city. That's probably not that important, but it was definitely a huge factor. I also figured since I'll be a senior in college this upcoming year and it'd be beneficial if they'd be a good reference for future internships of jobs. 


**My question...**

So, my boss wants to ""talk"" tomorrow-- code for firing me. I obviously resent the fact that I did the best I could with the amount of support they provided. I was just wondering whether or not I should bring that up at all, and if so, what the best way to do it would be? Is it possible to leave my boss with a good impression of me despite my lack of reliability, which was certainly an issue in the Fall, but which I didn't think was such a problem this Spring? I'm a little embarrassed to even go in tomorrow just to be let go. Any wisdom for me, Reddit?? 

**TL;DR  Is there any way to use tomorrow's meeting with my boss, who is probably gonna fire me (because I'm unreliable), to my advantage?**"

Now I am at another  contract at another Pharma company, over the past 4 years I've had various contract roles catered specially to migrations in MOSS 2003/2007 from 2003 to 2007 or from another file managing system to MOSS migrating files manually. I've also gotten more into creating subsites, doc libraries, lists, changing views, adding web parts, creating permissions groups and adding in people and most recently just started learning Infopath and creating data connections to SP.  I guess you could call it basic MOSS configuration??

I swear to God, it took me 3 months of trying to download Chris Jericho to finally succeed in doing so. My next attempt is to get that sweet Lord Tensai, but by the time I get him downloaded the gimmick will probably be dead. Fix this, or stop advertising all these awesome CAWs scrolling by my screen on the main menu.

#2 - You fix this fucking pin system and you fix it now. This piece of shit is the dumbest system ever implemented. How could anyone approve this? Do you test your games? Apparently, nobody in your almost out-of-business company has nephews, because playing this game with a couple 10 year olds will  prove to you how fucking dumb this pin system is. Guess what they do when they are getting pinned? They press all the buttons like a wild man. I show them how to use the kick out system and they don't even understand. One of them got the hang of it and only managed to kick out ONCE. FUCKING ONCE. Don't tell me I don't know how to use it, because I fucking diddly do. I can use it to kick out, it still sucks. The pin system should appear right when the guy's skin touches yours (AW YEA!), not when the ref counts 1. STUPID STUPID STUPID.

Do you know how annoying it is, having to wait until the referee starts to count 1 before the graphics even appear on the screen? Kicking out is a frantic thing to do, nobody wants to slow down and play some goofy ass mini game. Fix this shit.

#3 (but not really that important) - Your models this year looked like Herpa-Derp the Third. Do interns make your character models? I can forgive the graphics, because you DID manage to make the game's replay value FUN again... and I feel like the AI was well done this year.

That's all I'm going into. I feel like WWE '12 was the best WWE game in the SmackDown Series and the revamps they made were great but#1 and #2 need to be fucking fixed. Still doesn't top WWE All Stars as the best engine THQ/Yukes has put out though. You put realistic physics and graphics on that game and you would have something magical.

Please feel free to continue posting suggestions for WWE '13. Swearing encouraged."

**BACKGROUND** I am about to graduate from the University of Maryland in less than a month, with a degree in Government and Politics (* UMD's Political Science major). Before I get chastised for picking a liberal arts major, I justified my decision for two significant reasons:

* Politics and government are my true passion, and the one subject that I never seem to get bored with.
* I had a number of significant high school (student school board member, state legislative page) and college internships with federal(USDOT), state (MD House of Delegates, [CAPC](capc.umd.edu)) and local government (Rent Control Board Member, City Council Liaison). 

My GPA is a bit embarrassing, at a solid 2.86. Throughout college I have consistently worked a part-time job, struggled with severe depression, worked as an RA, and was elected to student government. Additionally I see a therapist weekly for depression/anxiety issues, and I am currently taking 10mg Adderall three times daily.
****
**CURRENT PROBLEMS**

* No employment prospects
* Overbearing parents
* Can't maintain enough savings from part-time income.
* insatiable desire to run for public office, or be involved in public service.
****
**PERSONAL SKILLS**

* I am quick to read and understand people, and am quick to empathize/relate to other people's problems.
* Good debater/public speaker (can improvise speeches off the top of my head).
* I can learn really quick, and I research everything - wasting many hour scouring wikipedia for no reason.
* I'm relatively proficient with PCs and widely-used office software.
* I love meeting people and being on the move. I would be miserable at a desk job/cubicle job. 
* I have a strong work ethic when I enjoy what I do, but I am terribly lazy when I am bored or uninterested in the work. 
* I can explain complicated and inter-related concepts in layman's terms. I've been told I would be a good teacher.
* I like to think I write well, and I weirdly obsess over orderliness despite the fact that my home life is messy (laundry, dishes, etc.) 
****
MY PROBLEM: I am interested in pursuing more education - particularly law school or a MPA/MBA. Though I am almost positive that my GPA and college performance makes this unrealistic. I don't really care if I make a massive salary - I'm more interested in finding a career that I am passionate about, that won't be hindered by my ADHD.
****
TL;DR I am an anxiety-ridden ADHD graduating college senior who has a mediocre GPA but aspires to be a successful and happy. Please ask questions!

spogo,1,2012-04-24,random thoughts,throwaway2345645,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/spogo/random_thoughts/,"I'm 21, on my last year of uni, doing the last projects I'm going to do and waiting for an internship opportunity to come up.

Last year I got into a massive depression that almost ended the already fragile friendship I had with a couple of classmates, who are the only people I have ever met who I could remotely consider friends.

I went to a doctor who sent me to another doctor who sent me to a psychiatrist who send me to a pshycologist and I have been taking first sertraline and then anafranil for the best part of a year.

My mood has been somewhat better, but I still felt like shit in the inside. A couple weeks ago my pshycologist told me she would be leaving the center where I see her and she would be replaced by someone I don't know. This came after visit upon visit of talking more about my OCD problems than my emotional problems. To her it is as if after being diagnosed with OCD everything had to do with that.

I'm emotionally unstable, I'm jealous of other people's habilities to make friends and communicate with other people and I can't stop thinking about the fact that I can't achieve that, that the couple people I had a friendship in class meant much more to me than I to them, I'm just another person in their collection of contacts and friends and people they can be with.

I've got no personality, no treats that make me special. I've been told I'm a good student pretty much all my life and I focused on being a good student because it is the only thing I knew I could do, but I can't do it anymore. I'm tired of feeling nothing, of working for the sake of working, of feeling alone, of not achievieng anything...

My days consist of waking up, eating and then spending the rest of the day in bed because I have nothing else to do, I don't feel like doing anything, I have no one to talk to, no one to share anything with and the only thing that has any meaning in my life is the two projects that I have to do for uni and that I hate and that I'm not able to do properly for god knows what reason.

I'm sick of feeling nothing but a void inside me. I feel useless, I can't do anything that I thought I was remotely good at before, I have no motivations, I'm growing older every day and every day I feel worse, more alone and further away from the life that I would like to have lived.

I stopped taking the anafranil, I stopped going to my therapist, I stopped caring for the work I have to do and for everyone I have to do it with. I have had suicidal thoughts for months, before, during and after the depression I had last year and the visits I had with doctors and more doctors.

The only thing that scares me is pain. I think about overdosing but I have nothing but diazepan that could do anything to me, and the ammount I need is not available. I think about cutting my veins, but fear it for it being to painful. I think about taking cyanide, rat poison or whatever the fuck I know would work, but I fear not taking enough or taking too much would fuck me up instead of killing me. I think of jumping off the highest building I have access to, but couldn't make myself jump after the two times I have tried. I think of cutting whatever other veins or artheries there are in my body that could make me bleed to death as fast as possible. I think of shooting myself in the head, but I have no weapons available, so I think of stealing one from wherever maybe a hunter in the forest. I think about drowning, about jumping in front of a car, a train, the metro.

Every day of my life I think about the lack of meaning or significance it has. Fuck a family that I don't like, fuck the people who say that care but do not care. I'm alone and I can't share anything. I'm feeling less and less able each day. My life is a failure and I can't see myself achieving any of the things I thought were possible when I was younger. I have no motivations to live and I live every day waiting for it to end because there is no joy in any moment of it for me."

I had some sad news today. I was turned down for an internship that I applied for, an internship which was amazing, well-paid, and in a fantastic city. It was exactly what I want to do, and I would have been great at it; I almost want to say I was perfect for it, minus a bit of experience...

What I really want is some advice on dealing with the odd cognitive-dissonance I'm having about not getting it, and the blow it's dealt to my self-esteem, oddly. Has anyone else dealt with this kind of thing? 

I know economy is shitty and I know that whoever they chose is super awesome and probably has more experience than me, and they had tons of applicants, but saying those things doesn't make me any less sad. And I've been doubting my own abilities, that I actually *would* have been good at it, or am good at anything. If I can't even get an internship I would have rocked and loved like my first-born child, how am I supposed to get anything else?

So a little back story first. To start off, I'm 18 years old. Since my freshman year in high school, I concurrently went to a community college, taking 11 units every semester eventually getting an AA. I haven’t had a break since the transitioning summer of freshman to sophomore. I did an internship my sophomore and junior summer and took summer classes after I graduated to get a little ahead. Now that I graduated, I'm attending college but I'm seriously burnt out. Last semester I got mediocre grades and this semester it’s pretty much the same. I really want to get at least B's in my classes but I'm finding it to be very difficult to do so. I took classes in Biotechnology in high school, I took enough to receive a certificate in it from the community college, and since I found that really fun and interesting I decided to major in it. However, in order to get my bachelors and eventually masters, I need to take Chemistry, Physics, Math, etc. As most of you may know these classes are demanding and require a lot of time devoted to them. These classes just aren't as interesting to me as Biology, which is another reason why I'm not doing so well with grades at the moment. 
	
During the summer I was hoping to get a lot of stuff out of my system and just take it easy. I was planning to return to school in the fall but not as a full time student and get a part time job. That way I can still go to school, have some extra money and not over work myself. Come spring and I will be a full time student, mind rested and hopefully be in the game and seriously study and what have you. Having said that, my mother doesn’t think I should do that. She wants me to stay a full time student and hurry up and graduate. I live close to my college so I still live with her. Since I’m a full time student right now, we made a deal that I don’t have to pay rent and other expenses. I also still get her benefits from her job. This however is only if I stay as a full time student. I told her of my plan and she gave me a lecture about how as soon as I get a job I will quite school and end up nowhere. Her benefits won’t benefit me anymore and I will have to pay rent, my own food, cell phone, and other stuff. *Note*, she is an immigrant who only went up to the sixth grade in Guatemala. She has worked hard and I understand what she getting at but she doesn’t know how stressful college can be. I don’t plan on fully quitting college, just taking it slow for now. 
	
I was also thinking of joining the reserves mostly for the benefits they offer. I went to talk to a recruiter but I felt like he was just telling me stuff I wanted to hear so I can join as soon as possible. Maybe someone can help me out with this as well. 
	
Thanks for reading. Can you give some advice on whether I should stay as a full time student and just soldier on or if I should follow my plan to take it easy for a semester or two?

**TL; DR**: I’m stressed from school and want to take it easy for a semester or two, mom thinks taking it easy will be a bad idea resulting in me never graduating and making me a failure. What should I do?

spjrj,2,2012-04-24,Career choices for an accountant without a designation? (Canada),terminal_loss,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/spjrj/career_choices_for_an_accountant_without_a/,"**tl;dr what kind of good jobs are there for people who have an accounting degree but don't want to move on to getting a designation?**

First post, probably over-explaining issues specific to Canada because this subreddit seems rather US-centric.

23-year-old articling student from BC.  I'm halfway through CASB (the CA program in Western Canada), and having serious doubts about whether I want to continue.  I did an internship at a local firm during my last year of university and got hired full-time after graduation.  I've been working there ever since while taking CASB modules.  I decided to pursue the CA designation for rather silly reasons like perceived prestige over the CGAs and CMAs, and because the CA program puts a strong emphasis on developing auditing skills, which interested me at the time.

I'm slowly realizing there is nothing I like about public accounting.  I'm not motivated by the prospect of hitting the fast track to partner and getting tons of money; I'm satisfied with my current salary.  I hate the hours; the amount of vacation I get in the summer doesn't outweigh the misery of tax season.  I'm questioning the wisdom of specializing in auditing and public practice issues now that simply becoming a senior has caused a full relapse of all the social anxiety issues I've spent the last three years trying to improve.  Every morning there is a significant chance that I will wake up and every fibre of my being will be screaming ""this is wrong, this is a mistake, get out while you can"".  Some days it gets so bad that I have to call in sick because I can't bear the thought of going to work.  The other day I was joking with one of my friends, ""One more week of depression!"" (yay tax season) He asked me, ""Do you think you'll stop being depressed in May?""  I realized I didn't have an answer for him.

Over the past couple years, what I've noticed is that I'm happiest doing the simple tasks, like compilations, bookkeeping and basic tax work.  Even though I hate auditing and public accounting, I would love to be the person the auditors have to talk to.  I'd love to be a controller or even just a bookkeeper.  Around here you barely need a degree to do that kind of work, let alone a designation.  I keep telling myself that I need to complete my CA because I'm in too deep now, but do I want or need to go that deep if I just want to be a bookkeeper or work in industry?  Am I just subscribing to the sunk cost fallacy?

Thanks to anyone who read all this."

I may continue to quit if I feel that the sober life has more to offer than being high 24/7. I have been a daily smoker for ~3.5 years.


So this past weekend I was with MANY friends that were smoking while I was around. I tried not to make it a big deal that I was quitting for however long it may be, but just said no thanks when offered. It actually felt kind of good being the only one around that wasn't high because I could really look around and see that most of these people just sat around and watched the world go by, I on the other hand wanted to experience it! On the flip side of things I was pretty envious that they were toking it up, and I actually still enjoyed being in the atmosphere of smoking even if I wasn't hitting it myself. In the end, I refrained from smoking and I feel like this is my greatest challenge that I have faced yet.


Here is how I have been feeling lately:
1. The not-smoking headaches are completely GONE! Thank god, they were getting very annoying!
2. My head continues to get less blurry. I still notice random instances where I just totally zone out or feel a little ""after high"" kick in.
3. My cravings aren't as strong, but not a day goes by where I don't think about smoking.
4. Sleep schedule is back to normal, but appetite still doesn't feel completely normal. I still have to force myself to eat on certain occasions.


I hope my experience motivates others to continue on their journey!
I will continue to check in every 2-3 days.
Stay sober!

Everything is set to display for those objects in the settings you see in the link. I only have the nose screenshot of the attributes but it is the same for his hair. [LINK](http://imgur.com/a/kZDLc)

They are Nurbs and even when I did convert to Polys and parented under the same place, it will only render maya software and not mental ray. But when it is not parented, it renders mental ray just fine.

I have a feeling that it has something to do with the parenting system that it is not allowing it to be rendered for some odd reason. I am parenting to one of the joints in the head so that it follows the animation around correctly.

Any tips?

Thanks everyone.

**Edit :** Ok, after reading all the comment, I realised that you have some good points. I was really thinking that buying a house instead of renting was a good solution but you have proven me wrong.

So, my next question would be : What is the best way to go from living with parents to living with your wife/girlfriend?

**My short to middle plan looks like this :** Right now, I still have 6 classes and 1 internship to finish before my college ends. I got my boss' word that I will get hired at the company where I am doing my internship. 

I am currently saving about 80-85% of my money. My girlfriend and I are trying to save up to 60k before we move in together.

Once we have 60k, we are going to try to find a small appartment in repentigny at a low cost (300-500ish a month). We will keep on trying to put money aside until we have 100k, and then we will buy a house.

Is that a better plan?

This will let us : 1) see how it is going living together 2) buy most of the stuff we will need in a house

Does that make sense?

I still require one more year to graduate and would like some suggestions as to what the best plan of action is for me to do during this time frame.

If I am suspended, it would be for the upcoming Fall semester and not affect my current student status. I have already obtained an internship for this summer, and if I perform well, may receive a job offer for when I graduate.

Now if I do get suspended, I will not be able to go back to school after my summer internship. If my internship goes well, would it be an option to ask if I could extend my internship throughout Fall as well? Would it be a bad idea to tell my supervisor I could work longer because of my suspension? 

I wanted to get an idea if this is an option, or if it would be better for me to just finish my summer internship and apply elsewhere for opportunities until I finish my degree, and potentially go back for full time.

Once I was even told to keep it on the ""down-low"" as if it was some kind of secret.  The only explanation given was that ""the division head is working on it.""  What does that mean??

I don't know if my ego is just too large, but it feels like opportunity is being pulled away from me.  With the energy work, I am in contact with the highest managers on-site and trying to bridge the gap between PM, capital shortages, and energy savings plant-wide.  With manufacturing, I'm working on a very small footprint of a small building, in contact with middle management, and will be spending a considerable amount of time as process support; doing the same job that non-engineers do, and not using any of my math or engineering skills.  I'm also afraid they'll use that as an excuse to low-ball any offer they give me.

Does manufacturing engineering have good prospects for advancement?  Will I be wasting my ME skill set and putting myself at risk of stagnation?  I don't understand non-desk jobs and it has me freaked out, clearly.

Thank you to anyone who reads all of this and replies.  I really appreciate your advice because this has kept me stressed out much more than I need in my final semester.  I have spent a lot of time talking about energy efficiency in this forum, so I'm not just a lurker hoping to take advantage of your kindness.  I do appreciate it.

sp4gi,7,2012-04-23,Advertising/Marketing professional looking to get into healthcare - am I making the right decision? Help me think this out? (x-post from askreddit),makinmoneysothrowawa,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/sp4gi/advertisingmarketing_professional_looking_to_get/,"Realized that maybe this is the proper place to post something like this.

I work for a company doing marketing project management. It was my first job after college. Got an internship at 24 then went full time shortly afterwards. After I hit June I'll be at the company for a year, and I can already tell this isn't going to be something I can spend the rest of my life doing. My company recently became a 24/7 company and I work (within the confines of the company) about 60-70 hours a week (not counting driving) and I'm required to respond to calls/texts/emails on weekends. I've had to cancel trips home to see my family, vacations, and constantly reschedule my weekends and time after work because my boss will randomly have me do stuff on weekends. There's no work life balance. Had no real desire to get into marketing anyway, it's just something I fell into. Although I understand that all this is pretty common in advertising... I don't even get paid that well for the hours (less than 40k). I also don't get very much time at all for my own hobbies, because I'm exhausted at the end of the day or my job sucks my free time from me.

I'd really like to get into healthcare. Not for the money (there's a ton of money in advertising, I could suck it up and make tons in this), and not for the prestige (because I really don't care). I'd be doing it primarily to help people and because I enjoy analytical thinking. Though I understand switching industries is a pain in the arse and once you leave you can't turn back. Ultimately I'd like to become a physician assistant.

A common entry level job is a PCA/PCT at a hospital. I have hospital food service and urgent care reception experience, but no clinical. I just recently got my phlebotomy certificate, but I don't have my CNA yet. I'm not at all averse to hard work, as I worked over 100+ hours / week on a cherry farm and also doing hospital food service. As long as the work paid off in terms of advancement, I wouldn't care.

Some fears/reservations I have:
----
-- I won't be employable in a hospital. I can see HR going ""LOL you've got a BA from Penn State and professional experience and you want to be a nurse aid? Wow overqualified. NEXT.""

-- That I haven't given marketing a chance. I've never in my entire life wanted to get into advertising. But I'm in it now and many people are struggling to find jobs. If I leave this place it's going to be hard/impossible to get back.

-- That I should stay here longer to save and pay off student loans. I've got about 30k in student loans. I'll have about $10k saved up in an emergency fund before I leave/start looking for jobs as a cushion.

-- If I get into PA school I won't get good ROI afterwards. I want to do this to help people and other reasons, but I also don't want to bury myself in student debt and not be able to pay it off my entire life.

-- That the market will be saturated with PA's in 3-4 years.

-- That most everyone hates their job anyway and I should just suck it up and deal with the job I have.

**TLDR** I'd like to switch careers from advertising/marketing to healthcare to help people and have more person-person interactions healthcare/physician assistant but have some reservations (see above).

Thanks in advance.

sp44q,0,2012-04-23,How far does a 3.3 gpa take you (business degree)?,hungrycats23,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/sp44q/how_far_does_a_33_gpa_take_you_business_degree/,"Well to be honest my CGPA is alot lower than that but the last two semesters before this one I was doing pretty well had a 3.1 and 3.6. That was my third year. I was away on an 8 month internship and am back in school to do my last two semesters and it seems like this semester may not be that great. 

I decided to take 6 courses instead of 5 and that will bite me in the ass as the class I decided not to drop was my toughest final and I'm sure I'll end up with a 60 in that class at best; potentially 50's. My finance course an exam I went into with a 90 I somehow received a 71 in the course (not sure wtf happened; there could have been a mistake on the final as I dont think I got a 52% on the exam - I will have to look into it but for now I'll assume I did do bad)

The other four courses, one is a pass/fail class and the other ones I'm guessing I will get 80's and high 70's in. My guess at my GPA for this semester is a 2.8 to 2.9 at best. More likely 2.9.

Thing is after this semester I'll be done my toughest courses and I think I can once again get a 3.6-3.7 gpa; which would raise my 4th year average to a 3.3.

Here in Canada when applying to MBA schools they look at your GPA from your final two years and if I have an average of 3.3; would that be enough to get in to a decent school and what would employers think?

I've got fairly decent experience through my internships and do intend to get an accounting designation (CMA) but for the time being when I do graduate will be considered average or above average? 

If the school you went to means anything, I went to a fairly reputable one and will graduate with a business degree with a major in accounting. 

**TL;DR**: Will be graduating with a final two year GPA average of roughly 3.3 from a Canadian university with a bachelors degree in business. I also have 12 months of internship experience. How impressive will I be out in the real world **and** when I apply to various schools to do my MBA?"

It was cumbersome having this bulky splitter taped to my tripod but it got the job done. 

I am graduating next semester and will no longer have access to the microphone. I use Magic Lantern Software with my T2i and the Microphone Quality is Amazing. I shot a video for my intern boss a few months ago and you can hear the quality here:

So I have a drug test coming up next monday. by monday, I will have been clean for 45 days. I'm 5'7 190 lbs, slightly heavy set but I do run half marathons. I've been doing a lot of cardio (running almost 12 miles a week) and working out on non running day. prior to this, I was smoking about once a day, with a few off days of not smoking here and there

I know its a urine test, so now Im wondering if there's any last minute preparations I can take before monday. I bought some test strips off amazon, and i failed it last week, gonna try another tonight. I havent been able to find anyone who can be my control test (don't know many non-ents), and this result has me slightly worried. Are there any detox drinks or any other things I can use to help clean my body of the THC?

Also, I've been taking 3 b-complex vitamins a day, and I know I'm getting the test at Labcorp. If anyone had any information to share it would be greatly appreciated, as I really need this internship. Thanks!

Edit: I ended up passing the strip test I got off Amazon, so I'm pretty confident I passed the less strenuous test LabCorp does. took me 5 weeks before I was completely clean enough to pass the strips, but I heard those strips are very sensitive so it may take a shorter amount of time "

Also wondering whats good to do in that area (Bunkyo and surrounding areas). I'm particularly interested in good music venues and entertainment places because I'm striving to be involved in the Japanese music industry after I graduate.

**Some background on me:**

I'll be graduating next December from GW with a degree in Political Communication. I'm thinking about pursuing a master's in Political Management or Public Relations, but considering it's a big decision, I thought I'd take a shot at finding a job first. I've even heard about some firms offering to pay for a master's education, so I thought I'd look into this.

I have tried to have a relevant internship every semester of my schooling. I interned in the Hart Senate building my freshman year (even got to go to the President's first SOTU), interned for a K-Street PAC my sophomore year, went abroad earlier this year, and just finished interning for a DC Council candidate.

**What I'm looking for:**

I'm not sure exactly what I want to do, but I am obsessed with politics. I'd love to some day be a campaign manager, and this summer I am leaving DC to work for a Senatorial campaign. However, my candidate is not likely to win, I am unsure how to enter this field and find a job in Washington once I graduate. I suppose I should be looking for an entry-level job for a political consulting or public relations firm?

**My questions:**

What should I be doing between now and the time I graduate?

Where should I be looking for a job, and what can I do to make sure I'm not only employed after graduation, but on track for a lucrative career as a Washington professional?

Any tips or guidance would be appreciated, and I will answer any questions you may have.

Thank you in advance."

He's never made any effort to go back to school. I have to practically force him to take his meds. He lounges around and complains and makes excuses for why he can't go back to school and how everybody and everything is against him. I love going out, but he rarely wants to come. When I do go out without him, he tries to make me feel guilty for doing it.

I believe some of the problem is that for his entire life, his parents have always taken care of him. If he wanted money or a car, they'd always give it to him. I've had to work since I was 14. Now, his parents have been transferred out of state and he wants me to pay for his things when he's not working, but I don't want to be a mother to a grown man.

I've talked to him about all of this before, but when I tell him how I feel, he starts crying and begging me not to leave him. he tells me that I'm the best thing that's ever happened to him and leaving him would destroy him.

I know he's depressed, but I feel that if I stay with him, my career and social life will suffer. I want to be able to go to company functions and be able to work all day on projects without feeling I have to check up on him. I love him, but ultimately, a relationship with him isn't worth more to me than I am to myself and my needs. I also want to just have fun.

Is it wrong to dump him when he's depressed and what's the best way to go about it?

TL;DR boyfriend is depressed and I want to live life and have fun. Is it wrong to dump him and how?"

I just got offered my dream job.  I'm not going to specify, but it is a major defense contractor.  The problem is, they aren't really cool with drug use.  For now, it is just an internship so I only need to do a urine test, but if I get offered the job full time, I will have to go through the process of obtaining security clearance (extensive background check, as well as a polygraph).

Anyways, I have a few questions for you guys.

(1) Have any of you ever obtained a clearance?  I know that I need to quit for good if I am going to get it, but I used to be somewhat of a regular smoker for a few months, so I am terrified of being rejected.

(2) I will have to take a drug test before starting.  I'm pretty sure I have about a month before this happens, but I NEED to be able to pass the urine test.  This is my dream job, and losing it would crush me.  I am about 140 lbs, female, and probably like 5'6"".  Is a month enough time to pee clean?  Is there anything I can do other than extensive exercising to ensure that I am clean?

Thanks guys.  I had to create a throwaway in case during the investigation they check my reddit account (yes, they're that thorough)."

I have asked in /r/frugal if buying a house with my gf was a good idea and I have realised that we should rent first. 

Now, my question is : What are the best way to stay debt free once we leave the parent's house and live in the ""real world""?

1. My car is paid
2. For now, my only expenses are food, phone bill (53$/month which is actually low in canada for my data plan) and my car insurance (75$ a month for full coverage)
3. I just started my 3rd internship at the same company where I now make 36k.
4. My boss told me he will give me another raise after my internship (in 4 months), which will bring me up to minimum 40k.
5. I do not see my gf and I breaking up (we have been dating for 6 and a half year). (I know things will change when we live together but I really hope it will work out good.)
6. I still have 5 classes to finish at college but I will work at the same time (they are evening classes and aren't really important)
7. We have about 20k saved up and are putting 85-90% of our money aside until we have at least 60k before making a move (Either buying a house or renting an apartment)
8. We were thinking about buying an apartment because the renting price are almost as high as a house payment (600-800$/month compared to 900-1100$ a month)

I think that sums it up... I will not take it personal if you guys tell me I am naive and/or ignorant. I just turned 23 years old and would like to know what you guys would do differently if you had the chance to go back to being 23 and starting in the ""real life"".

Thanks."

I'm going to be starting an engineering internship next week and I need some pant advice.

Based on my tour of the work facility, the dress code seems to be on the casual end of business casual (chino's, buttoned-up shirts, polo's, no ties).

I want to keep my look very clean, simple, and consistent:  white or light blue shirts (or patterned combination of the two); light or dark grey, black, or navy blue pants; and accentuated with either brown or black belt and shoes.

I prefer the look of dress pants opposed to chinos but worry it could be too dressy and maybe look weird without ever wearing a jacket (and rarely a tie). 

Could I get away with the following looks? [1](http://i.imgur.com/wAlIl.jpg)  [2](http://i.imgur.com/bUr6q.jpg)   [3](http://i.imgur.com/7qSd8.jpg)

When I was in school and interviewing for jobs, I remember being asked why I wanted to work at the firm I was applying at, and had enough general knowledge about the local firms to get through that question.

My main inquiries are:

* What are good ways to coordinate my cover letter to them, being that I am applying from out of state?
* If asked why I picked that firm, what's a better answer than ""I just found you via the internet and wanted a job?""

Any other help would be greatly appreciated. I've thought about applying to Big4 and other national firms, but I've been lazy to start studying for the CPA and I think since I'm a bit older than the typical college grad, I might have better luck at a local firm."

It's been about a year since I passed my preliminary exams and began research (but still I don't expect to graduate until 2015 plus or minus a year); in January I switched advisers due to complete disenchantment with my previous topic (no bridges burnt), but for a few reasons I'm just unhappy with things right now and want to try to apply around and see if I can't get a nice offer. There are a few details about my resume that I've got questions about given the situation:

1. Presently I've included names of my various research advisers/mentors throughout my academic career; should I not? At the very least my current adviser is a (relatively) well-publicized name, but some sources do seem to suggest excluding all names of any sort apart from my own.
2. Related to 1, I *certainly* don't want my current adviser (or former, or anyone at my school) to be contacted by a recruiter; to that end I included a line at the end stating ""References available upon request."" Again, sources suggested such a line is superfluous and assumed, but I felt that it may deter any calls/contact to the names I have listed before we've actually discussed references. Thoughts?
3. I keep hearing different things about this: should I include GPA? I don't have any experience outside of academic research (and a research-oriented summer internship), and I'll be aiming for industry. All my GPAs since undergrad are quite nice, and because of my format including them isn't wasting vertical space.

Any feedback is appreciated."

**Description**

JOSH DENNY is here, with former intern Shooby and fan Max. We’re drinking spirits and celebrating Friday the 13th. Watch out for spooks and killers out there, kids. We talk about Shooby being late, and how his teeth look like they’re escaping from his mouth. We talk about food trucks and Mexicans, as well as shitty bands. More stupid stuff with Flapper’s Comedy Club. We start a new ongoing new Natasha Leggero reference for anything that sucks. Is milk steak a real thing? Max and Shooby aren’t original and repeat each other’s jokes. How would society start over if almost everyone died? A weird British fan calls in. Our mandatory talk about shit continues. Patrick reads an IM conversation from a fat girl with no sense of humor to one of our fans about Patrick and the show. We talk about why Hitler got a bad reputation for killing too many Jews. We get in to Shooby’s phone and read texts from Tony, a girl who manages High Roller Tattoo in New York, where Shooby recently got a tattoo and Patrick will soon be getting his. Shooby texts likes a man-girl. Domino’s Pizza Hero game for iPad is so addictive and it actually makes their pizza look good.

I had a couple interviews, but was 0/4.

I guess my question is, am I in a position right now that will be valuable in the future? By this I mean is being able to understand 100% of drawings (for buildings and parking lots, roads, etc.) going to find me a new opportunity someday?

I am almost 30, been in my non-engineering but technical field (RF/Circuit) for almost 10 years now where I work out doors with my hands all day and this year after my recent promotion I will be bringing home at least $60k. This includes bonuses, mandatory on-call, and overtime as I am hourly.  I have a guaranteed promotion in January 2013 that will provide a base yearly increase of $4k a year which will obviously bump up my bonus and overtime earnings.  Let's assume after this point that I will have an average wage increase of 4-5% year over year if I stay until retirement.

I looked into engineering because the technical parts of my job are what interest me.  My current job is bleak (in my opinion) because I don't want to be old and physically broken from my current duties.

I am currently going to JC to knock out my pre-reqs for a transfer to a good local engineering UC.  I am still torn between electrical/computer/mechanical engineering but that's where I am leaning. Without boring you with the details, 2018-2019 will be the soonest I will transfer, unless it gets to the point to where I can't work and do the classes I need because they aren't available during non-work hours/days.  Then I might finish JC sooner but also leave my job sooner, a cut in my lifetime earnings.

For the UC I will most likely have to go full time which means leaving my job for those 2 years plus any time finding employment.  I am hopeful though that I can find some paid internships.

So basically looking at 3-5 years or so with cut wages and no growth and starting in a new career in ~10 years at the age of ~40.

I hope to retire no later than 63, so I have 23 years to work as a engineer.

So finally the point to all of this.  My life earnings between now and then between the two jobs, does a move make sense financially (also factoring in school loans for UC potentially) over the rest of my work career based on observable salaries?

If it makes a difference, I would prefer to design/build/test things where I can still work with my hands.  I hear these jobs can pay potentially less because there are more candidates interested in the same or because startups are great for this.

Thanks for making it to the end of my post!"

I may be getting an internship at a major defense contractor for the summer.  While the intership does not require clearance, if I come to work full time next year when I finish my masters I will need to get a secret clearance.  I used to smoke weed relatively frequently for a short period of time (like 2-3 months).  I decided that coachella would be my last time ever smoking.

But anyways, my question is what is the process of getting a secret clearance(like do they polygraph, talk to friends, etc)?  I have been looking around, and can't seem to find it.  I have found several threads on reddit where people have said that pot smoking should not be a problem, but it would comfort me a little more to know exactly what happens.

Thanks!

Edit: Thank you for all the responses.  It helps a lot.  Very comforting to know that secret clearance isn't too big a deal."

Right now i'm in my last semester (with amazing professors) I am running all A's. I think my improvement will look great for me-but at the same time I am looking to work in a well respected hospital in NYC. I'm worried that my grades are going to hold me back from that happening. My sister works at CHONY (NYP Presbyterian Children's Hospital) and I'm praying for some connections through her but all in all I don't know how much connections will really help. I hear that a lot of people don't get a job for 4-6 months-this scares me. My sister got her RN job right when she graduated before she even passed her boards (and this was only 3 or 4 years ago). 
I'm also really nervous for interviews-I'm one of those quiet and sweet kinda girls-not loud and confident-Interviews make me really nervous and I need to learn how to suck it up and be proud of what I've done and exude confidence-if anyone has any tips for me that would be really amazing. 
I also hear that a lot of people get jobs where they interned in btwn the 2 years of nursing school. I did in internship at Bellevue in the Peds ER--&gt;Will that look good for me? My dream is to work at NYP I am just worried about how difficult it may be for that dream to come true-am I way in over my head?

Any advice is welcomed!

Derpette: I'm having trouble with some of my remote drives. [Surprisingly she knows they are not local, this is uncommon knowledge at their company]

Me: Alright, let me look. [I go into their company profile in our PSA system, look up the table we keep of their networked drives, and I go and try to manually reconnect them, but it fails to fix the problem] Hey, Derpette, do you use multiple different computers in the office with your account?

Me: Well, there have been a few people with this issue at [client], so one question: Do you get the same wallpaper when you log into a new computer?

Derpette: Yes... [horror of horrors, I discover that she has a roaming profile and it is borked]

Me: Alright, it seems like your roaming profile [I explain in derp-words] is corrupt, I have to remove it.

Derpette: Ok. Does that mean I need a new email and password? 

Me: No, not at all, but you may lose your internet favorites and the auto-completes. That really isn't a choice though. Also, you need to move your work and your stuff to the network locations because I have to delete the stuff on the machine you are sitting at.

Derpette: Alright, I think I can make it work. I only use the network anyway since I usually share with teams.

su4bk,1,2012-04-26,I've lost it all.,ShooterMentality,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/su4bk/ive_lost_it_all/,"""If I cared what people thought about me, I would commit suicide if I understood what it meant.""

I realized that by the time I was three, I knew that there wasn't any joy to living; I couldn't put the words to describe the feelings. The reason was that I had to go to a school to learn how to talk. I was shy with people, and always pointed at things to get what I want. The school didn't help me that much, except that now I have an unnaturally loud voice that gets into people's faces when I speak. What I should've known was that I couldn't put those thoughts into action, mostly because I didn't understand, nor did I have the capability to do so.

""Every person born is another competitor in this world.""

Elementary school at a young age was no different matter. I didn't make friends because no one liked me for who I am. To most people, I'm a boring person who isn't worth their time in talking to because I was smarter than most of the class. I was put into a gifted class in first grade, but there was nothing that came out of it. I didn't understand why I shouldn't be ahead of others, I finished my exams faster, and got top scores without trying. Boredom set in, and without any friends, I tend to lurk in the corner, trying to go to the library to learn more.

By second grade, I already hated school so much that I wanted to kill the chancellor of the Board of Education, and started plotting ways to kill him. Of course, that didn't come to fruition because I didn't have supreme willpower to execute such a plan. Learning about Columbine helped me see, where in fact they didn't kill enough people. I had to revise my plan now to inflict more damage. I'd estimate at killing 30 people would be sufficient for my plans then. Plus, I had a sparkle of hope thinking that things will be better in the future. 

Third grade was painful to me in a sense that I had to work with another person for the science project. Science projects were awful in the sense that I couldn't create an experiment given what I had; I made up an easy experiment and fixed the results. I never got good grades in future individual projects mostly because I never had the proper tools to begin with.

""If I had to choose between a life where I'd be alone forever with everything I want versus a life with people but have nothing, I would commit suicide the instant that my life was headed towards the latter.""

There was a psychological evaluation for every student by the time I was in fourth grade. I knew about suicide back then, and I wanted to do it, but I still had a glimmer of hope that things will be better. The weekend before the evaluation, I went to the library to read about World War I and World War II, mostly because I was interested in war history and how much carnage the world had created. The nuclear bombs that were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki enthralled me, as they were weapons that could instantly wipe out an entire city.

Of course, my feelings at the time were about being alone in solitude. When I blurted out that statement to the psychologist, he was baffled at that statement. My parents were angry with me because they were called to school and punished me for making those statements. The school enacted a plan with having ""play dates"" with other people in the class. I knew, at that instant that I could never truly express myself ever again for fear of punishment. Later that night, I contemplated on running on the highway or jumping in front of a train to commit suicide. I decided not to only because I had to lie to myself that things were going to be better.

""New challenges and experiences await, except that no one told me that it involved burning bridges.""

One would think that by going to a Junior High School with new people would change my mind on how the people would act. Suffice to say, this made my life even worse as I tried to be myself. More projects that needed to be done, more group work where I had to carry the rest of my group, and I had less interest with hobbies that I used to enjoy. Every morning, I would wake up and have this mental exercise of  saying to myself, ""Why haven't I committed suicide today?"" Eventually, I knew the answer was nothing, and that I was weak because I could not go against the human instinct to live. I need to overcome this in order to be stronger, like all those who committed suicide before me.

High School was different, in the sense that I did get some contact with other people, mostly by not trying to be myself. Sure, I was disgusted with myself for acting this way, but the principle I had in mind was ""use and abuse"" relationships to get what I want. Also, I'd see rampant cheating on exams in order to get into top-tier universities where no one would get caught and punished. Realizing this by my senior year, I needed to come up with a plan to promote justice and equality, but there wasn't  a way to show this.

""One can't start immediately with such a grand goal, one must meticulously plan ahead and see to it come to fruition.""

During the day that the VT shooting came on the air, the reported number of dead was at 32. Now my moving target just pushed higher, and that to make a name for myself, I needed to kill 50. People joked that I would become the next shooter, where I fit perfectly with the shooter's mentality, and looks as well. Luckily, things died down and I didn't act upon my urges. 

Shooter Mentality: This isn't about bullying, or racism that drives these people to commit acts of atrocities. The only things that matter is that they are depressed, and they think that society has effectively rejected them from this world. No one can find out about these people because they are mostly invisible to the rest of us. Most exhibit signs of hostility towards themselves, but unless someone looks at their life closely, one will choose to ignore the signs. The shooters who act are acting out of anger, attempting to fit into a place where they want to belong in this world. This is much easier than accepting that he/she is going to be alone for the rest of their lives, and living their life that way is torture for someone who wants to belong.

""The keystone is alone at the top.""

Of course, people who continuously cheated throughout high school tended to get into better schools, and most of them got into the Ivy Leagues. I felt a slight resentment towards them, but what I should've realized was that I needed to game the system to my benefit. Unfortunately, I learned this lesson too late as I didn't do this at college either.

I chose to go to a state university instead of a few private ones because I would have less debt to pay off in the future.  While this plan worked, I hoped to go with a path of internship-job during my junior-senior year. However, no employer wanted to speak with me even though I had comparable credentials with everybody else. I know this because I looked through other people's resumes to compare myself. Feeling dejected at the prospect of no job coming out of college after applying for 134 applications for jobs and internships, compounded with the Global Recession, I had to realize that I bargained with myself for too long.

""Why do you think almost all literature have a dystopian future? This isn't a coincidence.""

I needed a new reason to continue living after college; that is where cost-benefit analysis comes in.  Selfishness comes into play, and as long as I got the benefit, and having other people pay the cost, I would survive out of spite towards my family. 

After graduating, I started looking for work with companies, going to job fairs, and meeting new people through networking. This has gone on for about a year now, and after applying for 100 positions in-person, and about 800 applications online, I have been soundly rejected at various points in the hiring process, or even worse, not hearing a response. Every day, I look at the news and be disillusioned at what I've become, an abject failure. I've always considered myself as a failure, but this is a new low for myself. Currently, I work part-time self-employed with my investments and odd jobs such as babysitting and tutoring.

Also, I heard that my dad was going to lose his job in a couple of weeks, so now would be a great time to commit suicide, as the cost-benefit analysis is showing that the benefits aren't going to be much anymore. The biggest question is whether I should go out with a bang or a whimper. 

Well, that's it. If I don't get a full-time position in two weeks, then you'll know what choice I made.

stgfe,158,2012-04-26,am I wrong for not wanting to support this endeavor?,feathermay,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/stgfe/am_i_wrong_for_not_wanting_to_support_this/,"Actually, it's more than me not wanting to support it. I am kind of pissed off that someone would have the audacity to do this and I don't know if it is my own personal hangups or if it really is ridiculous.

This girl I know (we are in our early twenties) is trying to raise money so she can go to Africa for some kind of volunteering trip. I think volunteering is awesome and everything but what the fuck, how are you going to ask your friends to raise $6,000 so you can go? What are you thinking? Who do you think you are? She hasn't even made it clear what, exactly, she will be doing in Africa or why. She keeps saying it will be the ""trip of a lifetime"" (her words) which to me implies that she is more excited about traveling to Africa than helping people.

I could use $6,000. I'm pregnant, a teacher, babysitter, and tutor, and in grad school. But I’m not asking all my friends to hep me pay for my life and if I did it would be wrong. but somehow this girl thinks it’s okay to ask people for money so she can have the “trip of a lifetime."" Yes, she will be helping people, but she could just as easily help people here in the United States and not beg her friends and family for money so she can do it.

I think I may be unjustified in my anger over all of this, but to me it isn't even this girl specifically. I think this just shows me how immature people from our generation can be. And on top of that, we grew up in a very affluent area so I see my friends' lives funded and paid for and supported all the time and they don't see anything wrong with asking people for help even though they have never wanted for anything their entire lives. I know someone living in NYC on their parents’ dime with no job just so they can go to shows and write a blog about how awesome and fashionable they are. People with non-paying internships in the city living in fabulous apartments paid for by their parents, going out drinking and clubbing every night and complaining about how hard Mondays are. 27 year olds who still go on “spring break” trips to Cabo. $6,000 “volunteer” trips to africa. It’s disgusting and I want people to grow the FUCK up.

She thinks she is saving the world but really she is paying an organization a ton of money so she can go on a trip and feel good about herself. It’s fucking ridiculous. All of this so she can come back to the U.S. after it is all done and brag about how much of a changed person she is and how much she helped the poor people in Africa. God damned hipsters. If you want to help people, i think that’s wonderful, but asking your friends and family to raise that much money for you to travel somewhere exotic so you can do it is extremely selfish and immature, IMO."
stbc9,5,2012-04-26,"Girlfriend is depressed, how can I help her?",somefunnycomment,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/stbc9/girlfriend_is_depressed_how_can_i_help_her/,"Me (22M) and my SO (19F) have been together for almost three years.

When she was 15, she lost her father to a heart attack which caused her to go into a deep depression (she saw a therapist for that, which worked well). After about 1,5 years she was out of it and that was the time we first met. At that time she was a delightful, spontaneous, enthusiastic girl full of live. We started our ""official"" relationship about 4 months after we first met. Most of the time (I think about 80%) it was perfect. Of course, her growing up (she was only 16 the first time we met) was a cause of some issues, since she doesn't really like the responsibilities and such.

The past couple of months (about 6 months or so) things have started going down hill. She lost her interest in sex (she always wanted to have sex at least each day), lost her lust for life and started building a wall around her. I convinced her to go see a psychologist, which she is keeping up (with me paying part of the bills for that because she doesn't have a lot of money, and I think it's worth it and don't need the money for anything really). At the intake-test for the psychologist she was diagnosed with a pretty deep depression (almost so deep she can't be helped by ordinary psychologists). This, of course, explains the lost interest for sex and lost lust for life.

This depression causes a bit of a strain on our relationship because she wants to be with me all the time. The problem is, I'm a pretty introvert guy and am currently in an internship that demands a lot of my time (I'm away from home from 6:30 AM to 8:15 PM each day) and I need some time of my own, which she doesn't like, of course.

I try to give her all the attention she needs, but I can't give it all since it's extremely tiresome for me. Besides that, I've had a pretty bad case of mono about a year ago and still recovering from the symptoms.

But, after this wall of text comes my main question, how can I help her in other ways? How do I deal with her being depressed? I try to ask her what she feels, but she doesn't know what she feels (which I understand).

**TL;DR**: I (22, guy) have a GF (19, girl) who is in a pretty heavy depression. What can I do to help her?

PS: Important note, we both live with our parents at the moment.

stacm,2,2012-04-26,Making tough decisions,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/stacm/making_tough_decisions/,"Hey /r/jobs this subreddit has been such a help while looking for work and I have to say thank you.

Now I need some help making a decision on where to work and what offers are my best choices. 

Currently, I have an internship opportunity for a company I would love to work for over the summer. Only problem is I'd need to enroll in school to be eligible for the internship which is something I would consider but the costs are concerning.

The next opportunity is a job in another city that is expensive to live in. The salary would be enough to get by but no real room for substantial savings. The job is for a start-up company and I am reluctant because I've worked for one before and it is draining. I emailed a current employee of the company I know through mutual friends to see what they say about the company culture.

And last option is keep looking for work where I am: in a small city living with family. The ability to save money would be highest here although it is also a lot slower to find work and I don't have many connections here.

Any suggestions/advice. Thank you!"
st7ii,15,2012-04-26,[FR] Food truck line.,pethebi,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/st7ii/fr_food_truck_line/,"Hi guys, this is my first FR so sorry if I'm not following specific FR rules or anything, I've only read FRs but couldn't find any links on the sidebar on making FR. I've also recently read the link on not giving girls HB #s anymore, so I'm trying that out right now. It also might be a bit long, so let me know if I put a lot of irrelevant stuff in here too.

So today I went to a weekly food truck festival-type thing where a bunch of food trucks gather. It was raining so most people had umbrellas, and I was standing in line with my roommate behind these 2 girls. Let's call them girl 1 and girl 2. Girl 1 was standing right in front of me in the rain without an umbrella so I spontaneously asked her if she wanted to share my umbrella. She turned around, said something with a smile and we started talking, and I moved my hand towards the middle so that it was pretty much over all 3 of our heads (girl 1, girl 2, me. My roommate had his own umbrella). I found out that it was her first time there (it was my first time  at the one in this city too) and that she moved into the area a year ago working in social media, say it sounds fun, but it's really not. I joke that at least they have a job, I'm still an intern, but that topic quickly died. As I was talking to girl 1, I saw three friends who I was supposed to meet up with walk up behind the girls and I waved at them, and then continued talking to girl 1 about other stuff I don't remember.

At some point she mentions that girl 2 was a coworker and also a bartender. I instantly tell her that my roommate was DJ and they hit it off pretty well. While they were talking, I realize that my friends had disappeared, and I start looking around for them while she talks every once in a while. Eventually, I find out that she used to live in the city where I work, so I start talking to her about where to find places to live around there. 

Eventually, we get to the front of the line and I ask my roommate what he's getting, if he wants to get 2 things and share it. The girls turn around to look at the menu. My roommate mentions some coke grilled food on the menu, and girl 1 turns around again to talk about it, saying how it should be good and stuff. But then after they ordered they just walk away and leave without saying anything.

After the 2 girls left, while we were waiting for our food, another couple came up to us and the girl asked us to explain to the guy what dim sum was. We got to talking about a lot of different foods and it felt like a much better interaction than the one I had with the 2 girls because everyone was talking and there was laughing and stuff. Eventually I realize that I have to go look for my friends and told them it was nice meeting them, shook their hands and asked them for their names then left.

In hindsight, I think I could have got her to talk more about her job and what kind of things they do, maybe throw in a couple of negs. 
I also think that looking for my friends was a bad idea, because I was no longer paying attention to the girls. I could have just looked for them after we ordered and got our food.
Should I have also moved in closer after I offered the umbrella? I moved my hand towards the middle and took maybe half a step forward, but maybe I could have stood shoulder to shoulder with girl 1? 
Also, when girl 2 was talking to my roommate, should I have gone back to talking to girl 1 instead of listening to their conversation? It felt like it was 1 to 1 conversations going on during our entire meeting, rather than the entire group talking.
Finally, should I have asked them their names sometime in the conversation?
I also didn't get any # closes because at no point during the interaction did it feel nature to ask them for it. I also wasn't too interested in either of them and didn't feel like we had too much in common. I feel like after reading seddit a lot, I need to get rid of this mindset, should I?

TL;DR: Offered girl in front of me my umbrella and hit it off, but then interaction died when we got to the front of the line and they just walked off. Not too sure why, but I have some ideas."

st71b,7,2012-04-26,Girlfriend of two years not interested sexually at all: Am I justified in being upset by this?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/st71b/girlfriend_of_two_years_not_interested_sexually/,"I (M20) have been in a relationship with my gf (19yo) for a little over 2 years now. We both have known each other since high school and ended up attending the same college--her a freshman while I'm a sophomore. Let me preface this by saying that our emotional relationship has been very healthy throughout our time.

Things were going great throughout the first few months. We were extremely attracted to each other and messed around about 3 times a week -- no intercourse though. We talked about sex on every so often and she would repeatedly put it off. This didn't upset me because we were virgins and I know she wanted her first time to be with someone special to her. I felt the same way so I agreed with her. We kept up this routine for the entire summer before I went off to college. This is where I felt like our healthy sex life ended.

I moved in to school in that Fall. It was really hard on us, many tears were shed the night before I left. This is where I felt we really had something special going on. I made it a point to try to better myself by losing weight so when she was able to come to school with me the next year I would be even more attractive than I was when I left. 

I would visit often maybe once a month and whenever I visited she never wanted to mess around and sex was way out of question. I would almost always be turned down whenever I visited...even though she would say different. I never got too upset because I didn't want to seem like that was all I cared about and that it was reasonable that she would just want quality non sexy times. This continued throughout the entire school year. I even lost 50 lbs over this year to no avail.

I spent that summer at home where I had my first engineering  internship. I was hoping that the summer would be a return to the same type of summer as the year prior. This was not the case. Whenever we did mess around I would have to almost beg her and she didn't even seem to enjoy it and still no sex -- this time she said she wanted to be on bc and planned on starting it in the fall. I chalked up her disinterest this time to her anxiety of moving away from home. She is super super close with her mother. This continued until the fall when she joined me at our university. 

First semester I had built up new hope that our sex life would increase; but again barely anything. I blamed the disinterst this time on bc side effects and separation anxiety from her mother in addition to moving away from home--definitely understandable. I tried as hard as I could to be a rock for her.

Now we have just passed our two year anniversary.  She quit taking the pill and has been feeling a whole bunch better about being away from home. We have both being super successful academically and she has made tons of friends. We still haven't had sex and I practically have to beg for any type of sexual stimulation. Any time I bring up how sex she gets super upset and angry and makes me feel like I am being unreasonable. She has straight up told me that we will not be having intercourse any time in the near future. 

I don't know what I am doing wrong if anything. The constant rejection is whittling away at my confidence. I feel inadequate around all of my guy friends from high school who are not virgins. I am also having a hard time making new guy friends because of this. It also makes me angry because she wants us to act like we have a sex life around all our friends. Is this my fault?

**TLDR:** Been with girl for two years and she has constantly turned down sex even though we have a very healthy emotional relationship. The constant rejection coupled with feelings of inadequacy around my guy friends is fucking up my confidence.

Writing all of this has been an awesome catharsis for me. Thanks for listening. But tell me people of Reddit, what advice do you have for me? "

A couple of years ago I met this guy at a social gathering (we're in the same student organization at my school) and we've been friends ever since - though nothing more than friendly acquaintances; I've always been attracted to him but didn't have enough interest to pursue anything more.

Flash forward to a couple of months ago, and we randomly start hanging out on a semi-regular basis. Like, 4-5 times a week at various social gatherings. I get to know him much better and turns out he's a super cool guy. He starts pursing the crap out of me for a couple of weeks - texting, hangouts, what have you - and I was certain it was going to go somewhere. Turns out he's just super friendly and led me on ""by accident."" We talked it out and our friendship has been great since then (that was the beginning of March); we hang out nearly every day and have gotten considerably closer as friends since everything happened.

The problem is that ever since then, I've been in total anguish about the situation. The more I've gotten to know him the stronger the feelings I have for him have become. It totally blows. He's still friendly (if not friendlier) than ever and evidently wasn't scared off by what happened. Friendly enough to make me doubt sometimes that he doesn't have feelings for me - which makes getting over him much more difficult than it should be, but that's another story.

OK, SO...Here's my dilemma: he's going to move to another city for the summer to do an internship, so I pretty much won't see him/talk to him at all for 10 weeks. I've been harboring these feelings/heartbreak for a while, though I'm pretty sure he's oblivious to both. Would it be worth my time to make him aware of either of those before he goes? Part of me really wants him to know so I can fucking stop holding it in, but the other part is afraid of more rejection (obviously). Plus I don't want things to be weird between us...but if he's going to be gone for months, it might be a good idea to clear the air? At least for the sake of my emotional well-being? Is that stupid? I kind of want to know once and for all if I have any hope with him...I just don't want to come across as too needy or dramatic or something. You know? Gah!

My partner and I did a lesson on Aristotle and his Virtue Ethics which led to a great discussion about ethics in general. 
For the next lesson the teacher wants us to go into Aquinas. I'm familiar with a bit of philosophy of religion, but not Aquinas' work. What seems like a good place to start would be with his '5 Ways' to prove God's existence. I like it because it takes something very influential and relevant to them (it's a non-denominational Christian school) and makes them think about it, note, the teacher actually suggested this one so it won't be too controversial. These five ways also can be a nice segue into argumentation, and teaching necessary vs. 'unnecessary' or contingency. 

Also, it's a 45 minute class, and I may get a chance to follow up, but not sure. So it's not terribly in depth, but good exposure is what I'm going for. Any advice or other ideas is appreciated!"

sszgi,1,2012-04-25,General Questions about Systems Engineering,faust100,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/sszgi/general_questions_about_systems_engineering/,"Hi Engineers!

I am considering returning to school to study systems engineering.  The school I'm looking at offers a concurrent Systems undergrad/MBA program that looks interesting.  Can any current systems engineers explain what the discipline is like to study?  What kind of jobs do you do, and is it a practical decision in the current economy to pursue systems?

Quick background: I graduated recently with a B.A. in Econ and German lit form a fairly prestigious liberal arts school.  I haven't been having a lot of luck in the current job market, so I'm looking to get a practical (engineering) and advanced (MBA) degree as well as have opportunities to do internships in industry, which I wasn't able to do through my last school.  I have credits for Calc I and Physics I, and with a degree, I don't think I'll have to worry about gen-eds.

ssvn8,4,2012-04-25,"8 months into Big 4, I receive a call from my a place I interned at as an AR/AP clerk to rejoin them as an accounting supervisor. Should I take the offer?",JustKeepRedditn010,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/ssvn8/8_months_into_big_4_i_receive_a_call_from_my_a/,"3 years ago, I got my first accounting internship in college with a small company. Over time, it has grown to become a mid-size firm and my boss is now the CFO of the company.

During the time after my internship with them, I interned at a Big 4 and got a full time offer. I started this past Fall with the Big 4 and have done 2 rounds of busy seasons of financial audit and internal controls assessment work (yay non-calendar fiscal year ends.)

Today, I received a call from my first boss who is now the company CFO. They want to offer me a position with the company in a supervisory role, doing tax work, reviewing items performed by staff, and helping document the internal controls processes for auditors. In other words, general accounting stuff with a hint of IA work.

To be honest, I loved working with the company. They have a great work-life balance and I liked the culture. However, on the flip side, I'm afraid that I may be limiting my stock (if you will) if I cash out this early in my Big 4 career, even though it can be considered in some ways a promotion since I would be a supervisor/senior. I know that most intro-accounting industry jobs lead nowhere (e.g. AP Clerk positions), but I feel like this would be a step up and the risk of capping out before management is less, especially since the company is growing a lot and these job duties are essentially already management-type roles.


/r/Accounting, what are your thoughts? Is it too early to jump into industry, enjoy life, and stop being staffed on busy seasons working 12+ hour days?

P.S. If it matters, I already have my CPA."

It's been about a year since I passed my preliminary exams and began research (but still I don't expect to graduate until 2015 plus or minus a year); in January I switched advisers due to complete disenchantment with my previous topic (no bridges burnt), but for a few reasons I'm just unhappy with things right now and want to try to apply around and see if I can't get a nice offer. In case it's relevant, I'm in an applied math program at the computational end of the spectrum and will be looking in the technology sector - data analysis and the like. There are a few details about my resume that I've got questions about given the situation:

1. Presently I've included names of my various research advisers/mentors throughout my academic career; should I not? At the very least my current adviser is a (relatively) well-publicized name, but some sources do seem to suggest excluding all names of any sort apart from my own.
2. A consequence of 1.: I *certainly* don't want my current adviser (or former, or anyone at my school) to be contacted by a recruiter; to that end I included a line at the end stating ""References available upon request."" Again, sources suggested such a line is superfluous and assumed, but I felt that it may deter any calls/contact to the names I have listed before we've actually discussed references. Thoughts?
3. I keep hearing different things about this: should I include GPA? I don't have any experience outside of academic research (and a research-oriented summer internship). All my GPAs since undergrad are quite nice, and because of my format including them isn't wasting vertical space.

Any feedback is appreciated."

Thank you for contacting me about Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (H.R. 3523). I appreciate hearing from you.
As you may know, Representative Mike Rogers (R-MI) introduced H.R. 3523 on November 30, 2011. Among its provisions, this measure would require the Director of National Intelligence to establish procedures to allow and encourage the intelligence community to share information regarding cyber threats with private sector entities. H.R. 3523 would also allow private sector entities under certain circumstances to share cyber threat information with other organizations, including the federal government. I understand your concerns regarding this measure and value your input. The House of Representatives passed H.R. 3523 by a 248-168 vote on April 26, 2012. Please be assured that I will keep your views in mind if H.R. 3523 is considered by the Senate.
Thank you again for your correspondence. Please do not hesitate to contact me in the future if I can be of assistance.

I graduated the University of Illinois in 2010 with a bachelors in political science and an associates in philosophy. I have taken grad school level statistics courses, had paid positions in political campaigns, am currently interning in the marketing department of a theatre (we've had Lewis Black, Jack Hanna, and we are going to have Brian Regan), and I have another summer marketing internship lined up at the local chamber of commerce.

I tell you all of this to let you know that anyone can fall for a scam job proposal. I have fallen, or nearly fallen for, several such offers over the years. Starting in high school I have probably averaged 1 scam job offer per year, these last three months not withstanding. Over these last three months I have received 12 job offers that were all too good to be true. The first several interviews I received (way back in high school) I treated with the utmost respect; trying to garner the favor of the conman/woman. I ignored my proper senses which all told me these places were basically being run by carnies telling me anything I wanted to hear. I have become intimately familiar with their schemes, pitches, long cons, and everything in between because I started going to these interviews for fun. Messing with the recruiter, informing others in my group interview how their schemes work, and generally causing a ruckus. Honestly doing this is more relaxing for me than getting a massage. Moving on. 

## Why does this matter to you? Well I can help you, the desperate job seeker, from being taken advantage of by scalawags and malcontents. Here is a short list of things for which to be on the look out. 

***

**1) They call you out of nowhere but insist you sent them your resume.** 

Everybody knows that the economy is terrible which translates into high unemployment. These companies know that job seekers must send out resumes *en mass* trying and snag a position, any position, with a legitimate company. When you update your online resume via careerbuilder, monster, or linkedin you are adding chum to the water and these sharks can smell it. 

How to combat this trick: Keep a list of companies that you send your resume to; make sure to include parent company. Now when their recruiter calls and says ""I'm calling about the resume you sent in to company X"" you can say ""I never sent a resume into company X"". This is one small step in getting the upper hand.

Similar Tactic: Sometimes companies will just tell you that they trawled your resume from monster/careerbuilder/linkedin. This gives you the upper hand immediately because you know how to proceed. Most companies do not grab low level resumes off of a resume website; they make potential candidates vie for position by listing the opening. This is the first red flag people should get.

**2) When they set up the interview they tell you how to dress. (Make sure to dress up!)**

This is a sign that the interview is not going to be legitimate. Most companies will give you the benefit of the doubt when it comes to dressing yourself, the ones that don't are generally trying to set a mood for the interview. They are going to have a group interview and they want each of you to look professional so that the illusion of legitimacy is maintained even when other candidates are present. 

**3) If they ever use the term 'multilevel marketing'.**

Most of you are familiar with this type of sales structure but I am going to give a quick rundown for those that are not. A multilevel marketing strategy (scheme) is basically a legalized pyramid scheme. The recruiter is trying to build a team. Each member of that team will be giving a percentage of each sale to the recruiter. They encourage you to recruit a team so that you can start making that sweet recruiter income. You, in turn, will encourage your team to recruit more members. In several iterations the population of the planet will be working for you! Imagine what kind of check you will receive then!

**4) They offer 'unlimited income'.**

If you just work hard enough you can make as much as you want. We have people making six figures a month. 

This phrase, and explanation, is just used to put the burden on your shoulders. If you don't succeed then it is *your* fault, not the fault of the company or the recruiter. They will impress you with figures like 'just three sales a day and you will be making $2000 per week and that doesn't include the residuals!' and 'average starting salary is $5000/month!'. Maybe some sales people are earning $2000/week (or $5000/month) but they don't work for this company. 

How to combat this trick: These types of companies are basically made of hubris. They will never expect that you will try to validate their numbers. That's why they generally have a 'top earners' newsletter. That newsletter will be prominently displayed in the waiting room. Read it and see what types of salaries their 'top earners' make. If they have a top ten list, as they often do, then notice the bottom four or five salaries. You will notice something frightening: they aren't making as much as the touted 'average salary' of a starting employee. If the 'top earners' aren't making $5000/month then how the hell can they claim that as the 'average' salary. 

**5) We offer a flexible schedule where you work the days you want and you are your own boss.**

Bullshit. The recruiter is going to be on your back everyday to get out there and sell. Even if they aren't you are looking at 12-14 hour days just driving around from potential sale to potential sale not actually selling anything. Your recruiter is your boss and your hours of operation are always. 

**6) During the interview they ask what salary you want to earn and then they say ""don't low-ball yourself; I see someone like you making 8-10 thousand dollars a month at least.""**

This is just poor baiting. They are making you feel inadequate about only wanting what you need to survive and they are, again, putting your failure (when it inevitable comes) directly on your shoulders. 'They knew you could do it, but you didn't work hard enough'. It's also an appeal to the kid in all of us who once thought that we could be making $100K/year.

How to combat this trick: Ask them how much they make a month. They will be taken aback but they will also be in 'sell mode' so they are not going to say ""I can't tell you that."" They are also not going to tell you what they make (because it is roughly equivalent to 1/20th of a pittance). They will make an allusion to a six figure income but don't believe it for one second. They barely scrape by but by getting you in on the gig they will barely scrape by more comfortably. Ask who makes their suits (because you want to buy one when you start making the big girl/boy dollars). If they say George then they are dressed in Wal-mart chic (which there is nothing wrong with but very unlikely when making $100K a year). If they say Armani, Gucci, etc ask to see the label. Call them out on everything. 

**7) They insist you pay for training/product to sell.** 

They will say things like 'well we have to insure that you have a drive to sell this product' or 'it's company policy that each employee own our brand of knives/shoes/insurance'. With a simple wave of the wand they have made you into a customer instead of an employee. If you need a certificate for a job, that makes sense. Some jobs require additional training. If they require you to buy the product you are trying to sell, run!

**8) It's going to be a three part interview. Group interview, panel interview, one on one interview.** 

Just say no to group interviews. These are just presentations designed to sell you the product. Your peers are there to create an atmosphere in which you are afraid to ask questions. It also makes their small office seem populated and hospitable instead of cold and dead (like the inside of the recruiter's heart)


**Epilogue)** That's my advice. It is not comprehensive but it is, I hope, helpful. Each of these things are red flags which means that some legitimate companies may employ some of these tactics. That doesn't legitimize the tactic but it means that you have to be extra vigilant. Remember: companies need to prove themselves to you just as much as you need to earn a place within them. If a company feels scammy, it is a scam!

Good luck job hunters; I hope I have helped.

What do your parents do? ,jukeboxjosh,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/svhrj/its_bring_your_parents_to_reddit_day_what_do_your/,"I figured since most of us haven't gotten to show off our parents since elementary school, we should show off to the 1.5 mil in AskReddit!

My mom is a 4th grade teacher at a low socioeconomic school, and she's been teaching for close to 20 years (I'll have to confirm that later). She's by far one of the coolest teachers I know, and I'm not just saying that. She's kind of a rebel when it comes to her semi-insane administrators, and she great results. For instance, we have a standardized test called the TAKS (Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills), and it's a minimum skills test that's supposed to dictate whether the child passes on to the next grade or gets held back. A lot of times principals just pass them on, especially when the school has a very low passing rate. A lot of times she gets a class with only 30% passing rate for said test, and has brought it up into the 80s. Pretty big feat, especially when some of these kids barely understand fractions or addition in some cases. She also gets the kids to respect and trust her, and when you're at a school with kids whose parents aren't there, or are being raised by siblings only a few years older, they need that. She prefers to stay at schools like this, despite the fact that they normally have less-than-stellar administrators, because she feels she needs to help these kids out and help them have a brighter future. I'm proud of her everyday and hope one day she gets to a school she can help and not have principals breathing down her back for every little things that is ""wrong."" (She's been *written up* for have a purple sheet of construction paper on a table and a bag of Cheez-Its on her desk. This is officially documented.)

My dad is head of QA for insurance companies, I believe. I don't know nearly as much because he's not been as open about his job until recently and we're not as close, so I'm gonna be off on a bit of this. Anyways, he basically tests out bug reports that customers and other testers point out to him for all the half a dozen releases of the program  that are being used. He has to document everything with as much detail as possible and send it to the developers to fix. He also tests any new features according to how he and his team believe the customers use the product. As he put it, it's just him documenting thing problems with programs, which he's been doing forever. He has a really chill work environment that has these neat Skype-ready, presentation-ready meeting rooms where you can bring your laptop in, hook it up to the big screen in the room, and screen share with other meeting rooms in the multi-story office to show off new features internally or externally. The workplace also has fridges filled with soda, tons of different coffee options, and a different food truck (normally) comes out to the office to offer lunch to anyone who wants it. He really enjoys his job and was trying to butter me up for an internship over there.

So reddit, what do your parents do?"

I chose to attend a public U for at least the first couple years to try and keep costs down, I guess. It all rounds out to about 17k or so. My parents are not going to help, FAFSA is not going to help. I'll be working through  the summer, and during the year. 

What really brings worries is some people (on reddit, and elsewhere) complaining about 50k worth of debt. I am pretty sure I will have exceeded this by the time I graduate. In my stupid 18 year old head I figure that a starting engineer's salary can get it paid off in a long, but not excessive amount of time.

I also figure that job placement is not as big of a deal for engineers (compared to other fields) since there are always report on how widely available jobs are. I know that internships, work experience, and extracurriculars are generally more important to employers than GPA.

Am I an idiot? or am I right when I suppose that engineering degrees are, in fact, expensive, but do pay off?....

TL;DR i'm going to be $17k under in student debt after my first year, is this normal? is this reasonable? 

Thanks!


edit: Thanks for all the informative responses guys! What I am taking is that my situation is fairly typical, and will all work out as long as I'm not lazy (1+ part time jobs + co-op/internships). This is great, thanks again!"

This will be my first post on reddit, so lets see if I do this right.

So I got my new case in the mail yesterday and I was really excited about it. I started by taking out all the komponets that where in the old case and putting them into the new one. Old one was a mid tower, new one is a big tower. Then when I was done putting it all back together I put the power plug and one of my monitors in to see if everything was ok. It was not The light on the motherboard was lit but when i pressed the power button nothing happend. I then was going to take it all down to see if ther was anything I had done wrong. When i was about to unplug the monitor it suddenly started up but as soon at I moved my hand in any way it stoped again. i thyed aplying diffrent preasure to the graphics card and from ther on I could only get it to power up by doing that, it didn't even work sometimes. 

Things i have tryed to get it to work again are:
Removing the graphics card and only use the inbuilt graphics card in the motherboard. Didn't work.

The power supply is powerful enought to handle the power requirements. I even tryed without any case fans, only CPU cooler and SSD. Didn't work.

I have tryed mulible other tings that mostly would have worked on other computers I have worked with before. Non worked so far. 

I am currently working as a computer intern, got one year left to get my degree. A few of my friends has master degrees and simular grades in computer engenering, programing etc etc, no one of them knew after hours of trying all sorts of things what to do. 

This leavs me to seek help from my fellow redditors to see if anyone has anyide of what could be wrong and what i could do to fix it. 

This is a computer that has a price tag at about 3400$ that is just sitting there not working.

Commiserate inside.,[deleted],Buffalo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buffalo/comments/suw5x/an_open_rant_about_youthful_joblessness/,"Fellow Buffalonians; I want to work. I want to get a job, and I want to do work, and I want to do it well. I'm 17, in my junior year of highschool but graduating in June, and have 5 courses completed through the honors college at UB. My grades are so high I could walk them down to a methadone clinic and they'd fit right in. I've got drive, creativity, and a hell of a lot of spare time. When I do things, I do them well. I want to work.

Ideally, I want to produce. I want to make things. Synthesize. Create. I don't care if it's artisan or industrial or scientific, but I want to be able to look at the end of the day and say ""I (help) make that."" I'd love to nail an internship at a record label or recording studio, but that's just a fantasy.

I'd also like to direct. I'd make a great manager or organizer at just about any business, but I know I can't just apply for a managerial position as my first job. I'm a fantastic organizer. I shoot high and hit high, never lose money, and people listen to me. I've got the size for it at 6' 5"", and physically look more adult than many 17 year olds can.

I do not care about risk. I would love a job like roofing or defusing live explosives. Give me a reason (or, alternatively, money), and my balls will drop to titanium mode. I do not care how shady of a business I'm working for. Dodging taxes? Using a pizzeria as a front? Migrant workers? No permits? I couldn't care less, just keep me clean. I just want *something*.

I've got transportation. I've got decent physical strength (and work on increasing it). I've got good looks (and a lack of bashfulness). I am upfront. I am honest. I am liberal as fuck. If you really want to know about a job applicant, why don't you ask them?

And fuck it, I'll do menial work. I'll wash dishes, I'll serve food, I'll stock shelves. I'd rather if a business wanted me for what makes me standout, but I'll become one of the drones if you ask. I'd do it in a fucking heartbeat because it's just a modern truth the first jobs need to be that way.

I will do anything you ask me to do for money on a regular basis.  Anything at all.

So why the fuck can't I get hired? 

Why aren't there jobs for me and my broke friends? Why are we entering adulthood without any opportunity, without any hope? The job prospects after college aren't looking much better from what I've seen. Are we all just going to have to resort to crime to make any type of respectable living? We all want to work, but none of us can find jobs.

So reddit: What are your sob stories of not being able to find employment? I just needed to get that out. I think my ambien may have kicked in..."
suuty,1,2012-04-27,"Almost positive my roommate's GF is cheating on him, what do I do?",yo_yo_throwaway,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/suuty/almost_positive_my_roommates_gf_is_cheating_on/,"I think my roommate's girlfriend is cheating on him. They have been together almost three years and he is even looking at engagement rings. This girl has been trouble from the start though, he has a decent amount of money so he has been her sugar daddy throughout the duration of their relationship. It seems like she doesn't give a shit about him, but he is in love with her and can't see past the bullshit she tells him. So here is some of the evidence:

**Previous Transgressions**

1) They were on a break for a week and she fucked another dude, I understand it's a break but a week? Really?

2) When I talked to her roommate about banging the guy during the break she told me ""Ha, you think that's the only one?"" and proceeded to tell me about periods earlier in their relationship where she banged other dudes behind his back.

**Current Evidence**

1) Recently she got an internship in the city close to my college and has consistently been ""working late"" and going to happy hours with her coworkers. She rarely hangs out with the guy, and he recently told me they hadn't had sex in a month and a half. She says she is always too tired from work.

2) When I told a friend about this ""working late"" stuff, she told me she was definitely lying. My friend said she had seen my roommates GF at her friends apartment with a guy watching movies, and it wasn't the first time she had seen her there either.

So I'm pretty sure this girl is cheating, but I want to be sure before I confront my roommate with this information. She has bullshitted her way out of things in the past, and I know he will probably fall for it again if there is no hard evidence. So does anyone have any suggestions on a way to find out definitively whether or not this girl is cheating?

**Edit:** Just to clarify, this guy is a good friend, we have lived together for three years almost all throughout college. He is a good dude and I hate to see him getting fucked around on like this, that's why I'm asking."

-I have two internships under my belt as well as several leadership positions in on campus organizations. Also, if all goes well I should be graduating with honors (honors program as well as academic honors). Will this have any basis on my being admitted?

supo6,2,2012-04-26,How to deal with jealousy in early relationships,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/supo6/how_to_deal_with_jealousy_in_early_relationships/,"I'm 22M, and my girlfriend is 22F. We've been together for 5 months and it's going amazing.

However, I find myself having some jealousy issues. I'm not sure if this is normal for all guys in new relationships (this is my first relationship that lasted for more than a couple weeks/one night)

I am also her first boyfriend (she had a bunch of guys friendzoned and had a thing with another last summer, but that's it)

 
I have no reason not to trust her, but she is very VERY social and has a lot of guy friends.

We have seen each other every weekend except once in the past 4 months (she is on an internship away from our university).

Otherwise it makes me quite uncomfortable when she goes out drinking with some of her clients / co-workers. She works in a gym during her internship so obviously she is surrounded by a lot of guys. This hasn't been so bad, she usually texts me quite a lot during the evening and the next morning, but sometimes it's hard for me.

For example, last week we were going out for one of her girlfriend's birthday, and she invited the two guys from the gym she had met in her internship. This made me feel a bit uncomfortable when she told me she invited them them.. but I got over it. 

Obviously I talked to her about it once or twice. I told her I want to let her do what she wants, I don't mind her going out with guys at all, but it makes me feel uncomfortable sometimes, and I hope she knows. Those discussions always go very well and she makes me feel a lot better right after. This being said, there is no way I well ever be THAT boyfriend who gets all pissy when his girl goes out, or who prevents her from going out (I know some guys who do this, sickens me)

This week it's been the worse ever though. She is in some all-exclusive resort in Mexico with 3 of her girlfriends for a week. I've been over-thinking about all kinds of stupid shit. The fact that she told me her friends were boring and she wants to make some new ones to go out and have fun makes me more paranoid. I obviously haven't heard from her since she left last Sunday. I know I should have nothing to worry about, but just thinking about how crushed I'd be if she came back and told me she hooked up with some guy makes me sick. (She couldn't tell a lie if her life depended on it, she would tell me right away).

So, is this normal? I've been told it's all about my confidence and stuff... But honestly I consider myself fairly self-confident, good-looking, on my way to a good job when I graduate, we share interests, I can satisfy her in bed etc... Basically I have REALLY nothing to worry about but I still do. 

So, how do you guys cope with jealousy, and does this happen to everyone in the early stages of a relationship?

TL;DR: Been in a relationship for 5 months and I'm a jealous fucker. Is this normal? How do I fix this."

I'm fairly competent with AE, C4D, PS, and to a lesser extent Illustrator - I know I still have A LOT to learn (going to start focusing a lot more on 2D animation soon) but I can't wait to learn it!

The level of my work - http://jeffthomson.co.uk - Unfortunately final year of uni, and dissertation work has taken up a lot of my free time, so a lot of the stuff on there is old/rushed and not necessarily what I feel I'm capable of now.

Just really unsure where to look, or who to email, what agencies etc etc. If anyone knows any one taking on interns, or a good place to email it would greatly appreciated, I live just outside of London, so that would probably work out best, but im not necessarily ruling out somewhere else, the world is too big, and life is too short to stay in the same place.. :P

Any advice/help would be greatly appreciated, thanks

Oh, and I have checked out motionographer jobs, but there seems to be a very limited amount of internships, mostly in the US, seeking local applicants only - any other online resources like this?"
suobc,0,2012-04-26,Computer Science/Engineering major thinking about applying to law school for a career in patent law. ,[deleted],law,https://www.reddit.com/r/law/comments/suobc/computer_scienceengineering_major_thinking_about/,"As it says in the title, I am currently a computer science major and I am seriously considering applying to law school for fall 2013. Since it is getting close to the time when I need to either start studying and preparing for the LSAT or otherwise start on the path to grad school, I figured I should get educated a bit before I decide. So here goes:

-I currently have a 3.57 LSAC GPA (plan on at least a 3.6 before graduation). Assuming I get a reasonable LSAT score (165-170), what are my chances of getting in to a top 20 school?

-Assuming that I do not get in to a top 20, would it even be worth it at this point, as far as my getting out of student loan debt is concerned, to pursue a career in patent law?

-I have two internships under my belt as well as several leadership positions in on campus organizations. Also, if all goes well I should be graduating with honors (honors program as well as academic honors). Will this have any basis on my being admitted? 

-I come from a white middle class family and did not have any spectacular hardships growing up. What would be the best way to make my personal statement stand out if at all possible?

-Is a career in patent law, particularly in software and/or computer engineering if that matters, a satisfying career choice in the first place?

That's about all that I can think of at the moment, but I would welcome any other advice!

I spend all day doing boring, mundane shit (work in IT), while dreaming of being the dissolute scion of a wealthy New York family whose exploits are featured in the society pages.  The only things I'm good at (or even remotely enjoy) are partying (but only if it involves people wealthier than me -- seriously, I can't enjoy house parties where everyone else is some IT schlub or works in a bike shop or is a social worker or something) and weightlifting.  Too bad I can't turn either into a career.    

I hate my parents for being middle-class -- like it's some great crime that they dared to have children when they knew they weren't going to leave a great fortune.  Isn't this a fucked up way to think?

I'm deep in debt, mostly because I spend ridiculous amounts of money in an attempt to momentarily convince myself, others I am wealthy and to ingratiate myself with people who actually are.  I have a few friends who are associates in BIGLAW or work in private equity, and I wish I could switch places with them, but the absolute worst are people my age (26), who have wealthy parents and sponge off them.  They (the children) still work as INTERNS on political campaigns or for magazines or fashion designers or float in and out of graduate school programs; they will always have their parents' money to fall back on.  It's a permanent safety net, but, beyond that, they can effortlessly afford things that cost me a month's salary.  

Anyway, fuck this.  Is there some kind of 'acceptance' therapy where I can learn to be happy with the immiserating mediocrity of my middle-classed-ness?  "

We're both attend A&amp;M, except he is graduating in a few weeks and is moving to Houston, which is just an hour away, to work. I still have two more years of college left. He broke up with me because he feels like he can't handle the long distance.

Background information: 

He's graduating with a petroleum engineer degree. His job will require him to travel to oil rigs during his training until he finally gets settled into an office in Houston, which may take six months to two years. He's living with his parent during this time.

He says during his freshmen year, he tried a long distance relationship with his high school girlfriend, but it didn't work. (Again, it was about an hour and a half away.) During last summer, he was working as an intern while I went to summer school. He almost broke up with me then because of the distance (this probably should've forshadowed what is going on now.) 

Is there anyway I could convince him that we could make it work? We still love each other and it would be such a shame to just throw this relationship away like that.

TLDR; Can /r/relationships give my boyfriend advice about going through a not so very long distance relationship? What can I say to reassure him?"

Advice?,[deleted],KitchenConfidential,https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/sx03b/i_dont_know_where_to_start_advice/,"I apologize for the wall of text. Basically, I'm graduating college and want to break into the food service industry without experience. School/ no school + dishwashing?

I'm currently studying abroad in Mexico. I graduate with my BA in graphic design (minor in business and psych) in 6 days. I'm 22F in NC. I haven't applied anywhere. My portfolio was put on the back burner so I could travel Mexico while I've been here. I do not regret that decision at all. Eventually, I want my MBA, but all of the schools I'm considering have an average student age of around 28-32 and I truly think I will get the most out of my experience after having worked full-time for a while. In the meantime, I'm weighing my options on how to get that experience.

I almost left my current school to go to culinary school at the beginning of my Junior year. I have always wanted to go to culinary school. I decided I was too far in to not finish, and I stand by that decision because I have learned a lot. I've been researching culinary programs in my area. Community college seems to be the smartest route since after culinary school you come out ready to be a cook not a chef. Meaning another $4000 in debt and come out making $10-12/hour. (I am totally fine with this, if it's the smartest option.) I've read a lot on whether it is really worth it to go to school or not. Whether it's best to get experience in a kitchen, then go to school to refine your skills and be ready for a hire paying job. I've got meetings scheduled with the program directors in my area to ask them some of these questions, too.

I have prior work experience and internships, but nothing in the food service industry.

So, from how I see it now, my options are:

Get a job as a busser/dishwasher until I can get my portfolio ready. Finish my portfolio and find a design job. Stay working part-time in the food service industry to learn. I'm afraid this won't get me experience since I'll be part-time.

Get as many hours as possible as a busser/dishwasher. Try to stay in that field to observe/learn while I free-lance to bring in extra money and keep my design skills going.

What I actually want, ideally, is to have my own company. I've brain-stormed ideas for this but I'm leaning toward my own restaurant or event planning company. I realize these are far into the future and are a lot of work. For the second, I couldn't do it all by myself, but I think I would be really good at making everything come together to result in invites, menu, etc.; food/cake; photography; etc.

I know I'm dreaming here, but I have to start somewhere. Where should that be? My fear is getting stuck in a design job and never carrying this all out. I've got the patience and determination. I know I can do this. 

Also, if my route should be getting kitchen experience... where is practical for me to apply from the get go even for a dishwashing job. Chains, mom and pops, etc. or is it practical to apply to restaurants who are hiring for those positions no matter their ranking? I've found nice places hiring, but I didn't know what experience was expected for fine-dining restaurants."

   If the Internship goes well over the summer i may consider employing you for various tasks around the house.

Background: My mom's a pretty mean alcoholic and I've found pot in her room a bunch. I'm REALLY against drug and alcohol use.    

My boyfriend knows that. We used to argue about it a lot, and he would watch me cry (I never cry about anything other than this and family problems) and beg him not to drink when he visited his friends at other universities, but still do it. Eventually (a year and three months into the relationship), I gave him the ultimatum of drinking or being with me (because this really is a huge problem in my life, and I don't want to worry about it all the time and be unhappy with it), and he said that I was more important to him than doing those things with his friends.  

Fast forward to a few weeks ago, I found out from a coworker that he had met my boyfriend at a party. I asked him about it and he said that he went, but I didn't have to worry about it. I asked if he drank and he said he did (even though he promised he wouldn't). After hours of unanswered texts, questions, and phone calls, he finally admitted to me that he's been smoking pot at least once a week for over a year.    

I broke up with him, but then we got back together a few days later.    

I don't know if I made the right choice. He's been nearly perfect with everything else; this is the only serious problem we've ever had.      

Back at the time of the ultimatum, he said that I was more important to him than doing that stuff. Well, now he's doing what I thought PLUS smoking, so what does that mean about my importance?    
He knows I struggle with feeling unimportant, and that I hate that my mom puts alcohol before me. But he's doing the same thing.    

Please help, I can't get this off my mind.     
Note: He told me that he's smoking tonight.  
For those of you saying that I'm too controlling, I'm really not. He's going off to an internship for the summer, and I'm okay with it. We're going to different colleges and I'm okay with it. We really only hang out like once or twice a week, and I'm okay with it. I'm not one of those people who's like, ""You have to call me/text me all the time."" If he's busy, he's busy. I don't care. I've never asked him of anything other than this.  

**TL;DR**- My boyfriend has been lying to me for over a year about smoking pot at least once a week, despite me being super against it. Should I stay with him? "

sw6h2,0,2012-04-27,The Unsuccessful Job Hunt ,[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/sw6h2/the_unsuccessful_job_hunt/,"Dear Reddit, 

I am about finished with graduate school, and I started applying for jobs. When I say “applying for jobs,” I mean hundreds of jobs on practically every jobsite that exists.  Honestly, it is not working out well because I have not heard back from any employers. I know that I am competent, honest and hardworking; however, integrity does not seem to mean anything during these harsh economic times. Additionally, employers want people with years of experience, and as a student, I simply do not have that. It really brings me down when my peers are getting job offers without even trying. I have friends who received job offers right out of college, and I have to do everything to make myself more employable. I went to graduate school not because I love academia, but because I needed an “edge.” I needed to somehow make myself more employable, and I honestly thought that getting a master’s degree would make the job hunt easier. Sadly, I was wrong. I was very wrong. It has not gotten easier, and no one is willing to give me a chance. 

I work hard at everything I do, and I have great references. My past employers know that I work hard at every task I am given. Before I entered graduate school, I had a solid-paying internship, and I worked hard. I was even given a job offer; however, I turned it down because I was told that getting a master’s degree is more important. So, what happens? Someone who is less qualified takes the position that I was offered. How less qualified? Imagine a waitress suddenly landing a prestigious job without any experience. That is exactly what happened, Reddit. My job history suddenly meant nothing, and to be honest, I still regret that decision to this day. I should have taken that job, but I did not. I had a golden opportunity to start my career, and I messed it up. I listened to the wrong people (i.e. my parents and co-workers) who told me that education was more important, and they were wrong. 
Graduate school has been difficult, especially knowing the fact that I am working so hard to start my career and others are just getting jobs handed to them. I have looked at job hunting advice on Reddit, and a common theme I am coming across is networking. I cannot network because I cannot pretend to like someone just because they might be able to employ me. I know that I am going to get verbally scolded for saying that, but it is true. For instance, if I go to a bar and I am drinking with someone who is acting like a jerk, I will not be associating myself with them. I am realizing that sometimes you need to fake it till you make it. I have come to terms with it, and I am trying to leave my personal biases at the door. “Fake it till you make it” pretty much sums up the job market. I would rather not fake anything, but what choice do I have? 
I have seen how fake people can be in graduate school. It is appalling; however, the students know how to network. Networking requires people to “fake” interest. That much is certain. I guess I have never been good at faking or acting even though I did participate in several plays when I was a kid. I do not want to fake anything. I could not look at myself in the mirror if I was living a lie. 

What do I want? I want a job where I can wake up and be happy to go to work. I want to help people. I want to make my existence worthwhile. I want to show my parents that I am capable of getting my career started. I want to get married, have kids, buy a house and provide for my family. I want to have a work life and family life. I want my existence to have meaning. I do not want to be a student forever. want to grow up, Reddit. I see people with families, and I am envious. I want that. I want to be like everyone else out in the work world. I knew times were rough, but I never times would ever be this rough where I cannot even get a job after working several low-income jobs and getting experience during several internships. 

Thanks for listening, Reddit. 

EDIT: 

tl;dr I am still trying to find a job and not having much luck. I want to get everything started already.

syvwq,3,2012-04-29,Girl at work - Should I or shouldn't I?,nobody2000,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/syvwq/girl_at_work_should_i_or_shouldnt_i/,"I feel like a tool asking this - I don't want to think I'm above being helped out, but I've done well in the past...I don't know why I'm frustrated.

This is a two parter. I'll post the 2 questions after the description of my situation.


Back in May, a new girl joined work as an intern. She's in finance. I was a marketing intern then. She's cute, we hit it off on a company boat cruise. All the admins (secretaries) noticed this and reminded me of this.


She also had a boyfriend...


BUT I didn't care. I would stop by her desk and chat, see how she was getting along - being fun, inquisitive, entertaining, and friendly without looking like the dude that pounces on fresh meat.
I'd stop by daily, and finally, after a few days I had a small ""fuck it"" moment and wanted her to stop by MY desk to chat. She never did.


So - I felt I could chalk up our flirting and stuff to just her taking a quick break from our work and nothing more - if she was interested, she'd stop by and chat with me. (Tactical problem - she sat with the interns, I sit with the associates).


She never stopped by my desk, and we didn't really talk much. Walking around the office, I noticed she'd kinda take corners weird almost to avoid talking to me.


I don't think that it's an ""I don't want to talk to you at all"" thing. I think it's more like ""I'm nervous/shy..."" on her part


And then with the way I act - I feel like we're both a big fucking blue penguin meme.


So we managed to catch up once a month during birthday celebrations and happy hours - nothing special. Learned more and more about her, and became more and more attracted to her.

Eventually I become full associate and meet a wonderful girl outside of work. Sex was great - she has been with a ton of dudes and I'm the only one to make her orgasm.
Then she became less wonderful and broke up with me almost 2 months ago. Oh well.


BUT

Turns out the girl from work dumped her boyfriend in January...

Now, she JUST got hired full time, and I told her ""we need to celebrate"" but realized it was that generic bullshit that she'd likely ignore.

Luckily, she reminded me twice about what I said (email + in person).

We'll get drinks next week - then I don't know.


TL;DR - Girl at work and I hit it off, she seems shy, I have to initiate all conversation but she seems to enjoy it. Going out to celebrate new job next week.


My questions are this:
1.) Do you have any advice about flirting with a shy girl? She's definitely smart and confident and all that. We're going out and let's assume I want to take things further. Am I just going to have to shoulder most of the work at this point (communicating with her, taking her out)? I know girls want dudes to do this anyway, but I feel like it's going to be a bit more work with her than normal.


2.) The inevitable ""Do I shit where I eat?"" question. We work at a HUGE company, but now, with her new job, we sit 2 desks down from each other. Neither one of us is a subordinate to the other, and never will be. What about ""secret relationships?"" Also, what do you think about the timing? (She was JUST hired full time last week - right around the time when I'm ok with not being with my ex anymore).


Any advice is immensely appreciated!"
sytqs,1,2012-04-29,Motorcycle Weekend Trips,Dirtroadrocker,travel,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/sytqs/motorcycle_weekend_trips/,"I'm a college student with an internship in Columbus, IN.  I just purchased a motorcycle, which opens up the world of reasonably priced roadtrips (My normal driver is a Jeep. Awful fuel mileage).  Also, with the fact that its a motorcycle (2000 V-Star), I will have limited carrying space.  It does have saddle bags, so I'm limited to about a weekend's worth of clothes, and maybe a bedroll, and a snack or two.  I love camping and roughing it, and would love to find places within ~6 hours or a ride from Columbus that would have a great drive (not highway riding-preferably countryside or hilly riding), have a cheap/free place to toss out a bedroll and sleep, and have great things to see once I get there as well?

When any of the people in my life ask me why i stopped being a christian i always say ""it's a real long story,"". Here is that story. I, like many other suburban kids, was raised christian and when i got into high school is when i really cranked up the jesus juice. I became a part of first priority (a christian group at my school) i even went to Honduras as part of a mission trip group, twice. i was in, 100 percent in. You see the way they got me was they made it seem like the only ""proper"" way to help people is through ""the love of christ"". so when i got done with high school i did not really know what i wanted, i was always interested in psychology and sociology so i though maybe a therapist. so i left my hometown to discover what it was that i wanted out of my life. Then everything went to shit. I had some friends (such a shame that they are not my friends anymore, i loved that family as if it was my own) in the town i moved to and they enthusiastically invited me to their church. well i had a sit down with the pastor and he was very excited to have me going there (I had played in a band that played at the church and the kids already liked me) and asked me if i would become the ""youth leader"" for the high school group. i of course accepted thinking this is what god had planned for me. if it was, god is a cruel bastard. do not get me wrong, i loved the kids i was overseeing and for the first year it was a blast, i got to play fun games with these kids and help them with their various problems. all these kids needed was someone to listen to them and support them and i did my best to help. then the fateful day came, you see i had been working for the church on a volunteer level and was perfectly fine with that, i held down a steady job at a local factory and had a (for a 19 year old kid) decently nice house. my pastor came to me and asked how devoted i was to this group and these kids, i of course, said that i was completely devoted so he told me that god had a plan. i should have asked ""why did he tell you and not me?"" but i did not, i asked what i could do. he told me that i had to quit my job and devote the next two years of my life to an ""Internship"" he said that my rent would be paid for and my food would be taken care of and all i had to do was do this internship and after i would be a pastor. well i had not gone to or taken any college classes and i was really excited about it. a pastor, now there is a job i can be proud of. so i was swept up and within a month i was enrolled. then they paid my first months rent and i was set to go. i had my ""interview"" which was a joke. they gave me a tour of a church i had already been too and talked up the program and then told me i was in. well on my first day i felt like a fish out of water i did not know anyone there and they were WAY more committed to their church than i ever was to mine, they basically lived there. not to mention the man that was in charge of it all pastor dan. he was a real life, grown up bully. he made petty jokes about me constantly and picked on the other man  (who was a 50 something year old man) i was there with my church. i should take a minute to explain my church siuation, you see there are these things called ""chain churches"" and they have separate locations all over the state and they all answer to the same head pastor guy in a bigger city. well the church i was working for was about 50 miles away from the church where i attended the internship. in the internship it was myself and another guy and we drove the 50 miles four days out of the week to be at the church by six. and immediately for some reason pastor dan began making my life more difficult and making petty jokes about my fingers (i have two missing fingers on my left hand). it was an awful experience but i kept going cause at the end of the day all i wanted was to help these kids. well as you may have guessed the church stopped paying my rent and food and with the hours we were at the internship (6 am to 5 pm) i could not find a job. the pastor from the church i was working with had the idea to move me into the house with the other man i was at the internship with. and that is when it got really bad. you see the family that i was staying with had a very very different idea of how a youth leader should behave, you see i was 20 by then and i had a circle of friends that i was very close with and not all of them went to my church and some no church at all. i want to pause here again, i can honestly say that my friends in that town were the only thing that kept me sane, they would be the ones who i would complain to about the emotional torment i endured because of dan and the others at the internship. they were amazing and i could not ask for more loyal friends in my life. but back to the story, if i were to come home late, late being 10pm or later, the family i was staying with would lock me out. sometimes i would stay with friends, sometimes i would stay in a car and a couple times i stayed in my old house (it had not been rented out yet, and i still had the key). and to some that seems reasonable but the thing is, even if they were awake they would not come to the door to let me in. and sometimes the accptable time to come home was 9 sometimes it was 8 sometimes it was even after dinner. i had no way of knowing when i came home whether i would have a place to sleep or not. and meanwhile back at the legion of doom (i had to) the internship had a new class starting adding like 8 or 9 kids that were fresh out of high school. now out of these kids i knew like 4 of them from different church functions and they are still some of the few people who still will talk to me, and i will always respect them for that. but the others, were not so accepting. once again i felt like an outsider at home, an outsider at the internship, and an outsider in my own church, for dan had been sending my pastor letters and emails about my dismal performance at the internship. and to be fair i was having a really hard time with motivating myself to try any harder because no matter how well i did dan would have some petty comment to say to me so i just gave up.well fast forward about two months and i was living with my parents in my old house, again. but i still had to find a way to ludington every weekend (for because of my epilepsy i did not have a drivers license). well after the first year of the internship i had to find a job and found one again in the town my church was in moved back up with yet another church connection. and after two days their mind was changed so i moved into my car by the lake in northern Michigan in January. needless to say it was an awful experience. but i pushed through and tried to find a job where i did not work with a person from the church because i was getting ready to step down. i had enough. well i was fortunate enough to move in with one of the friends i mentioned before.  i never did find a job in that town but i lived rent free with that friend for almost a year before i moved back to my hometown with my dad. i left the church i stepped down. now that is not how i became an atheist, that is simply why i left the church, when i did i researched the other side, read Dawkins, read Sagan read anything i could get on the ""world without the god glasses"". and that is how i became an atheist. but i would have never done that if i never left the church, you see we had a strict reading list being a part of church leadership. and it was not a list of books to read, it was a list of books not read, at the top of the list was The God Delusion by Dawkins. after i left i immediately read it and realized why i was not supposed to, it makes perfect sense. i, someday, would like to thank him for writing that book as many former christians would, and i hope someday i hope to be able to do that.
so that it it r/atheism, i did not write this for sympathy i wrote this to show people what i have been through in the name of religion. i still have lingering guilt and a sometimes crippling fear of hell (even though i know its illogical) but i am 23 now living on my own in a house and working to go to school in April of next year. thank you for taking the time to read this

synul,0,2012-04-29,A post you all hate- Texas girl moving to Chicago over the summer. Never lived in the city before.,habi12,chicago,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/synul/a_post_you_all_hate_texas_girl_moving_to_chicago/,"I've been holding back on posting because I know how much you guys hate it when we post things like this but….

I'm moving to Chicago this summer (May-August) and will be living in The Loop. I was offered an internship there and gladly accepted. I currently live in Texas and have lived here ALL of my life. I have never stayed anywhere else for a long period of time other than on trips. 

I heard you don't all have A/C in the north, is this true? How hot does it get over the summer? I know it probably won't get anywhere near our kind of hot (100+) but what do you consider hot? Weird question but it's been bugging me.

Also another thing I have never experienced is the public transit. Everywhere I go, here, is by car. I am not bringing my car because I'll be in the Loop and I don't want to have to deal with everything that comes with a car. Do you have any suggestions as to using public transit? I'm 22 (f) college senior doing an internship for a web/graphic design firm.

Basically any info would be great. What goes on in the city during the summer? How do I get groceries? Are there farmer's markets in the loop? Any good vegetarian/vegan places in the loop?

I'm freaking out, I move in 2 weeks and just found out about it! 


EDIT: Thanks for all the down votes! At least I got answers out of it."
syl5l,21,2012-04-29,"Reddit, I'm worried I'm being taken advantage of at my job. What do I do? ",raawrcupcakes,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/syl5l/reddit_im_worried_im_being_taken_advantage_of_at/,"I'll start by saying that I'm incredibly fortunate not only to be employed, but to be working in a function that I find both challenging and fun. I get to write all day. I'm a big fan of my job. It's pretty rad. 

That said, I've been working like crazy. I'm technically entry level (graduated from college last May, and have been working for this company ever since), but I'm in charge of producing writing for upwards of 10 clients at a time. For reference, I'm under the impression that similar positions elsewhere assign writers between 1-4 clients at all. The company I work for is mid-sized-ish, but it's primarily staffed by designers and coders. With the exception of my employers, I'm the only writer around. 

On the one hand, this is a great opportunity. On the other, I'm routinely expected to do things I'm not sure an entry-level employee can/should do. For example, 6 months in they had me train an intern to do a job I was just learning how to do. Now I'm getting two juniors and another intern, which is stressing me out a bit. 

I'm also stretched thin writing for everything under the sun *[edit: I had a list of thing I'm working on, but I'm not sure it's a clear example. Let's just say that I'm expected to be churning out between 5,000 - 10,000 words a day].* This consistently requires me working not only from 9:30am-7:30pm (standard day), but also usually a whole day on weekends, as well as when I get home from work and a bit when I wake up. In other words, this job has swallowed my life whole. 

Here's the issue -- or, I guess, one out of a number of issues. I've not been promoted, and my pay has not been substantially raised. I'm 100% sure that what I'm doing doesn't constitute entry-level, ""junior"" work. But that's the level of my title and certainly of my compensation. My company is aware of this and they aren't interested in changing what happening, because I'm fairly cheap and moderately skilled labor. They're underpaying me and overworking me, and it won't stop.

I don't know how to go about fixing this. I've repeatedly asked my bosses and HR to help me define my role at the company, and they usually dodge the conversation and the issue is never resolved. I asked for a review and title change, and they kind of said yes but nothing actually happened. I'm completely overextended, and every attempt at establishing some more reasonable work structure has not worked. 

What do I do? Am I asking the wrong questions? Should I just be demanding a change? Should I leave the company? Should I be happy I like my job and quit it with the complaining? 

**TL;DR: I'm underpaid and overworked, and being asked to tackle things above my level of experience. I've tried to reduce my workload and talk it through with management, but I just get assigned more work. How do I fix this?**"
sykc5,0,2012-04-29,Job Offer: be my Secretary / Coach,garoththorp,uwaterloo,https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/sykc5/job_offer_be_my_secretary_coach/,"**TL;DR** I'll pay you (negotiable: 50$/week) to manage my schedule and nag me to get things done on time.

I think the greatest challenge I've had during my stay at school has been time management. I'm just awful at it. The related problem is that it's taken me a few years and several failed courses to realize that this is something I'm terrible at. What I need is someone to pretty much make me accountable for my time, and force me, contractually to do the things that I should be doing -- while resisting the urge to point out how much of a lazy arse I am.

**So here's my proposition:**

I pass off some fairly simple tasks to you, such as handing you my assignment papers and having you make sure my calendar is correctly kept. Then once the datapoints are there for when I need to have things in by, you'd figure out about how long it'd take, and schedule time for me to do it -- and check back later to make sure that I'm actually on track. Basically, the goal is to ""mentor"" me to get my stuff done on time, and create accountability.

I don't generally require tutoring or anything of that sort; I'm just lazy. This position would basically be a cross between an executive assistant style job, and a coaching style job where you yell at me do extra pushups.

My only prerequisite for this position would be that you're also not a lazy sort of person, so some proof of you actually getting stuff done in your own time would be nice (decent grades or something). I guess some psychology courses would be helpful, though not mandatory.

I figure a fair salary would be about 50$ a week -- since really, it shouldn't take much time at all to manage a calendar and phone / text me occasionally. Should go a long way to covering weekly living costs if you're trying to save money. We can negotiate the price when we meet.

Anyway, so just send me a private message on Reddit here for extra information / to schedule a time to meet up on campus. Thanks for reading.

**My Background:**

I'm a 22 year old male computer scientist. I've finished all of my internships and am on my last few semesters of school. In general, I'm a fairly sociable guy and interested in philosophy and startups. In my spare time, I like to play board games and video games -- the usual."

I'm definitely going to ask about availability of internships and research partnerships, as well as try and get some contact details for alumni.  Both have a focus that is compatible with my interests.

I'm curious what people in the community would want to know about a program when choosing, given your hindsight is probably better than my forethought.  What do you wish you had asked programs before making your decision?  What subtle things set one apart from another?

sye9z,11,2012-04-29,RPG: innovation concerning quests?,zegazefazfa,Games,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/sye9z/rpg_innovation_concerning_quests/,"Hi,

I've been playing RPGs for a long time (lands of lore, might and magic 4/5, BG1/2, fallouts, morrowind, witchers, skyrim...) and been enjoying them at different level (I have to admit that I've been kinda disapointed in the more recent ones, and more and more seeing thru the ""tricks"" of gameplay/mechanics now more than before). Lands of Lore still feels like the game where I was the most immersed, I was younger, and did not ""see through"" the gameplay but just enjoyed the story and atmosphere.

Now what is my problem? Quests (and stories).

I don't know if it's me getting older (29) or just having worked for the industry for a brief time (game design internship @ ubisoft) but I can't help but call off the bullshit of the way games are rolling out in front of my eyes: get this, pick this, kill x, go there, hide and kill y, wait in the dark ... 

Now that I'm older **it seems that the story is just a way to interconnect gameplay/mechanics one after another** and not the other way around (gameplay supporting the story). Everything feels cheap.


*The Basics*  
- My question is, is it possible to get rid of the fetch/kill quests that make up 99% of the actions were supposed to do?

*The false innovation*  
- And even the so called innovative gameplay is most of the time gimmicks. Meaning, that you ""feel"" that you are just here to roll out the specific gameplay, the ""scene"" was just waiting for you to do as told and that's it. (the way they inject random ""new"" gameplay mechanics at some point of the game (sneak, snipe...))

----------------------
**Quick idea:**  
Most of times it seems that the quests (3 basic types fetch/kill/find) are the way the story advance. So you're not living the story but you're just makeing it advance acting as you are told to within the framework of these mechanics.

(a)--&gt;(b1/b2/b3)--&gt;(c1/c2/c3)

If you are in city A and the story must roll out towards city B, you're not going there on you're own, for you own reasons (except maybe in Morrowind, very unique game), you go there because you have to go thru a specific task.

See, stories in RPGs are often a series of tasks. If you realize that, you feel cheated. When I was 12 I could pretend I didnt see that, now I can't anymore (I am struggling to finish skyrim because of that).

An idea I had, would be that the story plays out, with you going along the world, geographically or timely or with dialogues, and ACTIONS/EVENTS happen along the way.

Take Skyrim such a big WASTED, i repeat, wasted, by making you go from point a to b to c to d, in a crazy manner, zig zaging across the map! It's insane.

Proof? I often try to FORCE myself to roleplay (miss things, walk more, take actions that are more in character rather than mix maxing, try to travel in a logical way - ie not jumping from quests to quests like a mad man across the map)  to kinda enjoy the game! WHAT a gamedesign if the player has to PRETEND and BEND the gameplay in order to enjoy it!

I would like, once, a game where the kill/fetch quests are the exception. Let say you are the hero warrior, so you start somewhere, and then take on a journey with friends, to a certain direction and things HAPPEN along the way! not the other way around (things happening force you to travel &lt; you lose control, you're  puppet just pushing button to make the story advance!)

In some ways, older FPS (doom) are way more logical! You move forward the world, and things happen : magic and amazements!

Can we discuss this? Thank you."

I recently met this wonderful, amazing girl and we have so much in common. We talk for hours and flirt back and forward.  We also live fairly close to each other, we met on reddit by pure chance. I really like her, though I think I fell for her way to fast so I attempted to back away, logically speaking we met about a month and a half ago, so me feeling anything for her freaked me out but I have come to accept it. She had several bad experiences with people so I can see why she hesitates but it only makes me even more logical. Logistically speaking this is a bad idea and I should run and forget. Focus on finals, my internship, and summer courses. Leave all silly romantic feelings aside. But alas feeling always seem to get in the way. I can not for the life of me focus on anything but wanting to hear her voice, the sound of her laugh, and holding her in my arms promising never to hurt her. We havent spoken in a couple of days, going from speaking every night to nothing makes me sad. 


So What should I do? 
Be my logical self forget and focus on my work and summer plans.

sy0ji,2,2012-04-29,Importance of Master's Degree?,kampyo,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/sy0ji/importance_of_masters_degree/,"Hey r/Accounting! I was wondering if some of you already in the working world might be able to give some advice. 

After dabbling in a bunch of other majors, I returned to school for a bachelor's in accounting. My program is well regarded within my state, but not so much nationally. I've been pulling good grades and have a Big 4 internship secured for next year, which just so happens to be the  year I graduate. Because of my rampant indecisiveness, I have well over the 150 hrs required for the CPA and would be eligible to sit in May.
 
HOWEVER-

I was speaking with one of my accy professors and let it slip how I daydreamed about going to UT Austin, and how if I was going to get a master's, I would want to get it there. She casually mentioned that she had an old connection there, and hinted if I wanted to go it was VERY POSSIBLE that I could get in (yikes that sounds fishy. I really am a good student. I have a high GPA and the highest grade in this professor's class). 

I didn't quite know how to respond. Part of me wants to get out and go to work, but part of me thinks a master's might come in handy some day...especially from UT Austin. I know the masters probably won't matter for a staff position, but would it be a good career move when considering, I don't know, a move to Sr/manager? Or even a move to industry after I put in my time in public? Would I be just fine as long as I get my CPA? 

Other factors: I've never lived outside the midwest and have always gone to school in areas surrounded by cornfields. Austin would be AWESOME. But I could also really love starting work and having money and not being 30K in debt.

**TLDR: I have 150 credits w/o getting my master's. Will getting my master's be beneficial in future career moves or will no one care after I have my CPA?**"

I'm looking for something smooth where we can talk and who don't really look like the common pub ! I was thinking at first a tapas pub (bar à tapas) where you can eat, enjoy a bit of a meal, drink and still not as formal as a proper dinor.

I'm used to paris but left when i was 15/16 and since I only went with friend so you really don't care of the place ! Just went back for my internship so I have no idea where to find place like this ! 

If you have any idea (maybe other than tapas pub), feel free to say :)

I am coming in knowing no one in Davis. 

I'll be living in west davis since I want a more mellow home life and I've heard W. Davis is the more mellow part of Davis. I also wanted to live in a house vs an apartment since I am coming with a drumset and I would like to practice regularly again, having lived at an apartment for a year now. 

However, I do like partying and want to jump into the Davis party scene. What are some good ways to jump into said party scene knowing no one in Davis? Would it be good to start at bars and maybe migrate to parties post bar times? It has been a while since I've had to essentially restart my social life in a new area so I'm a bit rusty as far as making a new start goes. Any help appreciated."

Hey r/loseit, I need some help when I come home from college over the summer. I recently got laid off from my summer internship, so I have PLENTY of free time with which I will probably spend most of it indoors doing nothing but eating/not moving (Like the lazy engineer I am).  I play rugby and soccer up in school, but without these motivators over the summer, I fear that I'll just stack on the pounds like I've done before.

Though I'm not huge, I do have a lot I need to lose, and I heard you guys know what you're talking about when it comes to motivation and eating/exercise advice."

[Hint: hit enter twice to create a break/paragraph.  Wall of text is difficult to read.  With that out of the way, thanks for the AMA, it sounds interesting.  What are the salaries like for your work?  Or is it more like contractor work, paid by the job?  I would think public speaking skills are important, to appear credible/likeable if you need to testify in court. I'm assuming court testimony is part of the deal, but have no clue - is it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hp7zk?context=5)|Salaries are competitive with those of Civil Engineers in conventional areas. Yes, testimony can be part of the deal. But most of the time a case will never see the court room.

[What is the most bizarre accident you've ever had to reconstruct? One that really made you wonder how the hell they managed it?  Edit: spelling.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hogw5?context=5)|My boss told me about the case, which happened long before I started doing this type of work. Based on the story he told me, I requested the set of depositions. My intention was to write a story based on them; they are Cohen Brothers script quality stories. I need to put it in motion.
[Is it harder to reconstruct an accident when ABS brakes are involved (due to fewer skid marks\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hoj8r?context=5)|Slightly harder, but nowadays vehicles are equipped to record a long period of pre-crash data through the Airbag system. This, along with damage to the vehicle tells the rest of the story.
[How much historical data do those units record, i.e. is it recorded if the airbag doesn't deploy, and how far back does the information go?  Thanks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hpeeb?context=5)|There are two types of events that are recorded in the Airbag module. Most auto manufacturers since about the year 2000 are equipped with such devices. This varies from make to make. The event can be a deployment event, in which the bumper sensor tells the computer to deploy the airbag; usually at higher speeds. Also, non deployments get recorded at times, these are low speed impacts which tell the computer not to deploy the airbag. The amount of time and data recorded vary. Typically you'll see information such as driver seat buckle on or of, speed 5 seconds before deployment, brake on or of, accelerator throttle, etc.
[Do you need some sort of authorization from the owner to get this information from the airbag module?  EDIT: 'Black boxes' (event data recorders\) mandatory for new cars in 2015. Source.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hq7uy?context=5)|This varies from state to state. In my state, It is necessary for us to fill out a form signed by whoever has taken ownership of the vehicle post accident.
[So bumper sensors actually exist? I didn't think cars actually had airbag deployment sensors housed in the bumper, it sounds like an easy way to have an accidental deployment. I thought they deployed based on the input from a few accelerometers.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hstus?context=5)|It's a combination of both: [Link to en.wikipedia.org](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbag#How_airbags_work)
[If I wanted to remove the computer after an accident, where would I look for it?  Different on every car I'm sure, but you must know some general ltips (under the hood, inside the dash, you tell me.\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hrp8k?context=5)|[Link to www.cdr-system.com](http://www.cdr-system.com/pdf/CDR_v5.0_Vehicle_Coverage_List.pdf)

I can imagine many subjects which would be beneficial, but none that would encompass all of the skills I presume need to be possessed.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hom9n?context=5)|I have a Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering as well as several accident reconstruction and software courses.
[Whow. you were a civil engineer and switched into this ? If you dont mind me asking, what is the more lucrative career ? (I'm on my way to becoming a civil engineer. I don't ask because I plan to switch, just because I'm curious\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4htdt0?context=5)|They're pretty well aligned monetarily, though in this line of work I travel a whole lot.

[Ah thanks, and is it fight-club-like travel i.e. short, in/out trips or do you ever get time off to sight-see etc ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4htgns?context=5)|Travel varies from  2 days to 4 or so. I get to meet a lot of interesting people and eat at a lot of great hidden treasure like places. From time to time I'll end up in a city where I know people and we'll have dinner, etc.
[Has the job changed the way you drive? Are you more wary of the dangers of driving, or put off certain brands of car?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hp0i7?context=5)|My job has changed the way drive indeed. I try to be very observant while driving through intersections. 
[If I'm driving behind someone and they purposefully slam their brakes to get me to rear end them, and there are no witnesses, can you prove that the accident was their fault?  And how?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4homro?context=5)|It'd be difficult to prove that. The gold standard seems to be that the rear ender is usually at fault. If you can prove that his brake lights were not functioning before the collision, then you may have a case.
[Is it remotely possible to prove that the brake lights weren't working? Without the use of a dash-cam.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4houpa?context=5)|There's a method in which you analyze the filament of a light bulb of a car involved in a collision. If it's streched it means the lights were hot (on) when it got struck, if it's a brittle fracture it's likely the lights were off. This makes a decent argument.
[Is it possible, at least in some scenarios, to examine tire marks to determine what happened? you'd think that the front driver suddenly slamming on the breaks would leave a trail on the asphalt.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hp2bm?context=5)|Yes. The deceleration rate (usually in units of g's or gravity-32.2 ft/s) is dependent upon condition of tires (new or old), surface details (new asphalt, grass, etc) and weather surfaces (rain, snow). A typical deceleration rate is 0.7 g's for normal wear tires on pavement.
[But if you get rear ended the tail lights more often than not get damaged. what happens if the lightbulbs were crushed in the accident?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hp6dh?context=5)|You'd be surprised how well the filament will hold up 
[How much fun is it, after you've investigated the skid patterns, debris, etc. to prove in court that someone was clearly lying about their speed, etc.?  Also, what's the craziest accident you've ever had to reconstruct, or the most challenging?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hobqv?context=5)|Challenging involves multiple vehicles usually. There was this one where a tractor trailer was coming down a ramp at a rapid speed while merging onto the highway, the truck flipped on its side and vehicles traveling on the highway collided with it. There was a ton of evidence marks and speeds had to be determined for three different vehicles.
[How did you get into that line of work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hoaf2?context=5)|I started an internship while in college, liked it and stuck with it. 
[What is the most fucked up accident you saw?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hpe9c?context=5)|There was one where a farm vehicle was carrying a large wooden post horizontally and aligned with the horizon for approaching traffic (I hope that makes sense). He was driving on the side of the road and the wooden post was hovering above the lane of travel. A passenger truck drove through it and it seemed as thought the passenger who got hit by the post had literally exploded.  The farm owner was liable for damages.
[Do you work for a state, city or county agency?  How long was the course you had to take to become an accident reconstructionist (yes, it is not something you just learn ""on the job""\)?  How many years have you done this? and of course, worst accidents you've had to be on scene for?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hox3w?context=5)|I work for an independent third party. I've gone through several courses. I have a BS in Civil Engineering and took a 2 week course in Northwestern University. I've been doing this now for 7 yrs. Worst accidents are usually the ones involving families and head on collisions. There was one where the truck driver was impinged onto a tractor trailer while it was on fire. He was still alive and communicating before he died. I get to read many pages of depositions where all the unpleasant details come out.
[Do you find that people driving larger (non-commercial\) vehicles tend to cause more accidents?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hovcf?context=5)|That's a loaded question. Kidding. Well truck drivers are operating a machine about 16 times the weight of the average passenger vehicle and traveling at similar speeds. They carry more energy and have a larger tendency to be involved in accidents. Also their perception/reaction time is longer so they have less distance to work with.
[Do you ever analyze vehicles that were struck by a train? If so, does that involve different or more complex analysis than car-on-car collisions?  What's your hourly rate? Does it change for serving as an expert witness? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hp7p0?context=5)|A train decelerates much much slower than tires on pavement. Investigating an accident involving a train requires permission from the railroad companies as well as research and evidence documentation. Were there cross bucks and gates? Lights? As far as methodology, it can be analyzed as a conservation of momentum case.
[If someone were to make ridiculous House/Psyche/CSI dramatization of what you do with you as the quirky dick of a reconstructionist genius solving the most important car crashes ... ya know, Princess Diana shit... who would you like to play you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hpc9e?context=5)|Will Ferrell.
[What kind of advice would you have for road users?  What do you think is realistically possible? (With these two I mean like, licensing changes? policy change? whatever, etc.\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hpkhs?context=5)|I'd advice to pay attention always, especially when on high speed highways. Don't travel when tired, intoxicated, etc.
[Have you heard of SATAI?  Perhaps you have friends who are members.  What is your opinion of the organization?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hox69?context=5)|I have. I am not from that state, but I am a member because I took a course with them. Accident Reconstruction associations are generally reputable; most of them are made up of ex-police officers.
[So, my dad is a Marine Corps lifer.. and for a good portion of his career as a military police officer he doubled as an accident investigator. For a long time, he had a sawed in half tire filled with cement and a chain hanging out of it that lived in our garage. I assume it was some homemade instrument he used for teaching himself about tread marks.. I dunno. Anyway, during this particular part of his career I was conveniently learning how to drive. He decided one evening to show me pictures of some investigations he had been working on in an effort to scare me into driving more safely. It worked. I got my own Red Asphalt lesson right in our living room. My question is... have there been any particular accidents that have really shaken you or stuck with you throughout your career? Do you feel you drive more carefully knowing things like how fast your car will continue to travel after you hit the brakes if you're going 80 down the highway?  *Edit* - I accidentally a word.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hpjki?context=5)|That's called a drag sled ([Link to www.gazettenet.com](http://www.gazettenet.com/files/images/20100524-232949-pic-5669238.display.jpg))
 |Police photos of a really bad accident are not very pleasant, but I've become a little more desensitized over time. I imagine people in the medical field have to adjust similarly. Working around death certainly lets me know to live my personal life to the fullest. And I'm not perfect driver, but I abide by all driving laws and try to share the road as much as possible.

[Curious if you subscribe to the same sort of skepticism presented by the narrator in Fight Club when he's talking about analyzing accidents for the big corps. Do you feel there is that sort of jaded humanity-minimization element in the car industry, having seen their work first hand?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4htauc?context=5)|Well this element can be translated well into other fields like the food industry for example. It was striking to find out that there are economic analysis companies that will put a pricetag on how much a deceased person involved in an accident is worth, based on age, profession and expected lifespan.
[How do you feel working with cars in which people have died?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hp62i?context=5)|It's strange to come across brain matter and other bodily fluids during a vehicle inspection; certainly not my cup of tea.

Thanks for the AMA!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hp3cj?context=5)|I believe an insurance adjustor commented on an earlier thread that most of insurance fraud is medical billing. People generally lie about how fast they were going.
[What percentage of accidents you've investigated actually involved fraud, e.g. people intentionally crashing into things?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hp76w?context=5)|This is a very low percentage. Fraud usually comes in the form of people claiming hail damage when a closer look reveals that the marks were done by small hammer or so.
[Why do you use the term accident, as opposed to crash or incident?  Some are quite clearly done on purpose.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hoozz?context=5)|Accident and collision are interchangeable.

Has anyone ever threatened you or intimidated you because of your testimony?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hsger?context=5)|We do a lot of visibility testing. In fact, we have these glasses with a camera dot on the center of the eyes. We get a hold of someone the same height to wear them in the driver seat and record different points of view. This tool proved important in a case where a truck driver didn't see a pedestrian crossing as he accelerated after being stopped and therefore collided with the pedestrian. The case settled for an undisclosed amount.
[Is there any make or model of car that you wouldn't buy based on some insight you gained from your line of work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hq7uk?context=5)|Well I would just stay away from a vehicle like the mini cooper or anything that's so low and small that it may give you a disadvantage against a larger and more common vehicle, like a Ford F150.
[Is text messaging at the time of the accident frequently looked into?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hq7uk?context=5)|Over the past few years I've noticed more and more attorneys request phone records of people involved in accidents to see if they may have been texting or on the phone at the time of the accident.
[I drive a reconstructed vehicle which has previously been in an accident. How much more difficult would that make your job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hqzcu?context=5)|If your vehicle has a salvage title, chances are that after it was rebuilt, the airbags were not present. If these are not present, then there is no report filed by the module.  As far as analyzing the damage to your vehicle, we usually run a carfax report on the vehicles we investigate for that same reason.
[In a middle school math class, we had a police officer come in to give us an overview of accident reconstruction (specifically using skid marks and thugs to determine speed at an accident...many years ago do I don't remember much\). Do some areas leave this type of investigation up to law enforcement only? How closely do you work with LEOs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hqzcu?context=5)|We have a good working relation with the local Police department.
[I have always wondered this. With the increase in vehicle safety systems, such as 10 airbag equipped vehicles, preemptive brakes, pre tensioning belts and rollover sensors, are people surviving auto crashes better then vehicles without these systems in place? I drive a 98 Lexus ES300. Am i more likely to die in a collision in that vehicle versus a 2012 Lexus with more advanced safety features?  What would you consider a ""safe"" vehicle? what would you consider a ""dangerous"" vehicle? thanks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hu3au?context=5)|A safe vehicle, in my opinion, is one of low rollover propensity (center of mass is lower, but not too low). Obviously the more airbags you add the better. Side curtains make a vehicle safer. My boss switched from Ford to Nissan a few years back because Nissan offers side airbags.
[I'm currently taking a course on Traffic Theory (Criminal Justice degree\) and we just studied a major 3-scene crash that happened on I-43 near Sheboygan, WI, in 2002. 50 vehicles were involved, 39 people injured, and 10 people fatally injured. What's the most messed up accident you've had to reconstruct?  Also -- what is your education? Are you employed with the IL State Police? Thanks for doing this AMA!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hr1ru?context=5)|I have a degree in Engineering and I've taken several courses as well. I am employed by a third party company. We saw a similar case to that in Phoenix that occurred during a sand storm. Several trucking companies were involved and I believe two people perished.
[Might get buried but, any cool tips and tricks of the trade? Like any cool little details that says a lot about what has happened during a car crash? (Sort of like what you've mentioned already about the brake lights and filament\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hs81a?context=5)|Thank you all for your interest. I contemplated for a while as to whether to do an AMA or not but so far 3/4 of the response has been positive. I'm semi-new to reddit.
[Thanks for doing the AMA your work seems very interesting.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hs81a?context=5)|As far as tricks of the trade goes I can think of only a couple of things. A major tip I can share is that if you're ever involved in a vehicular accident, whether it's your fault or not, take a high amount of photographs and remember that everything you say initially will end up in a police document at one point or another. If the accident is severe enough, hire an attorney. We live in a litigious society.
[How much data is being recorded by the car?  How many of driving is recorded at a given time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hsaq8?context=5)|This varies from  make to year of manufacture.

[Do you use the drag sled?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hpo6c?context=5)|No, we use a GPS accelerometer ([Link to www.vericomcomputers.com](http://www.vericomcomputers.com)) and brake suddenly at the accident scene to acquire a deceleration value under those conditions.
[Was your job accurately portrayed in fight club?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hysvo?context=5)|Tyler Durden (or Jack)  was product recall specialist for an unnamed car company, where as I work for an independent employer hired by insurance companies, attorneys and sometimes the State generally in order to figure out speeds of vehicles involved..
[What sort of computer program do you use?  Was it bought or did someone make it?  What variables are commonly used? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hqvji?context=5)|We use a number of programs for different functions. PC Crash is a brilliant piece of software for simulation/animation of accidents. We also use AutoCAD and Sketchup video trial exhibits.
[Can you tell if someone's headlights or turn signal were on at the time of a collision?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hqied?context=5)|Inspecting the filament int he bulb, if stretchted it's likely it was running hot (on) when the collision happened. This is known as hot shock. If the break of the filament is brittle or if it's undamaged, it's likely the lights were off. This is cold shock.
[Saw that you have a BS in civil engineering, and was wondering if this was a job you could get with any bachelors degree or if you had to be more specialized? I realize you went through some specific training, but did the engineering degree make it easier to be accepted into the more specialized training?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4htxrs?context=5)|There are ex-police officers who do this, but generally an engineering firm will have more credibility because of a solid background knowledge of mathematics and physics. This job is suited for a civil (because of the transportation aspect of it) and mechanical (because of vehicular failures in brakes, engine, etc.) engineer. Yes, the engineering degree made it much easier.
[Personally, I have a bachelors and masters degree in music, but would like to switch careers for a little while (just burnt out of the music scene\).

[I am a Biomechanical engineer with a Phd, and have been looking for forensic injury biomechanics positions with consulting companies like Exponent and other smaller companies. Problem is I am fresh out of school so companies are not willing to hire me because I don't have any experience. I know with many of these companies Accident Reconstructionists and Injury Biomechanists work side by side for many of the cases. Would you have any recommendations for me where to look? Will taking that two week course at Northwestern help (I am right here in Chicago\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hsudv?context=5)|It's usually the company who would pay for something like that, but if you can't get employment after a while, it may be a good investment to look into. I would recommend getting a linked in account and preparing a nice profile of your resume. Also, ""follow"" and join groups relating to this field; i.e. forensic engineering companies and accident reconstruction as well.
[Also, when you reconstruct accidents, can you tell by the angle at which the tire rutting departs from the roadway whether the driver was executing an evasive maneuver or just drifted off the road?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4i074o?context=5)|The heading angle of skids and how gradual the drift is can be helpful if there are pre-skids left, other wise only impact gouges tell whether somebody drifted onto oncoming traffic, etc.
[Did this change the way you drive somehow? What are the most common mistakes you've seen that have caused accidents?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hq2r9?context=5)|Well the nastiest accidents involve vehicles crashing at high speeds in opposite direction (head on collision). These tend to happen on two lane divided highways (usually about 75MPH speed limit). People drive tired, or are distracted somehow and go left of center.
[If you're still in Illinois, were you part of the investigation of the crash that killed 3 teens in Prospect Heights or had any insider info in that case?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hsa37?context=5)|No I was not. I only spent 2 weeks in Evanston for the class.
[I am a licensed engineer and have noticed job postings everywhere I look (newspaper, craisglist, monster, etc.\) for licensed engineers to do forensics work. I have even gotten letters in the mail trying to recruit me, I assume they got my info from the list of PE's in my state.  So is your field *really* short on engineers right now? Is this some sort of scam?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hu6v9?context=5)|Well anytime multiple vehicles are involved, all attorneys will schedule vehicle inspections so that all experts involved are present at the same time. In my part of the country, there does not seem to be a shortage.
[Is there a way to get information on an accident that occurred more than 30 years ago?  Also, is it possible to use that information, should it conflict with an official story or confirm a suspicion, as evidence for wrongful death?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hqlzr?context=5)|The more time has passed since an event, the more difficult is to work with and to prove.

Is photogrammetry accurate? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4husrw?context=5)|Photogrammetry has a good degree of accuracy. We acquire the coefficient of friction by using a GPS accelerometer and breaking hard at the accident scene at those conditions.
[Have you ever any investigations in SE Wisconsin?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hpl7o?context=5)|No.

(i.e. degree or certificate?\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/swyv4/iama_accident_reconstructionist_i_investigate/c4hsry3?context=5)|ACTAR certification. It's moslty ex-police officers who do this work, but dedicated engineering firms do it too, and its competitiveness is growing.

It's a definite hobby of mine. I'm hoping some people in the IT field or people with this job can tell me more about what I can do with it. I'm trying to get an internship as well as I was told it was very important to get before i graduate. So has anyone received this degree or work with people who have this degree?

MLC vs. Modules",thaFknBirdTho,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/sxt28/passed_p_fm_mfe_pending_results_options_for_how/,"Hello all, first post in this subreddit. To give some background about myself, I go to the  University of Connecticut and have a week left in my junior year. This summer I will be working for a health insurance company and it will be my second internship. I just took MFE last weekend and felt great about 27 of the 30 problems. 

I have been thinking a lot about how to spend my 7th and 8th semesters, and where I would like to be 12-15 months from now. One options is to take MLC, either in November or May. This seems to be the most natural, however it would require me to basically give up a month of college social life at one point or another leading up to the exam.  The option that my parents have suggested would be to relax and enjoy my senior year. Only go to college once, right? Anyway, the option I am most curious about is to take the FAP Modules. Here are my thoughts and questions:

* I have heard that this can be done in 4 months or so, leaving me to believe that if I spread it out from now through summer 2013 it would not be too stressful. Are the statement and my assumption from it correct? 

* Is there any reason that taking the modules before MLC and C would make the whole process more difficult for me?

* How does this strategy look to potential employers?

* With this path, my first exam while transitioning to a full time job will be MLC rather than C. I have very little experience with C, whereas I took two courses on MLC. How big of a factor should this be?


Thanks for any help you have with this! Also just created a AO account to post there as well. "

Him: 22

So my SO and I started dating a year+ ago. We're both attend A&amp;M, except he is graduating in a few weeks and is moving to Houston, which is just an hour away, to work. I still have two more years of college left. He broke up with me because he feels like he can't handle the long distance.

Background information:
He's graduating with a petroleum engineer degree. His job will require him to travel to oil rigs during his training until he finally gets settled into an office in Houston, which may take six months to two years. He's living with his parent during this time.

He says during his freshmen year, he tried a long distance relationship with his high school girlfriend, but it didn't work. (Again, it was about an hour and a half away.) During last summer, he was working as an intern while I went to summer school. He almost broke up with me then because of the distance (this probably should've forshadowed what is going on now.)

Is there anyway I could convince him that we could make it work? We still love each other and it would be such a shame to just throw this relationship away like that.

TLDR; Can /r/relationships give my boyfriend advice about going through a not so very long distance relationship? What can I say to reassure him?"

I am currently a senior (c/o 2013) in college pursing majors in Philosophy and Political Science and a minor in Computer Science. I had initially planned to go to law school after graduating, but after spending two years working as a paralegal, I realized law is not for me, but Computer Science, in fact, is.

As I am so far into my degree program already (24 credits stand between me and graduation at this point), I have settled for minoring in Computer Science and keeping my original majors. I realize that a minor in CS will not get me anywhere employment-wise, so I am looking into applying to and enrolling in a “transitional” Computer Science master’s program aimed at people moving into CS from a non-technical field.

I have a few questions related to my situation:

* Will potential employers look down on me for having an undergraduate background in a non-technical field, or will the fact that I’m pursuing graduate education entirely trump that? 

* What can I do over this last year of undergrad to make myself an attractive candidate to potential employers despite my non-traditional background? I doubt I’ll be able to get a relevant internship since I’m only a minor and not a major, so what sorts of personal projects should I be looking into buff up my resume? Any ideas on networking to make contacts in the field?

* Am I being fatalistic to assume that I won’t be able to find work in the field until I complete my master’s and thus have a bona-fide CS degree or will I be able to job hunt with any degree of reasonable success once  I have a CS master’s in progress?

* Is there anything else I should know that I’ve failed to even touch upon?

After I graduated from a physics program, I got an unpaid internship to pass the time until I got a job, that was almost 2 years ago. I just can't find my footing. 
  
I have friends from all stages of my life, but they are all so busy with school and work that I am hardly social these days. For my internship I work mostly by myself and I go straight home. When I am at home I reload facebook and reddit all day, if that. I've been eating right and exercising lately, but even that's slipping. I just have less motivation to take as good care of myself as I should be, because I am doing next to nothing in life and I have nothing to apply my aspirations to.  
  
I thought I was getting better at being friendly and sociable. Someone I met a few months ago told me just that I came off as very cold. I really thought I was getting better at this. Was I even worse before? I don't know. I know I still can't hold a normal conversation to save my life unless the other person is carrying it, but I still thought I was getting better.  
  
I wasn't raised right. I'm trying so hard to get over all of the wrong things that I grew up accepting as fact. It seems impossible. I just don't know how many more days I can spend doing next to nothing. I stopped taking the medicine last summer, and I stopped the therapy about a year and a half ago.

All of that isn't enough time to study. I can't keep doing that - I don't have time to study and my GPA is only a 3.2 / 4 (USA if that matters). something needs to give though. 

(1)  take 12 hours of classes a semester , graduate 1 semester later , and take another 2 internships over the summer before I graduate.

(2)   take 15 hours of classes a semester , graduate on time  , and take one more internship over summer before I graduate.

(3)   take 12 hours of classes a semester , don't take another summer internship and graduate on time. 


I'm thinking I really want (1) , but I'm worried that by graduating in Fall , my chances of getting a job will be lower . Is this true ? thoughts and opinions please.

How have any of y'all forced yourself to make life plans when you really didn't feel like it?

Next year I am also doing a placement at a federal agency and in my email correspondance I have the same trouble. It is a very formal atmosphere, but all emails I receive use just the first name as a signature and refer to other lawyers by first name. Should I still address all emails to Mr., Mrs., etc.?

Would someone care to explain me how the CFA competitions work per se?  The basic advice I got from my professors is that they're typically 6 months long with a team, and you do something related to a finance with an existing firm.  At the end of the six months you go present your project to a board of financiers and compete against other teams on the quality of your report.  

And most of all.  Could someone enlighten me to a couple CFA competitions that they are aware of?  I'm currently doing research and the general approach I want to take is to enter two, one that is high quality that will look good on my resume regardless of how well I place.  And another lesser known competition that would be relatively easy for me to win just so I could pad my resume.  Who knows though, maybe I have no idea what I really want.

I am applying for the Human Resources Internship position within your company as posted on www.internships.com. With the knowledge I have of working on deadline, handling numerous tasks at one time, and my capability to successfully manage duties independently, I know my experience will be an asset to this position.

 

In a previous position, I worked as a Work Study Assistant within Penn State’s Human Resources Development Center. In this position, I worked closely with HRDC employees in researching and compiling data for upcoming campus-wide programs and presentations. I often worked with multiple computer documents simultaneously, proofread and edited various documents, and prepared our facility for upcoming public presentations. I also performed general office duties including filing, copying, faxing, and assisting with project work. I developed the ability to handle assigned tasks in an independent fashion, and consistently returned finished work to my superiors in a timely manner.

 

In addition, I am comfortable and skilled at working in an office setting, and have a mind for details and organization. I am very talented in working with technology, and I am proficient in the Adobe and Microsoft Office programs, and can work on either a Windows system or a Mac.


I am always willing to put in that extra time in order to ensure a more perfect product; I am able to withstand a stressful environment, and remain productive and level-headed. I am a hard worker and quick to learn, and would greatly value the opportunity to intern at your company.

 

I am happy to answer any questions regarding this letter or the attached résumé. I look forward to speaking further with you at your convenience!

 

Sincerely,

I've more or less sped through college and will graduate at 20, right now I'm about to begin an internship hunt for the fall, I have a pretty high GPA, at least my advisers congratulate me on it when I talk with them.

I haven't really been involved in anything though, I've kind of just been on my own developing myself, my way of thought and action etc... I'm just now getting out my teenage haze.

I'd really be suited to the financial world though, the way I think matches it, I'm an economist at heart. I really just wanna be constantly bombarded with information that I have to analyze and draw conclusions about. I spent untold amount of hours when I was younger looking at company filings and trying to figure out what's going on.

I really like money also, I like how it can be used to create things, the proper use of capital is one of the more important things to society.

People tend to like me when they spend time with me and my smarts go up drastically when I'm with other people and we're focused on something. I have no problem with working long hours or traveling.

So what do you think my odds are of getting my foot in the door anywhere? IB or fund management would be interesting."

They're giving me a $500/month housing budget that I'd like to stick to.  Any suggestions on the best places to rent?  Wouldn't mind staying near the university campus if that offers cheaper shared housing.  

Also, I'm interested in cycling and will probably be bringing a road bike and a mountain bike with me.  Anyone know the best places around Columbia for trails?

Best places to meet people around town?  I figure the university campus will be good in that respect.  Any other random suggestions about moving to Columbia?"

szabq,1,2012-04-30,My Story On Religion (Fixed),[deleted],atheism,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/szabq/my_story_on_religion_fixed/,"When any of the people in my life ask me why I stopped being a Christian, I always say ""It's a really long story,"". Here is that story. I, like many other suburban kids, was raised Christian. When I got into High School is when I really cranked up the Jesus juice though. I became a part of First Priority (A Christian group at my school). I even went to Honduras as part of a mission trip group, twice. I was 100 percent in. You see, the way they got me was they made it seem like the only ""proper"" way to help people is through ""The Love of Christ"". When I got done with High School I did not really know what I wanted, I was always interested in Psychology and Sociology so I though maybe a Therapist. 
*So I left my hometown to discover what it was that I wanted out of my life. That's when everything went to shit. I had some friends (such a shame that they are not my friends anymore, I loved that family as if it was my own) In the town I moved to and they enthusiastically invited me to their church. Well I had a sit down with the Pastor and he was very excited to have me going there (I had played in a band that played at the church and the kids already liked me). He asked me If I would become the ""Youth Leader"" for the High School Youth Group. I, of course, accepted thinking this Is what god had planned for me. If it was, god is a cruel bastard. Don't get me wrong, I loved the kids I was overseeing and for the first year it was a blast. I got to play fun games with these kids and help them with their various problems. All these kids needed was someone to listen to them and support them, and i did my best to help. Then the fateful day came. You see, I had been working for the church on a volunteer level and was perfectly fine with that. I held down a steady job at a local factory and had a (for a 19 year old kid) decently nice house. 
*My pastor came to me and asked how devoted I was to this group and these kids. I, of course, said that I was completely devoted, so he told me that god had a plan for me. I should have asked ""Why did he tell you and not me?"" but i did not. I asked what iI could do. He then told me that I had to quit my job and devote the next two years of my life to an ""Internship"". He said that my rent would be paid for and my food would be taken care of and all I had to do was do this internship. Afterwords I would be a Pastor. Well, I had not gone to or taken any college classes and I was really excited about it. A Pastor, now there is a job I can be proud of. So I was swept up and within a month I was enrolled. Then they paid my first months rent and I was set to go. I had my ""interview"" which was a joke. They gave me a tour of a church I had already been to and talked up the program, then told me I was in. Well, on my first day I felt like a fish out of water. 
*I did not know anyone there and they were WAY more committed to their church than I ever was to mine. They basically lived there. Not to mention the man that was in charge of it all, Pastor Dan. He was a real life, grown up bully. He made petty jokes about me constantly and picked on the other man (who was a 50 something year old man) I was there within my church. I should take a minute to explain my church situation. You see, there are these things called ""Chain Churches"" and they have separate locations all over the state, but they all answer to the same Head Pastor guy in a bigger city. Well, the church I was working for was about 50 miles away from the church where I attended the internship. In the internship, it was myself plus another guy and we drove the 50 miles, four days out of the week to be at the church by six o'clock. Immediately, for some reason, Pastor Dan began making my life more difficult and made petty jokes about my fingers (I have two missing fingers on my left hand from an accident). It was an awful experience, but I kept going cause at the end of the day all I wanted was to help these kids. Well, as you may have guessed, the church stopped paying my rent and food. With the hours we were at the internship (6 am to 5 pm), I could not find a job. The Pastor from the church I was working with had the idea to move me into the house with the other man I was at the internship with. 
That is when it got really bad. You see, the family that I was staying with had a very very different idea of how a youth leader should behave. I was 20 by then and I had a circle of friends that I was very close with and not all of them went to my church, with some no church at all. I want to pause here again, I can honestly say that my friends in that town were the only thing that kept me sane. They would be the ones who I would complain to about the emotional torment I endured because of Pastor Dan and the others at the internship. They were amazing and I could not ask for more loyal friends in my life. Back to the story! If I were to come home late, late being 10pm or later, the family I was staying with would lock me out. Sometimes I would stay with friends. Sometimes I would stay in a car, and a couple times I stayed in my old house (It had not been rented out yet, and I still had the key). To some that seems reasonable, but the thing was, even if they were awake they would not come to the door to let me in. Sometimes the acceptable time to come home was 9, sometimes it was 8, sometimes it was even after dinner around 6. I had no way of knowing when I came home whether I would have a place to sleep or not. Meanwhile back at the Legion of Doom (I had to), the internship had a new class starting adding like 8 or 9 kids that were fresh out of High School. 
*Now, out of these kids i knew like 4 of them from different church functions and they are still some of the few people who still will talk to me. I will always respect them for that. The others, were not so accepting. Once again, I felt like an outsider at home, an outsider at the internship, and an outsider in my own church. For Pastor Dan had been sending my Pastor letters and emails about my dismal performance at the internship. To be fair, I was having a really hard time with motivating myself to try any harder because no matter how well i did, Pastor Dan would have some petty comment to say to me. So I just gave up. Fast forward about two months and I was living with my parents in my old house from high school. I still had to find a way to Ludington (town with church without internship) every weekend ( Because of my epilepsy i did not have a drivers license). After the first year of the internship, I had to find a job and found one again in the town my church was in (Ludington). 
*So I moved back up with yet another church connection. After two days, their mind was changed. I moved into my car by the lake in northern Michigan in January. Needless to say it was an awful experience. I pushed through and tried to find a job where I did not work with a person from the church because i was getting ready to step down. I had enough. I was fortunate enough to move in with one of the friends I mentioned before. I never did find a job in that town, but I lived rent free with that friend for almost a year before i moved back to my hometown with my dad. I left the church I stepped down from. Now, that is not how I became an Atheist, that is simply why I left the church. When I did, I researched the other side. Read Dawkins, read Sagan, read anything I could get on the ""World without the god glasses"". That is how I became an Atheist. I would have never done that if I never left the church though. You see, we had a strict reading list being a part of Church Leadership. It was not a list of books to read, it was a list of books not read. At the top of the list was ""The God Delusion"" by Dawkins. After I left, I immediately read it and realized why I was not supposed to. It makes perfect sense. I, someday, would like to thank him for writing that book as many former christians would. I hope someday to be able to do that.
So that is it r/atheism. I did not write this for sympathy, I wrote this to show people what I have been through in the name of religion. I still have lingering guilt and a sometimes crippling fear of hell (Even though i know its illogical), but I am 23 now, living on my own in a house and working to go to school in April of next year. Thank you for taking the time to read this."

I was really excited when I first heard the message. It was after 6 PM when I heard the voicemail, so I planned on calling back first thing Friday morning. But all night I thought about all the reasons why I wouldn't be good for this job. All the interview questions I have fucked up in the past. I think about all the other recent engineering grads from the nearby Ivy League school who probably got calls from this company, too and have much more technical and internship experience than me.

I woke up Friday and said ""OK, I'll call at 10 AM"". 10 AM came and I said ""OK, I'll call at 3 PM"". And then 3 came and went and I was just too afraid to do it. Now if I find the confidence to even do it tomorrow morning, I'm convinced that 2 working days just too much time to pass to return this call and the HR person will think I'm lazy and that I don't care.

I have a lot of trouble with ""selling myself"".

I'm 22, just graduated from college and am applying for engineering jobs. The process is stressing me out the past few months so much that I'm sabotaging myself. Last month, I scheduled a phone interview (for a different company) in advance, and then psyched myself out too much and then sat and watched my phone ring when the time came for the call.

Instead of trying to think of the good things I've done and spin my failures into positives, all I can think of are the things I've done wrong on projects in school and reasons why I would be a failure in the working world. All weekend I've sat here worrying about waking up Monday morning and being faced with having to return this call and how I can convince an HR person that I'm good enough for this job when I really don't think that I am.

I feel depressed for feeling depressed. What company wants to hire someone who feels so terribly about herself? I'm a pansy.

I'm afraid to talk to someone about this issue. Based on what I do, I look like someone who just doesn't want to help herself. I'm not worth being helped by others.

I don't have a Mom or Dad to call who can tell me I'm the best and give me a confidence boost. I'm alone out here and just can't get it together mentally by myself. I could skate by with this anxious/depressed cycle while in college classes and managed a good GPA, but interviewing and all of this stuff is making me face it head on. I'm really feeling stuck based on the logic my brain uses to respond to inputs. I need to re-train my brain but there's no time. I need to get my shit together and get an interview since my current job will end in December.

How the hell can I squash that nagging voice inside that says ""you can't do it""?

Thanks."

I've been losing major sleep over this and maybe you can help me with an answer. I don't usually do drugs (as in, I hadn't taken anything outside of my prescriptions for almost a year and a half), but like an idiot, about 4 weeks ago, I went to a party and I took a single hit of marijuana from a bong and did one line of coke (which I have been told was no less than .1 grams and no more than .2 grams, no word on the purity, but I don't think it was any higher than normal). I know, it was retarded. I hadn't smoked for over 2 years, and for reasons of stress, I had accepted the offer. When high, doing a line didn't sound as objectionable :/ Three weeks later, I was drug tested as part of an application for employment for a major company (I'd be working for them as an intern). I've already passed all the other requirements, but if I fail this drug test, I definitely won't be getting the job. I'm an athletic male with a high metabolism, with thin, darker-brown hair. I swim and work out often, but I'm not sure to what degree this matters. Am I completely fucked? How sensitive are the hair tests? I've been feeling like a complete idiot about this. If I do show up positive for either, is there anything that I can say? I turned down several other internship offers to work for this company. I had not realized that they were the only ones that hair tested :/ If I don't get this internship, my career plans may be shot down in a major way. I'd likely lose my scholarships too. I took the drug test last Tuesday, from what I understand, I should hear back by tomorrow or Tuesday. Any help or insight would be greatly appreciated. "

I been keepin' my eye on this subreddit ever since I got accepted into this summer internship at Singapore through my university, and you seem like a rad group of people. I go to school in California, and I've been to Singapore before, but it was a few years ago when I was in high school and it was only for four days. I didn't get to REALLY experience Singapore back then, so I'm super fucking stoked to go back for a much longer period of time and truly see how awesome Singapore is.

So what places should I check out when I'm here? Best restaurants? Great sight seeing places? Music venues? 

How about some places where I can interact with attractive women (clubs/bars)? And no I do not mean prostitutes haha. 

Where do the expats hang out? How about businessmen? I'm looking to network extensively while I'm there for two months.

Any other cool/unique places worth checking out, tell me!

What else should I know about living in Singapore as a foreigner? Is it worth mentioning that I'm black? I hear they hardly exist over there!

Thanks in advance!! Sorry for all of the questions!

I'm applying for grad school and will have a paid internship in the city starting September. 23-year old composer. The thing is that I've never been outside of Manhattan so I'd like to know:

-What areas should I be looking at that aren't $2000+ for a studio and not plagued by sketchy people?
-Any areas I should avoid at all cost, even if the rent is temptingly cheap?
-What common NYC knowledge should I have before hunting for apartments?

Please keep in mind that I'm 23, still living on a budget (my previous rent in Boston was $1600 for a 2BR/1Bath, so I paid $800 with some utilities), yet I'll take what I can find that's fairly decent.
I'll be going down to the city for a weekend in about 2-3 weeks, and I'll be able to explore a bit, maybe even start looking at places and surroundings.

Thank you in advance!"
syz8e,2,2012-04-29,Question about a Psychemedics hair test,ad233,askdrugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdrugs/comments/syz8e/question_about_a_psychemedics_hair_test/,"Hey all,

I have a question about a psychemedics hair test. I've been losing major sleep over this and maybe you can help me with an answer. I don't usually do drugs (as in, I hadn't taken anything outside of my prescriptions for almost a year and a half), but like an idiot, about 4 weeks ago, I went to a party and I took a single hit of marijuana from a bong and did one line of coke (which I have been told was no less than .1 grams and no more than .2 grams, no word on the purity, but I don't think it was any higher than normal). I know, it was retarded. I hadn't smoked for over 2 years, and for reasons of stress, I had accepted the offer. When high, doing a line didn't sound as objectionable :/  Three weeks later, I was drug tested as part of an application for employment for a major company (I'd be working for them as an intern). I've already passed all the other requirements, but if I fail this drug test, I definitely won't be getting the job. I'm an athletic male with a high metabolism, with thin, darker-brown hair. I swim and work out often, but I'm not sure to what degree this matters. Am I completely fucked? How sensitive are the hair tests? I've been feeling like a complete idiot about this. If I do show up positive for either, is there anything that I can say? I turned down several other internship offers to work for this company. I had not realized that they were the only ones that hair tested :/ If I don't get this internship, my career plans may be shot down in a major way. I'd likely lose my scholarships too. I took the drug test last Tuesday, from what I understand, I should hear back by tomorrow or Tuesday. Any help or insight would be greatly appreciated. "

",I_PISS_Bong_WateR,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/syyjl/day_2240_officially_reached_the_half_way_mark_now/,"Background: Quitting for 40 days for an internship drug test. I may decide to quit longer at the end of 40 days if I feel it is beneficial for me. Regular smoker for ~3.5 years


So this weekend was just another weekend without weed, uneventful and stressful. I really could have used a bowl yesterday after having a very long day of moving! But at the moment I have no weed and my pieces are all clean and put up, probably for the best. I still think about smoking weed constantly but that ""withdrawal"" symptoms are no longer there. I am happy I am still keeping it going, but I wonder if the feeling of wanting to smoke will ever go away? I am still kind of tired all of the time, and my motivation has dropped a little bit (I always considered weed as my motivator). Hopefully I can find something else to fill that void.


This is BY FAR the longest break I have ever had since starting smoking. After looking back on it, these 22 days kind of went by fast...hopefully motivation for others! I still have a ways to go but I know I can finish, and maybe continue longer !! 

I am here for any questions or guidance for anybody! Stay sober!!"
syyhi,330,2012-04-29,Drop Dead Gorgeous,longgonedarlin,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/syyhi/drop_dead_gorgeous/,"We had two rules growing up.

One, always say thank you and you're welcome.
Two, never put yourself before others.

Being twenty years old and an intern at the largest modelling agency in the city, please and thank you didn't tend to get you very far. To tell the truth, the second rule really didn't either. 

I worked on the 15th floor, at beck and call to one of the costume designers. This woman was, to put it frankly, a straight bitch.

I remember one day I called my mother, crying, because the woman was so vile. My mother said, 'remember what I told you', and other comforting words, but those two rules really stuck with me.

I had my hands full with coffee and drafts on my way to work on a Monday morning, trying to keep my mother and I's conversation in my head. I hit the 'up' button on the elevator, and people poured in. The elevator itself had a ten-person limit. I somehow squashed into it with seven others. A young man, another intern, jumped on before the doors closed, when the heavy weight limit alarm went off. 

Everyone groaned, knowing someone would have to get off.

I looked at the man who had just got on, and he looked ready to cry. He must be late, I thought to myself. On an ordinary day, I would have forced him off, but I just couldn't do it, not with my mother's words ringing in my head.

'Never put yourself before others.'

I opened the doors to the elevator again, and hopped out, knowing I could just wait for the next one. I smiled at the guy, and he smiled back.

""Thank you,"" he said.

""You're welcome,"" I said. 

My faith in humanity restored, I didn't notice how strange it was that the weight limit for the elevator to be a person off.

I reported it to the maintenance man who nodded and said he'd check on it.

Later that evening, I flipped the news on and was shocked to see my place of work on the television screen, 'breaking news' in red scrolling beneath it.

I had heard that one of our models had gone missing that weekend.

Apparently someone had thrown her body into the elevator shaft.

No wonder the weight limit was off.

The only reason that I want to use it is because I feel like mastering it would help me sell myself as someone who is familiar with social media in internships that I'm going to be looking at in a year (I also feel like, as someone who is going into the field of journalism, social media is becoming increasingly important).

sywx6,4,2012-04-29,Any advice for someone looking to be a Database Admin?,herdyderdy,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/sywx6/any_advice_for_someone_looking_to_be_a_database/,"I'm graduating in about 6 months with a CS degree, and I've taken a couple elective classes that are heavy on databases/data streaming. These were by far the most interesting classes to me. If possible I'd like to get into DBA work or some kinda of database work as soon as possible when I graduate. All I can find though are job listings for people with 5+ years of database experience. I've only been looking in Portland, Oregon, however so maybe this isn't the greatest place for tech jobs (I'm planning on moving somewhere else when I graduate anyway). 

 I have about 6 months of experience in programming from an internship and a short contract job. Would these help me get a DBA position? "
