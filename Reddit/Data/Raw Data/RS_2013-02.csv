I landed an IT internship in the summer and need some advice on how to get more prepared for it. 

I know that internships are there to help gain experience and to have you learn the ropes with real systems, but I feel like I need to grow my knowledge so I can integrate with the company quickly and not dissapoint.

I'll be doing projects for the most part, and a little bit of support. I do have the LPIC-1 certification (mainly got it to help learn linux more intimately) but I don't often practice sysadmin type projects at home because I never felt that I needed to.

Any advice on how to be a better intern? I'm focusing on Linux but any advice is helpful"

17pj72,0,2013-02-01,Shooting for homeschool.,Starlight_lives,homeschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/homeschool/comments/17pj72/shooting_for_homeschool/,"Hey r/homeschool, I'm a high school student in my sophomore year and I don't think the experience is right for me. My PSAT/PACT scores are above average, but I'm also holding up a job to support my family. School and homework take up more than seventy-five percent of my time, and it's really starting to affect me in a negative way.

I have a background of PTSD and an abusive home-life when I lived with my father. Now that I'm away from him, I've accelerated my learning dramatically; unfortunately I'm now bored in school and went from a three point eight GPA to a one point eight. My test grades are amazing, but my average grades are failing because I don't turn in my homework. The reason behind that is because whenever I get home I have to help my little brother with his home-school because he has Crohn's disease. My single mother would help, but she's busy fighting a five going on six year divorce in court. Whenever I get home there are massive amounts of chores to do around my ranch and house to keep everything maintained just to be livable. 
Stress piled onto stress, onto stress. I've been making more frequent visits to my counselor and she advised that I should teach myself Chemistry, Geometry, and the other subjects I'm  taking at school to relieve the stress and to just prepare for maximizing my scores on the SAT and/or ACT. I think this is a great idea, but my mother is borderline. I could practice the subjects I need, keep the house maintained, help my brother with his homeschooling,to work, and still pursue my HTML and computer programming skills with my uncle since he's a programmer for a living and is more than open to teaching me as an apprentice. I could probably get an internship at his place of work if I work hard enough.
I have every bit of confidence in this, but I still want others opinions on the matter."

I’m 22 and a fresh college graduate that’s recently entered the harsh, face-slapping reality of the job market. I’m currently living with my parents in Connecticut, but would like to move back out to Indianapolis (I say back, because I lived there from August to December for an internship). 

I’m wondering if anyone knows of any employers or entry level jobs in the area that would allow me to do a phone or Skype interview. The obvious big problem with applying for jobs close to 800 miles away is that I don’t have much money to travel, and I’d hate to spend $300 for a plane ticket for an interview when I wouldn’t even be guaranteed a position. Of course, there’s always the option of just moving out there and searching hard when I get there, but I wouldn’t even risk that with today’s job market. 

My background: a BS in Sport Management and a Minor in Information Technology. My specialties are event coordination/management and customer service, but I would really be willing to take almost any business-related job (in sports or not). While I only have internship experience, I feel I am a hard working and quick learning individual that would work well in any position.

17p194,11,2013-02-01,I'd like to hear your professional stories. How did you end up where you are?,ExplosiveHippo,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/17p194/id_like_to_hear_your_professional_stories_how_did/,"Hi /r/webdev. I'm currently a university student (almost a senior) and my ultimate goal is to become a web developer. I thought it would be interesting to see how others got to where they are now. I guess it wouldn't be fair if I didn't share my story.

I started out around 14 or 15 I think, playing an online game. I eventually became a moderator on the forum for the game and many of the other moderators where heavy web geeks. That inspired me to start messing with HTML and CSS. I did a bit but never really got super heavy into it. 

I knew I wanted to do something with computers but I figured I'd want to repair computers or help set up systems. In my junior and senior year of highschool I went to trade school half day for computer repair and networking. I ended up getting my A+ certification but by the time I finished the program I'd really lost interest in fixing computers. It was really the same thing over and over and I required something a bit more creative.

I ended up going to a community college for web technologies and finally got a good grasp of HTML and CSS. I then starting taking classes in Javascript and Java and had some serious doubts in my ability. I just wasn't getting it and got very discouraged. I ended up getting through community college with pretty decent grades but felt like I really lacked much knowledge outside of being able to Google everything. I ended up getting an internship as a web designer and developer (developer as in HTML/CSS and jQuery plugins) which I worked at through my whole community college degree. This really helped me get a better grasp on my skills and I learned a ton. It was great.

I kept my head up though because I really enjoyed it when it worked. I then started to attend a real university. A highly established tech university in my state. Once I got in it gave me a big confidence boost that I *could* do this. I finally dedicated myself to it and I had matured a lot since community college. I'm now finally starting to feel like I can definitely do this as a career. I've finally started to break through the ""I have no idea what I'm doing"" phase and it feels great. This past Summer I co oped at a large supermarket's corporate office as primarily a web designer (I've always loved the design aspect of it too and I'm fairly good at it) with some development stuff on the side.

I'm finally in my last year of college and will be doing another co op this Summer and by next Summer I'll be graduated and be searching for full time work. I'm hoping everything works out but I have high hopes!

So, webdev. How did you get where you are? Is there anything you wish you had done differently. Any advice for us younger guys (and gals) getting in the business? (Sorry for such a long post!)"

If you're not familiar with us, we print your images directly on glass, and create a final product that is picture, frame, and mount all-in-one.

Here's some stuff:

 * Looking for full-time positions, and want to hire ASAP
 * But we'd also consider an internship position for students with only a few hours a week to spare
 * Need people interested in being part of a company culture, not just grabbing a great paycheck
 * Attention to detail, and a knack for problem solving
 * No telecommuting or remote work. We're needy and we want to see your pretty (and/or handsome) face in our office every day. That means we'd be happy to relocate the right person(s)
 * Only interested in people capable of self-managing and who excel at taking initiative and constantly looking out for opportunities to improve themselves and the company
 * Located in Gainesville, FL (Thanks High_Priest!)

Positions/Roles:

 * **Make things look good** - designer, creative director, beautificator; I don't care what you call yourself, but you've got an eye for design, a love of adobe software, a knack for understanding what us non-creative folks are trying to describe (and the confidence to tell us when we're wrong), insane talent, and a desire to see your designs on the web, on packaging, and in offices/homes all over the world.
 * **Python/Php/Ruby** - developer. Maybe not all three, but at least some mastery of python or ruby. Be prepared to show us some code samples and/or a github page.
 * **Web Leader** - you know what separates a good website from a bad one, and you love leading a team of people to make that happen. Some ecommerce experience preferred, but not required. Also, looking for an understanding of UI/UX principals, and familiarity with mobile.
 * **Lover of Data** - some people call this a 'growth hacker', and some other people puke when they hear that term. What matters is that you feel at home in databases, analytics, and excel spreadsheets, and you love applying data to practical applications and digestible action items.
 * **Marketing/PR** - you're an excellent communicator, can't live without your daily dose of social media, and you love using technology to connect with people. You live, breathe, and bleed customer acquisition and retention. 
 * **Customer Service** - you're a natural born empath. Nothing makes you happier than brightening someone's day, and the idea of spending your days talking to people from all over the US excites you. You exude positivity, and are the best communicator you know.

Some perks:

 * Awesome startup with awesome people (mean age 25)
 * Awesome product that you get for free (featured on TechCrunch, BusinessWeek, Groupon, NBC Today Show)
 * Stock options 
 * Awesome office (we won a KILLER office redecoration from Turnstone - [video here](http://myturnstone.com/stories/makeover-fracture/))

17ophe,1,2013-02-01,I still love her and only time will tell.,AsWeWalk,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/17ophe/i_still_love_her_and_only_time_will_tell/,"I am a guy and I met her freshman year in college and for a year it was amazing. Then we got to that point where neither of us had ever gotten to in a relationship before. The time after the initial ""honeymoon"" stage. We struggled and I thought she wanted to end it. So after a couples weeks of struggling, her attitude toward me made me feel like she wanted it to be over and I felt like it would be best to give her that. So I decided to confront her and tell her that it feels like she just wants this to end, so I said I would do it for her.

After a week, we both had ended up making out with friends that we both had been attracted to during our relationship. We both had different reactions to this. When we had our experiences, neither of us knew of the others. After my experience, I missed her way too much and decided to tell her that. After hers and me telling her how I felt, she was conflicted. She hated what she had done but she couldn't decide if she wanted to be with him or me. Eventually, we both severed ties with our friends and got back together.

This new relationship lasted 3 weeks and she broke it off. She said she loved being single and missed it. Needless to say I was devastated but I saw the signs leading up to it, so I had braced myself for it. Over the next month we tried to be friends and I tried to adjust but it still haunted me. I wanted to be with her. So I told her and she blew me off for a week by not responding to anything I messaged to her. She just thought in order for us to get over each other, we had to just not talk or see each other. At the end of that week, I begged her to just let me talk to her once. She agreed. After talking, we rekindled our friendship (which was more like best friends). This lead into summer break after sophomore year.

About 2 weeks into summer break we met up, since we live a good distance away from each other, to see a movie and hang out. After this we realized how much we loved being with each other and got back together. We talked everyday over break, hung out a couple weekends, and couldn't wait to be back at school together.

Everything starts out great back at school. We have fun and it just couldn't be better. Then she just switches to this different person. She stops wanting to hang out as much and keeps giving excuses as to why she can't. Well this goes by for 1.5 weeks and I see her once in that time. It's the night before my 21st and I ask her to talk. She agrees. We talk and I ask her the important question. ""Do you want to be with me?"" She just answers, ""No."" I tell her it's okay, give her a hug, tell her that I understand, and say that I wish she would have just talked to me about it. We both smile and leave her room. She then out of nowhere asks, ""I can't believe you are taking this so well. Wait, is there someone else?"" I was floored, but I calmly say. There is no way that there is anyone else.

We become good friends after this and even become friends with benefits for a while. After the semester we talk about getting back together, but we both agreed it was a bad idea since she was going abroad the next semester. She visited my family for Christmas, but we said we were just friends. We end up talking a lot more than expected while she was abroad and when she gets back we got back together. I told her that I really missed her and we talked about potentially where our future could take us. We both figured at this point our relationship won't end anymore. We couldn't stand being apart for those months without seeing each other.

We were great again, but only up until my birthday...again. The same thing happened where she ignored me, so I talked to her and this break up was just as smooth. (I hated this...) We then became friends with benefits and had fun. It seemed like she loved it more when we weren't attached, but she loved being with me. 

By the end of the semester, I gave her an ultimatum type question. Either I want to be with her or I wanted to stop this and get on with my life. She just responded to the question with I don't know. This really bothered me, so I kind of just quit. I tried to not hang out with her much over the next 3 days until I went to talk to her and told her that I felt that it would be best for us to stop seeing each other because we both had issues we needed to deal with in our own lives.
(I was dealing with anxiety induced by school which led to depression and she did not know this. I felt she couldn't handle a relationship and the stress of her load with an internship, classes, and extracurriculars.)

After that night she just asked one thing of me. That I do not date anyone for the rest of college because it would be too hard to see it. I agreed and asked the same of her. She also agreed.

We still did friends with benefits stuff over the course of the rest of the semester. I then told her that I loved her the day I left for break while we cuddled in my bed. The very next day, she goes on a date with someone. I was devastated.

It has been 2 months since. I am taking this semester off to deal with things and she is now in a relationship with this new guy and completely ignores any attempt I make at trying to be in a friendship.

Throughout this entire experience I have loved her and still do. I wanted to propose at graduation. I still think about her everyday and wish that there was something I could do to make myself forget about her or get her to at least talk to me again. The only thing that makes sense to me is that time heals all."
17opgg,3,2013-02-01,So I am a little confused about the levels of surgeons depicted in Grey's.. Can someone help explain?,blazeofglory94,greysanatomy,https://www.reddit.com/r/greysanatomy/comments/17opgg/so_i_am_a_little_confused_about_the_levels_of/,"Ok so I have been re-watching all seasons and I am a little confused. Grey, Yang, Stevens, Karev and O'Malley started as Bailey's interns. Bailey was a third year resident. That took a year and then they were all second year residents. Little Grey and co were then the second year residents interns.

Burke, Shepard, Montgomery, Sloane are all attendings. They are the bosses of Torres, Bailey and co.

Now.. A few seasons later, we get Robbins (attending). Bailey is promoted and so is Torres. Still no interns for these two.

Last season, our first lot of interns, apply for fellowships, and take them at SGMW. They aren't attendings, but Torres, Robbins, Bailey, Shepard, Montgomery, Sloane are. Torres and Bailey skipped a fellowship? And the others never spoke of anything other than being attendings.

Now that Grey, Yang, Karev, Avery and Kepner are fellows, they have interns.. Again.. Why does little Grey's class not have interns when they begin their second year? Why are big Grey and co the only non-residents with interns?

Also, let's assume when big Grey and Derek met, Derek was a first year attending. They are interns for one year, then residents for 4 more (fifth year res gets chief res) plus a year of fellow? That makes Derek at least 7 years older.. And then Mark and little Grey would be at least 8 but I feel like Mark is older than Derek..

Anyway.. My question is.. If Yang, Grey and co got interns immediately after they completed theirs, where are little Grey's interns? And in this season, Yang, Grey and co are the only 'dark blue scrub' wearing people to have interns..

Can anyone explain why there is this inconsistency in new interns? "

*Average wait time for Anti-Gun senators' lines was much longer than Pro-2A senators' phone lines. Probably suggests high volume of Pro-2A callers.*
Everyone told me call counts were very high the last couple days.

_________________________________________________________

**Call counts: Pro-2A vs. Anti-Gun**

*When I asked I got all sorts of answers ranging from ""we can't tell you anything"" to very specific details. But this is what I could gather:*

Tuesday was totally dominated by Pro-2A calls.

Wednesday was nearly 50/50.

Thursday numbers leaned slightly in favor Anti-Gun.

**This is a good sign. We have been very proactive and got an early lead. Now we need to keep up the intensity.**

Apparently far fewer people called senators who were not representing their state than other posts have suggested. One person told me I was the only out of state caller he had gotten all day!

*Be careful with interpreting this data. The Pro-2A candidates' interns were much more willing to give me information than the Anti-Guns' interns on average so the results might be skewed.*

Please be polite and brief when you call. The interns were clear that they had gotten some nasty callers.

I'm assuming, and rightly so, that quite a few of you enjoy books immensely. As such you probably have slogged through a good number of them only to find that maybe every oher book leaves you genuinely feeling something.

**What was that book?**

What was the last book that made you feel something; did you cry, laugh, and scream at the heavens cursing your creator?

For me it would have to be *The Average American Marriage* by Chad Kultgen. At first glance it may just seem like another Palahniuk-esque, misogyny filled rant but the book has deep honesty. People love their partners, people cheat, and some folks genuinely feel regret while plugging away at their piece on the side. The narrator rapidly alternates from the longing he feels toward his missing family to overwhelming joy at sleeping with the young intern. I felt for him but fret that maybe one day my life will devolve into simply watching babysitter porn after my wife has fallen asleep, if only to go back and spoon when all is done.

So yeah... **What was the last book you gave a flying buck about?**"

17ombw,2,2013-02-01,"Where should I put my money? 24 years old 60k+ saving, 6 figure salary.",[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/17ombw/where_should_i_put_my_money_24_years_old_60k/,"I've already done a bit of reading on this subreddit about people in similuar situations. I think I have a decent grasp on what to do, but just wanted to get some feedback on if my plan is sound and there's a few questions I'd like advice on.


Background - I am 24 years old. I was lucky enough to graduate college with zero debt a little less than 2 years ago thanks to both my parents and some summer internships that paid extremely well. And again I was lucky enough to immediate get a full time job that pays 6 figures after bonuses. (I'm a software engineer at a top tier company.) 


In the last year and half I've saved about $60K, that is currently split in checking and savings accounts with Bank of America. My checking's account is a some ""advanced tiered account"" so it basically pays same amount of interest as my savings account anyway. Not that it matters as the interest rate is so low I don't even get a full dollar each month. I have another $10K in a 401k with Vanguard set up with my job. I've so far been only contributing up to what my company matches, which is 4% of my salary. I have another few thousand in stock on an account with Charles Shwab. This amount is expected to go up significantly as more stock vest and our annual bonuses are usually paid in stock as well. So far I have not sold any of the stock yet. 

I buy everything with a credit card (yay cash back!) and pay the full amount every month. 


I'm single, no car (live + work downtown), rent an apartment by myself. no loans no debt.


future plans (next 3-5 years): no idea. I might buy a house/condo in a couple years if I decide that I won't be moving to a different city for a long time. I'd like to take 6-12 months off for a ""sabbatical"" in 2-3 years. Probably travel the world or some shit like that. I'm confident I can get a new job any time I want. I currently have no plans to purchase a car but that could change if I end up moving where I can't walk/bus to work.


So here is my plan


Max out my 401K, I've been only putting in up to whatever work will match. I have more than enough savings so there's no downside not to max it out from what I read here. That right?


Keep $15k in checking/saving. My monthly expense is currently ~$3k. But that's cuz I've been lazy and don't cook and rent is pretty expensive as I live in a downtown area. If a emergency really comes up I can bring that cost down a lot so $15k is more than enough. Might even consider lowering this to $10k.


I read on here that it's not too late to get a 2012 IRA to save some taxes. Can someone give me a little more detail on this? Limit is $5k? Does it matter where I open this IRA account? Is there a recommendation? What is my deadline for getting this set up. I'm assuming I should get this done before I file my taxes. 


What about 2013 IRA? I read some recommendations for Roth IRA. It's $5500 limit starting this year right? Same questions as above, does it matter who/where I get this with. Pro and Con for regular vs Roth IRA for this?

My stock from work. I'm going to start selling them as soon as they vest. The idea is that I'm already heavily invested in the company by working there, I should diversify rather than keep more investments there. I personally think the stock for where I work is growing strong but it's still better to diversify instead of putting all my eggs in one basket. Do people agree with that?


Ok, everything else, so basically $35k + any money I save from now on. Oh and + the stock money if I sell them. I should be investing them. This is where I'm not entirely sure what's the best way to diversify. I'm fairly young so I probably want to lean on the riskier side. Should I just pick a comprehensive mutual fund and put it all there?


Something like [SWEGX](http://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/investing/investment_help/investment_research/mutual_fund_research/mutual_funds.html?path=/Prospect/Research/MutualFunds/Summary.asp?symbol=SWEGX)
 or [SWHGX](http://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/investing/investment_help/investment_research/mutual_fund_research/mutual_funds.html?path=/Prospect/Research/MutualFunds/Summary.asp?symbol=SWHGX)

or should I just pick a bunch of index funds myself? like
SWPPX, SWTSX which follow S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones? 


Also where should I get my mutual funds from? I already have a investment account with Charles Shwab due to my company stock set up with them. But people seem to recommend vanguard a lot more on here. 

Oh, and should I switch to a credit union? I hear interest I get with a credit union is much better than with a bank.

Are there anything major that I missed? Any other tips or suggestions for how to manage my money? 


Thanks for all the help guys. "

I wish I was weak enough to just break already. This barely hanging on is horrible. I wish I wasn't sick so I could just backpack across the country and live on scraps. I wish I wasn't such a goddamn disappointment. 

It's living with them. I need to get out of this house. That's what I need. I'm just a burden - i dont contribute, all I do is create problems and fight. I'm just useless. I'm just stuck. And I can't take it anymore."

TLDR: If you had access to a web app which coherently presented visualized financial data, would you use it? What features/analyses/things would you like to see in an app like this?




Hi all, I'm currently a finance student [~~insert usual stuff about being super motivated, or knowing a lot for my age, or despite being from a non-target with a less-than-stellar GPA I'm a super active networker, or- my favorite- my amazing 999% returns in my paper portfolio~~]
I've came to realize that programming will play an important part in my career, since it's a great way to distinguish yourself and help automate monotonous shit in the office, which is pretty much what you have to deal with as an intern anyway. So the reasoning was - work smarter, not harder. I figure the best way to learn is by doing. I'm working side by side with a programmer who can show me the ropes; meanwhile I'll be educating him on some fundamental finance. 

We're working on a program which would essentially provide visual interpretations of company and stock data. The users will be able to see a variety of charts and other graphics which should be helpful in decision making. Eventually, we expect to also integrate new stories. There will likely be a way to enter your portfolio, and if this really kicks off we would gladly incorporate APIs. 

So, the reason I'm posting this is to see if there would be an interest for a web app like this? I understand there's a plethora of tools available, but from my research I've noticed very few of them take advantage of pre-attentive processing (which makes it almost intuitive) so I hope we can fill that gap.

What are some features you would like to see in this? (Besides insider information haha) We hope to hear back from both long and short term investors

This is a bit of an odd request but I'm wondering what you guys thought would be good small(ish) projects to have in a Matlab ""portfolio"" (or Mathematica). I'm a first year math major and in order to get some experience I offered my help to a professor of the applied math department for this summer. The university offers some funding to students who wish to apply for it but it's amazingly competitive (4.1+ GPA while I'm probably closer to 3.5) and 2nd/3rd year students are usually a more obvious choice for the department. What I did though is offered to do it for free. I have enough money aside so I don't really have to work this summer and getting this experience would be worth a lot more than 3 months worth of minimum-wage work. 

While I'm still a first year student and my mathematical knowledge can't bring much to the table, I'm pretty confident my CS knowledge is above the average undergrad student in the department (I did do a few years of a CS undergrad before moving to math on top of doing a lot of programming, especially in C since I was in early high school) which I think gives me a bit of an edge. This semester I'm taking a class based around Mathematica and I've been able to pick it up pretty quickly (we're 2 weeks in but I've been able to do last semester's midterm, thanks to the built-in help!) and I used it for a few fun projects at well. My Matlab experience is mostly doing assignments for a friend of mine taking engineering who hates programming as well as messing around with GNU/Octave.

What I'm working on now is a bit of a CV for myself to present to this professor. He wants to know what kind of experience I have as well as see a bit of what I'm capable of (I'm assuming). Unfortunately I don't have a lot of math-related projects on hand (my biggest projects are mostly interpreters/compilers in C) so I thought I'd work on a few diverse projects to have something to show. What do you guys think would be interesting to show? It obviously have to be something complicated enough that it doesn't look like I just Google'd pieces of code and glued them together but small enough that I don't spend the next 3 months on it. Any ideas?

**tl;dr** Basically trying to impress a professor who could consider me for an unpaid internship this summer. I unfortunately don't have much to show him so I'm looking for a few projects I could work on.

Thanks!"

Adam looked genuinely worried at this point. He apologized to the board, for our rudeness and whatnot. It responded with a simple “fine” and the group did not really know where to go from there. One of the boys finally asked, adding an additional apology, if they could speak to someone else and the demon could be on its way. The board told us that he would not release the board to any other entity. We were going to speak to him and him only.

This seemed to really not sit well with anyone. I, well, I was interested. I held my smirk behind a straight-grit in order to keep the group still and petrified. Without asking another question, the dial moved once more and scribed a sentence that chills me to this day: tell that brother of yours to stop being a smartass. My eyes widened and I looked at Adam. Adam looked at me and then wore an expression of a man twenty years his elder, so far removed from the comforts of modern living. He wore the face of a parent burying his child, of a surgeon failing, of a war veteran outliving his comrades. He bore too much knowledge about the situation at hand, far more knowledge than anyone in the room. Essentially, this was not a joke. We had all removed our hands with this last insult and Adam motioned to return them, clearing his throat.
“Demon,” Adam asked. “Is that you, Amney?”

The familiarity and tone in my brother’s voice made the hair on my neck stand. Without a second to contemplate the situation at hand, the dial read “yes.”
“Listen, we were just interested in showing our friends how the board works. We mean no harm.”
“I know, you little fuck. I was just checking in. How’s the family?” The board wrote.
After the response, the dial rapidly shot to each corner of the board, to the decorative pictures that branded the extremities. Nonsense.
“We’re… we’re fine, Amney. I know we haven’t spoken in a while.”
“Good. Good.  Which parent do you love more?”
At this point, I picked up the little dial and clutched it tight, standing.
“No, we’re done. This is bullshit. Adam, I don’t know if you’re fucking with your friends, or… or what. But we’re done.”

The fucking thing tore from my grip and landed upright on the board. The candles went out immediately after and the girl screamed. I moved towards the stairs and turned on the light. The candles were tipped over and the wet wax smothered the board. Most of it was covered, except for the smiling sun in the upper left-hand corner.  The wax encompassed it and most of the mess was already drying. Adam looked up at me and told me he was sorry, a single tear running down his face. He sniffed, looked away, composed himself and rapidly stood, cleaning the mess. His friends never saw his tear.

We quickly packed up and that was that. We did not talk much about it. He was obviously bothered, but got over it by midweek. We played plenty of shooter video games and we even drank a little bit of our parent’s alcohol when they went away the next weekend. That Sunday night we watched a horror movie which focused around a demon. Upon realizing the story’s premise and hearing the word “demon,” I silently hated myself and prayed that it would not bring some shell-shocked flashback to my brother’s being. No such break down occurred; in fact, he calmly and happily brought up the experience after the movie. He simply asked, “Do you remember that whole ‘Amney’ bit?”

Of course, I said yes.

“Yeah, that fucker is creepy,” he smirked.
“You talked to him a lot?” I asked him.
“Yeah. I don’t really know how to explain it. Maybe those things are like… creative unlockers? You know? Like they tap into your creative invulnerabilities and just pour words from you.”
“I don’t know, man.”
“Well, I hope so, at least. He described himself to me one time. Real creepy stuff.”
“Like what?”
“Well, he was a demon. First of all,” he chuckled at this. He was nervous at first, then the seriousness caught his voice. “He was a demon, and he told me that the  most relatable thing he could call himself, the thing I would most understand, was the shape of a dog. Except instead of your typical ‘dog-shaped’ head, he said it resembled a mask. Like a large, porcelain, V-shaped mask. Mostly blank, besides large black eyes.”

I think of my mother sitting at a computer desk in the kitchen, thinking she saw a Jack Russell Terrier move past her feet.

“Weird, man,” I reply, offering nothing else.
“Yeah…” he cleared his throat. “What did you think about when he asked about mom and dad?”
“I,” I thought for a moment. “I didn’t.”
“Good,” Adam nodded. “He would have done something vengeful.”

I did not know what he meant, but I did not want to pry. I was happy enough that we covered this topic without a breakdown of tears. We proceeded to watch some mindless programming for a few hours and he went to bed, happy.

Later that night, or rather, early that morning, I received a call from the police department informing me that my parents had died in a car accident on I-95. I did not tell Adam until later that day. He went to school, like any other day, and spent six or seven hours in ignorance. He went to his part time job at the grocery store and worked, happily and stupidly, like any other day. I had to tell him when he got home. Our uncle and grandparents were there. It was inevitable. It was not my choice. He had to know. Were it up to me, I would have kept him, to this day, ignorant of the fact that our parents died, one with the melted and molten iron and steel that cocooned their bodies. Their carcasses were inseparable from the frame of the vehicle that carried us to however many family vacations. The vessel that brought us to Disney World was now their tomb; the vehicle that brought us to the beach was now the same chemical composite as our parents. Were it up to me, I would have prolonged his revelation with bullshit in the vein of, “oh, they are traveling in Europe,” or, “they continued their weekend trip and their flights are delayed!” Bullshit. Ignorant bullshit that keeps the emotional mind at bay.

We mourned. The community supported us. I was on the verge of suicide for months. The thought of my brother being alone kept me going. Our uncle was our guardian for a while, although officially, per the government’s papers, our grandparents were our guarantors. I grew older, completed college, and watched my brother finish high school. The years that followed were uneventful. Adam got a community service commendation; I managed to break from alcoholism. I got a job in mid-management at the state health department; Adam earned an internship at the police department. We were the most typical fucked up brothers you could fine. That was until our uncle became sick.

Yes, I know what you’re thinking: oh, a family member was diagnosed with something malignant, aren’t you a special snowflake. Well, you can go fuck yourself. Uncle Jack is in hospice as we speak. I already told you this. Uncle Jack is in hospice and the sirens have been blaring all day. From all around our sleepy town in the middle of nowhere, crisscrossed by highways and interstates and roads that lead everywhere but here, the sirens have been blaring. Fire trucks and police officers from towns that never knew our name are here, portioning off an exit on the highroad.

Uncle Jack takes my hand. He looks me in the eye. The morphine is already terribly strong and it is getting stronger by the day. At this point, it is not to relieve his pain. It is simply a race against nature to cease his organ’s function. It is no longer palliative, but a challenge to god. Earlier this morning, he talked about cats I don’t own and family members that never existed, such as a sister who was “bringing him water” all day. His delusions were terrifying and pathetic. I could no longer bear to see such a loved person dealing with so much bodily failure and ultimately, pain.

Staring me in the face, he said, “Son, I appreciate everything you’ve done… but please, get your dog out of here.” At this, I was confused. I knew it was another symptom of the morphine, but I wanted to help him, however I could.

“Uncle Jack, we don’t have a dog. You know that,” I held back tears.
“Stop. Just close the door. Stop him from staring at me. Stupid… fucking… dog,” he choked.

I rose and closed the door. I could tell the end was coming. But it is never easy. It is never immediate. It is always a matter of hours, days, weeks. Sometimes, months. The sirens outside grew louder. On a day like today, no solace was spared. No grieving, nothing. Your problem was just another piece of rubbish in the mosaic that society is composed of. Little did I know that the sirens were clearing and helping sort out a pile up that was on the same interstate that killed my parents. Little did I know that my brother was driving home from classes this afternoon to help me take care of Uncle Jack. Little did I know that his sedan may have been involved.

“Son,” Uncle Jack cried. “You’ve always been as good as any child of my own that I could have prayed for. Your parents loved you. I loved you. And I could never have asked for anyone better to see me out.”
I will admit to having cried at this display.
“But please, close that damned door, that fucking dog…”
I turned to see the closed door and dropped my eyes to the floor. Poor, poor drug-induced illusions.
But, of course, he continues.

“He keeps asking me, John. He keeps asking, who do I love more, ‘Adam or John?’ Get that little bastard out of here.”

I have an (admittedly worthless) degree in audio engineering, but until now only ever focused on the studio-side of things. I'm having a bit of a life crisis (Hate my job, bands falling apart, bad breakup, etc.) I've come to the realization that I would have a really good time doing live sound tech work on tours/large productions. I know audio very well, and I currently work as a pro audio/video salesperson, so I know gear quite well too. I realize I can't immediately get picked up to tour with Josh Groban, but I'm looking for a place to start. 

Anyone with experience touring have any insight how to get into that scene? Any production companies/labels I should look into getting an internship with? I'm more than willing to relocate, so anywhere in the US is cool with me. 

Please don't just point me to the FAQ, I'm specifically talking about getting into touring. I know very well how to go to local venues and ask for jobs working under people who know just marginally more than I do. I searched the sub and didn't find any answers. Thanks! "

Anyone else questioning their chosen major?,AngryEngineer912,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/17rvps/having_a_neargraduation_crisis_anyone_else/,"I'm a senior in ME, graduating early next academic year. Never had an internship, worked for eight years before school in non-engineering jobs.

I was talking to a grad student about his thesis project at school yesterday. We got to talking about our interests in and out of school. Then he asked me a question to which I had absolutely no answer:

""What's your favorite subject to study? Fluids? Thermo? Materials?""

I was a deer in headlights. I realized that this whole time I never really *liked* any subject. I just liked challenging myself and getting good grades. I've just kind of been taking classes because they were required. I never had a thought of ""Yes. I want to be an engineer."" I took math because I was good at it and well, here I am. I chose engineering because it just made sense and I wanted to make my family proud since I'm the first to go to college.

My electives were chosen on the basis of which would least interfere with FSAE. I can honestly say that the only real times I was fully enjoying myself was when I was either working with people on a group project or cutting metal in the shop. I figured I'd just get through school and then I'd get a job I'd enjoy. I'm now beginning to wonder if ME will give me that.

I kind of a jack of all trades. I'm pretty good at writing, communicating, sales, and now engineering/design stuff. I have a lot of experience and knowledge from non-engineering jobs that I use sometimes in engineering situations. In groups, I'm best utilized as an organizer, facilitator and brainstormer. I love working with people.

Is anyone else in this boat with me? Any suggestions for what type of job to pursue?"

2) The same information will appear at the end of the show as well.

A haunting in Taylor’s Falls
By: Josh Stanway 

If you don’t believe in ghosts, don’t worry, I didn’t either. That view may have changed after I spent 5 hours with the Minnesota Paranormal Investigation Group in the Old Jail Bed and Breakfast, a famously haunted building located right in TF. I entered the building to be greeted by  Don Lawrence, the owner of the Old jail, and two of our investigation group, Rocky and Diana. Rocky is a tech expert, while Diana is a medium who deals with the more spiritual side of ghost hunting. 
	
After I had been in the building for a few minutes, don started to tell the stories of his granddaughter always seeing the spirit of a little boy. What was even creepier was that several guests had also documented this same spirit of a young boy, one stating that their child had seen the boy, and that the spirit was upset that the family would be staying in their room. Other potential spirits included: an old steamship captain who would walk from room to room smoking a cigar, an old lady that would sometimes accompany the young boy, and the spirit of a prostitute that would wear chokingly strong perfume and tear down the curtains. 
A few minutes after this, two more members of the group entered, John and his wife Anita. Anita is British, and did tours through some famously haunted castles, including the castle that Henry the eight used as his hunting lodge. We took a tour of the upstairs, including a room that a man had been dead for three days in before he was found. I felt a bit uncomfortable in that room, like I was being watched. After that we toured the other building before the group unpacked all their gear. 	
	
They first set up their investigation gear in the basement room of the B &amp; B, where a cave full of broken glass, bones, and pottery had been discovered. John and rocky set up microphones and night vision cameras, along with an electro magnetic field sensor, which can detect any entity’s presence, visible or not. 
	

John started the session attempting to communicate with the spirits using an EVP sensor, which can detect the voice of a spirit that others around it cannot detect. He started by asking the spirit simple questions.. to hear a spirits voice with an EVP, you need to listen to the playback, but none of those questions had elicited a response. He explained to me that if I were a ghost and a bunch of strangers waltzed up to me and started questioning me, what incentive would I have to communicate with them? I answered none, which is most often true. This is why it can be hard to communicate with an entity that is present.
 
After this, the rest of the group entered the suite, and Diana suggested we use a spirit box to attempt to open communication with them.  Diana explained it to me. “a spirit box is a machine that cycles through radio stations at a hundred stations per second. It allows a spirit to openly communicate with humans in real time” which is more than an EVP can do. We all sat in the corner with the spirit box running, and John and Diana questioned the spirits about all things that could relate to themselves or the building. 

After a few minutes of only static as a response, we moved into a different part of the suite. This time, john also recorded the session of the spirit box with is EVP sensor.  Right away when we started the spirit box, a mans voice said “Talk” with surprising clarity, and I immediately felt uncomfortable. I didn’t say anything and the session continued. We heard several more things, including a prolonged squeal I interpreted as Childs laughter, and “in the other room” which sufficiently frightened me. 

After this we went into the main floor where we were given pizza and the group further discussed the presence of spirits. Then myself, Rocky and Diana ventured upstairs to attempt to “scrye” out the spirits. Scrying is a method of communication with spirits that involves staring at another persons face across a candle. It is supposed to create positive energy between both parties involved, and give their faces appearence of the others past life, and potentially, entities around them. I had believed this to be silly, and I was of the impression that it would not work for me. However, after Diana had scryed with rocky several time, she had me switch places with him. 

I stared at her. She stared at me. In my mind, I knew this was all that was going to happen. But then, her face took the shape of a skull. Yes, a human skull. I was mortified, to say the least. I was shaken and terrified. The skull had appeared so realistic. I didn’t want to attempt it again, but Diana urged me on, and I accepted. This time she turned into a young Japanese girl and then a very old, angry woman. She informed me I had become two different Native American warriors, with similar facial paintings. This made her assume that both the warriors were from the same tribe. No spirits appeared to either of us, unfortunately, and at this point it was almost eleven o’clock, and I had to head for home.
	
I said goodbye to the group and left, but they stayed there for several more hours. I was positive I didn’t believe in ghosts. But now, I’m not so sure.

17rkj5,14,2013-02-02,My sister's stupid fucking wedding,stupid_fucker,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/17rkj5/my_sisters_stupid_fucking_wedding/,"My sister and I grew up together taking care of ourselves. We were poor as shit and our parents had to work many jobs just to have enough to eat. Poor as in sometimes we couldn't afford the $0.40 school reduced cut lunches. My parents worked their way up, sacrificing everything, and now they can afford her a luxury like a fucking $10,000+ wedding.

I am to be her maid of honor, with six other bridesmaids in the party. Then comes the time to buy the dresses, in which she forced my parents to foot the bill for half the dresses. I had to buy my own because she didn't want to ask money from her friends. Whatever, angry time #1. After this, her friend didn't like her dress so my sister GAVE her friend MY dress without asking me ever, forcing me to shell out another $250 for another one.

I've never said anything to her about it, except that I think it's shitty that she let her friend have two FREE dresses and I have to shell out $500 total. I complain and she gets my parents to try to buy me out. I'm not okay with this. I got fitted today and the conversation turned to the old dress again after I found out my mom gave my sister my parent's credit card to spend whatever the fuck she wants, including the alterations to her dress and I had to pay for mine.

I brought it up to her again, not even asking for the money back. All I wanted was an apology and a confession that she continually chooses her friends over her family. She then freaked the fuck out and said that she has been paying for the entire wedding even though she got $3000 from my parents for Christmas just for her reception. I told her that she hasn't paid for everything- or really anything for that matter, to which she started screaming at me in the car with my mother on the ride home telling me that I need to ""shut the fuck up"" and that I need to ""grow up"" and to ""pull over the car, she has to get the fuck out and walk home."" My mother was driving and I was five miles away. When I didn't get out the car to walk home she started to call me names and say hurtful things and about how she thinks family members are more appropriate to foot the bill for her wedding and not her friends.

I wasn't letting up, but I also wasn't being an asshole. I just kept saying I wanted an apology. She then tried to open the car door and jump out to get away from me when we were driving 50 mph on a major six lane road, causing my mother to panic and scream.

My mother has cancer right now and my parents are getting to the age where they need to start thinking about retirement and medical bills. The fact that she did that to my mother is the most abhorrent act I've ever witnessed. My mother who gave her everything.

Combined with the fact that I'm broke as fuck. I only have $4 to my name until next week when I get paid and I'm too proud to even ask for a small trip to the grocery store to eat a normal fucking meal, and not sips of the last almond milk and whatever fucking leftover dried out cheese slices. I want to do it my own way and I don't want my parents to have to sacrifice any more than they already have.

I just don't understand how she can't feel even a little bit guilty about her $200+ trips to Victoria's Secret, her $1000+ shopping sprees, her $20,000 initial wedding reception, but cancelled last minute and lost my parent's $10,000 to have it a year later. Draining their savings, just to give her something they never thought they could.

I'm just so sick of her. I'm sick of her bridezilla bullshit. Her excuse to freak out and try to jump out in traffic going 50 mph, even as a threat. I'm sick of her never talking to me unless it's about her wedding, for over a year now. Her not even trying to apologize. Her throwing tantrums in public. Her shitty and victim attitude. Fuck her, fuck her, fuck her. She's a selfish fucking bully who has tormented me since I was a child. And I have to see her again in a few hours, where I'm sure she'll give me the silent treatment and ruin my dad's birthday party tonight. Fuck her. Worst part is, she's gone through medical school, she's currently living at home rent and expense free for her internships, and still thinks the world owes her something in her late 20's. FUCK."

There were so many cries of ""awful"", but I wondered about the concern behind the message.  I understand the note was somewhat one-sided and blunt.  But when I think of my sons, and when they eventually have to choose careers, I can't say that teaching is the direction that I'd push them towards.

Please don't get me wrong.  Teaching is a second career I chose with eyes wide open.  I love it.  I understand the rewards.  But with teacher dropout rates of 46% in the first five years, I think we can agree that it's a combination of extreme pros and cons which are not for everyone.   Would you recommend it to your kids?"

Enough that I know I'm an alcoholic. I drink every night as soon as i get home and a glass of vodka to sleep and on the weekends I often end up blacking out and passing out too early in the night or making a fool of myself (2-3 times a month). I'm 22, graduated from college, moved back home and have an internship that is not interfered with by alcohol, but my family and friends all drink a lot (to the point where they're borderline alcoholics) and I can't really escape being around booze and heavy drinkers all the time. 

I like to drink and can't really imagine my life without alcohol, but I don't like how much control it has over my life. This may not even really be the place to post all of this since its called stop drinking not less drinking but I don't really know where else to share this. 

Anyways I guess my real question isn't even about drinking socially, its more about not being dependent on alcohol in an environment where alcohol is all around me. How can I stop being an alcoholic when drinking is such a big part of my life?"

the first two and a half months consisted of people telling me just how horrible i was, and how much they hated me, and how I should just disappear from this world, and I agreed with everything they said, they were right.
I went into a deep depression, I hated myself, even more than they did, everything they said hit me [right in the feels] (http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6qzcxMTqk1r95twio1_500.gif), followed by me feeling [everything sucked] (http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m89h1foznI1rd15k1o1_500.gif), and I just felt like [crying and killing myself] (http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6o5qz4BPl1r2i9ha.gif).

But all of this was needed so that I could change, and become who I am today.     
I started to apologize for all the pain I had caused, and told them how I wanted to become a better person, and never become like that again.      
I tried to be nice polite, and do nice and friendly things to them, since they deserved it after all i had done. 
But most of them didn't believe a single word  i uttered, and continued to tell me all these awful things. 

But slowly I grew tough skin, so what they said [didn't touch me] (http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6mixiduiv1rqfkcd.gif), but if I had done everything I could to make up for my mistakes ,and be nice, and they still hated me or didn't care, then i just stopped trying, and moved on. 
I've tried to prove and show them I've changed, and if that doesn't help, well then there's no hope.

I've changed, and I'm a better person now.     
I hate people pitying me, I don't want pity, because I don't need it, I'm stronger and tougher than the weaker me I used to be.     
And I'm honest, no matter what, it's one my of my life rules. Since lying ruins everything.

I hate who I've been, and if people still hate me after I've tried to be nice, and tried to make up for my mistakes, well, then I know that I've tried, and done everything I could.   
BUT    
lately I just randomly burst out in tears, it might just be delayed feelings catching up to me, or something else, I just hope it goes away, because it's really embarrassing crying on the train on my way home from my internship.       

If you've actually read all of this, well, then thanks   
if not, well, then no sweat, it's just me blabbering, and getting a huge weight off my chest."
17rfxd,3,2013-02-02,[C++] Image Processing and memory leaks ,[deleted],learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/17rfxd/c_image_processing_and_memory_leaks/,"Background: Student minoring in Computer Science; internship and way over my head with the project requests....

Unfortunately I won't be able to post any code as it is copyright, but I am looking for any references/advice. All the code is C++ and the IDE I am using is Visual C++ 6.0 (I know this is old but it's what most of the original code was written in). 

I have been asked to add a match value to indicate how similar two images are. Thus far I have been approaching this by trying to binarize an ROI for each image and compare the two using a matlab algorithm. This is where things get rough.... I have been working on this project for a week now and have barely made it anywhere. While I have been able to print out bitmaps of the binarized ROI's for some examples every time I think I fix something it breaks for a different image (often one that used to work). Most of the project relies on using previously written functions but this program is HUGE! I am having a hard time navigating through it, and am approaching the limit of my abilities to debug.

My concerns are as follows: 

-Does this seem like the right approach to the problem?

-I need to learn more about image processing, fast: ROI managing, how bufferes work, how multi-threaded processes initiate, GUI work in C++. Any suggestions?

-There is a memory leak somewhere in the program (one that I probably introduced) but am not sure how to find it. I have two object instantiations on the heap but have made sure to call delete and assign the pointers to null (in that order). Any common places for MEM leaks in image processing? I know some of you will ask: no, I am not sure I need heap allocation but do not understand enough about multithreaded processes so I thought this might be the safer approach? In retrospect that might be a terrible assumption... 


Really appreciate any constructive comments this community could give me. I am working on this project for the most part by myself... Should I possibly post these questions in /r/programming or stackoverflow? I just didn't know where to go as  I said before I won't be able to post code. Sorry for length. "

Being a teenager is tough.  Sometimes you just need to ask some questions, and I know a lot of you will have nobody you feel comfortable asking.  So from the comfortable anonymity of the net, ask away!  

I'm 22 - old enough that I've been through college and gotten a job, young enough that I'm not too far removed from the problems you'll all be experiencing now and in the near future. 

I've had experience with lots of the things you guys are or will be going through, and I'm an open book - nothing you ask will offend or surprise me, and I will respond to everything.  If you don't feel comfortable asking here, pm me and I'll respond.

17r9f3,14,2013-02-02,"Looking at Masters programs abroad from the links in the side panel. Are there any counseling services in the US to discuss options, career paths, the value of particular degrees in various countries (i.e. earning a masters abroad and taking it back to the US), etc.?",Zelaphas,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/17r9f3/looking_at_masters_programs_abroad_from_the_links/,"Sorry for the lengthy title. I'm hitting a roadblock in my career where I probably need to go back to school. I think this would be a great opportunity to study abroad. My reasons are:

* I never got the chance to study abroad while getting my bachelors, but I did take a vacation overseas and as brief as it was it opened my mind to so many things and made me crave knowledge. I think my focus on management blended with learning about other cultures and businesses around the world would make for an excellent educational career move and boost my experience and practical knowledge.
* Tuition in the United States is absolutely obscene now, and at the same time there is no guarantee that a masters will pay off (in some cases it can actually hurt you). At a glance, I've seen a few 2-3 year programs in Prague or Vaduz in the low thousands of Euros a year for tuition. (but who knows what difference this makes compared to cost of living...)
* I've spent my whole life in Illinois, and immediately after graduating in May 2008 (beautiful time for the economy, right?) I was unemployed for nearly 9 months straight. It shattered my confidence and sort of solidified the idea that if things go bad I can live with mommy and daddy as long as I need. That's not a healthy way to live, however great the intent is, and even now living in Chicago, I'm still close to my folks, friends and family that there's this idea of a safety net. I feel going abroad will help me really understand what independence and responsibility mean, and if I frame it around the focus of expanding my education, it won't turn into a shot in the dark, wanderlust scenario.

To clarify, I clawed my way up from nothing after that fit of unemployment and have much better confidence now. I understand how the job market works and what employers expect of me. But to that point, I understand I'm somewhat stagnating now and should get my ass in gear in some direction or other.

Anyways, bottom line for this, **are there any counseling services for picking up a masters or other educational program abroad?** I've used the links on the right to browse a few programs, but per my title there's a lot of unknowns and missing information that I would love to be able to sit down with someone and walk through it all. Like:

* Do they provide housing? Will I need to find my own housing? Besides whatever Craigslist du jour they have, how do I find housing remotely from the US?
* Can I bring my cat with me? (ha!)
* What's the going cost for textbooks and the like?
* Can I get an internship or other job as income while I study to help pay off tuition?
* I have only about $24k in my savings, are there scholarships or loans I can apply for? How does this work?
* What kinds of projects or reports will I be expected to complete?
* Will I work hands-on with any local businesses during my courses? If so, do I need to know a language other than English?
* Can I study another language as part of the course load?
* Do I have to study the native language of the school, or can I choose a language to study?

Etc. etc.

Thanks in advance for any help.

**Edit** : Thank you everyone for your replies so far, the information you've given is immensely helpful.

For anyone who's done this before (or not), do you know of any counseling services in the US that I could visit to hammer out some the finer details with, especially the application process and any tests I need to take before applying? Or, even, what sort of terms I might google to start hunting down a local resource?"

17qh5i,3,2013-02-01,Hypothetical: would you hire a paralegal with 1 or 1.5 years of law school under their belt?,hom3lesshom3boy,law,https://www.reddit.com/r/law/comments/17qh5i/hypothetical_would_you_hire_a_paralegal_with_1_or/,"I was thinking about alternative legal education systems and this idea came across my mind. A good paralegal is worth their weight in salt. However, I'm going to guess most paralegals don't help their attorneys write the argument sections in motions, briefs, legal memos, etc. because they haven't been to law school to understand how that writing and thinking process works.

Then you have your law school student intern. They've been trained in the ways of legal research, legal writing and Civ Pro, but most may not have a clue what it's like to work in the ""real world,"" much less in a law firm.  

So what if you were presented with this situation: A paralegal who's worked for a few years and then dropped out 1 or 1.5 years into law school, with the full intention of never becoming a lawyer and only went to learn the basics what a law student learns. It's like having a 1L or 2L summer law clerk + a trained paralegal all rolled into one.

Not to beat the shittyjobmarket horse, but on a more macro level, I think this alternative legal education system that takes paralegals and  ""graduates"" them after 1 or 1.5 years of law school addresses a lot of the problems with the legal employment market: high student debt, high cost of hiring grads, the glut of lawyers, and lack of ""good"" paralegals. But the question remains: would you hire them? Assuming you had the space and the funds?"

Just a brief intro on who I am and what I like. I'm 20 years old and am unique in almost every aspect. I am a part time sales associate at Ace hardware as well as a part time intern for a local cable channel doing high school sports events. I'm a current student at Hennepin Technical College in Eden Praire pursuing my diploma in Audio Production Specialist. I plan on continuing my education further at Anoka Ramsey Community College to over-ride my diploma into a 2 year Associates in Applied Sciences.

I can be a stubborn but yet, I am one of the nicest people that you can meet and get along with. I do have a ""hit or miss"" sense of humor, so if you don't catch on, I won't be hurt or offended. It somehow just comes on spontaneously (no there is on combustion involved with it, if there was then I'd be cooked). I'm quite difficult to upset or hurt since I care quite a bit, but when I am mad or somewhat displeased then I do tend to have a very cranky side to me. The upside of this is that I usually get over it fairly quickly (unless it was something quite dramatic).

Family is a top priority in my views and will not change no matter how much someone puts forth effort with, if this appears to be an issue I kindly ask for you to please move along. In addition I also believe my education is also one of the top priorities as I would like to finish what I've started and establish a full time job as some sort of audio engineer (maybe with my local cable company? I don't know, time will tell its tale). Music is practically the heart and soul of who I am. I am open to practically any genre since it's a part of my profession (anything extreme I'd have to ponder on). The 5 genres I'm a sucker for are Classic Rock, Alt. Rock, Techno, R&amp;B, and some Top 40.

I do know what I am looking for and it's basically this. I'm looking for someone who will actually take time and understand who I am, someone who can get along with my family, up for trying out different things (or just sit back and watch a movie, works for me), always happy most the time, and goes with the tide not knowing what to expect next in life.

Just little twinges here and there and a bit of tenderness. Last weekend it got terrible. Wearing a bra hurts so badly, it's more tender than it's ever been. And it just didn't feel right.

I had a really hard time adjusting to college work as my high school was really easy to just coast by in. I made it through the first 3 semesters with something like a 3.0 then through some circumstances and stress in the non-academic world basically I fell into a cycle of depression. I dropped most of my classes the 4th semester, failed the other 2. Went home for summer got a job, thought I would be okay, and then failed again the next fall semester. My GPA is now a 2.0, I have no hope of doing computer engineering anymore (I'm not good at the EE) and am transfering to comp sci major. 

I've been going to counseling this semester and the latter part of the previous semester, still have my job (transferred to a store here. it's retail, but i need it to pay the rent) and am doing better now but I'm still struggling to succeed. I really don't expect my GPA to get much above a 2.5 or 2.75.

My questions are basically: 1) What should I be doing alongside making better grades to help me. 2) What can I do to get noticed/get a job seeing as I now will never get those ""Minimum 3.5 gpa"" job/internship requirements I see on almost every posting.

 I sent out some resumes/applications for summer internships around thanksgiving and haven't heard anything back yet. I've been looking into trying get some form of extracurricular activity but I only know sophmore level c++ programming (some stl containers, oop, some graphics work, some work with pointers/linkedlists) and can't think of anything non-trivial I could begin working on. 

I would really appreciate some direction, or even to hear from some people in similar circumstances. Feeling rather lost"
17u1xt,1,2013-02-03,The world doesn't need someone like me and I'd like to oblige it. ,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/17u1xt/the_world_doesnt_need_someone_like_me_and_id_like/,"I don't really know where to start but here's my stats:
As a 5th year student I've switched majors 4-5 times, been on academic probation for 4 quarters (2 of which I was given a ""This is your last chance""letter), I only have 3 jobs listed in my experience, I've got almost no marketable skills (in the process of learning another language but otherwise fluent in only one language, trying to learn some kind of data analysis program but once again no where near claiming it as a skill), and I am currently in therapy for depression. I've probably also got around 15 D's, F's, W's (more D's and F's), no real relationships with any professors (although I am working on this as well) and I am approaching the end of my education with no prospects for jobs, internships, or any real rewarding life experience ahead of me. 


I feel shitty and crappy and wondering why I'm still around. It seems almost selfish this insistence that suicide is bad when people like me could use it to weed ourselves out. I feel like a parasite to my parents even though most of my rage and self-esteem issues come from the years of physical abuse (my dad would use me as a punching bag when my mom wasn't around, slamming me against the elevator walls and I'd have bruises and contusions all around my shoulders and back), the emotional abuse (of being told by my dad that I was a ""good for nothing drug using slut that parties all night ""with my other ""whore friends"" when I was a band track honor student, my mom telling me that I was fat, a slob, my dad telling me that I was ""aggressive"" and no guy would ever want me because I wanted to play the violin when he wanted me to play the trumpet), the sexual abuse (being groped by my dad and told that he ""owned 50%"" of my body and he could do what he wanted with it, having my face slammed into the tile of the kitchen floor and knowing there was no way out). Being told that I'm responsible for the marriage break down and that I contribute to their lives being worse. 


But no employer wants to hear any of that. No one (besides my partner) wants to deal with the baggage. They don't want to hear that by the time I got to college I was so angry, tired, pissed off that I had to re-learn what it meant to interact with normal people. That you could constructively criticize an idea without laying in to the person and being called an ""incestuous freak"" they way my dad would call me, because he and my my mom were separated but they had to share the 1 bedroom apartment so that he got the bedroom whereas my mom and I had to share a bed in the tiny living room because he refused to let us get a small cot and out it where he kept his huge drafting board from college that he never used and didn't want to sell because he wanted $25,000 (because that's how much he paid for it 30 years ago) when the going price on craigslist was for $6000. 


No one really cares that most of college was spent picking up the pieces especially when I began getting the symptoms for interstitial cystitis and that I had to skip classes because I was in so much agony that I couldn't get out of bed but of course there was no way to prove I was in pain and OSD said ""good luck!"" and professors said ""Too bad"". That eventually I stood up for myself (with the help of my partner) and told them that I was not going to be their Doctor child and that I refused to apply to med school because it was not what I wanted to do. 


Because to an employer or a grad program or even the peace corp, I have no relevant experience, no skills, not even grades...nothing to show. I have nothing to contribute. Even though I am back at school and studying as hard as I can, doing great at managing my flare ups, attempting to gain fluency in another language, going to therapy to deal with my mental health, and further trying to improve my interpersonal communication by assisting with the administration of a local book club.....it all seems to mean nothing. And it hurts. I just want it to stop hurting and I want to feel like I can be someone better than this, a happy, confident, sexy example that things can always get better.   "

Your professors/advisors are active participants in the industry you are entering, they are professionals with contacts, and decades of experience. They want to see you succeed.
Your peers are the people who will be driving the industry of the future. They will be starting businesses and taking over existing positions. They will be educating the future generations

These people are your ins, your references, your future bosses and employees. *They* are what you should focus on. Good connections mean infinitely more for your job security than a 5.0 gpa and a double major cum laude. When you graduate, your degree becomes a line in your resume and a piece of paper on your wall.

I'm pretty messed up. I started masturbating 'prone' in 1st grade. Started  internet porn at 13. I'm 30 now. I grew up religious so most of the girls I dated never wanted to do anything sexual so I'm not that experienced. I had one girlfriend I did oral with a lot so I'm pretty good at that. I never got too hard when she reciprocated, I figured she was just not very good at it. I had a few hook ups that never went well performance wise but I blamed that on being shy/ not being in love with them, feeling guilty etc. I tried to stop PMO many times because of my religion. I went through phases of guilt and not caring. 
About a year ago I quit religion and gave myself free licence to PMO and have sex. I used porn pretty much everyday and started using toys since. It got to the point where it was really hard to get myself off, but I also couldn't go a day without getting off at least once. 
About 6 months ago I hooked up with a cute intern from work after her internship was over. I visited her in another state for a week. She was easily the hottest girl I've ever dated or been with and I couldn't get erect at all with her. That's when I knew I had a problem. After that I tried some acupuncture and other ED remedies. I thought that it was helpling but I wasn't with anyone for a while. I kind of new I needed to stop PMO but was still kind of in denial I guess.
A couple weeks ago I just met the most amazing girl ever. I can totally see myself with her long-term. So my 'problem' has come up again. I did some internet research and came here as well as other sites. The good thing is now I know I need to give up PMO. I've been PMO free for about a week and a half. I'm totally flatlining right now. Every time I tried to quit before was impossible. I think now that I know PMO has caused me to have ED makes it easier this time.
My ED is causing some strain in the relationship so I'm hoping for a quick recovery, but no matter what happens I know I need to stick with this if I want to be able to have real relationships. Another good thing is I'm feeling much more confident now, it was pretty easy to meet this girl and she really likes me and at the time I had a few other girls that wanted to date me.

thing.

* How do you pronounce Rennes? :$ Whenever I listened from a native French speaker
its almost imposible to me to distinguish its sound clearly, and I'm afraid I'll

* Things to do/see in Rennes or near it?

* Public transport in France. How does it work? How much does it cost?

* Nightlife and cultural events in Rennes

* Pay as you go phones. Can I buy a SIM if I have an unlocked phone?

* I've read that it is consider rude in France to talk to a stranger in a foreinge
language without greeting at least in French. Is this true?

* Is it true that there are more people who speak Spanish than English? Or that
French people kind of hate English?

* Regional food to try

* Is it too cold there? Does it snow?

I am sick and tired of laptops as they keep crashing and failing -- not to mention their inherent immobility.

My 800-900 dollar laptop has been bugging out for the last year, and now it is too bad for me to handle. I was thinking about getting a tablet so that I cannot play high-end games so that I can get more work done. I am studying at the university and make a significant amount of projects. Additionally, I am going to China for my internship in autumn, so I would like to use my future tab for work as well.

As such, I am looking for a tab that is sturdy, while being able to play movies, play music, read PDF files, good to okay'ish for note-taking, and good for writing projects.

Now, my projects don't have a ton of visual stuff that would be problematic for a tablet. All that is needed for the project work is the ability to use a keyboard for writing. 

The tab and keyboard should be fairly cheap as I am a student, and money going to this tab will take money from my trip to China. I'm counting on spending about the same amount of cash as the Ipad 2 costs -- not including the accessories, ofc, in case the keyboard isn't part of the product. 
I would love for the capability to have GPS so that I can find my way around Beijing or Shanghai.

Any suggestions? Is it dumb of me to get a tab? I've read about bloggers using their tabs heavily for writing stuff, so it appears to be decent if used with a keyboard. Should I get a notebook instead? even though that won't allow me to be mobile and read on the bus and such. It would really be easier if I had a tab with a keyboard case -- but maybe it is naive or me to think that it will work?

Thoughts?

P.S: If you say that a tab can't be used for writing, please state why. =)"

How about a student visa?,omginternets,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/17t8fa/usimmigration_im_returning_from_france_and_my/,"The details are somewhat particular, so I'll try to clearly outline the relevant facts.

- I'm 25 and she's 23
- She's been to the U.S. before for about 6 months -- I believe this was on a student visa.
- She speaks excellent English
- The goal is for her to come for a year to work as an intern in an ivy-league laboratory before applying for a Ph.D position.

To clarify the last point above, the idea is for her to be able to come live with me.  This means she needs to have career options.  The point of all of this is **not** to work the system so that she can go to school here -- it's so we can stay together.

The issue I'm concerned about is that she won't officially be a student, but instead be an intern.  This means she won't be officially enrolled in the university, which I'm assuming makes her ineligible for a student visa.  She will very likely be unpaid as well.  Could she still qualify for an H-1B visa?  Are there any other options other than getting married right away?  I think it'll happen eventually, but if we could wait a few more years, that would be great.

What are our options, here?"

So we are already into February (fuck!) and I was wondering what you were hoping to achieve in the next 11 months. 

I'll get this ball rolling. I am hoping to graduate vet school come July and have just handed in my application for an internship. It's highly competitive and they rarely take new graduates, but screw it, I want it badly enough so we will see. I am also hoping to spend some time in summer travelling and seeing friends abroad. My final goal is to reach the 80kg mark on my bulk. I'm currently at 75kg and am determined to reach that milestone.

So lets here it guys. Your turn!"
17t56j,3,2013-02-03,So fucking tired of this shit.,10Years2Live,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/17t56j/so_fucking_tired_of_this_shit/,"It's the same thing every day. Same boring shit, day after day. Wake up, school (or not), read reddit, eat, sleep. Maybe program something or play  a video game if I feel like it (almost never). There's no point to it all. I don't like it here. The people suck, there's nothing to do, and I'm just tired of it all. I've recently escaped to anime. My last safe place. I can get out and live the life I *actually* want. The worst part of it all is that no one *knows* that I'm depressed. To everyone else, I'm just the cheerful guy who just is very picky about stuff. I can't stand it any longer. So I've finally decided to start doing something. I can't possibly find any sort of point to it all, so I've gone and challenged myself to a game. I've already set the timer on my computer. 10 Years from now is the deadline. 2023, on my 30th birthday (hence the throwaway account name).

The goal is to achieve either (or both) of the following:

1. Find a reason to live. Said reason cannot be another challenge/game.

2. Do *everything* that I want to do at the moment. Basically make my anime fantasy a reality. This includes becoming a full-time game developer, getting the girl of my dreams, and moving to Japan, among other things.

If I fail, I plan to suicide. As of right now, I have 318600000 seconds. I'm not close to achieving *any* of the goals. I've already taken steps to start the process, and if all goes as planned, I should be in Japan in 5 years.

However, considering I barely have the motivation to pull myself out of bed, I don't think I'll be able to do this. The reason I've decided to do this is because I'm simply tired of it. I've given myself 10 years so I have some time to evaluate and to prevent any hasty decisions. In 10 years, I'll be through roughly 30% of my natural lifespan, and I don't care to live the last 30%. That only really leaves 30% to be decided.

I see death as an end. And that end is going to come no matter what I do. But considering I'd rather be on the other side of the screen....

Whether I actually go through with any of this or not really doesn't matter. Whatever happens, happens. It's either random or already determined, so it's not like I have a choice in the matter.

I'm really just depressed and need a hug I suppose. Someone who can see through my web of lies. Just sit there and give me a purpose. A reason. I think the only thing that can help at this point is a god (if one exists). I'm honestly wishing I had schizophrenia, just so life would be interesting. That's why I got into video games, anime, and game development. Because I just want to be entertained. I just want to *leave*.

I have no idea why I'm posting this here. Maybe I just want someone to listen.

Perhaps some of you want to listen in on how my little game is going? Current progress stands at rudimentary japanese knowledge, 3/4 to a bachelor's degree (needed to move to japan), and my schedule blocking any access to visiting japan. As I mentioned earlier, no one interests me, so the whole friends/girl thing is going horribly. If anything, I'd like to just be able to pull someone out of the screen. A dakimakura maybe? Nonetheless, my path to being a game developer seems secure, I've already published a title, and am working towards internships.

But really, this is all nice, but I don't care about any of it. It's all fake. And in the end, it's all going to disappear anyway. I already know what happens. What's the point when there aren't any surprises?

Sleep is probably what is causing me so much misery. I can't get any of it, and the little bit that I do has no dreams. People say I dream, but I don't. I fucking don't. Don't tell me that I do, because I don't. I *know* when I dream. I *experience* it, like it is life. That has only happened a few times in my life. And I wish I was eternally like that rather than this POS life that I'm stuck in.

Help /r/depression. Help. I'm really tired of this. 10 years. It seems like such a short time, yet a long time all the same. Even 90 or 100 years seems short. I've already lived through 20. That felt like nothing. Just a few years of ""friends"" and a few years of games. Then now. That's it. That's all 20 years is.

What do you think /r/depression?

Edit: Just another sidenote (unrelated): I'm sick an fucking tired of people not even caring when it's my birthday. It's happens every year. Tons of parties, cake, fancy dinners, presents, etc for everyone else. For me? ""Happy birthday!"" on facebook and that's it. Nothing fucking else. Not a ""hope you are doing alright"" no dinners, no cake, no decorations, fucking nothing. I feel my parents only give me stuff to not make me feel terrible. But I know they don't like me. They flat out said to me ""I know you don't care about anything or even care if people die"". They never listen, and just mock me when I'm being myself. I've pretty much all but severed ties with most people. I have a facebook account but never chat with anyone. I don't even know why I go there. I'm just fucking tired of it all. "

I hate to come to you with this sad kind of question, but I do think I need some help.

I'm a sophomore in college. Last year was my freshman year, and I had a lot of feelings of loneliness. I passed it off as not having close enough friends here, being far away from my family, and just starting a new routine in general.

This year, I have a really solid group of friends. I live with five great friends in my apartment, and have lots of others outside of it as well.

Because of the way my school works, we have two or three semester where we will work full time at an internship instead of going to school (it's called co-op, if you've never heard of it). So I am on co-op right now, working 40 hours a week. I absolutely LOVE the job that I am doing, and I don't dread going to work at all. It's the weekends that get me. For the last two weekends, I have just felt lonely. Last weekend, I didn't do much, so I promised myself that I would see friends this weekend and see if it got any better. It didn't. I went out both nights, hung around a lot of people that I was close to, but it just didn't make me feel happy.

I'm missing the point of the weekend. They go by so fast and I have nothing to do on them anyway. I'd almost rather be working.

I often feel this way though. After I've spent a period of time with my family, I'll come back to school and feel lonely. I love my family, and I'm thousands of miles away from them when I'm at school. I love being out here on my own, but it's hard when I've just spent great time with them, and when I know I won't see them for six months.

I'm hoping that gradually, these feelings will go away. But I'd like to be able to fix them myself. How do I stop feeling lonely in a world where I have lots of great friends?

:(

Sorry for the long post, but thanks reddit."

At this point, I am almost sure that I won't get an internship, and would like to focus on developing new skills that would be useful and would potentially look good on the CV. 
From this subreddit I have found out that learning Excel is always useful and I have recently enrolled in a MS Office Professional training course, someone else also suggested learning a programming language. 
Is there anything else that you guys could suggest ?

P.S. English is not my first language, sorry any mistakes.

I've been teaching at a school for the last couple of months for my internship. I have a colleague who's really quite cute, and with Valentine's Day coming I thought about leaving a rose and a card in her postbox.

And then doubt settled in. You know how it goes. You start with a neat idea, and shortly after you start criticizing it. For instance, we didn't even really talk that much to begin with. We hardly know each other. Also, I'm really not sure whether we'd be good together.

Then again, it's not like I'm asking her to marry me. It might actually be a possibility to find out whether or not it could work, and it might be fun either way. If I'm a bit more playful about it.

I was useless. I was lame, heartbroken, poor, failing school, and losing friends like you wouldn't believe. Looking back, I was probably depressed too. This was senior year of high school. I was fucking pissed. At the world, at my parents, at my teachers, at my peers, at girls, at my brother. I couldn't understand why everyone seemed to have so much; so many friends, so much sex, so much love, so many prospects, so much money. I graduated and went to Western Michigan University... it wasn't exactly Harvard. But there I met my suitemates who came from terrible poverty. Like, ""I'm not sure if we're going to have electricity this month,"" poverty. And they worked their asses off, got scholarships, and went to school. One of the kids took a job at the front desk in one of the dorms and sent half of his paycheck to his mother because she was struggling to make ends meet with his three brothers. Really inspiring stuff. Anyway, this made me realize something. I was not ""awesome"" as the guy above on 4chan said. I fucking sucked. The world did not owe me money, a girlfriend, love, parents, a brother, good teachers, good grades, or a good future. Those things are earned; well, most of them at least. I pulled myself up, dusted myself off, and hit the books. I'd never studied before, so the first semester I got a 3.2. Second semester I got a 3.3. Not great, but good enough to transfer to a Big Ten university. I did, and I've been climbing up ever since. I'm a junior now and I'm well on my way to going to law school. I have a 3.6 overall GPA, I'm captain of an academic team at my school, and I have an internship in a law office. I worked all that stuff out, and my parents and brother worked themselves out as well. Now I'm happier, and I've managed to have a great group of friends. I stopped thinking the world owed me that shit, and I went out and earned it. We are the product of all that ""self-esteem"" bullshit they told you when you are little. That your are special, beautiful, perfect, a snowflake. They told it to you because they saw that kids with high self esteem perform better, and they thought it would help you. They didn't realize that performing better creates high self-esteem, not the other way around. If you want to feel like a god, simply go out and kick ass. It's the only way to feel good long term.***"

I was accepted a year ago in education at the university, entered with my job experience in a youth center.

Went to the local health center last week to get tricks to develop my organisation skills and through that, my motivation, I will have consultations in three month.

From 4 courses, I canceled 3 of them, one was my internship, which is gonna delay my diplomation to 1 year later, more debts, more motivation to build and not drop another time. Much more free time to waste on computer games. I’m a compulsive gamer, I lack that electric impulse in my muscle and brain to make my body stand up from in front of that computer and make something of my life, projects, achieve something once in a while. I’m in the prime of youth, or… well it is getting behind more and more and I am still not… proud of myself. Feeling incomplete, deliberately not using my capacities.

I graduated from college in December, with no plan, no job, and with no idea what I needed to do to figure those things out. I've literally been dreading this period of my life since I was a kid, to the points of having panic attacks about it. That anxiety follows me around a lot. To be totally honest (and I don't know how normal this is, but I always assumed it was until I started asking around), I didn't expect to live this long. No terminal illness or thoughts of suicide, I just...didn't think I would live past 21. Just didn't occur to me. 

And then I graduated. I lived (until then) in a student run co-ops, and had been for the last 5 years. The biggest house I lived in held 100 people, the smallest, 20. I loved it, but when I graduated I had to move out. I didn't have a lot of time so I ended up signing a six-month lease for a 1BR. Completely and totally different than what I'm used to. Not only that, I went in signing it with the assumption that my boyfriend would be there to help me adjust. 

The day I came home from a short Christmas break (and the day before I moved), he broke up with me. We had been together for a year and a half. I won't say it was perfect, and we had broken up before, but he just said he couldn't do it. I blame myself for a lot of it. Actually, I blame myself for it completely. The last few months before my graduation were a whirlwind of constant panic attacks, emotional dependence, freak outs and just regular depression. I didn't want him to be around me for the most part, because I didn't want to be seen like that but he still stuck around. I made the mistake of calling him one time during a panic attack while I was on holiday, and asked him what would happen when I went away for grad school. I guess that was just as much as he could take of me. The line got silent, and he said we would figure it out. He sent me a text the next day saying we needed to talk...that was the end of that. 

And so then I'm completely alone in this one bedroom, father from the central part of the city than I'm used to (I ride my bike as transportation so it makes it especially difficult), no boyfriend, no job, extremely depressed, extremely alone, and just...floating. 

Its been a month, and I've done a lot that should make me happy.  I've gotten a job and an internship in the field I'm interested in, I hang out with friends, see my family, have hobbies, things along those lines, and still feel a complete detachment from everything around me. The accomplishments I've achieved don't actually hit home anymore, and the things I should revel in don't stir me. I've pulled myself up by the bootstraps and still feel like shit. I don't know when I'll surface, and I don't know when I feel better, but the state I'm in now is the lowest I've been in a while...I don't know what to do. I'm not expecting really anyone to read this, I think I just needed to type it out. Maybe get a few internet hugs, or just to be in someones thoughts for a moment. "

They're urges that yield results. How do I mean? When I take my fist and push it against my neck, as if I'm holding a knife, and imagine the blade sliding through my flesh, I feel a real sense of relief and satisfaction.

I feel it most every day. From when I wake up to when I go to bed. It makes my legs weak, my chest sink, and creates a sensation as though someone is tuggung on my esophagus. I'm going to puke.

The anxiety hangs behind my eyes, engulfing my senses in a numbness I can't quite push away. It has triggers. Triggers I've taken the time to distinguish, but I have no idea how to deal with them. 

I'm living a good life. Full time student, a good internship, an accomplished and loved local DJ. What the fuck do I have to be depressed about anymore? I guess the last 5 years of my life I spent numb and alone really made a lasting impact.

I don't sleep. I don't relax. I'm stressed 100% of the time.

Thank you all for your advice and opinions. ,hoveezy,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/17socg/im_not_attending_law_school_thank_you_all_for/,"About a month ago I posted in r/law about advice on going to law school:  http://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/15m6tu/is_it_really_that_bleak_out_there/

Most people suggested I look at the job prospects objectively. A couple of you guys were encouraging. But I finally made my decision and I'm deciding not to go to law school. 

Aside from the advice I got from this subreddit, here's what I'm basing my decision on: I interned for a public interest foundation and I recently spoke with some of the attorneys there. One attorney asked me if I wanted to practice the law or if I wanted to help people. I told him I wanted to help people. I realized then that I shouldn't go to law school. My love for the internship had more to do with assisting low income clients than it did with practicing the law. I mostly felt indifferent to the doc review work I did there. So I'm giving up on my pursuit of going to law school. 
I spoke with my favorite professor a week ago and he told me to ""follow your bliss."" 
I'm getting my masters, then a credential to teach in high school. Your advice has really helped me. I just wanted to thank you guys for all your help and advice. "

[Kerry, of the original 151, which pokemon would you have sex with, other than Scyther of course?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rfxs/we_work_at_rooster_teeth_the_company_behind_red/c885mog?context=5)|Obviously Mr.Mime. Have you seen those hands?
 |Kerry.
 |I'm gonna answer this too. Lickitung. -Chris.
[Chris and Nick: Did you want to kill Kerry when he lost the ring?  Kerry: What did you think when you lost the ring?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rfxs/we_work_at_rooster_teeth_the_company_behind_red/c885ufd?context=5)|I was just really mad at myself for wasting our time and energy more than anything else. Ring bearing is hard man.  Not at all. Shit happens. That's why we filmed it. I mean, when things go wrong, it can often times make documentaries more intersting. And we found it in the end so Sauron didn't win. -Chris.
[Boobs?  Kerry.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rfxs/we_work_at_rooster_teeth_the_company_behind_red/c886ez3?context=5)|Yeah, definitely boobs. -Chris.

I think my favorite reaction was Geoff one day when we were trying out our costumes. He just sort of smiled and shook his head. He was in the army so I think he had a good idea of what we were in for. - Chris.
 |I'm pretty sure there were some bets going on. I'm still waiting for my cut.
 |Kerry.
[So how good did it feel to finally bury the ring?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rfxs/we_work_at_rooster_teeth_the_company_behind_red/c885tos?context=5)|Better than sex. -Chris.
[What does sex feel like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rfxs/we_work_at_rooster_teeth_the_company_behind_red/c8873f6?context=5)|Like burying a ring into the ground. Except not as good.

[ what were your favourite Moments of the trip?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rfxs/we_work_at_rooster_teeth_the_company_behind_red/c885kvt?context=5)|As lame as it sounds, the first time we saw the Mountain was pretty spectacular for me. It made it feel like we actually had a chance of finishing.
 |Kerry.
 |When we first saw the mountain I got chills. Also, when we got to the end of a 70km stretch of road on day 5 it was pretty awesome because that was when we knew we might actually have a chance at finishing. I also immensely enjoyed anytime we sat down. Especially when candy was involved. - Chris.
[Nick, are you a regular guide in New Zealand? Or how did you get involved with Chris and Kerry's adventure?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rfxs/we_work_at_rooster_teeth_the_company_behind_red/c885lh1?context=5)|When Kerry and I first started planning the trip, we realized we'd need help with transportation and supplies from someone in New Zealand. Then I remembered I'd met Nick a couple months earlier when he came to visit our office. And Nick was perfect: a talented film professional, a fan of Rooster Teeth, and physically able to do it. Plus he's just an awesome guy. And after realizing all of that, we decided to have a third person come with us on the walk. And that was the best decision we made. -Chris.
[Who smelt the worst at the end?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rfxs/we_work_at_rooster_teeth_the_company_behind_red/c885pfk?context=5)|Probably Kerry or me. We wore our Hobbit outfits the whole time without changing or showering and Nick at least changed clothes every once in a while. We were some pretty stinky hobbits. Just remembering the smell of our feet when we took off our shoes makes me want apologize to Nick again. -Chris.
 |Turns out, chaffing smells just as bad as it hurts.
 |Kerry.

On working at Roosterteeth: What does Nathan do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rfxs/we_work_at_rooster_teeth_the_company_behind_red/c885m19?context=5)|I would say that Nick had the worst blisters overall. His feet were destroyed all over. My pinky toe might have had the most concentrated blister on it though. -Chris.
[Boobs or ass?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rfxs/we_work_at_rooster_teeth_the_company_behind_red/c885kkc?context=5)|Boobs please -Chris.
 |Boobies.
 |Kerry.
[What do you prefer about LOTR in the books and films? Like, what bits were skipped from the books that you liked, and what scenes were better in the films? Also, what do you think about the Hobbit being three movies?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rfxs/we_work_at_rooster_teeth_the_company_behind_red/c885lx3?context=5)|I love both the books and the movies. I read The Hobbit when I was 12 and then immediately went and bought LoTR (and a map of Middle Earth so I could follow along). When I finished the books and heard they were making movies, I was stoked. I still remember the first time I saw the trailer in theaters. I got goosebumps and my stomach dropped. I was sad the scouring of the shire wasn't in the movies, but as a filmmaker myself, I understand why it wasn't included. I thought it was ridiculous they were making The Hobbit into three movies when I first heard about it, but I also trust Peter Jackson so I'm excited to see the next two. Plus, it means two more movies of Middle Earth. -Chris.
 |I'm a big fan of both. My favorite scene out of the series is coming up, when Bilbo and Smaug first talk in his den. Pretty excited for that. I trust Peter Jackson and I feel like there is enough content to work with, so I'm excited that it's going to be 3 movies.
 |Kerry.
[How did you familys feel about you guys going?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rfxs/we_work_at_rooster_teeth_the_company_behind_red/c885ld9?context=5)|My parents were worried about me but felt much better once they found out Nick was going with us. They thought it was brilliant/dumb. Much like a lot of my ideas as a child. This one didn't end in a hospital trip so that was good.
 |Kerry.
 |Well, you actually see my mom in it but after that skype session she told me how genuinely worried she was. My sister thought I was insane. And I don't think any of them thought we would finish but they were supportive. I mean, they kind of had to be because they knew I was going to do it regardless. - Chris.
[Which prior ideas of yours have resulted in hospital trips?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rfxs/we_work_at_rooster_teeth_the_company_behind_red/c8861zm?context=5)|Deciding that I wanted to use a chisel to make art when I was 4.
 |Kerry.
[That can only end well.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rfxs/we_work_at_rooster_teeth_the_company_behind_red/c886zt3?context=5)|That's exactly what my 4 year old brain said.
 |Kerry.
[Loved the series, thought it was a great idea, but also *kind of* felt bad for y'all and your gross blistery feet n stuff. Anyway.  What was the first thing you guys did when you got home? (i.e. sleep for a year, cuddle with each other, play some halo\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rfxs/we_work_at_rooster_teeth_the_company_behind_red/c885pl4?context=5)|I wish we could have come back and relaxed but we pretty much started editing it immediately since we wanted to get the whole series out before Christmas. That meant working non-stop for 3 weeks and pretty much living in the office. I also developed Bronchitis during the trip so that plus no sleep made post-production almost as difficult as the actual walk. But thankfully editing doesn't require you to move your feet. -Chris.
 |Right before sleeping for a day I replied to all of the emails I had from family/friends/and co-workers letting them no that we didn't die.
 |Kerry.
[What was your inspiration to do this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rfxs/we_work_at_rooster_teeth_the_company_behind_red/c885nu4?context=5)|Fuckin love Lord of the Rings -Chris.
 |Knowing that it was remotely possible.
 |Kerry.
[I can't think of any good questions but I'm a big fan and I wanted to take part in this somehow so… What is your favorite color?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rfxs/we_work_at_rooster_teeth_the_company_behind_red/c885zth?context=5)|Blue.
 |Kerry.
[I hope Chris says Red.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rfxs/we_work_at_rooster_teeth_the_company_behind_red/c886zp7?context=5)|Damn, now I feel pressured. - Chris.
[What was it like working with Elijah Wood for season 10? Did you guys fangirl out when you saw him?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rfxs/we_work_at_rooster_teeth_the_company_behind_red/c885r2z?context=5)|I didn't get to work with him directly on Red vs Blue, but I was lucky enough to meet him once when he came to our office. I absolutely [geeked out like a fangirl.](http://roosterteeth.com/members/images/image.php?id=2975667) -Chris.
[If given the opportunity, would all three of you do it again?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rfxs/we_work_at_rooster_teeth_the_company_behind_red/c885knh?context=5)|I would definitely do it again if we had lost the footage or something like that before it got released, but if I'd much rather do a new walk than the same one again.
 |Kerry.
 |I would do it again but take a lot more time with it so it wouldn't be as painful. New Zealand is absolutely beautiful and it was amazing just seeing the country while we walked. That being said, I'd rather attempt a different adventure in the future than do this one twice. -Chris 
[What was the hardest part of the trip?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rfxs/we_work_at_rooster_teeth_the_company_behind_red/c885lbz?context=5)|Walking through the cut-down forest was pretty rough. It was high noon and there was zero shade.
 |Kerry.
 |Climbing up the mountain on the last day was the hardest part for me. My leg sort of stopped working. -Chris.
[Hey Kerry, how stupid is Chris?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rfxs/we_work_at_rooster_teeth_the_company_behind_red/c885sz6?context=5)|Stupid enough to go on this walk. Smart enough to edit it.
 |Kerry.

 |Kerry.
[Since Kerry and Chris were carrying the Ring and were basically being Sam and Frodo, does that mean Nick was Gollum?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rfxs/we_work_at_rooster_teeth_the_company_behind_red/c885r9n?context=5)|We actually cut a bit from the first episode where we compare him to Aragorn. They actually look pretty damn similar. -Chris.
[Hey how did both of you get yours jobs at roosterteeth?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rfxs/we_work_at_rooster_teeth_the_company_behind_red/c885pg5?context=5)|I started as an intern and was lucky enough to be able to stick around.

 |We met Matt and Burnie after entering a short film contest where they were the judges. After seeing our stuff, they decided to hire us to help write and produce some projects for Rooster Teeth when they needed extra help. After about 8 months of working on a project-by-project basis, I was offered full time job at RT. -Chris.

And it'd be neat because I figure one of them might actually be yellow somehow. -Chris.
 |I would almost always rather fight one thing than multiple things.
 |Kerry.
[Have you ever tried to suck your own dick?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rfxs/we_work_at_rooster_teeth_the_company_behind_red/c885r8n?context=5)|Watch this for your answer: [Link to roosterteeth.com](http://roosterteeth.com/archive/?id=6737&amp;v=mor) -Chris.

 |Kerry.
[So, we saw your feet Kerry, but your thighs...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rfxs/we_work_at_rooster_teeth_the_company_behind_red/c885wop?context=5)|They got pretty bad. It was definitely one of the many things that slowed us down.
[Just how bad did they end up being?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rfxs/we_work_at_rooster_teeth_the_company_behind_red/c885wop?context=5)|Compression shorts.
[Was there something you wish you had brought that you didn't have on the trip?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rfxs/we_work_at_rooster_teeth_the_company_behind_red/c885wop?context=5)|Kerry.
[What was the scariest thing that happened to you guys? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rfxs/we_work_at_rooster_teeth_the_company_behind_red/c885rkn?context=5)|When the farmer caught us trespassing on his land. We were really scared he would kick us out and not let us keep going and that would have made it impossible to finish without missing our flight home. Or when we were out in the woods on day 3 past sundown without our tent or more water. Or when I took my shoes off on day 2 and smelled my feet. -Chris.
 |Definitely getting caught on provate property. The only thing worse than going to jail is going to jail in a foreign country.
 |Kerry.
[Did you get any cool souvenirs from the trip? (Besides blisters\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rfxs/we_work_at_rooster_teeth_the_company_behind_red/c8862rv?context=5)|A video series.

No, not at all. We actually only passed through one small town along the route we took. We also hiked along several trails so that helped it feel more like Middle Earth. And then when we got to Mount Doom, no one was there because the road was closed so that felt the most like the movie and books. -Chris.
[Why didn't you just take an eagle?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rfxs/we_work_at_rooster_teeth_the_company_behind_red/c8862fw?context=5)|Eagles would have been waaay to easy.
[When did you guys get the idea to actually do this and how long did it take in planning?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rfxs/we_work_at_rooster_teeth_the_company_behind_red/c885kz2?context=5)|We came up with the idea around the end of 2011/beginning of 2012. We knew we were going to piggy back this trip with some Australian conventions in the fall of 2012, so we had that long to plan. Unfortunately we were also very busy during that time so we didn't get to plan as much as we would have liked.
 |Kerry.
[Did you guys encounter any crazy animals other than Chris.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rfxs/we_work_at_rooster_teeth_the_company_behind_red/c885phb?context=5)|Just sheep and cows mostly. Though there was a time when an entire herd of cows just followed us around until we passed their field. It was surprisingly creepy. They just stared at us... Cows are scary, man. - Chris.
 |Does NZ have crazy animals? I thought everything was fluffy or edible.
 |Kerry.
[How many times did you guys bang.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rfxs/we_work_at_rooster_teeth_the_company_behind_red/c885sqi?context=5)|Over 9000. -Chris.

We averaged about 6 hours of sleep a day and the rest of the time we were either walking, shooting, eating or breaking down/setting up our tent. -Chris.
[Kerry, Chris. No question here. Just go let everyone at The studio that they are amazing. And thank you for doing what you do.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rfxs/we_work_at_rooster_teeth_the_company_behind_red/c88627t?context=5)|Kerry.

I applied for JET, but unfortunately wasn't chosen. I'd like to have to work and do the daily grind, as opposed to going on a vacation and just sight-seeing. I'm more interested in the culture and people and everyday-life. I'm also interested in what it'd be like to be a minority because check your privilege and all that.

Are there any options out there? Or should I just forget it and quit being dumb and work on my resume? Thanks for any help.

I'm going to apply for an internship with a company that wants me to make an online account to submit my resume.  Like so many websites these days, it gives me the opportunity to use my facebook account to sign in.  I pretty sure don't have anything that would set off an employer's red flags on my account, but I also don't see any reason to let an employer to have access to information about my political or religious beliefs (which can easy be figured out from my comment history), or even just to see the embarrassing pictures my friends have put up from high school. 

On the other hand, I could see that giving a potential employer access to my facebook would be kind of a good-faith gesture, and they would have the opportunity to see that I'm not a terrorist neo-nazi that likes to organize honey badger fights in her basement.

Thoughts?"

We used to have sex regularly, but I've just been putting him off since I've been back (which is bad, I know). But, being the VERY typical horny 19 year old guy, this isn't really working. I feel like he really loves me, and I don't think it's his fault, but I just have absolutely no desire. The thought actually makes me feel kind of sick.

I think maybe it's because I'm really focused on my schoolwork right now so I can claim a job at the business that I interned at, and that is just distracting my focus. 

I don't know what to tell my boyfriend. I feel like a shitty girlfriend, but I don't want to fake it completely because that would most likely upset him even more.

I am a graduate student and I receive tuition remission through my program, which is listed on the 1098-T as grant/scholarship money. We all have assistantships, and I'm pretty sure we're required to hold those positions in order to get the tuition remission, though I could be wrong. 

I decided to try both H&amp;R Block and TurboTax's free online filing programs, and there is a HUGE difference between what they say I should be getting--H&amp;R Block says I should get about $500 back, TurboTax says I should have to *pay* 400.

Since they keep a handy little tally of what you owe as you go along, I can tell that it is this question on TurboTax (which is not on H&amp;R Block) that's causing me to owe money: ""Did the scholarship, grant or other education assistance you received in 2012 require you to work in an internship, volunteer, research or other service position?"" When I click yes, it asks me how much of the money was payment or income for teaching/research/etc. and when I put all of it, I suddenly owe a bunch of money. This seems...wrong, given that I make all of $15,000 per year. Any insight into this? Am I doing something wrong?"

I've heard repeatedly that my major is stupid and worthless and I have no skills and I'm never going to make any money. It's never been my goal to be rich, but I'm so scared that I really am a failure even though I had good grades and still volunteer at an internship for a literary magazine. English and writing are the only things I loved to study and I'm terrible at even basic college math.

I have had a hard year involving different institutions not treating me w
well. This summer I worked part-time at an unpaid internship. I spent several hours a week just driving around during deliveries for them, and while they said I would be refunded for my gas, I never was. They wouldn't even bother completing a form at the end of the summer confirming to my school that I had worked with them.

My school is another deal, I attempted to report a sexual assault to them and they wouldn't let me, then when I said I was going to withdraw half-way through the semester they said I would be refunded... a few months later I am in more debt than I can fathom, half-way to a bachelor degree and living at home.

**tl/dr i am used to being screwed over** 

So while not having a job doesn't leave me homeless, I need to find one. 

I got a job at a small cafe, and been going in to train. They haven't had me fill out any paperwork, or really done much to train me. I've been washing a lot of dishes, because everyone seems to be annoyed when I ask them to show me how to do something. I keep asking when I will fill out the forms that make me an official employee, and they keep saying they will have it the next time I come in. This has happened five times in the two weeks since I was interviewed. 

Also, through reading about the owner on facebook, I learned she started owning this cafe two months ago. Before that, she opened a cafe this summer that went out of business after three months. That seems off.... 

I'm not sure how much of this is legitimate concern, and how much of it is me being afraid that I will be hurt again. Probably it's some of both.

I hate wall of texts so I'm going to break it down into bullet points.

* Boyfriend and I have known each other since March 2012.  He moved out to New York for the summer and we saw other people.  Have been officially dating since the end of October.

* Recently got cleared to start hiking again (broken ankle) and wanted to go on an extended trip so I went on a 3 day road trip (Friday afternoon-2:30a Monday) with my best friend from college, who happens to be a guy. My friend and I had been talking about going on a road trip for awhile but plans were not finalized until the Monday until before we left. I wanted to invite my boyfriend with but he is in law school, has multiple internships, as well as Arabic classes on Sunday, and I didn't want to pressure him into feeling obligated to go. 

* My friend and I at one point were unsure of our feelings for on another so we went on one date.  It was terribly awkward and we both decided we were better off friends.  This took place 3 years ago.  I had told my boyfriend this, but forgot to include the part that it happened so long ago.  

* While on our road trip we went to visit one of my female friends from high school and stayed at her house.  At no point did my friend and I share a bedroom and my high school friend joined us on all of our excursions.  Boyfriend knew we were staying my high school friend but wasn't aware of the sleeping situation as I can have a tendency to forget to include all the details.

* I texted the boyfriend during periods of cell service, saying things like ""I love you.""  Also called a few times, which were very strained.  Asked boyfriend if everything was ok and he stated he was stressed from school and work.

* On way back home I dropped my friend off at his apartment and then drove over to my boyfriends place to spend the rest of the night.  As we lay down to sleep the boyfriend says he felt very disrespected by my vacation.  He doesn't trust my friend and feels that if we weren't in a relationship that my friend would be trying to sleep with me, obviously finds me attractive, it's not normal for girlfriends to go on trips with guy friends, etc.  We talk, until 5a in the morning, with me filling in the information I forgot to initially include.  He says he feels better but is still wary of my friend, stating that it was disrespectful of my friend to propose a trip to me without running it by him.

So basically, is my behavior out of the norm?  While I do have female friends I have a tendency to be closer to my guy friends.  My guy friends climb, hike, camp, shoot, etc while my female friends like to gossip and watch girly television shows.  

Also, it seems double standard-y since the following weekend he had his female roommate drive him to an important doctors appointment and then spend the rest of the day meeting with her parents (a 14 hour trip overall, that he neglected to tell me about until a few days before hand).

tl;dr-traveling with opposite sex, communication failure, ugh.

PS- boyfriend has been linked post in case I have been overly biased.

**Edit:** Forgot to include that I had asked boyfriend if he was ok with the trip and boyfriend agreed to it and then later said he had reservations but didn't expound upon them.  Partially because I never probed and he didn't want to feel like an overbearing boyfriend.

**Edit2:** Boyfriend says it's not so much he didn't trust him but that he doesn't know him well enough and was operating on limited info and that limited info wasn't very good. Also, he didn't want to say anything while I was on the trip because he didn't want me to worry."

It occurred to me that I'm young and may not have the opportunity for this later on, plus, it could give me some interesting work experience.

Brazil has been somewhere I've always wanted to go. Rio de Janeiro would be my first choice of location, but after that, I'm not too concerned as long as it's a major city on the coast. 

I have a bachelor of arts in economics and I minored in finance. Ideally, I'd like to get a position at a venture capital firm, but anything remotely related to economics and/or finance would be great for me.

Did I mention that I don't speak a lick of Portuguese? I can understand a small amount when I read, but that's about it. I am willing to learn the language though.


Any suggestions?

**EDIT:** Thank you for the responses. 

Do Brazilians have a general perception of Americans? 

As mentioned, I studied econ/finance, but I didn't go to an amazing school. How are American universities perceived down there?

**EDIT 2:** Thanks again for the responses guys! You have all been very helpful. I will contact some people on LinkedIn at VC/PE firms down there and see if I have a chance in hell. Otherwise, I'm not opposed to teaching English as this is probably the best time in my life to make a move. 

Not sure if it makes a difference, but I'm 25 years old. No obligations. No kids. No girlfriend, but maybe that could change in Brazil :-) . My work experience is some nonprofit work (leadership role) and a long internship that I just finished up where I did M&amp;A advisory at a small PE firm.

**EDIT 3:** As far as cities go, how are Salvador, Recife, and Fortaleza?

**2 -** Same champions

**3 -** Maps/Mods Editor

--------


**1 -** Easiest thing to add. Or should I say, to edit ? Because you already have them in intern I believe...

Codes would be like : ""setlvl"" ""setgold"" ""wtf mod"".

 **Why :** Always sames reasons : champion testing, custom games with friends etc...

 **How :** Maybe a button to enable/disable them in custom game creation ?

-----

**2 -** Maybe not so easy to add, but in some spotlight they were 2 friendly Annie...

Everyone wants a 5 blitz v 5 blitz.

 **Why :** For fun only, since LoL has already the serious/esport side.

 **How :** "" Draft Mode/All Random/All Same Champion"" maybe, or ""Allow Same Champions"" button somewhere in game creation.

------

**3 -** Maybe the craziest idea, but the best if done correctly...
Just look at WC and SC. These two games made more games than themselves with only their editor.
Tower Defense, DotA (=&gt; LoL), and many more...

 **Why :** For mappers like me that loves to mods games...

 **How :** Add your intern editor or something simpler, or a complete new map editor designed for your fans &lt;3

I know that all these ideas have already been asked, but RIOT... PLS.

17vfpa,3,2013-02-04,"A really long, rambling writing about my current relationship. Just need to get everything out.",ConflictedDragon,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/17vfpa/a_really_long_rambling_writing_about_my_current/,"I honestly don’t really know what I am hoping to gain from writing this. I know that I am doing it at the request of my significant other, and that this is mostly done to appease him. I suppose aside from that, I am mainly doing this as a way to let everything inside my head out. Giving voice to the feelings that I always have to keep a tight rein on might help lessen their influence. 

It’s hard to even think of where to begin. Four years seems like such a short time, looking back at everything, but at the same time, trying to summarize all of the important events that have led to where I am now, especially in reference to a relationship, makes four years seem impossibly long.

Our relationship was really never supposed to happen. We met at a party, and I had every intention of it to be a one-night stand. I had recently moved and started attending college. The relationship I had been in crumbled when my boyfriend said I wasn’t worth moving for. It was too risky for him to quit his job to move with me, and he didn’t want to do a long distance relationship. At the time my 20-year-old self was crushed. I felt so unwanted. I spent the first two months after my move alone, trying to cope with the depression I was feeling. 

It was only after classes started that I began socializing with a few people that I seemed to click pretty well with. One night I was invited to a party, which I agreed to go to completely at random. I had no intentions of finding another boyfriend, I wasn’t even looking for anything sexual. When I started getting hit on by my current partner my first instinct was to leave. Part of me wanted the attention, though. It felt nice to know that I was still wanted and viewed as attractive. That part of me wanted to feel sexy. It was very out of character for me since I am mostly reserved and withdrawn from people, but he ended up coming home with me, and we had an awesome night. That part of me that wanted the attention also wanted to prove that I didn’t need a relationship to survive. I could have sex, and have it just be sex. 

I’m not really sure if all of that back story really matters in the grand scheme of things, but for me it does. My first relationship lasted for 5 years. I was very close to my first boyfriend, and truly viewed him as one of my best and closest friends. We actually still talk to each other, and I have been invited to attend his wedding. In comparison, the interaction that I was having with my current significant other was hallow and empty. There were not emotions invested in what we were doing.

I do not have that closeness with my current partner that I had with my first, and I feel part of that a large part of that has to do with how we met. We never had a foundation of friendship. After the first night it was supposed to be over, and I think it would have been except that he moved in with one of my classmates who lived in the same apartment complex as me, so I saw him fairly often. He would stay over more and more often until he pretty much stopped going ‘home’, and stayed with me as a way to not pay rent to my classmate. It was more out of convenience for him. I never asked for rent money, or help with paying for groceries since he didn’t have a job at the time.  I never nagged about job hunting. I never asked for help taking care of the apartment, or chores, or anything. He pretty much stayed at my apartment all day playing computer games. Looking back on it I feel I put up with that more because of my insecurities. I felt that if I said or did anything that would make him unhappy that I would become unwanted again, and I didn’t want to feel that way. 

There was never love or real affection involved in any of it in the beginning, and while I was ok with that for a while, eventually I started becoming depressed again. I missed cuddling after sex, or having someone who wanted me to cum. Sex was not about pleasure anymore with him. It was about him getting off and that was it.  I missed having someone that I felt I could talk to. Any time he asked for my opinion on something, and if my view differed from his he would run it over with his own view on things and tell me how what I felt or thought was wrong. It made me feel unvalued since I am of the mind set that a different opinion isn’t wrong, it’s just different. 

While for the most part we lined up sexually, I am a submissive as well as a masochist, and there are certain things that I enjoy sexually that most people would find extreme. My current partner, at the time, thought that my sexual wants were signs that I was mentally unstable, and that I needed medication.  I tried to explain my point of view, but he was never interested in exploring a BDSM style relationship, and so I felt a very important part of my personality was withering and dying. 

I had been comfortable with myself, my submission, and my sexual need for pain in my previous relationships. This was the first time that I was being told that I was bad, or ‘fucked up’ because of it. So along with feeling starved of affection, I was also being denied something that I felt I needed. I tried going without the pain and submission because I wanted him to be happy, and because I did not want to be alone, but eventually I could not keep going with it and I kicked him out of my apartment. It was hard for me. It was the first time I had broken up with someone, and I felt like a terrible person. I didn’t do it because I didn’t care for him. I did, but I was unhappy, and he was stagnating in life because I was allowing it. Breaking up would force him to do something for himself, and allow me the space I needed to heal. 

Things went well for about a month. I got over feeling lonely pretty fast, and I started feeling better about myself. A huge part of that had to do with going home for the holiday break. Being around family and old friends really helped me.

When I came back I realized I still had a few pieces of his clothing still mixed in with my stuff. Long drawn out story shortened… We ended up back together.  Not living together, but trying for an actual relationship this time. All of that was pretty much the first year of our relationship.

Our communication got slightly better and I confided in my fears about being incompatible with him. My need for submission and pain had not gone away. They were still part of me, and they were not something that I felt bad about because they were things that he did not approve of. 

When we reached what would have been our one year mark he wanted to do something special to celebrate, which sort of surprised me. With my first boyfriend we celebrated every month we were together. Part of that might have been the silliness of being in high school, but we always remembered to at least say happy anniversary to each other. My current partner never made a big deal about it, so when one year came around I didn’t feel that we had reached anything special. It was never a big deal before, why should it be now? For him, it marked the longest he had ever been with someone. For me, we still had several years to go before it became a recorded. That situation left sore feelings on both sides. 

In all honesty after that things sort of merge together as far as the time line goes. There are a handful of events that resonate very deeply with me, though.

Once we started dating he tried putting in more effort to be accepting of my submissive tendencies as well as my sexual preferences. There were a few times that we went to a BDSM establishment together as a way to ‘play’. However, all of these times ended in emotional disaster for me. One time, after we got home, he told me that part of why he did not enjoy going out to play publicly was because he was embarrassed to be associated with me while I did not have clothing on.  This was shortly after I had started regularly going to the gym.  I was starting to feel extremely good about myself and the progress I was seeing in my body. After that conversation I became extremely depressed, and it was the first time that I was legitimately suicidal. 

There was another time where I asked him what my submission meant to him, to which he replied, ‘It means nothing to me.’

During this time, my lease was getting ready to end. I would spend hours fighting with him about how I did not want to move into his apartment. We had already tried living together, where I was the only one to clean, cook, and maintain the apartment while still maintaining my grades in my classes. And while this time he did have a job, I did not want to go back to that type of situation. I also would not have had my own room, which is something that I desperately need. I am extremely introverted, and having my own room or a ‘safe space’ that I can go to as a way to get away from people is something that I can not go without for very long.

He ended up saying during one of our fights that he posted on 4chan about our situation, and that they replied with how I obviously didn’t care about him since I wanted to pay to stay away from him. I was furious. I cared deeply for him, and still do, and to be told that he was getting ‘advice’ from people that he constantly told me were trolls, and ‘the scum of the internet’ made me absolutely rage inside. 

I ended up moving in with mutual friends. I cannot recall anything else major happening during that time. I gave up on trying to have my BDSM needs fulfilled again. It didn’t seem worth it any more. I knew that it would only lead to me being disappointed or hurt and that it was better to just leave it alone. 

I ended up graduating, but my lease ended before them. As a result I moved into his apartment and took over the room that his old roommate and left. I was very hesitant to do this, but I had lived with him before, so I knew what I was getting into. I started an internship with one of my instructors, which kept me in the area, and since things were still rocky / bad between us I looked for a way out of the apartment, and found one. 

We broke up again, and he moved out of state to live with his family for a while. There is a bit more to it then than, but nothing that I feel pertains to the over all relationship. 

For a while we didn’t talk at all, but eventually we started messaging back and forth online. He moved back to the area, and since we both needed a roommate we moved in together under the strict, mutually agreed to terms that it would be a two-bedroom apartment, that we wouldn’t date each other, and that we wouldn’t date other people while we were roommates; the former because our relationship had not worked before, and the latter to avoid any awkwardness while we were living together. We knew we would end up having sex, since we had always been extremely sexual with each other, but we both felt that we could handle things.

We have been living together for about six months now. 

Now he says that he wants to have a relationship with me, but all I can think about when we talk are the emotional scars that I have now. I do not feel that I am attractive to him because he has stated that I’m not. He does not want to be in the type of relationship that I want to be in, so any relationship we have I feel will be unfulfilling for me. I still do not have the sense of closeness or safeness that I desire with a significant other. For me there are all of these signs that it would be a terrible, horrible thing to try, again. 

We are still having sex, and while that has been good I do not think it is enough. He has been making an effort to be more affectionate to me recently, since admitting to wanting a relationship again, but I feel I am too jaded for it to work. I feel that there is too much history between us for us to ever be able to function properly. 

There is so much more to it than that. And ultimately it comes down to me feeling too hurt and broken to try. There has been so much emotional pain and hurt over the past four years. Pain and hurt that I feel I did not deserved. I never felt listened to, or that my opinions were respected by him in the past, so now that he is trying to make an effort it is hard for me to change my own habits. I have been conditioned to expect my views to be used against me, so I have learned to not share them. 

We communicate in such different ways that even if we did have a relationship I think it would end up failing again. He is of the mindset that yelling and fighting are normal for relationships, where I do not function well in environments like that. 

But at the same time I still have these irrational emotions for him, and part of me does want to try for a relationship again. A part of me wants it to work and to be sunshine and rainbows. I want to believe that I can have the sort of happiness that I had in my first relationship again, but it has been so long that another side of me thinks that I just made those feelings up. That they only ever existed in dreams that were never real. 

I don’t know what to do at the moment. I am not really looking for advice, or help. There are too many things left out of this post to give anyone a clear take on the situation, and even if I had been able to cram four years into a single writing, it is only one side of the story, and as much as I tried to remain detached while writing, it is still a biased take on the situation. I’m sure his side would be much different than mine.  And I don’t mean to make it seem like everything is terrible. We do have really good times, too. When things are good, they are awesome. I wish the good times happened more often, or at least out weighed the bad times, so it felt worth the struggle to achieve them. 

I want it to feel like it is ok to be myself, and to feel accepted and valued for being who I am. I do not feel that I am a terrible person. I feel that I’m actually pretty awesome. I love doing things and helping people out, and making them happy; especially my significant others. I feel I do a lot to make life easier for those around me, and I get satisfaction out of doing it. That satisfaction dies when I feel like my efforts are fruitless and trivial though. And that’s how I feel right now. Cleaning the apartment doesn’t mean anything to him. Packing his lunches doesn’t show that I care. Doing outstanding work at my job doesn’t make me an attractive mate. Even dressing in nicer cloths than my normal baggy, black t-shirts and shorts doesn’t earn me compliments or praise. It just seems like no matter what I do, nothing matters, and it’s hard to want to try when it feels pointless. It’s hard to want to be pretty or attractive on the outside when on the inside I feel like I am slowly dying.

As I said in the beginning, I don’t think I’m really hoping to gain anything by writing this aside from voicing my thoughts. Writing everything out has help to untangle a few knots in all of the confusing emotional threads. I still don’t know where to go from here, but reflecting back on things has helped. 

For anyone that actually read this all the way through; thank you.  Feeling like I have shared these thoughts has made me feel a little more solid and balanced. Huzzah for the Internet.  I also apologize for the typos, if I had gone back to fix them I think I would have lost my nerve to post this.

17vegf,3,2013-02-04,2 Questions: Procrastinating on accepting a job offer? And possibilities of returning to companies after summer internships? ,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/17vegf/2_questions_procrastinating_on_accepting_a_job/,"I recently received an email saying that I got a job offer for the summer from job A (they recruit early because there's security clearances you need to go through, so the lag time isn't really lag time, it's necessary). It's a GREAT company doing COOL stuff but not my absolute ideal company. However, the ONLY thing I really don't like about it is the location. It's pretty bad.  

Since it's still early, I've filled out dozens of other applications for internships at my ideal location (California) and likely won't hear back from those for a while. I also have 1 other interview lined up (job B) in the coming week for an ALSO GREAT company that's more directly in my line of work AND it's in a better location!  

So here are my two questions:  
1) How long do I have to respond yay/nay to the job A offer? Should I immediately reply to the email I got this morning with some sort of statement? What should that statement even say?  
2) I'm a junior studying engineering in college; what's the likelihood that the internship I take this summer could lead to a full time position post-graduation? I'd LOVE to work full time for job B in the future; it's really the line of work I'm interested in. Job A is pretty great also but I would HATE to be stuck in that location. I'd really rather move to California asap.

First of all, sorry if I seem naive. Just a quick note; **I live in the UK.**


**Some background first:**


I'm a programmer with a strong background in mathematics. At my current job, I do slot machines maths modelling and verification, so I do a lot of statistics but it's all basic level, it requires thinking a lot but it doesn't require a great deal of mathematical background. Verification is based on coding simulations in C# and checking that my statistics are correct (I guess that's called Monte Carlo simulation)


I want to get into banking, I will be straight honest, it's for the money and the position and because I'm in London so it's the best place (one of) for this kind of jobs. However, I do actually enjoy mathematics and programming mathematical applications, I have always had A* in my mathematics courses, but I studied Computer Science so I didn't do ""Advanced"" level mathematics.


**My situation now:**


I have a **first class degree Computer Science bachelor** from a recognised university but it's not a top-ten one.
I'm going to do Master's soon hopefully, and I thought I will do a course related to the field I want to get into.
Now here is the thing, I don't necessarily want to be a quant, I basically just want to have a job in the financial industry that requires a lot mathematics-oriented programming.


**My options:**


So I have three different courses:


Oxford - MSc Computational and mathematical finance


Imperial London - MSc Mathematical finance


Imperial London - MSc Statistics

One of the tutors at Imperial advised me to do Statistics instead of Mathematical finance because, according to him, it's getting more difficult now to get a quant job and Statistics is broader so I have more options regarding my job perspectives.


**My queries:**


1 - **Which jobs satisfy my needs (mathematical-oriented programming in a financial industry) other than quantitative finance?**


2 - Do you agree with the tutor at Imperial that I should do Statistics instead of Mathematical Finance, the main thing that attracts me to the Maths Finance MSc is that it includes a three months internship (if I can) which is EXTREMELY important in my opinion, but I still want to hear what you think.


Thanks, I tried to break it down to make it easy to read. Cheers, any advice would be appreicated."

I could use a little guidance on my visa situation.  I'm starting an internship in London in a week and because the salary is so low (400 pounds/month) they told me I could stay and work on my six-month tourist visa.  I'm a recent college grad (finished in June, studied Computer Science and Business) with a Bachelor's degree.  The internship would, if all goes as planned, lead to a full-time position with the company.

My main question is this:  Can I do the internship on my tourist visa?  I would hate to come this far just to be burned because I was careless about immigration.  If not, do I have any alternatives?

Thanks in advance for your help!

I think it should be evident that I've managed to turn things around.

I took on the 90 day challenge this past summer and for some reason I reacted very oddly to it. I was doing an internship that required me to interact with people, mostly on a one on one basis. I often had trouble communicating in the past because I was shy, so I decided to boost my self confidence by taking on the challenge. For the entire summer, and the duration of my internship, I did not look at porn or engage in fapping.

But here's what went wrong. I didn't notice a big difference with my social skills. In actuality, I developed a small stutter or speech impediment that hasn't gone away. Although I had more energy and focus during the time period, I also felt more tense and less relaxed during the day. I was still nervous around large groups of people. That never really went away. At the end of the internship, my supervisor told me I did everything well, except that I was too quite and needed to have more confidence. 

So although not fapping gave me more energy throughout the day, it also made me uncomfortable and nervous. It helped with depression, but that may be because I was going out more instead of staying home all the time. 
Since then, I've gone back to my old ways. I'm a little bit more depressed, less energetic, but at least I feel more comfortable around others. What do you guys make of that? Has anyone else encountered a situation like mine?

[x-post from r/personalfinance],remind_me_to_study,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/17uaai/considering_quitting_jobs_and_taking_out_loans_to/,"I'll be 23 this month, and I'm considering quitting my job of 2 years to complete my postbacc study with the best possible grades. Here's what I'm looking at:

**Monthly income:** ~$1,300 after taxes on average at current job. Can vary depending on whether I can pick up other people's shifts. Physically demanding, outdoors, $10.50/hour. Student job. May have reached its limits in terms of ""good for the resume,"" as I am a senior staff member and have extra responsibilities.

**Current student debt:** ~$27,000 (interest included), currently deferred due to my status as a student. Previous degree not applicable to med school prerequisites.

**Current program:** Pre-medical program at state university. Fulfills prerequisites for medical schools in the U.S. I have about 30 credits (quarter system) left to go. The program I'm in would have me paying roughly $2,000 per term for the next five terms (Spring, summer, fall, winter, spring), assuming I keep going part-time a the local community college for my lower-division requirements.

**Current savings:** Basically none, after a family emergency (good thing I had the emergency fund, but now I'm back at square one). Decent credit rating (725-750), no scholarships.

**Current living expenses:** I rent an apartment with a roommate for $580/month (utilities included); the lease runs through August. I pay $30/month for internet, and do not own a car. I live in a city with fantastic public transit, and I budget out $90/month on transportation. I'm currently receiving government food benefits, which I will retain through June before reapplying.

&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;

So, here are my current ideas:

1. Reduce hours at job to ~20hrs/week, take out ~$1,500 in loans each term, and apply for medical school June of 2014, for admission into the class of 2019.

2. Quit current outdoor job and take internship at newspaper (~18 hrs/week, $9/hr), take out ~$1,850 in loans each term, same idea as before.

3. Reduce hours at job to ~20hrs/week, take out ~$1,000 in loans each term, go to school part time and for an extra two terms, and apply for medical school June of 2014, with the caveat that any acceptances I received would be provisional and I would not be able to work and save money before starting school.

Does anyone have any input or personal experiences? If I get accepted into medical school, I'll end up taking out ~$200-250K in loans anyway (and even though I'm hoping to get into a program that lets you work 4 years in underserved areas in exchange for loan forgiveness, that's a lot of money). If I keep working as much as I do, I know my grades will suffer. And I can't get help from my family; the aforementioned family emergency saw to that.

Thanks, people! I really could use the input."

First of all I live in Canada. I just don't know what level of poverty justifies using a food bank because I don't want to take food from people who need it more than me. I was wondering if anyone else has had this experience and maybe if I explain my situation a little, some fellow Canadian out there will have a suggestion on what to do.

I just got a job but when I did the math I still have less than $40 a month for food. I am a 24 year old female. I just got a degree but I have no experience to get a job in my field and I can't afford an unpaid internship. As far as family resources, my dad was the primary breadwinner but died in an accident several years ago. My mom is injured and waiting a few months for surgery so she can't work let alone walk or drive. She has enough to support herself but I was forced to borrow money from her for the past few months while I was unemployed. She's going back into debt and I can't burden her anymore. I have a credit card that's over it's limit and I fear getting another will not help. I am still trying to get a second job but no luck yet. I have friends who would help me if they knew how poor I am right now, but they're all fresh graduates too and I don't want to burden anyone. I have to admit that I'm kind of ashamed of them finding out how much financial trouble I'm in right now. I used to use my university's food bank but I graduated several months ago. I have no idea how food banks work in the real world.

Honestly I just feel kind of ashamed to have to resort to this but I can't figure out other options. I'm a white female with a degree who comes from a family of educated middle class people. I feel like with everything life has given me already I should be able to support myself but I just can't get ahead...I'm not sure what I'm trying to accomplish with this post. I think I'm just coming to terms with the idea that I'm actually living in poverty. Anyway, if anyone else has gone through a time like this I think it would just be nice to hear how you got through it, if you used a food bank and what it was like. I'm sorry for the wall of text.

**TL;DR:** I'm a really poor Canadian and I'm considering going to a food bank. Just wondering if anyone else has done this and what it was like. 

**EDIT:** Wow! This was a much bigger response than I thought I was going to get. Thank you everyone for being so reassuring! I think hearing ""GO!"" from people who donate to food banks is making me feel a lot better about it. Thank you everyone for your encouragement and stories! I haven't read them all yet (I will) but you've already convinced me. I'll be calling my local number as soon as I post this. Seriously, you guys have me tearing up over here. Thank you!"

The chef here is a painfully pretentious CIA grad who worked at Blackbird's in New York and thinks he's God's gift to the kitchen. Sure, it happens, I'm used to it.

I'm singled out for every possible mistake I could make, even yelled at for ""texting"" (I was just checking the time) which everyone does anyway.

The worst kicker, though? At the tail end of a 14 hour day (I intern in the mornings as well), everyone is leaving, and he stops and tells me that tonight I'll be deep cleaning/scrubbing the entire line (which hasn't seen a deep clean in *decades*) So here I am, dead, haven't had a day off in a month, won't have a day off in 3 more months, at the end of the longest day, scrubbing every inch of a decrepit line by myself.

I've probably also got around 15 D's, F's, W's (more D's and F's), no real relationships with any professors (although I am working on this as well) and I am approaching the end of my education with no prospects for jobs, internships, or any real rewarding life experience ahead of me.


I feel shitty and crappy and wondering why I'm still around. It seems almost selfish this insistence that suicide is bad when people like me could use it to weed ourselves out. I feel like a parasite to my parents even though most of my rage and self-esteem issues come from the years of physical abuse (my dad would use me as a punching bag when my mom wasn't around, slamming me against the elevator walls and I'd have bruises and contusions all around my shoulders and back), the emotional abuse (of being told by my dad that I was a ""good for nothing drug using slut that parties all night ""with my other ""whore friends"" when I was a band track honor student, my mom telling me that I was fat, a slob, my dad telling me that I was ""aggressive"" and no guy would ever want me because I wanted to play the violin when he wanted me to play the trumpet), the sexual abuse (being groped by my dad and told that he ""owned 50%"" of my body and he could do what he wanted with it, having my face slammed into the tile of the kitchen floor and knowing there was no way out). Being told that I'm responsible for the marriage break down and that I contribute to their lives being worse.


But no employer wants to hear any of that. No one (besides my partner) wants to deal with the baggage. They don't want to hear that by the time I got to college I was so angry, tired, pissed off that I had to re-learn what it meant to interact with normal people. That you could constructively criticize an idea without laying in to the person and being called an ""incestuous freak"" they way my dad would call me, because he and my my mom were separated but they had to share the 1 bedroom apartment so that he got the bedroom whereas my mom and I had to share a bed in the tiny living room because he refused to let us get a small cot and out it where he kept his huge drafting board from college that he never used and didn't want to sell because he wanted $25,000 (because that's how much he paid for it 30 years ago) when the going price on craigslist was for $6000.
No one really cares that most of college was spent picking up the pieces especially when I began getting the symptoms for interstitial cystitis and that I had to skip classes because I was in so much agony that I couldn't get out of bed but of course there was no way to prove I was in pain and OSD said ""good luck!"" and professors said ""Too bad"". That eventually I stood up for myself (with the help of my partner) and told them that I was not going to be their Doctor child and that I refused to apply to med school because it was not what I wanted to do.


Because to an employer or a grad program or even the peace corp, I have no relevant experience, no skills, not even grades...nothing to show. I have nothing to contribute. Even though I am back at school and studying as hard as I can, doing great at managing my flare ups, attempting to gain fluency in another language, going to therapy to deal with my mental health, and further trying to improve my interpersonal communication by assisting with the administration of a local book club.....it all seems to mean nothing. And it hurts. I just want it to stop hurting and I want to feel like I can be someone better than this, a happy, confident, sexy example that things can always get better."

The plan is thus to buy a cheap second hand car in Portland and sell it at the end of the road trip. I am sure many of you have done similar things !

As it is going to be my first time to the US, I have no idea how is the whole process of buying a car is, especially regarding paperwork.

* What kind of documents are needed ? What does the seller have to give me ?
* Where do you recommend I buy the car ? Craigslist ?
* What about the license plates ?
* Would it be easy to sell the car (at a low price) in a couple of days at the end of the trip ?

Please tell me anything useful you know on the subject ! How would you go about buying a car in Oregon ? What would you need to do ?

Here is my situation. It is not bad, by any means…in fact my problem is probably a good one to have, but I am having trouble optimizing my options here so that the ultimate outcome is avoidance of getting screwed big time.

I currently work in an HR department for a public company. I have a decent paying job for my region and live comfortably. I am a direct hire without benefits, vacation and so forth. I started here as an intern, asked to be promoted in pay and then rode that out for awhile. A meeting took place where our budget was short by 80 million. I knew my position was going away. I move to korea to teach English. I came back and looked for work. Couldn’t find any. My old boss, who I got along with swimmingly, said there was an opportunity opening up and I should apply. I applied, didn’t get it. She said she would take me as a direct hire to do some project work, I accepted and functionally had my old job back.

Its been a year and change since that happened, I have a total of 3-4 yrs at the position and a M.S. in my field.. Back in the day, I was promised big things that I would be the next this and that and do the next great thing at the company. Times have changed. Everyone recently got a bump up from a manager retirement and I got left holding my dick. I couldn’t compete for the positions because I wasn’t an “actual employee competing for an internal position.”

They opened an external position at my level. I applied. They decided to cancel it and go for a position 2 grades above my head. I will not qualify for it and they will not select me. I have been told straight up of this fact.

Twist, all of my time that you all would rightfully suggest I pour into finding a new job, I am pouring into starting my own business with my brother. I work 8 hours a day and then another 5 or so doing stuff there. I would love to quit someday and do this full time. But, we have only been open 8 months and aren’t expected to start making a doable living for another year or so. If I scale back my efforts there, he will surely get overwhelmed and our investment and dreams are shot.

Unfortunately, the business is not in my field – im just the business/administrative arm. If it fails, he can fall back on his skill set – I will be left with a gaping hole of inconsistency approaching 30 and unable to find a job in my field.

Notes:

· I don’t feel sorry for myself, I know full well I got myself into this with eye-sized ambition larger than my modestly talented stomach. Hopefully the hivemind can help bolster my problem solving skills · I know im young and not all is lost. I am just trying to avoid starting alllll the way the fuck over. · I know I COULD just drop it all and join the biz full time, but my income currently supplements shortcomings in our revenues…not really an option. We’re in build mode, sustain mode isn’t for 6 months minimum. · I realize all these caveats and excuses are just lame attempts to avoid getting burned in the comments. Fuck it, im getting burnt out and additionally butt hurt that my job keeps me around but has no intention of letting me pursue new opportunities.

TL;DR I am getting shouldered out of my current job, have no time to look for another and have all my savings and income invested into a business I can’t walk away from.

This was completed via bacon reader. I blame all errors on that."

17y92f,51,2013-02-05,Job search story from someone not in the upper-crust,StateSchoolScum,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/17y92f/job_search_story_from_someone_not_in_the/,"You will first need to know my story to understand where I am coming from:

I come from a poor background. In my home town, no one goes to college. Many don't even finish high school because such things have no credence; anyone can get a job in town (as a construction guy, contractor, or gas station attendant) without a high school diploma. I left high school at 16 to work concrete. College just doesn't entire into these people's minds as a possibility. The culture is very anti-intellectual as well. 

I've always liked math and science a lot. I was always described by teachers as a ""gifted"" student in these areas, and I always try to deeply analyze how things work. Eventually I got a PC. Rather than simply say ""that there be one of them magic boxes"" and stab at the power button with my chicken grease covered digits, I tried to figure out how this incredible machine worked. 

I had no idea how a computer worked, but I started to form certain concepts in my mind about how I thought it worked after a while. I knew it wasn't ""magic""; it was a machine. Electricity flowed through it. I had so many ideas (and later on I learned the academic definition for what I was thinking of: finite state machine) and I started going to libraries, old high schools, etc. to find books on electricity, circuits, and anything else remotely related to computers. I learned a lot about capacitors, transistors, cathodes, etc. but never really figured out the operating system part.

Eventually, dial-up internet was brought to my neck of the woods, and man, was I ever fascinated by that. Every spare moment I'd be trying to learn something new on there. I figured out that I was an intelligent person and felt my mind was being wasted stripping roofs and digging holes in the ground. I started to come across the term ""computer programmer"", but I had no idea what that meant, but I very badly wanted to find out. The colors on the screen, the mouse movements, the start-up/shut-down functions, I knew it was all simply the very rapid interaction of hardware, electricity, and something else...which turned out to be code. I read books on C, but was never able to program in it because I had Windows and could not download Linux or BSD on dial-up.

I ended up getting my GED in 2005. I was 22 years old. I applied to the local state college and to my astonishment I was accepted. This is not a very good school at all, and I knew that, but it was better than nothing (at least that's what I thought). I had a big problem though: school costs mucho pesos, which I did not have.

Going to college meant moving into the ""city"" part of the county, so I applied to every job in town. One of these jobs was in a big warehouse so I applied to be a forklift selector. At the HR office, I did something that seemed to shock the HR people: I divided one number by another in my head (they lost the calculator so I just spit the answer out to help them). They asked how I did that, and I explained that division is easy for those numbers and you can just follow a step-by-step process (which I learned later was an ""algorithm"") for arriving at the answer or best approximation. 

The nice ladies of HR recommended me for this other job, in the warehouse offices. It was part data entry, part input-output (print and such), and some other stuff. The computer were all green-screen IBM terminals and the computer system was a mainframe. I'd never heard of one. I just knew I liked Windows better. This job paid like $10 an hour though so I was practically rich. 

I worked overnights and went to school during the day. I was even doing over-time and pulling 60+ hours per week. My life revolved around a series of naps, but I sure was learning a lot. I breezed through the first semester, mostly because I was just having such a blast in my intro to programming and math classes. They weren't hard, but I would read the entire book for a class in the first couple weeks, do all the practice problems, and do well.

I love the programming stuff the most. This was the answer I'd been looking for for a while. You take a language a person can read and create a basic set of instructions that the computer can compile, read, and execute. The logic just made so much sense. In the meantime, my job got moved to a new office because we got a new data center for the warehouse. Now we had Windows XP PCs to work from and everything. They also expanded the responsibilities of the job as the company updated it's technology. I became a helpdesk, network ops, Unix, and mainframe operator all rolled into one, still working full-time and going to school full-time.

As school went on, it got harder. Not unmanageable, but I was getting stressed doing both things full-time. I couldn't quit though, because without the job I couldn't pay for school, and they would throw me out and it would have all just been a waste. As I learned more about the company, I switched majors to Business. 

After three years, I got my Business degree. I took that straight to the HR department at my company. However, these were not the nice old ladies that had hired me. A new crop was put in place. These were young, pretty, and very mean girls. They came from schools like Cornell, and the company paid them top dollar to recruit from top schools in order to bolster the companies profits with top-tier graduates and their Ivy-League intellects. I was told that they don't hire low-tier scum like me and to get back to my till or leave. 

I felt awful. Before, I thought I'd made something out of myself. I really did, and everyone in my department pretty much was rooting for me to move on and become successful. I returned with my head hung low, realizing the caste system I was up against. I stuck around that job for another year or so but ultimately went back to my old habits of studying computer science and mathematics. I signed up at the college again to finish the degree I originally stated.

By that time, I was working second shift at my job and was effectively the lead/supervisor (although I was not being paid for this). I couldn't handle the upper-level classes and the job, so after a month of doing both I had to give my notice. The higher ups were infuriated that their lead was leaving and they had no one competent to replace me. I asked them how long it would take to train someone up to my level, to which they said they would need two years. I said I've given my required two-week notice (I actually gave them three) and I would happily work out my final time training someone else as best I could. They fired me on the spot. 

Unemployed, but now with a good chunk of change saved up, I put my full brain power to work on my final semester of CS. I learned all kinds of interesting stuff like linear algebra, number theory, self-balancing search trees, and cryptography. I started to like Java a lot and made that my main language. I learned everything I could about Java and the VM; whenever something presented itself that seemed like hocus pocus I just learned how it was working, like concurrent threading or how the VM does garbage collection, and what exactly happens to methods on the stack and objects on the memory heap at run time. 

Finally, I got the second degree (not too long ago), and here I am. That's my story. Here's my problem:

I feel like I'm in no better of a position to get a job other than gas pump monkey. Like I said before, this school isn't exactly MIT. Realistically, it's lower than whale shit on the the prestige scale for CS, and I'm still in that lower caste no matter how I rationalize it. I spent approx. $100,000 of my own hard-earned money earning those pieces of paper but I realize they are practically worthless. 

Every day, I get up and apply for jobs online. Sometimes I get a rejection notice, sometimes no reply. I've never gotten an interview. I know I'd make a great business systems analyst or software engineer. I worked along side so many of those Cornell graduates in my time at my company, and let me tell you, those people aren't smarter than me, and they don't do anything that I can't do. 

I see a lot of questions on here about the interview. I know I could impress people given the chance. I know CLRS by heart and have seen every video CS lecture Stanford, Berkeley, and MIT has every put on YouTube (I actually have them all saved on my laptop). It just seems like I can't get there from here. 

I typed out that long story because I feel like there are more people out there like me, just not on /r/cscareerquestions. So many people on this subreddit never had to work a day in their life, then got some internship and were offered high-paying jobs just like that. I'm at the point where I think I should just give up because it won't happen for me. I now live in a big city but I work for minimum wage because it's all I can get.  

Is there anything else I can do besides randomly apply to jobs on Dice? I already know the advice some of you are going to give, which is create some personal projects and/or create an app. Well, I don't want to make apps for a living, and there's no projects a person could possibly create that are going to impress people who work on multi-million dollar software projects with millions of SLOC. 

What do I do? Is this it for me? I went from nothing right back to nothing 7 years later. I feel like I could have taken that $100,000 I spent on school and bought a house instead."

Last Friday afternoon, I had an interview for a summer internship at company A.  I completely choked and didn't solve the question within the allowed time limit. We've all been there.  However, there are some reasons to believe that I may at least still have a shot:

* I successfully passed one technical interview prior to this one, so they know I have some ability.
* I ended up solving the problem about 5 minutes after we concluded the interview, and sent along the solution per the interviewer's request.

However, I haven't heard ANYTHING from the recruiter at all.  After the previous interview, I was notified of another round approximately 1 hour after the interview concluded.  My questions for you:

* Should I reach out and inquire as to what my status is?
* When should I do this?  Only one full business day has passed so far.

Also, I'm not sure if this is relevant but I am fluent in Spanish and fairly fluent in American Sign Language. Any input would be greatly appreciated!

She wants to carpool with me and another worker. 

Honestly, I don't want to carpool. I want the drive home to be a decompression time with NPR, where I don't spend the time hearing others rant or beam about their day. I also want to have a loose schedule, rather than having to leave when they leave. I guess another big part of it is that my parents agreed to pay for my gas, since the drive is a farther distance. 

Am I being selfish? I feel awful, but I just don't want to deal with people after a full day of doing just that."

17xscc,3,2013-02-05,Am I just this shitty or is this abnormal? (Wall of text-y),[deleted],KitchenConfidential,https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/17xscc/am_i_just_this_shitty_or_is_this_abnormal_wall_of/,"So, I recently got it into my head that I wanted to be a chef (I don't, as it turns out) and I went to try to get an internship at restaurants, and I ended walking into some rather fancy place. I asked the Head Chef if they needed interns there, and immediately got the answer of ""Come in Saturday for a tryout"".

I get there on Saturday, no idea how long I was going to be there (can't be that long, maybe stay through the Prep and part of the serving) and meet the dude that I'm supposed to follow so he can show me the ropes, nice guy.

It starts off rather normally, at least for someone who has never worked in a kitchen I'd imagine, I squirt some chocolate-thing into muffin-tins, fetch stuff and what-not.

Then the storm starts brewing. Another chef starts becoming annoyed that I don't know where stuff he asks me to fetch is. I should just know this is in Walk-In 1, this is in Walk-In 2, and that is in the Dry Storage. Of course.

Couple of hours later, he's still raging. Service hasn't started yet, but he's really, really annoyed I still don't know where this and that is, or that I don't do stuff quick enough. He starts berating me, and at one point he calls me retarded (not in a joking way, he said it to himself as I was walking away from him to fetch something ""Can't believe how fucking retarded you are"").

I should've just left there, because as service starts, he just keeps throwing his shit at me the whole time. He didn't even need to be close to me, I was with the chef at the Desert station and we were doing just fine for the most part. 

As service goes on, I plate a few deserts, the chef I was following around starts becoming irritated that I don't know what to put on each plate (I don't blame him, I don't think he was very experienced and stress can get to you). There were litterally five deserts on the most popular desert: 

1)Mixed fruits

2)A chocolate ball with mousse, rice crispies and ice cream inside, resting in a bed of mousse

3) Creme Brulee

4) A brownie

5) Chocolate pudding of some sort.

This was their ""taste-menu"", and it went out to probably every table. Me having to ask every once in a while what went on the plate next caused the Rager to get even more mad, and he was leaving shitty remarks every chance he got at this point.

So, 12 and a half hours in, when they're starting clean-up, I walk out. Peek into the Head Chef's office, tell him I'm gonna go now, and leave. He doesn't have my phone number (I got his, he only has mine if he digs through to the one stray call I made to him).

Am I just this slow, stupid and bad at fetching stuff and plating chocolate balls, that me being called retarded is a ""slight overreaction"", or am I in the ""right"" here, having never been in a kitchen before?

17xqxp,607,2013-02-05,Don't start rumors about me.,banana-stand45,pettyrevenge,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/17xqxp/dont_start_rumors_about_me/,"This is the story of possibly my greatest revenge on an enemy. During my sophomore year in college, I dated a guy who introduced me to probably the greatest apartment I have lived in to date. Great location, awesome parties, and lovable roommates. Four people lived in the apartment (boyfriend included) and two significant others would stay over frequently (myself included).

For most of the school year, everyone got along fabulously. Unfortunately, drama slowly built up between the other significant other and her partner. This significant other (let’s call her Tina) was overly dramatic, self-absorbed, and extremely two-faced. Around March, her partner figured out Tina was cheating on her and promptly dumped her ass. This became a problem because both had signed on to continue the lease for the next year. Tina kicks her ex-girlfriend off the lease for the following year and throws a hissy fit when we all aren’t moved out a week before our lease ended.

We begged her to let us keep a few pieces of furniture in the house before our next lease began, as we had nowhere to go, but she had no sympathy. She logged into another friend’s Facebook account to tell us off, so it looked like she did nothing wrong. Frustrated, we packed up our shit and got out.

By now, I was beyond frustrated with her, but I decided the best course of action would be to just ignore her and move on with my life.

My junior year rolls around, and I start my second year at an internship on campus in our LGBTA Office. There are about 7 or 8 interns every year working in the same space but with different assignments. Who walks in the first day? Tina. Fuck.

From day one, she started a crusade to ruin my life. Being passive aggressive, she would often leave notes blaming me for things or broadly stating how she hated drama and anyone who starts it needs to find a hobby. Everyone in the office fell in love with her after the first week, which completely got under my skin. What everyone didn’t see was her setting people up to fail so she could come in and save the day, her leading other girls on only to break their hearts intentionally, and her saying incredibly hurtful things to anyone who dared cross her path.

At first, I tried to tell everyone what she was doing and how she hurt people. This led to a meeting between the head of our department, Tina, and myself. I was scolded for spreading hurtful rumors as Tina cried crocodile tears. Later that day, she “accidentally” deleted a rather large Photoshop file I spent weeks on. She must have “accidentally” emptied the recycling bin too, my work was long gone.

I felt defeated. Since the LGBTA community was so tight knit, you couldn’t risk rejection. Otherwise you lose all your friends. By this point, a good portion of my friends weren’t returning calls or texts.

Eventually, she dated a close friend of mine then publicly dumped/humiliated her. My friend comes to me crying, telling me everything that happened. Apparently, Tina started spreading rumors about me throughout our community. She told them I lied because I was still bitter about losing the apartment to her. Finally, I figured out the perfect revenge. 

The Revenge:

The rumors were already out about me, so my credibility was shot. I did the only thing I could think of.

I was nice. Nice as FUCK.

Suddenly, I was friendly with her in the office. I laughed at her jokes, admired her work, and complimented her fashion. When we were out with friends (especially when Tina wasn’t there), I laughed about the good times we shared and how much fun she brings.

Tina had no idea what to do with my sudden kindness, so she started getting nastier in return. While I did not see it, current friends filled me in on what happened when I wasn’t there. Whenever I came up in conversation, Tina would start spewing hate about me and how I’m trying to get back at her. But when they talked to me, I would only sing her praises. During this time, she was also continuing to lead girls on and break their hearts.

Slowly but surely, I regained every one of my friends. After a year, every one of them apologized to me and told me everything she had them believing. The ENTIRE community turned on Tina afterwards. The administration asked her to leave her internship after discovering the mess she caused for me and other interns, all of her previous friends now unfriended her on Facebook, and she ended up leaving the community in a huff.

Best part? She could have prevented all of this if she didn’t try to spread rumors.

TL;DR: Bitchy ex-roommate spreads lies to make people hate me, I’m kind in return, everyone ends up hating her and she loses all of her friends."

But as his treatment drags on, the more I hate the world. I've become a misanthrope, and I hate it.

17xfgw,1,2013-02-05,so much...,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/17xfgw/so_much/,"Too lazy to make a throwaway... whatever.

I have slowly become very aware that I have been suffering from depression and anxiety for quite some time now. When I was a little younger, I thought it would be manageable on my own. A sharp decline in my grades in high school and a short-lasting improvement then plunge in my grades in college are now indicative to me that I have not been managing it very well on my own. I just started getting help for this last week and I can only hope it gets better from here.

Money has been an issue. Because of how long it is taking for me to finish college and how terrible my grades have been, I don't get any financial aid other than a BOG waiver. It was okay to manage last semester, but I didn't even start buying any of my books until the end of the first week this semester, and that was when I had to bite the bullet and ask my parents for help. I just quit my last job because my hours at my last job were getting low and I hated it. I got a new job last month under the pretense that I would be covering 20-25 hours/week, but my paycheck for the entirety of last month was $38. Didn't even cover the shoes I needed to buy for the job.  I worked three fucking hours this whole past week.When using my mom's card to buy my books, I neglected to buy a parking pass for the semester and didn't have any cash in my wallet today. $35 parking ticket...

On top of that I am trying to work this job to fund my way through my last eligible participating year of an activity I have put my heart and soul into. $3000 dues in addition to two flights for the year. I can manage the $3000 with a payment plan. I have another side job that will pay me $1000 total, but the money won't come until May. $3000 isn't pretty off of 3 hours a week either way. And after getting my paycheck for last month, I realized I can't make the trip I have been planning to see my boyfriend during my spring break happen. He lives across the country and I haven't seen him in person since August.

I am also overweight. I float around 137-139 lb right now at 5'0, my BMI is high and my fat percentage sits at 38%. My mother constantly reminds me that I am fat and sometimes the first thing I hear out of her mouth for the day is ""your stomach is bigger than mine"". Like many people, I was skinny... in high school. Have been putting on weight steadily ever since. I have recently developed related health problems to add to this. I want to lose it by eating clean and going to the gym but it's hard when your parents feed you rice all the time (and sometimes my mom brings home fast food, THANKS!). My mom has taken me to the gym with her to take dance and yoga classes... the yoga instructor once commented on how strong I was when my mom pointed out I was her daughter, but two seconds later when she was out of earshot she just said to me, ""you don't exercise."" But I took yoga twice a week all last semester and got stronger and more flexible. Another reminder that I'm fat. Whenever I have shown her how strong I have become as a result of my activities she makes a disgusted noise. It's clear that she doesn't want me to be fit, she just doesn't want me to be FAT anymore. My boyfriend is wonderful and tries to remind me that he thinks I am perfect and beautiful. I told him I want to lose weight for health and that is true, but the main reason I want to lose weight is because I feel fat and ugly and disgusting.

After failing almost all my classes last year I decided I really needed to change. I really want to graduate with my A.S. and finally transfer out of goddamn community college. I managed a 3.3 last semester, a major improvement. I'm a science major so this semester I am taking a couple tough courses and an online class. It's hard trying to manage these when your study habits previously lacked even the will to get out of bed. So I have been trying to completely rethink my approach to studying... meticulously writing every assignment in my planner, printing out the 44-page lecture slides to bring to class, actually reading the chapter like the teacher tells me to. I even started a regular sleeping schedule that didn't leave me falling asleep during lecture... but now that I am awake and typing this at 3am that may change.

I couldn't register for my online class's system to view the textbook and take the quizzes due to the previous problem of not having any money for school, so I wasn't in the system until yesterday (Monday). The instructor reminded me that I needed to take two quizzes yesterday before midnight or I would lose 10% of my grade immediately and would not be able to retake them. I was distracted by stupid things all day and did not remember until 12:30am. This made me extremely upset, I felt stupid and worthless and that though I had tried to change the way I organize and study but will forever be a terrible student. I really don't want to spend any more additional semesters or years here anymore. All my friends are graduating with their BA/BS this spring or will be within the next few semesters. I want my degree, I want an internship, I want to move on with my life and my career.

I really only regularly talk to my boyfriend. I can't really hang out with friends because they all usually want to hang out over dinner or coffee or drinks - I can't spend any money on those right now. Aside from the occasional dinner or chill time I do get to have with someone, I don't really have any close friends to hang out with anyway. My closest friend here at home has a lot of seemingly irreparable issues to deal with too, and as selfish as it may seem, I feel like in my current state I can't be around him for too long as it will affect me. My old roommate and I used to be close, but she made huge changes to her life and is not the same person. I'm happy that she is happy, and we can catch up, but we just don't relate anymore. I don't really know how to make new friends at school or work either, I guess. I'm awkward at school because I don't think anyone wants to talk to me anyway, and at almost every single job I've had everyone always assumes I'm some quiet, serious asian girl... no, I just find getting my tasks done more important than talking and fooling around, and I don't share immediate interests with you. I used to be good at making friends and networking, but I guess that skill has gone away now.

Though I have been dealing with my depression for a while I have not felt suicidal since I was 16... But today for the first time in five years I thought to myself that I wanted to die. I know I don't actually want to die. I just don't want to deal with these issues anymore. I feel like I have been really trying to put my life back together and finally be happy. But typical to life it doesn't feel like things have looked up in my favor. Why have I implemented so many changes, yet still feel so miserable?

I know I'm not exactly fun to deal with right now. These things are all I can think about. I talk to my boyfriend about these issues but with him so far away he can only do so much. I can see his heart break when I burst into tears on Skype, and these outbursts have been happening with higher frequency as of late. I don't want my problems to affect my wonderful boyfriend. I don't want my moods to affect my grades or my work anymore. I don't want my depression and lack of self-worth to show when I'm teaching students. I don't want my mental health issues to be passed on to my future children. I just want to be happy. Or not feel so miserable all the time at least.

Well, time to finally go to bed..."
17xe2v,2,2013-02-05,Basic Streaming Specs,Invisisniper,leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/17xe2v/basic_streaming_specs/,"So, I've been considering taking up streaming as an additional hobby to playing LoL; it seems like something that I would enjoy being able to talk to any viewers while I play the game, and I feel like forcing myself to analyse the game as I play could make me a better player.

The main barrier at the moment is that I simply don't have a setup that could handle even the most basic streams. I play on a 2 year old laptop with reasonable specs; it may be able to handle the stream, but it's been slowing down recently so I couldn't guarantee it. What's more of a problem is that although I run a steady 6 Mb/s download allowing me to view streams, my measly upload speed of 0.6 Mb/s could definitely not handle running my own. Also, whenever I upload anything decent sized, even small youtube videos, my ping spikes to about 1.5k.

Fortunately, I am coming to the end of a summer internship, which should earn me enough to replace my current setup. So I ask you, reddit, what kind of streaming setup options are there, and what kind of specs would I need (both PC and internet speed) to run such a stream? Also, an estimation of cost would be very helpful (note that I live in Sydney, and IT related stuff tends to cost notably more here than it does elsewhere in the world, so cost estimations from fellow Aussies would be more helpful). Any general streaming advice for a new streamer would also be greatly appreciated."
17xe20,3,2013-02-05,Recounts of last night and a reminder to myself that I think I have a problem. ,zerothrowaway1,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/17xe20/recounts_of_last_night_and_a_reminder_to_myself/,"I think this post is just to help myself actually recount why I need to stop drinking, or attempt to do more moderate drinking. 

I just could not sleep anymore, recounting yesterday's events just kept pouring into my mind. I just had to get up and try to make sense of things and now writing them down here. 

I am 23, in my senior year of college and the first time I had more than just a sip of alcohol was around 12/13 years old. The first month of the new year alone I have been blackout drunk about 5 times. I have always thought, ""well I am in college, I am just living up my life and having some fun right now until I need to grow-up"". A lot of my closest friends drink with me, while they are far more responsible and do not drink as much, they understand that my tolerance level is higher so they do not question my drinking habits as much. My mother has always been on my case about drinking, more recently my father as well, so I just try to not drink around them as much, or more controlled than usual. My sister and brother-in-law never really had a problem with my drinking, they went to a fairly big party school (OSU) and while they do not live that lifestyle anymore with having a child, they seemed to defend me with the same thing I though ""just living up my life right now"". 

My education while stressful for some (electrical engineering), I have just breezed most of my way and had a very laid back approach to it all. Last semester especially I would just drink and skip class most of the time, basically showing up for exams and such and doing a pretty good job of it. I figured, well I do not drink at or before work (an intern position I held at a prestigious company for over a year) and my schooling is still fine so alcohol can stay in the picture. On the weekends it was especially bad, I could go through a 5L mini keg a night while doing shots and still be ""fine"". While if I had to drive I would generally not touch any alcohol because I knew if I started, I would not stop... I feel this is my biggest issue and the reason I am writing this now. 

Recounting what I remember last night, I had class from 4-8pm but was at school earlier to work on my senior design project. Around 3pm, I send a text message to a good friend of mine for a drink with her and she agrees. The hours go by, I do not even remember how many I had, but I do remember she only had two (she can put back much more but is actually responsible). I do remember having one Narwhal (10%+), and roughly 5-6+? of Wild Black/Blue/Red (8%). This was from 3-~7pm, skipping both of my classes I was supposed to attend that day. We talked a lot, I really like this girl, both as a friend and somewhat of an emotional attachment more than that although she has a good boyfriend. I think this makes me drink more as well, thinking about how I am not with her, just being emotional, so I just drink more to not think about that and stay in a happy mood (another problem I think). I remember bringing up something to her after I have had quite a few and I think this was when she basically said it was time to leave the bar. I do not remember the exact words verbatim, but I basically questioned her fertility... I will not go into details but it was especially hurtful to her because I know how much she wants kids and here I am basically saying how she's getting closer to 30 and with all the unprotected sex she's had how come she has not gotten pregnant yet. I do not remember closing my tab but I have my card back so I must have. I do not remember the walk back to the lounge where I left my stuff. I vaguely remember her leaving me with some of my other friends basically saying for them to watch me and not let me drive yet. I vaguely remember leaving right after she left with my other friends trying to hold me back and reason with me to stay but it is hard for two guys at maybe 5' 5"" each 140/160lbs to hold me back at 6' 230 lbs fairly built. I do not remember the walk to my car, I do not remember most of the drive home. Here is where I scared myself this morning, I remember losing control of my car on the highway. I think I hit a patch of ice/snow on the far left hand lane doing roughly 80-90 (my usual speed so I am assuming I was going this). I crossed all 4 lanes of the highway and hit the other side wall with my car barely (I have not checked my car to confirm any damage). I immediately backup and continue driving and I am damn lucky no one was near me when it happened and no one got hurt. I get home and my parents question why I am home earlier than usual (roughly 7:40 at this time when I have class til 8). I do not remember the conversation after that, and I suspect they knew I was drunk. I immediately go to my room to sleep it off and wake up around 10 that night to eat some food before falling back to sleep. I wake up at 3, craving water, and then can't get back to sleep as I recount what happened yesterday. I finally get out of bed and think that I really need to change my habits, I need to do something, and being an avid redditor I assumed there would be a subreddit for this sort of thing. I look it up and took the AA quiz that was linked and answered yes to all 12 questions truthfully. I never thought of myself as truly and alcoholic, I just played it off, but now looking back at previous experiences... I wonder how I never stopped and did this before...

If you read this or not, it was more for myself but I thank you either way. I do not think I will stop drinking, I feel I need some way of telling myself to stop after 1-2. I look now at my desk where I have easily 100+ bottle caps of various beers littering my desk, and most were not there ~2 months ago. I look at the mini kegs laying around my drum set and recount how I would chug race myself because no one else was fast enough. I am a very competitive person so perhaps it trickles into my drinking habits. 

I want to change, I actually have plenty of people that care about me, they deserve to not see me kill myself on a highway from drunk driving, or even worse killing someone else. "

How much work do you do out of the office? 

Do you ever have to travel?

I go to University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth and have about 3.0 GPA (only a sophomore, much room for improvement). I'm planning on getting into some extra curricular activities through the business school and I plan on getting an internship junior-senior year summer. Also, obviously plan on getting a CPA. I have no plans (or don't think I really qualify, that I know of) to try to get a Big 4 job, what kind of salary could I make without being involved with Big 4 or attending a very well-known school? 

The reason I'm asking is because I feel like most of the threads are about big 4 or people who are doing well at a nice school. I just want to hear from the others who are closer to my circumstances since I'm sure I'm not the only one in my position.

Also, any advice that'll help me succeed in accounting would be nice.

Thank you!

EDIT: Also, should I be choosing any business related extra curricular activity or do you think I should join ones that relate more towards accounting?

Also trying to get a business related job this summer, was wondering if my experience from a business related job (non-accounting) would still look good as experience while applying for an accounting job in the future or if I should try to find a job that relates more to accounting?"

17wty7,19,2013-02-04,Relatively good life position but totally unsatisfied and just really confused about what to do,theresacatinmyroom,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/17wty7/relatively_good_life_position_but_totally/,"I graduated from college in May with a degree in sports business, interned with a professional sports team for almost a year, had a leadership position with the sports business club on campus, and was a student supervisor of the computer labs on campus. I was unable to get a job in professional sports right away and sort of panicked, so I ended up accidentally landing a job in the IT field. On the first day (orientation notwithstanding) I realized that I made a huge mistake and it's not what I want to do with my career. However, it's a job with health benefits, something way too many people I graduated with can't say (even just the job/career part).  

My plan was this: if I still felt it was the wrong choice in March, I would seriously ramp up my quest to get back into sports or at least marketing or PR. Why March? Because I would earn enough vacation time beforehand to go on a cruise with my family in February.  

Then hurricane Sandy came and changed all of that -- my family lost our house in the storm and we had to cancel our cruise. I lost my car in the process, and I used the insurance money to buy a used car so I could cut a monthly expense out of my life while also drastically lessening my insurance payments. I did this in preparation of taking a lower-paying job (or even a low-paying internship or something) and being able to, you know, live. I also had to move into an apartment because of the living situation and to lessen my commute (save gas/didn't have a car for two months after the hurricane).  

So here I am, almost 100 days removed from the hurricane and about 130 since I started at my job. I still don't like it after almost 4 and a half months. It's not what I want to do for a career. I don't have the charisma or personality to succeed as a salesperson in sports. I understand that if I want to get into sports, I'm going to have to either A. get more experience, whether it's an internship or what or B. become a salesperson. And I don't mean just get a sales job, I mean *become* a salesperson. And I don't think I can.  

I've started to look into the idea of Graduate Assistant position so I can get a monthly stipend and free tuition for a graduate program. I've started to apply for (and interview for) entry level marketing or public relations positions. I've applied for (and had a scheduled interview that got canceled for) sports sales positions.   

1. Grad school / graduate assistant - what happens when I do a 1- or 2-year program? How do I know I can find a full time job once that is over? What if I can't? 
2. Internship - how can I actually realistically afford this, especially when I don't have my parents' house to live at rent-free anymore? How do I know an internship is actually going to help me get hired?
3. Marketing/PR job - A lot of these are temps; what happens if they don't retain me after the 3- or 6-month temp period? What happens if I can't afford to do it?  

I don't know why I'm posting this or what advice I'm even looking for. I'm just really lost and really confused and it's a bad thing. I'm finding myself depressed, and my parents are really pushing me to just get used to my current job because it's a pretty good health benefits situation and there's a pension. But I can't see myself lasting here another year let alone the rest of my life.   

I feel like I was on the verge of great things back in April and May -- I had multiple leadership positions, a year's worth of internship experience, an awesome job interview out in California -- things were generally looking great. Now I'm in a job that I'm miserable at with no other leads, a lot of bills without enough money (paycheck to paycheck, barely surviving right now) and I have no direction or any idea how to get on the right path, or what the right path even is, or am I already on the right path and I just don't recognize it?  

I've started to go to sports networking events and career fairs throughout the area over the last month, just to try and get my bearings set, but even then, I'm doing it without aim. What am I doing? Where am I going?"

What is your personal motivation to apply for the HACU National Internship Program?

What are your academic and/or career goals?

What skills can you bring to an employer and what skills would you like to focus on throughout the internship?

My personal motivations to apply for this internship program include:

• Get professional experience in the fields that I am majoring in (accounting and finance). In this world’s competitive market having experience in my field of study with a very good company before I graduate would make me more appealing to potential employers and put me one step ahead of the competition, therefore increasing the changes that I get to choose which company to work for rather than being pressured on me by lack of opportunities.

• Test how I would cope with being away from my family. Being from a Mexican family where family is pretty much the most important thing, I want to try out for the first time what my mom calls “volar del nido” (to fly away from the nest), and be able to experience firsthand what it is like to live by myself with all the challenges that brings.

• I set a goal for myself to get an internship in 2013 with HACU so that I can get unique insights in my field of study and network with people from other parts of the world, so that I can expand my horizon and get to know how my country works a little better while doing so.

My career goal is to get my CPA and then work as an auditor or financial analyst in the FBI and be able to provide this agency the tools it needs to make its’ job easier and faster. I want to be able to catch people laundering money to contribute my grain of sand to this country which has given me so much. My academic goal is to graduate with a double major in accounting and finance with a concentration in financial analysis with a GPA &gt;3.00 and after that get my CPA certification.

I bring employers a different perspective into problems, which has been shaped by living in a house with a dual culture and being able to see the differences between one another. Other skill I bring to employers is good customer service, that I learned during the two years that I worked in the restaurant industry, where I also learned that being bilingual (like myself) is particularly important and useful specially living in a border town like I do.

During my internship I would like to focus on leadership skills, so that I can easily motivate other people as well as myself. I want to develop critical thinking, or as some people call it the “entrepreneur mind” which is the ability to see one step ahead than other people normally would and make decisions about it earlier and that way stay ahead of the competition. I want to learn how the software my company uses works so that I can troubleshoot problems and provide the clients my company has a superior customer service and support. I want to be able to acquire the skills needed to leave the company that I’m doing my internship with, better than when I first arrived there.

17wo0f,0,2013-02-04,[Request] I am doing an essay for an internship and I would like to have some feedback on it.,hispanica316,ineedafavor,https://www.reddit.com/r/ineedafavor/comments/17wo0f/request_i_am_doing_an_essay_for_an_internship_and/,"These are the questions I have to answer.

1. What is your personal motivation to apply for the HACU National Internship Program?

2. What are your academic and/or career goals?

3. What skills can you bring to an employer and what skills would you like to focus on throughout the internship? 

My personal motivations to apply for this internship program include: 

•	Get professional experience in the fields that I am majoring in (accounting and finance). In this world’s competitive market having experience in my field of study with a very good company before I graduate would make me more appealing to potential employers and put me one step ahead of the competition, therefore increasing the changes that I get to choose which company to work for rather than being pressured on me by lack of opportunities.

•	Test how I would cope with being away from my family. Being from a Mexican family where family is pretty much the most important thing, I want to try out for the first time what my mom calls “volar del nido” (to fly away from the nest), and be able to experience firsthand what it is like to live by myself with all the challenges that brings.

•	I set a goal for myself to get an internship in 2013 with HACU so that I can get unique insights in my field of study and network with people from other parts of the world, so that I can expand my horizon and get to know how my country works a little better while doing so.

My career goal is to get my CPA and then work as an auditor or financial analyst in the FBI and be able to provide this agency the tools it needs to make its’ job easier and faster. I want to be able to catch people laundering money to contribute my grain of sand to this country which has given me so much. My academic goal is to graduate with a double major in accounting and finance with a concentration in financial analysis with a GPA &gt;3.00 and after that get my CPA certification.

I bring employers a different perspective into problems, which has been shaped by living in a house with a dual culture and being able to see the differences between one another. Other skill I bring to employers is good customer service, that I learned during the two years that I worked in the restaurant industry, where I also learned that being bilingual (like myself) is particularly important and useful specially living in a border town like I do. 

During my internship I would like to focus on leadership skills, so that I can easily motivate other people as well as myself. I want to develop critical thinking, or as some people call it the “entrepreneur mind” which is the ability to see one step ahead than other people normally would and make decisions about it earlier and that way stay ahead of the competition. I want to learn how the software my company uses works so that I can troubleshoot problems and provide the clients my company has a superior customer service and support. I want to be able to acquire the skills needed to leave the company that I’m doing my internship with, better than when I first arrived there.

I have an on-site interview with company B next week, which is about a five hour drive from company A.  

Company A did seem to give off some signs about being wary of hiring an out of state candidate (they have a previous intern also competing for the position and also mentioned that there may not be relocation benefits offered).  I want to basically tell company A that I can drive out for the on-site interview, but I don't know if this is coming across as pushy.

I'm just curious, how's the CS program over here? Is it challenging? Have you learned a lot? Most importantly, how are the internship and job opportunities?

The biggest appeal of going to SFSU is knowing that SF is such a powerhouse of hot start-up companies. I figured that with all these tech companies, SFSU's CS department would try to provide students with a solid preparation for the workforce.

Unless I get accepted to some UC, I will most likely be transferring here.

I graduated with a Bachelors in Computer Engineering, and spent some time in Electrical Engineering graduate school.  I didn't finish, but it did help me learn an interesting amount of theory when it comes to integrated circuits.  My undergraduate involved a modicum of software and hardware...I did an internship where I became pretty good with the .NET framework and I used that and Ruby to do a lot of mathematical programming during my graduate work, where I did manage to get published.  My current job involves writing LabView on a machine I designed to test electronic components, and lately I feel like I've done everything- from circuit board design, to writing documentation and procedures and reports, interfacing with customers and sales representatives and external engineers and the government.  What I'm looking for is someone who understands what I'm good at:

* Learning fast,
* Working independently,
* Producing quality work with honesty and integrity,

as well as someone who understands what I need:

* Realistic management that produces realistic goals,
* Resources to help me develop the depth that I lack.

Some day, I'll be the best senior engineer you can imagine...for now, I need an environment that will help me develop the skills required to refine me to that point.

17wgim,2,2013-02-04,"My life is, in theory very good, but I'm terribly depressed (warning: wall of text)",[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/17wgim/my_life_is_in_theory_very_good_but_im_terribly/,"I guess I should give some background... I am a PhD student who theoretically has a great life

I've traveled to a lot of really cool cities on my university's dime. (Computer science publishes in conferences, not journals.) I did a prestigious internship that let me spend the summer in the SF bay area. I have investments and an emergency fund and a few cool toys like a DSLR and a tricked out Macbook.

But I feel this hollowness, this sadness a lot.

Mostly, it's circumstantial. My research is not going well, and that is not due to a lack of effort on my part. A close family member (not my mom) has stomach cancer, and will be dead within a couple months. And while I've lost weight, I'm stuck at ~190, mainly due to the fact that once every week or two I get stressed and binge drink/eat. I have constant anxiety brought on by an abusive alternative school I was placed in when I was younger.

I feel like everything is out of my control. For example, I am considering leaving my PhD program. My advisor is a flake, and  my collaborators are unreliable. (One student we brought in to write some code admitted he did not know how to code, and left the project. This will probably cause me to have to push back, if not cancel, a major publication). I'm realizing that  Ican't compete all on my own with research teams that have 5-6 people all working as hard as me, all as smart as me. I just can't do it alone.

So OK, I can leave with a master's I guess, right? Take an industry job.

Well, I have been basically friend-zoned from all the companies that would hire someone with my skill set...

(Apoligies to female readers - I don't buy into that crap but it's the best phrase I can think of)

You see, being a PhD I'm specialized, and there's only a handful of companies that hire people like me... and most of them would rather take someone from CMU or MIT, rather than a state school. So people I know who work at big companies, they tell me that I do cool things, but they also refuse to give me an internship or a job. (Hence the analogy - they think I'm a great candidate but they *just don't see me that way*m heh)

My plan had been this summer to intern at a private company, see if it was less stressful than my PhD. Possibly leave with a master's, move to SF.

Instead I'm working in a research lab. Industrial, so the pay is nice, but no matter how hard I work, they would never hire me without a PhD. Thus, my exit plan is shot.

Work isn't everything, you might say.

Well, friendwise, I don't know many people... I have a lot of acquantances, few friends. I might call someone I know here in town to see if they'll come hang out, but I am afraid to... if they say no it'll just make me go from sad to really depressed...

I don't really have many friends/romantic partners... while I'm good at networking, I can be a bit outspoken, agressive. It's a holdover from the days when I had to worry about looking weak or people would hurt me. Befoe the PhD, before undergrad, I attended a very stressful alternative school where both staff and students were abusive. I've been in therapy, gone on anti-anxiety drugs. I've gotten better, but I still only have 1-2 people who I can talk to, I feel they are tiring of my whinging. 

Also, my aunt has cancer. She got it at 57, just after retiring. In addition to the emotional pain that caused... (I used to go to her house when my dad got abusive) it's an eye opener. My aunt was very frugal, and saved for retirement heavily while working a lot. Now, she won't get to enjoy that time. It's hard to spend your 20s in front of a computer while seeing that...

Anyways, this feels like a rample, and I'll sum it up to try and make sense of it:

So yeah, to sum it up: I feel disconnected from my friends, have no romantic partner, my research is going poorly, I feel like I have no alternative to said PhD, and my... everything feels like it is going wrong. I feel like if I could fix one thing... find a less stressful job, a friend who would support me... if just one thing could not go wrong, then I might manage, but it all feels overwhelming.

It also feels hopeless. I've tried pills, CBT, therapy, you name it. I feel like I do all the right things, and nothing but bad things happen.

17wg1c,6,2013-02-04,"2013, Week 5 - Seemples - Trying something different + the usual",Seemples,Team_Japanese,https://www.reddit.com/r/Team_Japanese/comments/17wg1c/2013_week_5_seemples_trying_something_different/,"Progress report! This week I've done a decent amount of Japanese work, I completed another chunk of the last genki chapter (only the workbook questions to go now), did some listening exercises, wrote some diary entries in Japanese, and also attended my usual tutoring / Japanese class. While I don't think I've made a huge leap, I feel that I'm making consistent progress every week. 

I've also decided that I should post up something new I've learned every week and share a bit. I like to help, and hopefully by doing this some people will learn something new and I get to solidify my understanding / be corrected. I'll try not to do things you would commonly find in textbooks and shiz, but more subtle areas but due to my level I think this may be unavoidable.

One of the things I learned about this week was じゅんび　（　準備　）　which is the noun ""prepare"". To turn this into a verb, you just change it to じゅんびをする which then means ""to prepare"". For example: 「私　は　インタンシップ　の　準備　を　しすぎました」 which translates into ""I prepared too much for the internship"" (suru + sugiru &gt; shisugiru). The reason I came about this word was because I tried to use　ととのえる instead, which apparently is used for when preparing / cleaning documents (しょるい）or for a meeting (かい). Feel free to correct me on anything, hopefully someone got something out of this.

To be more specific with time spent studying: 2 hours on genki, 1 hour listening exercise, 2 hours diary writing, 1.5 hours with tutor, and 1.5 hours with Japanee class.

Next week: Complete genki (gjklnklsanmd), and diary writing. Not many goals this week due to the poopload of work I have to do for University, but it should still be manageable."

I suggest a Bachelors in something else, while maybe minoring in some form of audio engineer education. and (B) Be close to family or friends that will be able to help you out. If you get a opportunity, you can bet that you will be working for free for a while, and maybe just maybe get offered a very small amount of money after your ""intern"" or  ""runner"" position.

I went to Full Sail and got lucky and made it. I have been climbing my way up, from cleaning up over flowing toilets at 3:00 am,  to assistant, and now to a second engineer postion. It took me from 2004 until early 2012 to be able to support myself off audio work alone. The key, think outside the box. Your not going to start out working on hit record projects. Become familiar with ADR, noise reduction, TV and Radio production, remote recordings, etc. Be adverse in any situation that involves audio, and it will greatly help your chances of beings successful.  I recorded Radio, TV, and Film based voice overs for 2 years before i even got a chance to record music. I graduated to vocal overdubs, then individual instrument overdubs. Now I get run my own sessions with a bands, mixing, etc.

17wdrp,0,2013-02-04,Demanding respect in the office: Am I the bad guy?,LadyLoomingbird,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/17wdrp/demanding_respect_in_the_office_am_i_the_bad_guy/,"This is going to be really hard to get off my chest, as I'm still very upset over what happened today at work.  I'm almost shaking as I type this, so please bear with me.

After I graduated with my degree in journalism (minored in new-media), I won an internship at a professional blog in New York.  Well, after this, I don't know how professional they really are.

I've been working as assistant to the chief editor for three months, and I really love the edgy dynamics of our office staff.  It's a paid internship I won during my last quarter, and even though it's a paid internship, I barely make enough to pay for groceries and medicine.  Besides this, I've put up with the money situation because I love the idea of being a journalist and giving the underprivileged a voice on the internet.  Though there are a few assholes at my office, the people here have generally been pretty OK.  Until earlier today.

For the past two weeks, our PR department has been putting together a video package to be released on YouTube. The promotion involves all of the women in the editorial staff walking around in high heels posing posing in front of the camera, sometimes making horrible duck faces to be extra ""cute.""  The video is recorded at double speed with wind blasting on them for this slow motion effect when it's done in editing.  Our marketing guy says this will be dubbed over with a baratone voice talking about making the news ""sexy"" again.

There are so many things wrong with this that I feel like I can't keep it together.  Before I decided to write this post, I spent nearly half an hour sitting on my fire escape staring up in the sky, trying not to tear up. (Life pro tip: it's really hard to cry in freezing temperatures, so if you need to get it together, sitting out in in the cold after dark in New York city during February is a REALLY good way to keep yourself from breaking down.)

Here's what I take issue with:

1) These are not models, they are journalists.  More importantly, these are enlightened women who should be taking themselves more seriously as professional writers.

2) The PR and marketing department should be promoting our site as a NEWS site, showing how intelligent and insightful our writing staff are, both the men and the women.  As a woman who spent four years and a LOT of money studying to be a professional writer, I'd like to think of myself as an intellectual and not some piece of eyebacon for guys on YouTube to gawk at.

3) And this is the part that makes me tremble.  I know what guys on YouTube do, and you know as well.  Hell, look at most of the guys on reddit and what they talk about on /r/videos or /r/pics.  The women in this promotional video were fully clothed and not doing anything OVERTLY sexual, but come on.  Guys will look at this video, see attractive women being somewhat suggestive, and they will be sexually aroused.  As a woman, this makes my skin crawl.  If there's anything the /r/creepshots fiasco taught me (I've been lurking for about a year) it's that guys on the internet will masturbate to ANYTHING, porn or not, as long as the female form is displayed.  I don't want the women I work with and usually respect deeply being gawked at by some greasy redditor or YouTuber while he reclines in his computer chair back just far enough to unzip his pants and touch himself while MY COLLEAGUES make fools of themselves.

I went to the editor chief about this, and he laughed.  He said it's all in good fun, and that I shouldn't worry about it anyway.  All of the women volunteered to be in the video, but he doesn't understand.  He can't.  Until he's stood in front of a video camera in a red flowing dress and high heels, he can't defend this.  He has no idea and never will.

OK, I'll admit it.  I did cry.  I tried not to.  When I came home, my boyfriend Brad tried to make me feel better, but I won't talk to him.  I know he's done it, too.  The only two that can make me feel better right now are my two kitties Doctor and Zoidberg:

http://i.imgur.com/RAbu5Dy.jpg

PS: I know my boss reads reddit, so I am literally freaking out right now.

EDIT: Wow, I really feel so much better after talking to some of you!  You guys are great.  Some of the comments, however, have really made me wonder if someone from /r/mensrights linked to this page to exploit this story and make nasty comments about.

EDIT2:  I was turned away when I showed up to the office this morning.  My editor in chief informed me that my last paycheck will come in the mail next Thursday.  I don't know how to handle this.  Have I just been fired for voicing my concerns about sexism in the office?  I'm literally shaking right now."

I'm in so much pain right now. My adoptive mom has a bio-son who's been a heroin addict for ten years. He claims he's been ""clean"" for a year, and he's been seeing this girl for like 6 months. She doesn't work. They live with my mom in her two bedroom apartment. The second bedroom was mine and they were sleeping in the pull out bed in the living room sofa. Mom assured me that my room was mine and mine alone, it was my safe place, it would never go away. 

I've been away at an internship. Chick and brother announce she's two months pregnant. I expressed concern to my mom, since he's taken advantage of mom's ""mother's care"" for years and years. I know she's going to wind up taking care of this baby. This girl doesn't work, but apparently it's okay according to Mom because ""your brother's been working at Burlington Coat Factory for a month"". They don't pay rent. Mom takes care of everything for them. They're incredibly immature and selfish. They were talking about having a baby a few months ago, but they wouldn't even consider getting married first. 

Mom told me she gave them my room the night I left. They're using all my things. They had sex in my bed. I feel so disgusted and disrespected, my brother has stolen and pawned my things before for drugs, including a priceless bracelet that was one of only two things I had from my birth mother. When I brought up my concern about this too to my mom, she told me to ""get the fuck over yourself, they deserve it"". I'm putting myself through college by myself. I'm on track to get into grad school to get a PhD. But she's kicked me out of the only home I thought I had. She doesn't want me anymore. 

I feel so betrayed. I've been alone since my parents died when I was two. I thought when she said she'd keep me forever when she took me in when I was 8 because I was ""her"" daughter she meant it. She lied. I can't stop crying.

I've put it in my Amazon wish list if anyone is willing to help me out. It's called Sam's Teach Yourself Javascript in 24hrs: 
http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/ref=gno_listpop_wi

If any other information is needed I'd be happy to provide it.

EDIT: I added a few more books to the list I want to get eventually. Currently I really just want to learn JavaScript, which is 3rd item down on the list.

I've been reading a lot about America being extremely overworked and in my own life I have seen it. My dad works upwards 50-60 hours a week and only gets 1-2 weeks vacation a year. Almost every person I have come into contact with complains of being overworked.

I live at home because I can't afford a place right now, I'm currently looking for work as a pharmacy technician (I just got my certification), and I'm planning on marrying my fiance sometime in the next 1-2 years.

I have had 2 jobs before now. A part-time retail position and a full-time 12-week internship at a public park. I hated both of them because for some reason I suck at absolutely anything manual labor. I'm fine with working 40 hours a week, but not much more than that.

Overall, I have to say that I just feel depressed. I have no reason to be. But I just feel like this is it. Once I move out, my life will suck forever. All because of the place I was born. You can call me entitled or lazy. I don't care. The fact that I will never have any time to enjoy my life and I'll likely never be able to retire or have financial security depresses me to no end. I value my time. I value my family, my hobbies, traveling the world. And I'll never be able to do that. Yeah, first world problems and all that, but it depresses me all the same.

This leads me to my question. Should I leave America if I'm overworked? Fuck it, I have one life, one chance to do what I want, and I've decided that I will not work myself to death while having enough to live. So if I ever decide to leave America, how should I do it and where should I go if I should leave at all? Me and my fiance of course have family here, there's culture shock, there's financial concerns, all of that. So I don't even know if it's possible. But I will enjoy my life, no matter the cost.

It's almost my senior year, I have 3 semesters left after this one, and I know I should probably get working on my capstone this semester because people who don't start early get swallowed up by it...and this is our DEFINING moment of college. It's how we get jobs, and succeed post-academic life.

Game design internships are not around here, so I have to look out towards Texas and California mostly, and that strings along its own issues (How would I pay rent for my single bedroom here if I'm there for 12 weeks?) but I know I want one..but I don't think I could take one....

My job in the IT call center on campus is soul sucking, and all I want to do is relax and not worry about things when I get home, but I can't afford to get a lower paying job really, and changing jobs is hard to do while in college (I work part time) at my pay level.

I like what I do..I enjoy it when I'm not feeling like this. I just feel like there is too much work, too many expectations, and I feel like I'm falling behind. I'm feeling unmotivated..but when I'm unproductive I just beat myself up and get depressed and I feel worse...I'm terrified of seeing a counselor of any sort...though I know I probably should.

So here are some details: I'm about 190 lbs male slightly overweight but not terribly fat. I don't regularly work out but I do drink a lot of water. My last time smoking weed (went through an eight in about a week none for many months that before that and none since) was about six weeks ago. My last time doing mushies was about five weeks ago and my last time with Salvia was either last weekend or the weekend before(can't remember) . The drug test will be urinalysis. 

What are my chances of passing if any? Can I prepare for it? If I take it and fail could my direct loans from my school be revoked? Does it make any difference at all that I was in Amsterdam when I toked? I'm not sure I want to chug lots of water because I've heard that if the pee is too diluted they will take a hair sample instead.

Update: Thanks for the info guys. My GF picked up a pisser test for me at walmart and I'm going to give it a go just to be sure before my test. I know it wont be as accurate at all, but if I fail then I'll definitely know not to go take a gov't test."

* Do I have to explain why I dropped out?

* Does being a drop out affect my chances of procuring a job?

* I'm looking at other EU colleges as well. Especially Germany but can't make sense of their admission process. Help needed here.

*In comparison, is it better to get educated in US or EU keeping in mind the quality of education, tuition and living costs, exposure, job and internship opportunities?

Oh and tell me the dirty secrets of various universities that I most definitely can't find on websites."

",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/17zpea/my_father_is_a_vietnam_vet_with_well_ptsd_pretty/,"As I am growing older, am out of the house, and have gained a little perspective on my life and family situation, I only wish to come out of this in the end having established a healthier and happier relationship with my dad than what has existed the last 21 years. I am a junior in college, and have been having more and more problems with drugs and my mental health since freshman year. My dad has been physically and mentally abusive towards myself, my two sisters, and my mother for as long as I can remember. I have never been able to sit down and discuss this elephant in the room with anyone but my sisters and mom, and that first discussion did not take place until this past December. My mom finally sacked up and threw divorce papers his way while I was home over christmas break. The night after christmas that led to this decision was the worst state I have seen my father in in my entire life. He went from 0-60 in a matter of seconds, next thing I knew he was strangling me while I was fighting him off of my sister and mom, which resulted in the police removing him from our home. This is obviously not an isolated event, and the long term abuse has taken a toll on everyone in my family. 

While I am still not convinced he is a horrible person, two of the three of my half siblings who are all in their 30's and 40's and from his previous marriage, barely keep in touch with him. My half brother maintains virtually no contact with him, or even his younger half siblings, unless begged to come over for holidays by one of my sisters or myself. I have not spoken to my dad since that wonderful night, despite his pathetic attempts to be suddenly interested in helping me find an internship, etc. While I am not ready to speak with him yet, I am seeking out advice from anyone who is from a similar background, a professional (aka doctor, therapist, head shrinker, etc, etc, etc.), or anyone who has managed to fix a seemingly destroyed relationship. At the end of the day, he is still my dad. While I will never forgive him for many of his actions, I am still open to any way to try and mend what he has been broken the best I can. I know that he cannot help his upbringing, what he experience in war, and what it has done to his mental health. What I don't know, is if there is a possibility for me to improve my relationship with him before it's too late. He is turning 70 this year, his health is questionable, and his mental health could take a turn for the better or worse depending on how he deals with his second divorce. Any advice on how to better my relationship with him after this pivotal point as well as how to seek out help for him (although I don't really see him opening up in therapy) would be greatly appreciated. 

This is my first ever reddit post, I hope this subject is not too dreary. I am simply seeking any friendly advice or similar story that can help me improve my mental health as well as my relationship with that man, in hopes that there is some sort of happy ending to all of this."

Then I came here and was slightly disappointed. Nah I'm kidding, I found a great place (i mostly lurk) and since have played Settler, 7 wonders, CAH, and Ticket to Ride, and have a to-play list. It allowed me to reach out and I found [this place](http://www.gamerterrain.com/?page_id=2) near my town. (don't click it yet!)
  
Okay enough back story (sort of). I also am a local journalist and the owners of the above place have also done something else really cool. They opened up a restaurant called the [Game Master Grill](http://www.gamemastergrill.com/) that is board gamed themed and I had [to cover it](http://mineola.patch.com/articles/playing-with-your-food-at-game-master-grill) since it was new in town. You can go and get dinner, food is excellent btw, and buy a game and play. I asked him and you can bring your own too or just play one of the small dice or card of board games that he has there while you wait for your food. You can play/eat/eat/then play/show up start playing and throughout or take a break to eat, if you want to take a while go on a slower night and hang out. They'll even deliver a board game with your order. It is a really neat idea and a cool place.  
  
Generally it is a fun store and really nice. The staff will all teach you games. I've ate a couple times there and they helped teach my girlfriend a couple games as well,as taught us both some small games, when we didn't want to stay too long, to play while we waited for our food. They even have a neat zombie dice game! The place hasn't picked up too quickly though and could use more exposure. The owner is a greatguy who worked in the restaurant business for 17 years, got an opportunity to open a board game store a few years ago and took it. He is a veteran, a good guy, and passionate about board games, particularly about teaching people how to play new games. I want to see if I can help the place out by showing you guys a cool place you'd appreciate (maybe spurn a new idea for a restaurateur out there) and get him more exposure. Tell your NY/Long Island buddies about it. Go yourself if you are in the area, check out his site (the menu is super neat and creative with the titles of some dishes).  
  
Again here is the site for the restaurant [Game Master Grill](http://www.gamemastergrill.com/) and this is the, linked above too [article] (http://mineola.patch.com/articles/playing-with-your-food-at-game-master-grillhttp://www.gamemastergrill.com/) I wrote about the place. I don't need ""views or anything"" I'm actually an intern so I don't even get paid. I just thought the article was relevant to help spread the word. I was going to just make a post like check out this place, with the link, but I wanted to be upfront with my intentions and let everyone know a little more about the place. So thank's again guys for anyone and even if it's only one person chcking it out! PM if you have questions or anything.

It's taking me a lot of courage to post here right now. I don't know what to do, and I've stopped looking for relationship advice from my friends and family. I just need you right now.
i've been in a relationship for 4 plus years. It started the end of my junior year in high school and now i am a junior in college. 
He goes to a university 2 hours away, so I get to see him maybe three times a month. I started doing internships and would stay at his place, but now I am taking a full course load and finally able to stay by myself in an apartment...
When he does come over, he stays for around 3-4 days. He doesn't seem to understand that I have a copious amount of homework and papers to write. He constantly bugs me when I am studying, even though he promised to not. He is a slacker, doesn't know where he is going in his life, and very messy when he comes over. He expects me to clean up after him and only buys fast food to eat. He won't eat anything healthy and only eats out. I can't even make food for him, he is picky. He is also on depression medication and dropped two classes because of it. Let's just say, he's turned into someone I don't really find amazing or going somewhere with their life but, reddit, I am terrified. I'm scared. He has been my best friend for four years and really stuck by me. However, he wasn't emotionally there for me when my dad almost died earlier this year and completely ignored the situation. I would learn not to cry in front of him because it seemed like he didn't care....
I feel so insecure. Too insecure to leave him. I look at myself and think, ""who would want this?"" I don't know what to do. All my friends tell me if I'm unhappy I should leave. but I am super feminist (a woman's studies major, and an english major) and it's hard for me to date.
I have had an occurrence recently that really hurt me, too. I went out to dinner with an ex and he basically rejected me, telling me that I was just another girl and that I wasn't special.
I'm just really lost right now. Do I keep my loser bf that understands me in all my quirks and constantly says he loves me? Just give me advice and put me out of my college misery. Another concern I have is that I'm almost done with school and once i graduate (hopefully trying to go to grad school) that i won't have anyone.. 
Thanks for reading.

Background: I am a senior at one of the top accounting schools in the states.  The big four recruit very heavily here but it is still quite competitive to get a position.  I would love a position with the big four so I can get the client experience, but would ""settle"" for a nice regional firm if possible too.

My plan is to graduate this following December eligible to sit for the CPA exam.  I am forgoing the masters program because my parents are not willing to pay for it (it's expensive).  I have a 3.3 GPA, I am involved in a few clubs (No VP positions but still involved), and have a good amount of cool things to talk about on my resume.  Note: my GPA will fall to a 3.2 by this fall, not sure if that matters.  Though I have had internships in office settings as a Fresh/Soph, I have never had one specifically in accounting, and from what I have heard that is considered very important to have.  I don't have an internship for this summer because I just decided (in the past couple months) that I want to do public instead of industry which was what I had been interviewing for (was going well until I realized I was in the wrong area)  Now the major accounting firms have their summer interns and I feel like it will be hard to get a position at a top public firm without any internship experience.  I am kind of scrambling to get something for this summer, but I will likely have to take some (probably online) summer school so I have that going on as well.  I would really appreciate any advice on how I should position/network from here."

I'm an undergraduate student studying CS and enjoy webdev on the side. Though I am familiar with basically everything necessary for front end, I am curious: how often is a Creative Commons html template used instead of writing the page structure from scratch? Never? Do you use templates you made yourself?

While anyone is free to chip in here, I would appreciate some responses from senior developers if any are on here. When it comes to showing off what makes my development unique (say, for interviews), I typically mention bits of jquery and css I have manipulated myself. I have read a couple texts on xhtml, css, js, et al....but I guess I might be missing some secret as to how exactly a developer begins to produce something.

Keep in mind that I am asking this specifically in regard to relatively ""small"" jobs. The kind of work a business would expect of an undergraduate intern. Not trying to be lazy, just curious as to what shortcuts professionals take since my texts have not regraded to such things."

O. Ma. GAWD. This server is so awesome it made me change my schedule so the server I had originally planned for today is now tommorrow. So yeah, InvisionCraft is yet another survival server, but what makes this server special, you ask? Well, a lot. The admins and players are as you expect them to be, but the gameplay and builds are just fantastic. Ok, let's start off with the community. They're respectful people who follow the rules seamlessly. This is the exact community I'm looking for, mature people who just want to make the experience all the more enjoyable. Admins are great, they are nice and the rules they set out are fantastic. Alright, gameplay. Holy fuck, is it good (please excuse my language! D:). I feel this server would be lost without all the plugins this server has. It really gives a rich feel to the SMP experience without taking too much away from the vanilla Minecraft. And lastly, the builds. This server is in what they call ""Generation IV"" which in a nutshell means this is their 4th world. The spawn is wonderfully built and the information of the server gives you everything you need to know from the server's history right through to website links. So yeah, please go on this server, you won't regret it. I talked with one of the admins, staticpast, and asked him some questions!

**Q: What made you become an admin?**

**staticpast**: I've been apart of the InvisionCraft family, a year this month. Upon reflection, to my days as a player. I had one thing in mind. Helping out players. I decided to apply for a staff internship, which of course as a result of a lot of dedication, loyalty and commitment led to where I am today. Something I did not expect.

**Q: Have the players on this server been to your liking?** 

**staticpast**: Of course, and why rightly so? Everyone is welcome within the InvisionCraft community. Over the course of four generations - spanning since the 2nd June, 2011. InvisionCraft has come to be known by its noticeable sense of community, our friendly atmosphere. Our arms are open to all.

**Q: Do you think being Server of the Day could help you gain more players?**

**staticpast**: Hopefully, so. Any source of advertisement is good! Thankyou for this opportunity. 

**Q: Final question; will Server of the Day be a big achievement for you?**

**staticpast**: Definitely so, I can not say that we've ever been featured as a server of the day before. There's a first for everything!

Judging from the other non-internship interviews with this company, they are not really focused on the classic interview questions, but more web-based ones

As someone who has more experience in the C, C++, and Java side of things (without much web experience), are there any crash courses or resources you could recommend to me for this?

[I've posted once before](http://www.reddit.com/r/SCREENPRINTING/comments/wfjz1/having_issues_heat_pressing_gold_foil_advice_tips/) about this but I am still having trouble after trying suggestions offered in the last thread.

My friend and I are still trying to master gold foil technique. The first time I did foil was during my internship at a local shop. They had me heat pressing gold foil sheets onto a screen printed gold ink design and cold peeling. I don't recall the exact machine settings but they were close to what you might expect, ~350 degrees for ~10-12 sec. Well the first time I tried it in my shop it just didn't adhere properly, which lead me to my first post.

We use mostly [Union Ink](http://unionink.com/) products in our shop and we picked up some of their foil adhesive. So we tried just printing adhesive on the garmet (print-flash-print), heat pressing and cold peeling the foil. Well that didn't work too well, it came out really spotty and didn't get any better no matter how many times we tried. Then we tried printing a white plastisol layer then a layer of the adhesive. This came out much better (cant find the photos). We thought that printing gold first, then the adhesive would be the winning combination. [But that hasn't really worked either](http://imgur.com/a/FRrhT#0).

If you check out the photos you'll see that we've got [this weird texture](http://i.imgur.com/fonvPYZ.jpg) showing up on the foil even though the foil was completely flat when we pressed it. And we're getting [holes or pock marks](http://i.imgur.com/eEap10h.jpg) too.

The images featured are Union gold ink with a layer of adhesive, allowed to cool, then heat pressed at 325 degrees fahrenheit for 15 seconds and cold peeled.

Suggestions? Hypothesis? Anything is much appreciated."

My birthday was actually better than previous years since I actually did something (sushi with a few friends) instead of sitting around at home not doing anything. I'm in a much better place now than I was last year when I turned 27: I dropped out of my PhD program, felt like shit all the time, and was horribly depressed. I'm now in school for something different, have an internship, and also work 25-30 hours a week. 

Despite making these changes, I still don't feel great a lot of the time. Being busy distracts me only so much. My mind tends to wander and I still remind myself that I'm now 28, live with my mom and have never had any sort of relationship. 

I feel that I *should* be happy: I have food to eat, a roof over my head, some disposable income, and I do have friends even if I don't see them all that often. But when I get up in the morning, the first thing I think of is that I'm still me, and that all this change is for nothing and I'm just going to end up worse than before. I'm worried that since I'm so far behind everyone else that it's not worth it to even start. Is it bad to find yourself being jealous of others because they're more successful than you? "

I'm currently a transfer student at a some-what reputable school for accounting (SUNY Binghamton). As I've been attending presentations by the big 4, I could not help but be attracted by all they have to offer. 

However, my issue is my grades. Since I've only been here for one semester (16 credits) I can still recover from my abysmal gpa (2.4). My question is what should I do now to pave the road to working for or landing a internship at any of the Big 4 or midsized firms? 

The only firm I am able to apply to intern at would be KPMG as they do not have a minimum grade requirement, although I doubt they would select me as, unfortunately, my resume is not strong either. 

Currently I'm trying to focus on building my resume by joining clubs, leadership positions on campus, and I'm also the treasurer for my fraternity (would that solidify my resume?). 

This summer I will intern at a small local firm with few clients... 

So reddit, I ask you. What should I do now to solidify my resume and pave the road to working for a midsized - big 4 firm? 

Thank you again for your time."

I'm just working on a paper tonight, so I figured I'd try this again. Had some good conversations last time but nothing that really went anywhere.

**A little about me:**

I'm a college senior studying Sociology/Criminology and am concentrated on a Criminal Justice/Law Enforcement career path. I have a government internship where I get to work with kids. I have to be discrete until I know you better, but I love it so far and would not oppose making it a career after I graduate in May. Kids are awesome.

I enjoy books/movies/shows. I am currently on the third book of A Song of Ice and Fire. I also watch Game of Thrones. I can't wait for the new season of Walking Dead, either. Admittedly, I need to get back into the comics. I love good horror movies.

I produce electronic music. I also play a few instruments. I'd be willing to share some with you. I listen to many different kinds of music; some you'll like, some you won't. Most recently I've been in an instrumental hip-hop mood. I'm huge on dubstep and Drum and Bass but haven't been feeling most recent major releases.

I like to skateboard; shortboard and longboard alike. I also hit the gym a few times a week. I used to be a high school level competitive fencer but my course work leaves me little time to attend club practices. I also like hiking!

I like video games. I'm usually playing with other people, though. League of Legends and Guild Wars 2 are favorites. Recently I've been just playing my PS3 when I have time. I have Steam!

I'm an ENTJ/field marshal personality type. I'm extroverted until I'm introverted. The analogy I use is that my social battery is a little bigger than most other introverts. After a week or two I may finally need that alone time introverts crave.

I think I'm a handsome guy, but I'm not your kind of handsome I understand. This is professional/casual me! http://imgur.com/a/MCnkL

**And you:**

Be cool. Be yourself. Be healthy and have self-esteem. I'm open to a lot of different kinds of people. I'd like you to be around my age or younger since we're probably at the same stage in life (re: college). I'd like you to return the favor with a pic but you don't have to. 

Realistically, mutual attraction is important. Don't let that scare you, though. I'm just a pretty objective person.

If you're still reading I hope you PM me! Maybe Steam later- or Skype."

How do these guys possibly think they can sucker a student into working for them 20 hours a week at a job that offers them NO value?!?

First of all, this doesn't comply with US labor laws: the Department of Labor makes it very clear that if an employer is benefits from the actions (""for example, filing, performing other clerical work, or assisting customers"") of the intern, the intern must be compensated for his/her work. 

I find it ridiculous that this company thinks it can cut down its overhead by participating in (basically) slave labor. I find it ridiculous that this company can claim to be providing a service to its clients (who are students - again, this is a tutoring ""internship"") while taking advantage of college students.

But most of all, I find it ridiculous that someone might actually apply to this internship. So rather than applying for an actual tutoring job (Kaplan, etc.) or finding students to tutor privately, you're going to spend 20 hours per week making someone else money, with no real value to yourself. 

STOP THE MADNESS!

I have a question regarding CompTIA A+ Certs. I know there are a ton of them in this sub (I did search) but figured I'd through in my own just to be clear/personalized.

I'm a current IT student (junior year) who has not gotten a cert. yet. I am looking for internships, and figured a cert would help improve my resume (as it's nowhere near jaw-dropping).

While other certs would be more ideal, (Network+ Security+, Linux+) I don't feel prepared for those yet, and figured A+ would be the quickest way to enhance my resume.

I took a PC Hardware class last semester that was supposed to lead up to/prepare for the A+ exams, so i feel with a little brushing up i'll be fine.

My question is this: Since the 700 series is being phased out by the 800 series, any vouchers I purchase will be good for either up until Aug (I plan on taking Feb or early Mar).

The 700 series does seem a bit easier (not as current) while the 800s have some simulations or hands-on from what it sounds like. I thought that while the 800 would be better content wise, the 700s would require less preparation.

Will employers see or care which version you took? As i am a full time student, should i take the 700s just for sake of ease/quickness as either will be valid?

**TL;DR: I can take A+ 700 or 800. Will employers know or care which one? Is one better?**

P.S. - Might as well throw this in here: for those of you in the tech field, any ideas on how to improve resumes for chances of scoring an internship and/or job?

I don't hope to do support/repair as a career, but figure it'd be a good launching point, as it's ""Industry recognized cert."" (yeah, whatever.) Looking to focus in networking and/or security. But in general, how would one go about improving resume for an IT field?

Thanks and sorry about the length.

 This first little experimental tool i'm putting on the table is a deceptively simple real time visualization. What it does simply is take the top trends off twitter and match them to photos using a simple multi-stage algorithmic process to find the right photo from primarily public domain images. If you are a decision-maker – especially let’s say on youth entertainment – you could scan this and readily find out whats going on and what kids are talking about instead of waiting for your intern to decipher hash tags and bring it to you. If you tuned into global events you could rapidly see what is developing in a foreign country even if you don’t have the names and places down, the images would effectively give you a leg up on processing this.

Just for fun and expiremental research - Everyday the backend auto generates a dubstep style music video from the top trends of the day and uploads it to youtube with masssive SEO. An example is here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=WxnEzScDtPE

I'm going to hire I think - rightly or wrongly for some cute models to make bumpers for the videos to add to the video generation engine

It's part of a larger framework for another project, but I'd love to get feedback from all the smart people here if you think it rocks or sucks."

I'm looking for the staples (light blue, white, pink) but I want numerically sized shirts because my arms are fairly long and letter-sized (S, M, L; not sure of the proper nomenclature) shirts always seem to fit me oddly (typically traditionally cut dress shirts in medium are too short in the sleeves but nice in the body; while large slim fit shirts are too billowy in the body but pretty nice in the chest and arms).

As much as I'd like to plunk down ~$100 a piece of Brooks Brothers shirts right now, it's not really an option.

I am trying to decide what school to attend, but I am perplexed and stressed out.  I need your advice. 

Some of the pros/cons:

Canisius pros:  

- I have friends in the premedical program and they say it prepares you well for the MCAT.

-  Classes are very small and professors are always around to help.  My one friends physics class has 7 students.

- Strong alumni in Western NY, a lot of students get amazing internships / volunteer / research experience

- 99% of the professors can actually speak English

Cons of Canisius:

- ~31,000 a year (Scholarships equal about 6 thousand a year for me)

- A ton of grinders and hipsters

SUNY Buffalo Pros:

- With my EOP I will get $ back from the government

- Way more research available  

- More majors (I'd rather major in something like Pharmacology, than biology)

Cons:

-  I don't know much about UB

- A lot of teachers said the math / science department are swarming with professors who can barely speak English.  (English isn't my first language, but I know how to speak clearly) 

- Difficult to do get research spots due to sheer number of students in a class.

Right on the cover of pipesandcigars.com was a beautiful estate Peterson pipe.  I bought it right there and then.  
 

It came in the mail today.  Along with my Sir Walter Raleigh aromatic I had ordered for the occasion. 

Strolled up to our smoke room, loaded a bowl of Sir Walter Raleigh, and queued up The Tallest Man on Earth.  Listened to the album in it's entirety. 

Hands down best smoke I've ever had.

1836md,1,2013-02-07,[Javascript] - Question on scope / calling functions,[deleted],learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1836md/javascript_question_on_scope_calling_functions/,"Intern here, new to javascipt. My mentor guy is out sick so I am on my own today, unless someone here can help! I will do my best to explain what's going on because I don't exactly know that what I think I need to learn how to do is actually what I need to learn how to do.  
  
I am working on a web app using the Kendo UI, and basically it consists of a main page which has a tabbed control, and all the tabs display grids of different variations (Detail Report, Summary Report, Exempt Customers List, etc)- each tab has it's own .js file. The default page .js file has script for a dropdownlist control that gets its data remotely, and based on what is selected the grids on the other pages need to change correspondingly. It is basically there to filter data from the grids. 
  
So what I think I'm looking for here is how to call the dropdownlist from the default file (so that I can get the value of the selected item) over in the javascript file for, say, the Detail Report, and then use it to update my grid. Is this possible, or do I have to move the control down to the individual page's level, and put one on each page? If it is possible, how would I go about doing that? Like I said, my javascript is very rough, but I am familiar with programming concepts as an intermediate level C# student.
  
 I'll do my best to clarify anything needed. Thanks for your time."

182qrz,15,2013-02-07,List of (non-medication) changes I'm making this month. ,PlayForMeeps,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/182qrz/list_of_nonmedication_changes_im_making_this_month/,"So I think it's pretty clear that medication is only half the battle for a lot of people with ADHD and I've found this to be especially true for me- I (20F) was diagnosed a little over a year ago and although medication (50mg Vyvanse) has helped a lot, I still have a lot of residual anxiety and confidence issues that have been hard to kick due to years of bad habits/coping mechanisms. 

Reality set in a few weeks ago when I read two of my professors' recommendation letters that they had written for an internship- I probably wasn't supposed to read them but had access to them through my online application (come on, you would read yours too). They basically confirmed everything I knew about myself- I bite off more than I can swallow, appear to ""lack focus and determination,"" and that I haven't ""realized my potential"". They said a lot of good things too, but all of that is frustrating to hear nonetheless, especially when I realize that my lack of self control and focus can be misinterpreted as a lack of ability. I spent most of January in a depression after being fired from my job (""inability to learn quickly enough"") and feeling like a huge fuck up/failure/disappointment. 

So, I figured I'd share everything that I'm doing and see if anyone else wanted to share their own experiences, offer tips, or ask questions. It seems like a lot of people on this sub (myself included) have been kinda down/struggling lately and I don't like people feeling like their situation is hopeless. Sorry for the long post, I tried to break it up as much as possible and keep my sentences to-the-point. 

1. **Seeing a therapist:** I had my first appointment last week! I did therapy once before (after my parents divorce when I was sixteen) and really liked it so I'm optimistic about trying it again. We've started tackling my issues with anxiety- her first two assignments for me were to 1) pay attention to my negative thoughts, what they were saying, etc. and write some down for our next session, and 2) if I start thinking them- let them go and just stop thinking them. Obviously easier said than done but it's nice to have someone tell me to do it. I'm going back again at the end of the month and will eventually see her every week/every other week probably. 

2. **Exercise:** I've decided to run another half marathon in May. I ran my first in September (I think) of last year and haven't done much running since because I've been overwhelmed with school. My training plan is 17-21 miles a week which will be really difficult but I'm looking forward to it- running was one of the best things I ever did for my ADHD and sleep patterns. I'm also easing my way into a ketogenic diet (/r/keto), which may help with ADHD as well as a number of other neurological disorders (disclaimer: please do your own research before becoming a low-carb nut, it's a big change and you shouldn't screw around with your health). 

3. **Reading:** I'm a student so I don't really just ""read to read"" on top of everything else but I had some audible.com credits to use up and downloaded two books: *Spark* by John. J. Ratey and *The Willpower Instinct* by Kelly McGonigal- so far they're really interesting! Spark is about how exercise affects the brain's functioning and confirms a lot of the things I felt when I was training for my first half marathon; it's been really good for motivating me to train for this second one. I'm not far into The Willpower Instinct but I think it's something I'd recommend to a lot of other ADHD-ers. It's easy to read (or listen to, in my case) and is helping me pick apart where/why/how I lack self control and the ability to form good habits. For example, I learned that people who tend to be most optimistic about a new diet/habit are the most likely to fail- this completely contradicts everything I've heard about ""being positive"" about my abilities and whatever. I tend to be ridiculously optimistic when starting something new, so I'm really interested to read/hear the rest of the book. 

4. **NO MORE MULTITASKING:** This has been a bad habit of mine I realize and a huge reason that I only get things halfway done. When I want to be productive I want to do everything at once which means trying to clean while getting ready in the morning while also trying to organize my iTunes playlist and plan my day. I'm also really bad about texting and driving (terrible habit, I know) but am starting to do it much less (or only at stoplights). If I feel the urge to do a side activity I tell myself ""no"" and keep doing the one task I need to finish; for example, I paused my audiobook before starting this post. Usually I'd just keep it going and miss a ton of info. This has made a much bigger impact than I expected. I don't get overwhelmed with half-finished tasks nearly as much as I used to; in general, I'm much more ""present"" in whatever activity I'm doing. 

5. **Meditation:** This is so silly- I am really not some crazy hippie (or whatever stereotype you identify with meditation) but I have meditated twice in the last week and have really liked how I felt afterwards. It's really hard to explain, but my mind just felt very *clear* afterwards- like I was in control of my thought processes. I've been using [these Youtube videos](http://www.youtube.com/user/YouProductionsUS?feature=watch) to guide my meditation, beginning with ""Concentration Meditation"" (about 18 minutes long). 

6. **Motivating myself:** The past 2 semesters have been really rough for me because I'm not certain what I want to be doing or if I'm even capable of doing what I want to do. I'm a chem major (which I love) but not sure if I want to pursue grad school or a medical/physican's assiting degree- and even if I wanted to do an MD I don't know that my grades are good enough to get me in, which is really frustrating. I got the opportunity to shadow a physician a few days ago and it was a really good experience. It made the whole thing very real for me- I could actually see myself doing that as a career. I started classes yesterday feeling much more confident and driven than I have in a while. 

On a more general note- learning to ask for help has been really important for me in the last year. I feel a huge sense of personal responsibility which makes me feel very guilty about my bad habits. I don't like to make excuses for myself and can really beat myself up over procrastinating or not reaching my goals, which just combines with my anxiety and gets me caught in a vicious cycle. 

A real turning point for me has been telling myself ""It's okay that I can't do this on my own and there's nothing wrong with getting help to be happy."" I'm feeling hopeful/capable/in control (but not overly optimistic!) for the first time in a while. 

EDIT: I finished up this post and was listening to The Willpower Instinct a little, and I ended up right where they begin discussing meditation: ""Meditation is not about getting 'rid' of all your thoughts. It's learning not to get so lost in them that you forget what your goal is. Don't worry if your focus isn't perfect when you're meditating, just practice coming back to the breath again and again.""

I am a 3rd year International Media and Entertainment Management student from Europe. In my 4th year (January 2014) I should start writing my bachelor thesis on a marketing topic of my choice while working/doing research in a company. This would be my 2nd and final internship. 

As I am very passionate about online marketing and digital marketing trends (which I also blog about), I really want to do some research in mobile marketing (mobile ecommerce). The thing is that I really don't know where I should start looking.

So, having one year left to find an internship, I had the idea to go for the giant companies: Amazon, Ebay, Facebook, Google and others. 

My questions to you:

1. Do you think it is a good idea to do research/ an internship in such big companies?

2. Where should I start looking? I know that companies like this rarely reply to emails about positions, which are not advertised...

Thank you very much guys.

Cheers,

182ied,87,2013-02-07,Two petty revenges,captainmeta4,pettyrevenge,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/182ied/two_petty_revenges/,"**#1**

I recently got a part time engineering internship at a place that produces a radioactive compound for medical purposes. Because of its short half life, it has to be made in the very early morning.

Fortunately, I don't have to be there until 6AM on the days that I work. However, I have to wake up at 4 in order to get ready and drive there. This means that I go to bed early the night before, around 9PM.

In my apartment, there are two doors between my bed and the common area. If someone is watching TV or talking, both doors have to be closed for my bedroom to be quiet enough for me to sleep. (I've tried earplugs; I hate them). The first door is my bedroom door: no problem keeping that closed. However, one roommate has to go through the second door in order to get to his room or the bathroom from the common area.

And he left that door open four times last night, and I kept closing it. They were chatting, and the TV was playing the abomination known as ""Family Guy.""

So this morning, when I woke up at 4, I made no effort to be quiet.

TL;DR: Doors aren't for closing to keep sound out, right?



**#2**

On my way back from work this morning, there was a lady in an SUV behind me who kept swerving lanes to try to get past me. At the next intersection, we both turned onto the highway entrance ramp at the same time (there are two turning lanes). Where the ramp narrowed to one lane, she tried to cut me off instead of alternating cars. I sped up, blocked her cut, and forced her to merge the way she should have.

But now it was on. I kept ahead of her, and she got into the left lane to pass. I was in the next lane over and half a car length ahead. And that is where I stayed. Traffic thickened, and we kept pace with each other.

And then the left lane abruptly turned into a Left Exit Only lane. I had to resist the temptation to wave goodbye as she was forced off the highway.

TL;DR: Lady tries to save a few seconds by cutting me off. I cost her a whole lot more than a few seconds by tricking her into getting stuck in an exit only lane."

I am in quite the conundrum right now. I currently getting my M.Ac. with a focus on Taxation and have only a few months left before graduation. I have for the past year or two been focusing my efforts on Wichita, Kansas for a job, and have been waiting for quite some time to hear about a job offer at a public firm. But within the past week my plans have changed and I am now going to be moving to Des Moines, Iowa after I graduate in June.

Because I have been focusing so hard on Wichita, I am feeling kind of lost as to how I should apply for a fall or summer position at the public firms in Des Moines. Right now, the firms I would like to apply too have begun their busy season and I fear that any contact now would be seen as rude or air headed. I don't want to ruin my chances by making a careless mistake like an ill timed phone call, but I also don't have a lot of time left before I graduate.

I am going to focus my efforts on a top down approach beginning with public accounting firms in the top tier then down through moving down the smaller regional ones. I do not plan to start in industry now but will look there as a last resort if all other opportunities dry up in public accounting.

* Should I wait to make contact until after April 15th or start right away? 
* Do I have a chance at getting a position in a public firm in the fall given that most firms hire interns to be hired that next fall or following January? (I thought it would be a good idea to put a photo of my professional self on the front of my resume)
* Do non-standard resumes help in the accounting industry or do they just become easy to disregard?
* For anyone who works in accounting in Des Moines, what sort of work do the larger firms do in the city?

I used to intern for a school district in a large urban city, and one article about test scores in particular shocked me. It showed a huge disparity in test scores between girls and boys, but it was the boys that were lagging behind the girls. In particular, this was especially pronounced in school districts that largely served students of color, in particular African-American and Latino students. If you need a citation for this, see [here](http://www.swcompcenter.org/pdf/conf0406/Gender_Overview.pdf) and [here](http://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/the-widest-achievement-gap).

Barring the silly ideas MRA usually come up with, why do you think the test scores are skewed this way for boys of color? I think there is huge evidence to support that this is issue is 100% intersectional and must be viewed from the lens of race and gender. Obviously I know a lot about racial issues in education and can explain why the race gap exists, but I'd like to hear if you have any ideas why the gender gap exists as well.

Note: Plz to not use phrases like ""female privilege"" or other silliness. Male privilege still exists, and this situation does not signal the end of male privilege. My question is aimed at a particular situation in which race intersects with gender."

So, I've decided to relocate to a bigger city once I can secure a job. For the past couple months, I have been applying to anything that I think I might be close to qualifying for. It's been really tough because I do have some professional experience, but not quite 2 years yet.

I have had two internships and I have done some freelance work. I also have done some design-type stuff for the small company that I currently work for, but that's not my main job there.

I think I need to rework some of my projects so that I can add them to my existing portfolio, and tailor it for the purpose of attaining employment at a branding studio. What do you think a portfolio for that kind of job should include? I love identity design, but I don't have a lot of that type of stuff on my site. How many identity projects do you think it should include?

I know that a good identity designer needs to show that they can be flexible with their style. I am afraid that my portfolio does not reflect that either, but I know I am capable of working in different styles. My better work tends to have similar qualities, though, so I feel the result is a portfolio that isn't diverse enough.

I know I could be a really great addition to someone's design/marketing team.. I am feeling a bit discouraged about it all, and I would love to know if you guys have any advice. I think I know what I need to do, but I feel like I could benefit from some outside perspective.

Skype interviewing is weird because they're only going to see my face and whatever top I'm wearing.

The company is very into being ""creative"" and ""innovative."" They use those words a million times in everything they do and seem to really focus on being unique and, well, creative.

So, the question is, do I wear something a little more ""trendy"" but might be a little more distracting, or something more reserved and boring but less distracting?

Let's get specific, I was thinking of wearing this top while interviewing:

http://i.imgur.com/tGvz1VZ.jpg

I'm sorry I don't have any full-body shots of it, but I'd tuck it into a wool skirt and wear it with green flats and dark tights (even though they probably won't see any of that, but this is in case I ever stand up on screen.) Also, I'd wear a white shirt underneath so it wouldn't be see-through at all.

But, I wasn't sure if that was too much of a ""statement"" shirt to wear in an interview. But I do feel like it looks nice. I don't know.

The other option, I don't have pictures of, but it would just be a dark, patterned dress (it's a dark, simple  floral pattern, casual but nice-looking, with a high-cut neck, no cleavage risks) and a black cardigan over it.

help... I'm bad at this.

When it comes to the pistols in CS:GO I've read through many comments here &amp; on the Steam GO forums.  I've also watched nearly two dozen of the more popular youtube series/videos that give explanations, reviews, and personal/popular input regarding choosing a pistol.  Literally _NONE_ of these sources recommend the FiveseveN.  In fact, more than half of them discredit the gun in some way, and a select few even go so far as to label it as being the ""most useless pistol in the game.""

REALLY?  Has anyone actually USED this gun?  I mean, after the last patch the GO community has pretty much unanimously agreed that the Deagle and P250 are the only 2 pistols worth a damn, with the new Glock closely behind them.

Last night I put this gun to the test, and played 5 competitive matches in a row where I used nothing but the FiveseveN every round as CT.  After 6½ hours of testing, I feel like the gun's coding was left in the hands of 2 interns that have never played GO before.  Their conversation must have gone something like this:

    +  Hey, looks like we're working on the FiveseveN.  It's a pistol that sucks and no one uses.
    -  Well, if no one uses it, why are we changing it?
    +  All they said was ""try to make it more realistic.""  That's it.
    -  OK, let's look up the gun's real-world properties, and then copy &amp; paste the existing code from whatever pistol best matches.
    +  Sounds good.  I'll get some info on the gun.
    **10 MINUTES LATER**
    +  OK.  I've got the gun's stats.  Let's do this.
    -  Alright.  Let's go through the code in order.  First stat: accuracy.  What's it say?
    +  Let's see here... high velocity rounds... machine rifled barrel... constructed with focus on weight and balance... Hmm...  Looks to be an extremely accurate gun.
    -  Alrighty then.  Copy and paste from the Glock.  Next up: recoil penalties from being fired.
    +  Based on what I just read, I would say very little.
    -  Well, I don't wanna copy the Glock *AGAIN*... Tell you what, let's just average the Glock &amp; P250 together..... aaaaaaaand done.  Next up: penetration.
    +  Let me read some more.... hmmm.... oh.... OH.... WOW.  Dude - this gun isn't allowed in most indoor ranges because of it's ridiculous mussle velocity!  It's pretty much a rifle!
    -  Hmm... I guess I'll copy from the deagle then.  Next up: recoil penalties for movement.
    +  Umm... this gun is pretty amazing sounding.  In fact, it almost sounds like it was intended to be fired while under duress...
    -  Really?  Well, I can't just NOT give it a penalty.
    +  ....Why not?
    -  ....
    +  ....
    -  .... OK.  Fine.
    +  .... Actually, that's kind of extreme.  Which existing gun has the lowest penalty?
    -  Looks like.... the elites.
    +  OK, use the same code for the elites, but halve the penalty.
    -  Good idea..... Done.... and done.  The last 4 things are damage.  Let's start with unarmored body/limb shots.
    +  This gun's bullets move fast as hell.  Just up the damage slightly from where it's at now, then remove it's distance fall off completely.
    -  Umm... I can't actually remove it completely...
    +  Then just copy from the AWP?
    -  AH!  Another great idea!  Now what about unarmored heads?
    +  .... Umm.... honestly?.... death?
    -  ....
    +  ....
    -  .... ehhh..... sure. WTF why not?
    +  Are we making this gun too good?
    -  Nah.  HS kills can't ever REALLY be ""cheap"" if the target isn't wearing armor.
    +  Good point.
    -  Now, what if they're wearing armor?  What do we do for body &amp; limb hits?
    +  From what I've read, this gun's muzzle velocity - combined with its ammo style - wouldn't really be effected by a Kevlar vest.
    -  OK, no problem, I'll just copy what we have for unarmored damage.
    +  SERIOUSLY?  You don't think that's a bit extreme?
    -  Not really.  It's only doing, like, 15 damage per hit.  A pistol that kills in SEVEN hits isn't exactly O.P.  That's almost half the clip.
    +  Umm... yeah, I guess not.
    -  Last but not least: armored headshots.
    +  In real life, I'm almost certain this gun would still kill you, but tha-
    -  OK, I'll copy in the deagle code, and we're... Done!

I'm doing an internship in Phnom Penh from Sept-Dec this year. The adviser (who is over there) told me I should plan to either learn how to use a motor bike or a bicycle since there isn't public transit. Or I could rely on the motor bike taxis.

So the question: what's the best option?

I've heard motor bikes are dangerous. I don't know how far away from the University I'll be staying, so I don't know if a motorized option is superior to a bicycle. I am an avid cyclist, though, so I was looking more towards that. But what about the seasonal weather? Would either of the options be superior with weather in mind?

Finally, when it comes to moving out there, do people typically lease motor bikes or buy them outright? I'm obviously not going to need one past December. Same goes for a bike. What's the most efficient way to go about acquiring these items?

Thanks! This is totally out of my element and I love it."

My name's Brad (or realmofgamers), and I just started posting here today. It's a fun community so far! I've already been able to get people a few things (though cheap).

I currently do Freelance Writing for an Android website (Android is a smartphone OS). I worked for one before, but it wasn't paying well, so I moved on and was able to land an internship while I perfected my writing, so hopefully I will start getting paid soon!

I skipped College to learn skills on my own as I'm a firm believer that College is a waste of money when all the information is posted on the internet. Besides, you pay 80K to listen to a Professor talk for four hours a week. The rest is essentially you learning on your own. Besides, the one thing College graduates don't have is real-life experience. ;)

My dream is to become a game developer. While writing is drastically different from programming, I figured I should learn a skill that could get me a sustainable income while I learned programming. While I haven't gotten on the payroll yet, I'm hoping it'll be enough for me to live while I learn programming. 

That aside, in my spare time I play video games, workout, read fantasy and read self-improvement books.

Looking forward to getting to know everyone! :)"

Currently I am in my second year as a civil engineering student and upon graduation I have two paths to take: Working as a structural engineer in office or being a superintendent and running the construction site. I just dont want to be indoors all day long also many of my friends say the superintendents earn more than the office folk. At the end of this year, I want to intern oversees in the construction site but heres the problem. I have no knowledge what so ever in construction as so far I have only taken theoretical courses math and physics and the like. II have no idea what I am going to do as an intern on the construction site with no knowledge. Also, In order to learn all the construction processes from the top (GC) to all the way down to the superintendent and how everything works out and functions can you recommend me a book? I am sure you treasure a book that you always referenced to. Thanks alot for reading this. I just need experienced advice.

I would like to learn all the facets of building construction and I was wondering what would be the best primer book for this as I am currently studying civil engineering and might become a construction superintendent (site manager) in the future."

I am 21 years old, a fresh college graduate. I graduated top of my class with a degree in concentrated advertising. I have two top 10 agency internships on my résumé, one of which was in California where things started escalating.

I went to one of the top stoner schools in the nation, Ithaca college. I went here despite knowing that my parents would never be able to pay off my loans at a private school but i just kept saying to myself ""im going to a good school to get a good education so i can get a high paying salary"". The mayor of the city is now known for verbally decriminalizing marijuana for the sense of wasting tax dollars. My whole college career was a joke. I moved into a suite of all sophomores my freshmen year. Living in a building of only suites led me to not make as many friends. Doors were always closed, people already had their groups of friends. I was alone. My roommate was not a pothead but enjoyed smoking on the reg at that period of time. I ended up joining the rowing team to make friends. All was well. My friend group began to get very competitive as you do on sports teams. I was always into working out and was on a minimum of two varsity teams in high school. After a while competing for spots on team got very intense, even after practice my fellow athletes would disassociate themselves from others. With my spot on the team very secure I found myself the subject of hate most of time... It wasn't the best team you could hope for that's for sure. Slowly I started hanging out with my, for lack of a better term, bizarre roommate. I had smoked in high school but nothing more than on weekends. But soon it was everyday. I would be rowing on the lake at 430am staring out of the boat, still coming down from the night before, loving life. Coach would yell at me to look forward when my mind would drift but all I could see is sun peaking over the far mountains. My times still held and he couldn't be mad though.

I found a friend group sophomore year that genuinely cared about each other. I quit crew when my gpa dropped below a 3.0 first semester sophomore and had taken up bodybuilding. I loved weed. It helped me eat, it helped me sleep, it helped me not care as much. I always wanted to make everyone I met happy and this made me realize I could not and just to accept it. But now it has gone the other way. I finally was able to quit weed when I decided to take an internship in California for the semester. I worked on campaigns for high name brand products that you use everyday. Soon work stress started to get too high and I got diagnosed with depression and anxiety to get my medical card. We were ranked top 3 in the world across the board and somehow someone saw something in this disassociated stoner to let me into this world. I guess it's that thought that kept me going. 

Before I left there I was offered an entry level position for 35K a year. I declined. I left the agency of my dreams because I knew I had to pay off 120K in loans plus interest.

Now I am still smoking everyday, I graduated a couple months ago and haven't done a thing to start my job search. I feel more alone than ever before and can't remember who I was before. I have about an eighth of weed left from the mass I bought before I left school. Once that is done I need to try to quit. My loans set in December and need a high paying job immediately. My ""friends"" only consist on codependent relationships. I have many connections but no relationships even with my family. My girlfriend of two and a half year, thank you to her, is the only one who knows me anymore. 

Thanks for listening, it was about time I did this. Having this down I hope will help me realize where I came from and where I'm going. I am disgraced about my four years at college and hope to just bridge the gap from the person I was in high school to the person I am now.

Love and respect to you all and good luck in your journeys."

I finally got my bachelor's degree in the scientific field last summer, but I decided I didn't want to continue in that direction. One very promising and obvious master I could choose was one that combines science and business. 

The first year consists of an 9 month internship I'm running at a science department at the university I'm at, one course and some presentations/report I have to do. 

The second year consists of business related courses, like business economics and finance, and a half-year internship at a business/institute, preferably with a link to science. 

I'm really looking forward to have some practical courses and to acquire skills that gives me a broad choice of a future job, but my academic scientific skills seems to falter: I don't seem to be able to keep up with the level that they're asking from me. 

I'm currently 4 months into my science internship, and it has it ups and downs: I'm pretty sensitive to winter depressions, which had lowered my motivation and performance, and I'm horrible at giving presentations in front of people whom I know that are better educated on the subject that I'm presenting about. After overcoming these hurdles, I got a small boost in motivation, but now I'm suddenly confronted about my underleveled performance. 
It really starts to demotivate me. I also don't seem to be able to mingle with the people there, making it a hostile environment to me. I'm also starting to look around for job openings as a back up in case I decide to drop out, which also doesn't increase my motivation to go on. I'm also not aspiring to get a job that requires an academic education or to a position I can't work myself up to. 
I've had experience with leadership functions, finance, creative/innovative thinking and getting the job done, and I can say I've got a broad skillset, able to learn new skills up to a very functional level (just not able to get it up to an academic scientific level), so I don't think I'm a worthless asset. 

I tried talking to an adviser, but he didn't really help me, just said I have to persevere. I was thinking to go to a psychologist to deal with the motivation issue, but that seemed futile, seeing my current feelings about the matter. 
I'm also scared to tell my parents about these thoughts, although lately they seem to have softened up on this matter due other relatives having trouble with school. 

What should I do?

tl;dnr: Finished scientific bachelor, started science/business master, don't have to motivation for the science part, want to stop and start working. "

Every single one of them required experience in my hour long search.  Every, single, one.  I understand internships are a good way to get some experience, but this is a tough option.  I financial can't intern too far away.  I live in a part of the country that doesn't have a lot of internship opportunities, and I have a long term girlfriend that wouldn't be stoked about me disappearing for 3 months over the summer.

Am I just aiming too high?  Do most college grads not land programming jobs, software development jobs, etc. out of college?  Do I have to land in a part of the company for which I am over-qualified (in theory) and uninterested in order to work my way up to a position I am interested in?

185dle,2,2013-02-08,I[M21] am unsure if I should leave my GF[F21] of four years because of my identity crisis.,tornbtwheartandbrain,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/185dle/im21_am_unsure_if_i_should_leave_my_gff21_of_four/,"Warning: this will be a lot of text. **A lot**. TL;DR at bottom but it doesn't really do it justice.


Background: My girlfriend and I are both 21, she is in her senior year of college and I am in my junior year. We have been dating for 4 years starting senior year of high school. She is my best friend since preteens. This is my first relationship ever and she considers this the first serious relationship. She has no doubts in the relationship and have spoken of marriage and kids. I thought I had no doubts too but recently my thoughts have changed. We are in a long distance relationship and we see each other on every break and at least once a month. It used to be whether she was away or with me, I was happy. However over the past year, I felt more like the more she was away, the less happy I got. We talk every night and communicate often. We had our ups and downs but for the most part have gotten over most of it.


However, recently I have been depressed. There are a lot of reasons for this. First, I went to a junior college before transferring to a university. I am an introvert so making friends is really difficult for me. Since the transition, I have been more stressed and have no close friends. There are a few but I do not hang out with them often. I also commute to school a long ways (due to financial reasons), so I can't really meet new people per say. This is important because I basically depend on her for social interaction. So recently, I decided I need friends when I realized I don't know who I am. I have no vested interest at all. I like a few things but are not into them. As she describes, the only hobby I have is running, which I consider a chore to stay fit. I feel like I gave up every I was for her. I have no idea who I am anymore.


What do I mean when I say I gave up everything for her? When I was in high school, I was pretty much a nerd. I loved math and physics. I loved watching tv shows and every episode often. I loved watching every movie that came out. I loved playing video games. I was interested in cars so much that I wanted to work on my own. I had a pretty close circle of friends. Then, when we became an item that all slowly went away. First were the friends. This was entirely my fault. I paid so much attention to her because she wanted it and my friends and I drifted. Soon, we graduated and we didn't hear from each other again. I even rarely saw my cousin who I grew up with and is a brother to me. Interestingly he warned me that she was changing me and I needed to be myself and get to know myself better.


My girlfriend and I talk a lot on the phone when we were young since I didn't have texting. I loved playing video games and was somewhat addicted. I would talk to her while playing on the phone. Of course attention shifted from her to video games so she got angry. She wanted me to stop playing while on the phone. So I did. But sometimes I told her I wanted to play instead of hanging out with her all the time. She was visibly upset a lot by it. So, I quit. Not completely her fault as by this time college was starting so I was like, fuck it need to study anyways.


So I spent most of my time watching tv shows and movies and caught up on everything. This became basically my new and only hobby. However, when I was with her, she didn't want to watch certain shows that I loved (stuff like burn notice, community, and others). So slowly I would watch these on my own time, which was very little. Near the beginning of our relationship, since she moved to another state for college, she was lonely and leaned on me to support her so I did. We spent a lot of time on the phone, sometimes not really talking but just on the phone. I thought, okay, she needs me, I'll just watch it later. Later never came, now I watch only a few certain shows that we both enjoy only. We must watch at the same time too or else she'd be upset. Same with movies. But within the last year, when she made a lot of close friends, she would go see movies I would want to watch it without me and told me about later the night when we talk on the phone. She suddenly didn't make a big deal out of it anymore. I decided it wasn't a big deal, she could do that and I didn't care too much. When I have time I'd watch it later or so I thought.


On to friends. When I went to my first college, I eventually made friends. However, she was always mad if they were girls. She trusted me and knew I value loyalty a lot but she does have a jealous side. So she would visibly show she was upset on the phone when the subject came up. Even if I was hanging around them alone at school or gave them a ride. I would never cheat and she knew that. That's fine I thought, I can deal without having girls as friends or put them at a distance, no big deal. However, at the beginning she had a problem with me spending too much time with my guy friends too. Granted she didn't have much friends at the time, she wanted to talk and hang out with me even though it was only on the phone. Eventually she accepted it was healthy and I should be more social. But the damage was done. I decided I rather make her happy and spend more time with her than too much at school or with friends. This sadly included my cousin and sometimes family. When she was home on the weekends, she basically expected I'd be there early to nap with her and leave to go home at my curfew (I live at home and yes I still have a curfew). Basically couldnt leave her side. This meant that every time my best friend cousin or my family asked me to go out with them, I would turn them down cause I knew it would make her happy if I stayed with her. She liked this better because she would rather spend alone time with me instead of with family unless one or both our parents complained. Then we would hangout with them together. However, I always noticed it was always more times with her family then mine. That is part my fault too since I didn't fight it. I was also actively involved in school at that time. I volunteered a lot and got into internships over the summer. I eventually quit my volunteering because she wanted me to stay with her all the time (it was only once a week for 4 hours). I couldn't quit my internship though so I brought her along. She was still alittle upset by this even though she understood this was for my career. 


Then, there's sex. Sex is great and we are both givers for the most part. There was a lot of rough patches as she didn't want to try the things I wanted (no details cause she is very insecure about this). For some reason I cared a lot about this, I really wanted to push this even though I knew she was uncomfortable with it. Eventually, I got my sanity back and stopped pushing. I was more depressed as I felt I had nothing. I didn't feel appreciated. I told her how I felt like she didn't love me since I would do anything for her (which is true) until she eventually gave in. (Yeah I was an asshole at that moment, not proud). Even when she did, I didn't push it any further. I realized I was being a jerk and stopped asking her altogether for any of it. I was fine with the sex anyways. But ever since she ridiculed me about my preferences I was no longer comfortable with telling her any of my desires anymore. Also, I thought, doesn't matter as I'm never doing any of it again. I felt too guilty after allowing her to go through with giving me what I wanted.


Other misc. stuff: She always hinted at changing my wardrobe but my old one didn't really bother her either. It was only when my cousin changed his wardrobe did I change mine. I asked her advice and soon she was picking out my wardrobe. I let her basically go wild and I didn't object. I like my wardrobe now but it has a lot to do with my cousin and her influence. Also, my weight was getting out of control. I was always self conscious about my weight. She told me one day I was chubby and that she loved it but would be nice if I was healthier. Being me, I wanted to look good for her. Set a goal and went from size 33-34 to a 31 now. Huge change. If she wanted to change me I thought it was fine. It was all to make her happy anyways. Anything about my appearance she wanted to change or suggested, I would act on it immediately. Any attitude change she wanted, I acted on it immediately. However, if I ever criticized how she dressed or what to do with her appearance she got offended at first. Now she's okay with it but she drags it out and I believe makes excuses. For example, I was always attracted to blondes, asked if she would ever dye her hair blonde. She said no at first since she has a stigma attached to it (her dad also always believed she should be herself anyways). Then she said she would but only when she was out of her parents house since they would be super upset by it. I told that's fine I didn't mind. I also realized she was right, I shouldn't have asked her to change herself. So I dropped the issue altogether. I used to make a lot of money before I transferred to a university (relatively for a college student). Pretty much all of my money spent on her. I can honestly not remember the last object I bought for myself in the last year or even two. I think the last time I bought something for myself was Starcraft 2 besides food. Every penny I have earned went to buying her gifts (bags, iPad, clothes, etc), going on dates, or big trips like Disneyland, basically everything she ever wanted. Material objects never mattered to me (grew up poor, learned to cherish whatever I had) so she usually gave me sentimental gifts which I loved. However, some of the things I have hinted at wanting, she never did (things mentioned above).


The future seems blurry as well. As of now, it seems like I will have to go out of my state to attend medical school. However, she wants to come back home. She says she will go wherever I go but I feel bad of I have to take her away from home. Although she will be home my senior year and have time to spend with my family and hers, I don't know if she'll want to leave after that.


She is in no way a bad person. She is the most caring, considerate, cute person I have ever met although she can be bratty and selfish sometimes. She saved me from depression before and suicide (I know it's wrong now but I was an awkward high schooler and thought the world was over because nobody loved me, plus some issues with step-parent). As she got more mature, she was has gotten a lot better and tries to urge me to get back my social and personal life. She suggested I meet new people and get a different hobby. She even learns to cook, clean, do laundry, and bake because she feels like she needs to make up for it and since she believes we will be married one day. But honestly don't feel like I can do any of it. I am still in the mindset of making her happy regardless of cost. That all I need is to make her happy. To be honest, I think I would be perfectly fine living the rest of my life with her and making her happy even if it hurts and depresses me and I have nothing. It does make me very happy that she is happy, it is only when I am alone with my thoughts I get this depressed.


On top of this, I'm in college still. Hormones are raging. I see girls I feel much more attractive too (physically as I don't know them, but I do reserve that my girlfriend is beautiful in my eyes). I am essentially very lonely and have no one to confide in. My best friend (cousin) is a reservist and is currently deployed. Stress is high and time is running out. I'm not afraid to be alone but I am afraid I'll never be able to be with her if I leave. Afraid I won't meet someone else, let alone someone as fantastic as her.


I feel like I have lost my identity and don't know if I can get it back if I am with her. My brain says, in order to love someone, you have to be confident, love yourself, and be yourself. You have to have an identity that is not based on her and her influence. You have been sheltered and comfortable too long, haven't experienced life in any extent and need to do some self discovery. If it is meant to be, you guys will make it work after you have found yourself. At the same time, my heart says she is the one. No one else gets you like her, she is your best friend, you have a great relationship with no current problems, why so negative and want to leave? You'll never be as happy as you are when you are with her. Why break two hearts when you are happy? This will destroy both your families. You made a commitment and shouldn't go back on it (parents divorced), you're a man of your word. Love and loyalty are of the upmost importance. You love and care for her, what's more important than that? I am so torn. I have had little to no sleep for the last week being heartbroken.


So wise people of reddit, what should I do? What are your perspectives?


Side Note: sorry for long wall of text but I think it will give the full and better picture. Thanks for staying if you made it this far. If there is anything else you need, feel free to ask as I just spent the last 2 hours writing this and bound to have left something out. Also, sorry for the rant.


**TL;DR I am having an identity crisis as the last four years have been revolved around my girlfriend, which I love, but am very unhappy and can't shake being depressed. Should I break up with her to find myself?**

A post-doc I met during a summer internship is now involved in clinical research at one the VA hospitals. She loves her job and encouraged me to explore opportunities at my level.  

Because I am a pharmaceutical chemistry major, I have a decent understanding of clinical trials, drug discovery/development, and FDA regulations. However, I hear that clinical research is different from the bench work I am used to. What does a day in the life of a clinical research assistant look like? Also, are there differences between clinical research at hospitals vs. private companies? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

* Code that goes on rockets and spacecraft.
* Code that supports the design and manufacturing process of rockets and spacecraft.

We work on everything from large-scale web applications to tiny embedded computing platforms.  We build tech stacks on C#/MVC4/EF/MSSQL via REST to Javascript/Knockout/Handlebars/LESS, C++/Embedded Linux, Python, LabVIEW… which all together enables us to build, launch, and monitor stuff that goes to space.


**Some videos of our recent work:**

http://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ



**Proof:**

http://imgur.com/bl8dlZ2

Edit: Poor Dan, everyone knows he was photo-shopped. Don't close your eyes next time! 

Edit 2 : We've been getting a lot of questions about how C#/MVC/etc have to do with rockets. They don't. At SpaceX we have 4 separate software teams:

1.  The Flight Software team is about 35 people.  We write all the code for Falcon 9, Grasshopper, and Dragon applications; and do the core platform work, also on those vehicles; we also write simulation software; test the flight code; write the communications and analysis software, deployed in our ground stations.  We also work in Mission Control to support active missions.

2. The Enterprise Information Systems team builds the internal software systems that makes spacex run. We wear many hats, but the flagship product we develop and release is an internal web application that nearly every person in the company uses. This includes the people that are creating purchase orders and filling our part inventory, engineers creating designs and work orders with those parts, technicians on the floor clocking in and seeing what today's work will be per those designs...and literally everything in between. There are commercially available products that do this but ours kicks major ass! SpaceX is transforming from a research and engineering company into a manufacturing one - which is critical to our success - and our team is on the forefront of making that happen. We leverage C#/MVC4/EF/SQL; Javascript/Knockout/Handlebars/LESS/etc and a super sexy REST API.

3. The Ground Software team is about 9 people. We primarily code in LabVIEW.  We develop the GUIs used in Mission and Launch control, for engineers and operators to monitor vehicle telemetry and command the rocket, spacecraft, and pad support equipment.  We are pushing high bandwidth data around a highly distributed system and implementing complex user interfaces with strict requirements to ensure operators can control and evaluate spacecraft in a timely manner.

4. The Avionics Test team works with the avionics hardware designers to write software for testing.  We catch problems with the hardware early; when it's time for integration and testing with flight software it better be a working unit.  The main objective is to write very comprehensive and robust software to be able to automate finding issues with the hardware at high volume.  The software usually runs during mechanical environmental tests.

Edit 3: Yes, we are doing a ton of hiring for these software positions that we have been talking about today. Interns and New Grads too! 

Edit 4: Thank you so much everyone! This is ending but most of the group will be back at 2:00pmPST to answer more questions. 

Edit 5: ...and we're back! Engineers from each of our engineering teams are present. Let us catch up a bit and start swering again (probably be about 5 minutes).

For all open software related positions, please go to http://www.spacex.com/software.php

**Edit 6: Thank you so much Reddit! This was a ton of fun. To all those asking about internships and employment, our suggestion is to apply online. Your resume will definitely get read. To all the students out there, GL with your midterms coming up and stick at it. Try and work on some side projects and get as much practical experience coding as possible before graduating. Happy Friday everyone!**

I spent my days home alone looking for someone to take me in. Someone to give me an unpayed internship.

I got one job. One job for one day. It was awesome. I did my best. You were pleased. You told everyone at the office you were impressed. I got to come in 3 more times during 2 weeks. You said you loved how I acted. You hired me when no one else would.

You gave me a future, you took me in and gave me a purpose. You're only 10 years older than me, but you have been more than my boss. You have been my role model. I have cut down on my weed smoking just to make you proud of me, to show the world that you were correct. I'm good for something.

I have worked for you for 1 year now. I have made misstakes but you always shrugged it of and told me to learn from it.

Right before you left the office for the last time today you came to me. You told me that you're proud of me and that you knew you did the right thing when you hired me and that when I'm ready to face the world I will take it by storm.

You took me in when no one else wanted to. I will probably never tell you this but you have probably saved my life. In more ways than one.

I'm sitting at the office place you have given me when everyone else has left for the weekend and I am silently crying. I will miss you."

I have a bachelor's in a not totally unrelated field (urban studies and planning) and am wondering what I need to do to ensure that I am accepted to an M.A. program in interior design. I was thinking of doing this:

- Taking on a minor in studio art
- Going for an Architecture and Interior Design course certificate at Parsons here in NYC

In addition, I have work experience on the development team of a high end real estate development and construction company. Also, don't know if they look upon this favorably but I lived and worked abroad for a number of years. I am hoping that a minor in studio art + a 6 class course in interior design at Parsons will give me enough for a portfolio which will at the very least open the door for an internship or *anything*.

My drawing skills are very good. I have always been great at freehand drawing, painting, etc. I also make furniture and light fixtures from scratch with my brother. Should I include these?

Do I have a shot at all? I am *dying* to study interior design and don't want to get another bachelor's.

I am a 3rd year International Media and Entertainment Management student from Europe. In my 4th year (January 2014) I should start writing my bachelor thesis on a marketing topic of my choice while working/doing research in a company. This would be my 2nd and final internship.

As I am very passionate about online marketing and digital marketing trends (which I also blog about), I really want to do some research in mobile marketing (mobile ecommerce). The thing is that I really don't know where I should start looking.


So, having one year left to find an internship, I had the idea to go for the giant companies: Amazon, Ebay, Facebook, Google and others.
My questions to you:

1.	Do you think it is a good idea to do research/ an internship in such big companies?

2.	Where should I start looking? I know that companies like this rarely reply to emails about positions, which are not advertised...

Thank you very much guys.

Cheers, D.

184e6v,31,2013-02-08,[Dead Space 2] A Business Man,Hugs_of_Moose,LifeasanNPC,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeasanNPC/comments/184e6v/dead_space_2_a_business_man/,"I… I don’t know what to do. I’m a business man, a doer, I make the world go around and yet here I am curled up on the ground staring at a door of my apartment, listening to the muffled sounds of men and woman being slaughtered by those god-damn things! How I survived this long I don’t know. I saw that poor intern girl get cut to pieces right before my very eyes! I didn’t know what to do than either. I just stood there in shock, every cell in me frozen. My mind seemed to be twisting in on its self from exposure to such an instant upheaval of reality. It was searching for an explanation, a foot hold, anything that would work as a jumping point to process this new world. But there was nothing. At one point I managed to look away from her, only to see more of the beasts clumsily charging towards me, taking down whoever was unlucky enough to be within reach of their dreadful blades of bone and flesh. 

I looked down again at the girl, but upon seeing nothing but a mass of red pulp where she had laid I thought she managed to get away. However, the surge of optimism I felt could not have left me any quicker. Upon closer inspection I realized the red pulp I was staring at was her. With that my mind gained its foothold. I was out of that office building and headed for my home, the only place my feet seemed willing to take me.

Running down the blood drenched corridors of that city was surreal. It was as if someone had taken a planetary-sized shipment of paint and started spraying it with a hose on every surface. In the consumer district the doorways and windows of restaurants and shops where piled with bodies. As I ran past these places I’d occasionally slip in pools of blood which had made the metallic ground slick. 

I had almost reached the elevator that would take me from the consumer district to my apartment complex when I noticed something that even now perturbs me. The area was deserted. I was the only living being, man or beast. I stopped running and my eyes started darting around, from shop to shop, window to window, all drenched in red and filled with bodies. In the distance I could hear more people fall to the beasts, and yet here I was, in the most heavily populated area in this sector of the station, absolutely alone. I just stood there; my mind slowly began to twist again. It felt as though I was back at the office, staring at the intern girl being ripped apart by the beasts. I could see her clearly before me, an angelic face staring right at me with a comforting smile. Even the beast that was attacking her seemed to be at peace, each lunge of its blades piercing her side only to have the wound healed the moment the blade left her body; every appendage torn off her fragile figure instantly reattaching only to be torn off again. The beast seemed joyful for having found a companion to perpetually slaughter.

Then I heard a bird. Than another, and yet another until it sounded as if behind me an entire flock of crows had descended upon the consumer district to pick at the corpses. I remained still, afraid that my movement might scare them off, such beautiful creatures crows are. I was brought back to text books I had read as child about the forests of Earth, though I had never actually seen one myself. I had been breed and raised for the city, business was my game, even at a young age, and I never had time for such distractions; though I had always been curious. Eventually I turned, and expecting to see trees my mind completely twisted in on its self upon the sight I beheld instead. I could not understand why the crows looked and behaved so strangely. It was as if they were made of flesh and shaped like two wings without a body. They flew from corpse to corpse, holding them with hand-like talons and a beak that devoured them whole. They would engulf a corpse, and drop it again; moving on to the next corpse, and so on and so on. And after a moment, the dropped corpses would begin to move.
 
These were no crows, they were doves. They were bringing life back to this dead district. 

One approached me, and I let down my defenses. I saw in the wings of flesh the angelic face of the intern girl, however, this time the beast that was over her had a much more human face. The bird crept closer to me, and closer yet, until I could make out the image of the beasts on its wings. It was me. My hands knew nothing but the feeling of warm blood washing down the blades that had replaced my arms. My mind knew nothing but the sweet serenity of oneness with those whose bodies had been perfected along with mine. 

The dove was upon me, engulfing me, and for an instant I let it do its will. And I would have allowed it to change me into one of them had I not remembered the red pulp the beast had turned the intern girl into after its slaughter. My mind once again found its foot hold. Now before me there was no angelic face promising me an eternity, but only the fleshy monster wrapping its self around my head, blood drenched tentacles attempting to force me to submit. 

My hands clawed at the fleshy creature; however, I could get no hold on it. I could feel my body beginning to change, but I could not give up. Even as I sit here in fear, after having thought over the event many times, I do not know what strength of mind possessed me to continue to fight the creature's grasp. There was no hope and I knew it just as much as I know it now. But everything in me fought, almost to the death. 

A bright blast of energy exploded through my fleshy mask, and through the bits of matter and blood dripping from my face I could make out a man in a standard engineering suit, wielding a plasma cutter. He ran up to me, picked me up by the arm and yelled at me to run for it. He took off for the elevator, leaving me shell shocked. I looked down the streets of the district and saw just how many of these beasts had been created, and how many more were still to come. I turned toward the elevator and saw him beckoning for me to join him. I ran the few blocks I had left and gazed backwards, only half-aware, at the hundreds of beasts coming our way.

The doors closed and I pushed the button that would take me to my floor. I looked at the engineer; he was having a frantic conversation with someone, perhaps another engineer. Maybe they were trying to keep life support systems going. It seemed like a noble quest, one fitting of a man of such intelligence who chooses to serve the rest of society rather than rule it. There’s likely not much point in keeping this city alive, but a noble quest none the less.

 I did not speak for fear of interrupting his conversation and train of thought. Once the elevator reached my floor I got off. The engineer stayed behind, hit another button and nodded towards me before the doors closed.

I made my way to my apartment, but before the door opened I sat down. I’ve been staring at my door ever since. I’m tired, and even though the other side of that door has a bed; I’m too afraid to sleep. I’m hungry, and even though the other side of the door has food; I’m too sick to eat. I’m lonely, and even though the other side of that door has pictures of me and an intern girl, who I raised from birth, who I watched grow up; I’m too heartbroken to remember any of it.

**Overview**

We have been gathering information, been doing market research, as well as developing our website for well over a year now and it's finally here (we launched 2 days ago). 

Basically, our website www.UniLooped.com, is a site for college students to use as a classifieds specifically for their campus. It can be used to buy/sell things like textbooks (allowing students to buy &amp; sell from one-another vs getting screwed over at the bookstore or buying online), find housing on and/or off campus, scholarships, tutoring help, buying a futon for you dorm, etc. We will even be actively seeking employers to post jobs and internships on school-specific job boards so that our users can hopefully land employment upon graduation. Being college students ourselves we know how important that can be.

**Help Us!**

Basically, there's a lot our website offers and it's all completely free. We need help with ideas on how to gain exposure and to actually get users to post on the site. The problem we foresee is that users will check out the site, see that there isn't much already there, not post, then leave and never return. How do we get users to post on a brand new, unproven website?

Also - any tips on how to gain Facebook &amp; Twitter followers quickly? We feel like if we can get a good start in the social media realm, the better off we will be.

I'm debating between a Biology or a Biochemistry degree (there is very little actual difference in course load at my university) while taking a pre-med curriculum. I have enough room to fit in a minor and computer science seemed like a natural choice with my interests. I have also really been wanting a backup in case medical school doesn't pan out, especially since the job market for bio majors doesn't look too good.

However, I don't even know if I could enter the field of computer programming or get internships with just a minor unless I devote myself to becoming competitive outside of school. The minor is 6 courses long so it eats up quite a bit of my schedule for my college years. I could possibly finish my minor at earliest junior year (without giving up too much in my major early on because I need to remain competitive on the MCAT).

It makes me think, while trying to be competitive for medical schools, could I turn my computer science minor into a possible backup career plan? I'm unsure of the ability to get any internships with only 6 CS courses under my belt. The only thing I could think of is maybe mixing the CS and the Bio/Chem and trying to find something at a lab or go back to school and get another degree in CS. I know experience trumps degree but with neither it seems like I would be in the same boat as if I didn't get a minor in CS."

I got to have a great conversation with a few guys from Riot today. They were so enthusiastic for the game and gave me great tips on getting an internship and playing the game. Riot was one of the most down to earth companies at the fair.

So to all my aspiring college-applying League pals, remember that Riot recruits from here and that Championships are held across the street from my dorm!"

I'm an engineering student and have to use my laptop to do research analysis as well as remote in for my internship which is pretty much all coding.

Budget range: $1500 max
Purpose: needed for some data processing and coding (I mainly do R and Matlab)
Screen size: I currently have a 17"" screen and it's really annoying so I'm looking for a 13-15"" that's easily portable 
OS: Windows 7 preferably, Linux will work, although Macs aren't out of the question
 Performance requirements: As I've said, I do a lot of coding and CAD so as long as it won't freeze up doing that it won't be an issue
Brand preference: My family has always been Dell but I'm willing to switch due to the shitty state that my current laptop has deteriorated to.
Additional Stuff: Long battery life, Build quality, USB, ethernet, HDMI

Thanks so much!"

I had to quit because it was unpaid and cost me 50$+ a week that I didn't have to drive to it. They never had an opening and I got through whatever work they had piled up for me to do, so towards the end I was going there to do and get paid nothing. I decided to leave and go back to school until something better came along.

They are now hiring at their entry level position and I applied for it. The resumes are sent to the human resources department as far as I can tell and not directly to my old office. Should I also e-mail my old supervisor and tell him to lookout for it or is that too much? I haven't talked to him since the internship. However, as far as I know, I was well liked around the office and they always complimented on my work ethic so I don't think he has any ill will towards me.

Any tips or suggestions would be helpful, thanks!"

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[ of all, I want to extend my sincerest thanks for making it easy to understand the complicated corruption at the highest levels of our political system. I can honestly say that your reporting is the main reason I still have a print subscription to Rolling Stone. Thank you very much and keep it up.  Basically my question is this: What can be done about it?  What do you think is the *ONE* thing that the government needs to do to stem the tide of corruption and start fixing things?  What do you think the average American can do to help change things for the better?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8azir4?context=5)|Hello, 3rdCulture. A great question that I struggle with a lot -- normally, ""What do we do about it?"" isn't really the province of reporters like me. But in terms of the stuff I cover, the obvious thing that needs to be done is that the banks need to be broken up; all of our major corruption problems stem from the Too-Big-To-Fail issue. How we accomplish that is of course problematic. There are two ways it gets done, legislatively and through prosecutions, i.e. the DOJ could charge a bank with something and then make breaking itself up a condition of its settlement. Or the state could legislate changes like the Brown-Kaufman amendment. Either way we need to elect people who recognize the problem and are willing to take those steps. Sentiment for this is growing. 
[“You've now written two well informed and well documented columns harshly critical of SEC Chair nominee Mary Jo White. But Neil Barofsky, author of “Bailout”, former Special Inspector General of TARP and himself hardly a friend of the Too Big To Fail spoke glowingly about Ms. White when her nomination was announced by the President. Any sense of why you two differ so strongly on this nomination? Thank you for your time.”](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8azhz4?context=5)|Gruasty, great question. Neil and I talked about that just the other day. He knows Mary Jo, worked with her, she actually hired him if I'm not mistaken. And I trust his judgement about pretty much everything. So this has been confusing to me. One thing we talked about is that in most cases, the switch she's making, from defending Wall Street for millions to policing it, doesn't really work. But he believes she's in the small minority of people who can pull it off. We'll see. I like Neil a lot, he's an honest person, hope he's right. 
[Did you really throw your coffee at Vanity Fair's James Verin when he said he didn't like your book?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8azl74?context=5)|I absolutely did throw coffee at James Verini, and it had nothing to do with him not liking my book. Let's leave it at that for now. I'll tell the full story someday. 
[Matt, you lived in Russia for a while and wrote about and did a lot of interesting and intense things, like messing with the mob, checking out Siberian prisons, and partying pretty hard. Russia is a place where they kill journalists for merely existing, so my question is: how did you not die? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8aznqo?context=5)|Purely by accident. Honestly, there were some close calls. A lot of bad decisions while I was there, many of them under the influence. One very funny story I've never told: I once worked with a Russian paper called ""Stringer"" to wiretap Alexander Voloshin, Putin's chief of staff. We published a week of his phone calls. I was so afraid of the consequences, I stayed out of the country when we published. Upon my return I was detained at the airport for 10 hours. I thought I was going to jail for life. In fact, the Russians were simply concerned that the lamination on my passport was coming up in one corner. They thought my passport was fake. Once they reached the embassy, they let me go. But that was one scary 10 hours. 
[Did you ever meet Hunter s. Thompson? I know it's been quite a while since he worked for rolling stone. Jw.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b0bjn?context=5)|Years ago, when I was in my twenties, I was asked by a book publishing company to edit an anthology of ""Gonzo Journalism."" Not long into the project I realized there was no such thing as ""Gonzo Journalism"" as a genre per se, it just meant ""written by Hunter Thompson."" But I was broke and needed the job. So I called Hunter to ask him what he thought. He said, ""That's a shitty assignment."" I told him I probably agreed. He said, ""How badly do you need the money?"" I said, ""Badly."" He said, ""Well, good luck, but I'm not going to help you with it. No offense."" I said none taken and that was it. That was the only time I ever talked to Hunter. It was a funny call, though. 
[Obama just mentioned new rules for taxing carried interest, do you think anything will be done? Do you see him making any drastic changes to Wall St. in his second term?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8azjdm?context=5)|Benjamin, hey, thanks for the question, this is a good one to start with. This AMA thing is wild BTW, thanks for being here. On carried interest, don't expect changes. Politics almost annually propose repealing that break. Changes never actually get made -- usually the threat is used as leverage to secure something else they really want. I would bet my house that you won't see major changes to that law. 
[Matt, a line of yours is lodged in my head: ""Organized greed always defeats disorganized democracy."" Unfortunately, while the animosity of Occupy Wall Street is still strong in early 2013, the disorganization of the movement might be even stronger.  So, if you were in charge of Occupy Wall Street, what single achievable goal would you (re\)organize the movement around?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8azmp3?context=5)|Again, to repeat, breaking up the banks is the big thing. That should be the Holy Grail of activist goals. Everything flows from the TBTF problem. If that can be accomplished, we're off and running. And it's not farfetched. There are a lot of people even in DC coming around to the idea. 
[Matt, huge fan of your writing. In some bizarro alternative universe, you are left as supreme dictator of the USA, but you only get a month, and any laws you implement are now as good as scripture. What are some of the things you do? What would be the first thing you'd fix and how? Thanks. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8azyg8?context=5)|First of all, I'd want my official title to be ""Interior Minister."" I seem to recall that Ivan the Terrible once had a giant frying pan built so that he could roast the captives from a battle in Pskov. The frying supposedly was done in Red Square. I think I might try that with the cast of ""Jersey Shore.""
[Matt, would you ever tip your hat into the political ring? Please think about it, I mean, look what happened for Elizabeth Warren! I think you would have a major populist pull.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8azpnb?context=5)|I wouldn't last 10 seconds as a politician. It's a very hard job with a completely different skillset from journalism. Plus, I'm totally unelectable... if you look at some of the early eXile issues, I couldn't win a county dogcatcher race with all that in my past. I wouldn't vote for me. 
[You're often pretty cynical about politics and society from your writing. Having worked in DC politics/journalism for the past 4 years, I often just want to get out. What gives you hope? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8azkz8?context=5)|I get accused of being cynical a lot. I would say I'm the opposite of a cynic. A cynic is someone who recognizes that nothing changes. If I didn't think changing things was possible, I wouldn't be such a long-winded bore about the problems.
 |I think writers like David Brooks and Tom Friedman are cynics, even though superficially they're a lot more positive than I am. 
[A lot of people, myself included, are big fans of your writing as a journalist. Whose work do you try to read on a regular basis?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8azkvj?context=5)|I read a lot of odd stuff on the internet. I check on Zero Hedge pretty regularly, love Jeremy Scahill, I read Glenn Greenwald. Drew Magary is my favorite sportswriter. Lawrence Wright is cool (The Looming Tower was fantastic). I reread Seymour Hersh's old books a lot -- ""The Price of Power"" is always in my bathroom...
 |Also read Bill Simmons on sports obviously, we're both from Boston, so there's a mutual-suffering factor there. EDIT: Sorry, I keep forgetting we won all those championships in the last decade. Hard to explain but a Boston sports fan always feels like he's suffering even when he should actually be thanking God on a daily basis that he doesn't live in Cleveland.
[How do you stay refreshed mentally? Does reporting the things that makes me rage quit reading the news for the day give you the lift you need to continue in itself, or do you find hobbies or a different way of recharging and reporting on more?  If I can't even read Greenwald then Taibbi in the same day because I get so outraged, how can you guys write it every day?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b0dmp?context=5)|Chainsaw, I keep my focus extremely narrow and try to avoid upsetting things when I'm not working. That's why I don't even read much about things like the drone attacks or torture -- my head would explode. On the other hand, I could write ten books about the NFL draft. 
[I was wondering if there was a legal reason the SEC or other financial enforcement agencies cannot use some of the settlement/court decision money for their operating budgets, as police do. I don't agree with the incentives law enforcement has to pursue the drug war, but if its happening all the time why should the SEC or FDIC ever have budget problems, wouldn't they be one of the most ""profitable"" branches of government?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8azs3u?context=5)|I believe last year the government claimed it made 15 dollars in fines for every one it spent on enforcement. I'm not sure why there should be a resources problem when it comes to policing Wall Street, big Pharma (which had three monster settlements last year including Abbott and GSK). We have a gazillion police patrolling the streets in bad neighborhoods in all our major cities, where there is very little potential for major economic damage to be done, while there are, what, 1000 SEC agents policing the whole country? There's no reason it should be that way. 
[Thanks for taking the time to pay us a visit, and for your insightful and entertaining work in *Rolling Stone*.  If you were an activist, rather than a writer, what do you think you would be working on now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8azjoq?context=5)|The thing is, I'm not an activist. One thing people don't realize is that my primary attraction to the subject matter I write about is that it's so interesting from a literary point of view -- I mean the corruption is just so dark and disgusting, there's something almost humorous about it, I'm very attracted to it as a writer. I also love the labyrinthine complexity of the scams. It's kind of the perfect subject for me. On another level, it outrages my social conscience, but that's secondary, if I'm being honest. So do a lot of other things -- I mean, that business yesterday of the government giving itself the power to extralegally assassinate without evidence is monstrous. As an activist, there's no shortage of crazy things to fight against. But to me, the most interesting problem is this financial cartel issue. 
[Have you ever received a refutation of an account of events you given, specifically from those within finance? I read both your work and mainstream financial publications.  As I am sure you're aware, the authors of the latter do not hold the highest opinion of you or your work.  I am curious as to whether or not this ever plays out directly, or merely in the volley of articles back and forth?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b1nks?context=5)|I'm very often criticized by people on Wall Street, but I get just as many people from that community contacting me and helping me with what I do. A lot of what people take issue with, when they do criticize me, is the fact that I don't have a background in finance and I'm presuming to have opinions about things they think I don't really understand. But when you ask most of those critics to point out something I'm wrong about, usually what they're quibbling about is a conclusion, not a set of facts. So for instance, when I did my story on Goldman, I quoted a hedge fund guy who said that Goldman selling bad mortgage bonds while it was shorting them at the same time was a classic case of securities fraud – “the heart of securities fraud” was the quote. I had numerous people, like Megan McArdle for instance, jump down my throat about what an absurd notion that was. But it was a view that many people on Wall Street had – I got the idea from a millionaire hedge fund manager. Some people didn’t see anything wrong with what Goldman did, but I did and do. A year or so later, Goldman was facing a massive investigation by both the DOJ and the Senate for engaging in that very sort of activity.
[Stated plainly,  do the people you write about ever send hate mail?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b1nks?context=5)|Again, almost all of my sources are from the financial world. I’m obviously not going to come into a subject like this that’s so broad and complex and start making wild end-run calls about this or that. I’m listening to people on all sides of the equation and making a decision about whom to trust, whose point of view seems most valid. That’s what journalism is and you always do that, no matter what the subject is. With finance there is a very consistent criticism of the big banks and their misuse of government influence that I hear from all corners and the people who have this view are both very convincing personally and very consistent with each other. So that’s where this critique is coming from. I may not be an economist, but all journalists do what I do – listen to people, conduct interviews, and draw conclusions from what you hear.  
[After ""The Great Derangement"" was released, did any of the people you dealt with undercover in Texas find out about the book? Did any reach out to you/the fake you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8azge1?context=5)|Yes, they did reach out. Well, one of the characters did. I haven't been good about getting back to her. I know she's a big fan of Bill MAher, because I always hear from her anytime I do that show. 
[A common criticism of your work is that your colorful rhetoric detracts from your serious and substantive reporting.  Do you see any merit to that critique?  Do you feel the rhetoric is necessary to keep readers engaged?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b1k83?context=5)|I think without the color it would be very hard to get large numbers of people to read about credit default swaps and so on. It's a challenge from a writing point of view to creative a narrative about this world that makes the subject matter accessible to people who aren't into it naturally. Again, I find the crazily complex stuff these people dream up fascinating and I'm trying often in my work to let readers share vicariously in the excitement and wonder I feel in learning about it all. I'm sure some people think that detracts from the seriousness, but I feel pretty sure that rhetorically, it's all a net plus. 
[Hey Matt, any good behind the scenes stories from your early mornings on the Imus in the Morning show? I always enjoy your commentary with that crew.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8azlpf?context=5)|I love Don. He's always been great to me. One very funny thing is that he dependably reams me out about how much the titles of my books suck. When you see us chatting off camera in breaks, it's usually about that. 
[Hi Matt, I'm a sophomore at Bard College, and I was just curious as to what you thought of Bard as a school.  Also where did you live here anyways? Toasters or Tewks?!  Do you make regular visits to old man Botstein?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b0co7?context=5)|Hi Th0rsday. I lived in South Hall. Loved Bard, wrote an article last year about it. 
[If bankers were a particular type of sandwich, what type of sandwich would they be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b0ee5?context=5)|Not sure, but I think it would have both Haggis and farina as ingredients. 
[This is a weird question, but did you ever write a piece with a parenthetical about Battlestar Galactica bring one of your favourite shows of all time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b0d8m?context=5)|I definitely did not, because I watched my very first episode of it Monday night. I do like the show, though. I recognize a lot of actors from one of my other favorites, the Canadian cop show ""Da Vinci's Inquest.""
 |Can I ask why you ask? 
[You met me a little over a year ago in a book signing in Brighton right after you signed a magazine for three giggling teenage girls. I'm in that bearded leftist demographic. My question is: You are a regular critic of the entire system of finance, of wars, of lobbyists, and of stuff like Iraq war contracts, but you have never translated that criticism into one of capitalism generally. Indeed, you defend capitalism and assert that these kinds of things are perversions. Why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b1pdw?context=5)|I get that question a lot. My view on this is, if there's something fundamentally wrong with modern industrial capitalism, we'll find that out when we actually see it in practice. But when it comes to modern Wall Street, we don't have the data to make that assessment, because there's so much anti-competitive collusion and intermingling with government power. Anyway those larger questions -- what sort of economic system we should live in -- are kind of above my pay grade. 
[You tackle a lot of contentious issues with powerful people. Have you ever been afraid for your life because of a story you were looking into?  EDIT: Grammar.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b1y6r?context=5)|Never. When I worked in Russia, I had friends who were Russian reporters who really did have to worry about those things (in fact two acquaintances -- I won't go so far as to say they were friends, but I knew people like Anna Politkovskaya -- were killed). But someone like me only needs to worry about litigation. I really... I get that question a lot, and it seems to me that people misunderstand the risks of reporting in a country like ours. The way to defeat journalists in this country is to ignore them, not kill them. 
[Matt,  What is the single most thoroughly corrupt entity \[institution, person, practice\] you have come across during your career?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b10s7?context=5)|I had a Russian reporter friend, Leonid Krutakov, who was trying to trace some money that disappeared from the Russian treasury. He followed the cash from bank to bank, transfer to transfer, until one bank listed the destination of the next bank in line as an address on the outskirts of Moscow. Leonid found the address and it turned out not to be a bank at all, but an electrical exchange box on a telephone pole. I'm not sure how they effected the actual theft, but I remember the punch line was that somebody had transferred tens of millions of dollars to a telephone pole. That was pretty much the best corruption story I ever heard. The top 10 are probably all Russia stories. 
[What are the best and worst parts about being on the Bill Maher show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b1w2x?context=5)|That show is terrifying to do. Huge studio audience, huge TV audience, and you have to fight to get your comments in. Whatever people think about Bill, when you're on that set, you really appreciate how quick he is to keep that show flowing the way it does. 
[Matt, after reading Griftopia, it became even more obvious to me that right after the bubble burst, you somehow got the money (I'm assuming from Rolling Stone\) to travel as much as you needed to, and spend as much time as you needed to, to interview hundreds of people about it. That you were doing first-hand reporting, at a time when everybody else was just quoting press releases or (if they were really ambitious\) quoting what they heard on CSPAN. It's why yours is the #1 book I recommend on the subject.  But lately you haven't been doing as much of that; the sources you cite lately are (like the hacks back in 2008\) what your sources call you and tell you on the phone and what you see on TV. What would it take to shake loose some more travel expense money so you could do so more first-hand reporting? And if we did, who do you want to interview now that you can't afford the money or time to track down and spend time with?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b2qje?context=5)|I still travel a lot, as you'll see with my next book. But what you're describing has a lot more to do with time constraints, and age, and being married, than lack of funds. I don't have the ability to go spend weeks at a time in some faraway place anymore. 
[I used to intern at Democracy Now! and I met you once. You still writing that piece on ID's?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b1gey?context=5)|Yes, I remember you. That will be in my next book I think. 
[How did your father's connections help your journalism career?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b0v9d?context=5)|I should answer this, since it seems to come up a lot. My father was always supportive of me growing up. But he never once helped me get a job in journalism. My first gig in the business, with the Moscow Times, I actually got through family friends, a couple my parents knew in their college years who had worked with the Moscow Times editor in her previous job in Paris. After the Moscow Times, I worked at the eXile, which I started myself with Mark Ames. While at the eXile, Rolling Stone did a story about the eXile, which is how I met the editors there. So the only time anyone ever made a call for me was back when I was about 22 years old, and even that only got me the opportunity to submit freelance articles for the Moscow Times. Again, it's not that my father actively didn't help me -- he would have if I'd asked him to -- it just never came up. My father's an excellent TV reporter, he's really old school, and he taught me a lot, but our two businesses really don't intersect much.

Maybe I'm naive, but nobody kills journalists here. They just let them rant and rave and get drowned out by reality shows. Much cheaper!

All reporting contains a point of view. Even if you're writing in the third person in the New York Times, there's bias in which facts you choose to present, and in what tone you use, what's in the headline... I believe it's better to be up front about the bias and let readers see it.

Not going to make any excuses.  So Now 6 months after graduating I'm finding I keep getting rejected from jobs because of my low experience.  I have been unethically inflating my gpa to a 3.8 but find I'm still getting rejected :(  I only have a 1 year internship I did.  So I called up my 3 target schools and all agree it is fine for me to apply with the low work experience since it's at least one year pre or post grad.  My target schools are Columbia, Baruch, and Pace.  All require a fairly high Gre score.  So naturally I enrolled in Kaplan's 1200 dollar one month course to prepare myself, I study many hours each day, and I plan on taking the exam March 11th and then finishing up essays and recommendations so I can apply by the deadlines of April.  

Questions

1.  Should I just continue to apply for jobs instead of getting my MBA?

2.   Do I have any shot of getting into these competitive business schools?

Any feedback you guys can provide would be great appreciate it

*sidenote My family is pretty wealthy so money is really not a concern as far as how expensive an MBA can be my dad is taking care of the whole thing if I hopefully get accepted into a program."

I started my internship in November 2012 as a student and graduated in December 2012. I still hold the internship with a couple other people who have graduated as well. The company is fairly brand new..I believe they started in 2007-ish in the entertainment field so I don't believe they're profitable as of now. 

Since I was going to graduate in December, I told my company that I wouldn't be needing any school credit and asked about other compensation. They only thing I'm getting back is the money I'm spending for parking. It takes me at least an hour to get to my internship so it's been hard financially. I told my ""boss"" that I was going to graduate in December and asked them about compensation, but was told ""no, you'll only be compensated for parking"". 

I know these days it's hard to find internship that are paid and I've told myself countlessly that this is all for work experience and networking with industry professionals. It's been 3 months, no pay, and I'm still trying to find a full time job in the design industry. I've also been trying to find a part time job so I can intern &amp; work at the same time. 

Question is...is it illegal that the company is not paying me for the work I do for them as a graduated student? Should I let go of my position? Or, should I keep interning for the sake of experience?

[Hi Congressman McGovern - thanks for the AMA and for your efforts to scale back the Citizen United decision.  Can you tell us how we should interpret PAC contributions to your campaign? For example Norfolk Southern donate the maximum $10,000 to your 2012 campaign. Do they donate because they want access to you or do they donate because they believe in your ideology?  If a PAC donates the maximum $10,000 will they have greater access to you? Do they receive any special treatment when they want to discuss upcoming legislation? Do you think this system of pay-to-play also needs to be reformed?  How do the $10,000 contributions from Raytheon Co, Union Pacific Corp, CSX Corp and others effect the way you govern as a congressman? If these contributions have no effect on you, then why do these organizations take their time and money to donate in the first place?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/180lxh/i_am_congressman_jim_mcgovern_sponsor_of_two/c8ajsno?context=5)|It's a fair question.  I am not going to unilaterally disarm.  The system stinks, but it's the system we have if you want to run for office.  If you want to change it, I hope you'll join with me in the effort to change how we finance campaigns.
[How do you feel about marijuana legalization? Do you believe it will ever be legal in the United States on a federal level? I heard about a bill being introduced in Congress but people are saying it won't get very far. What are your thoughts on this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/180lxh/i_am_congressman_jim_mcgovern_sponsor_of_two/c8aitcp?context=5)|I'm looking at legislation that will likely be introduced.  Unclear in a Republican House how much traction it will get, but I'm open to considering it.
[Hi congressman Jim McGovern! Thank you for taking the time to do this AMA. What is your stance on gun control? Do you think stricter gun control laws should be put in place?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/180lxh/i_am_congressman_jim_mcgovern_sponsor_of_two/c8aic9j?context=5)|I favor universal background checks, assault weapons ban and legislation to prevent gun trafficking.  I'm hopeful we can at least get something done this year.
[How about term limits for the HoR and Senate?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/180lxh/i_am_congressman_jim_mcgovern_sponsor_of_two/c8aj06q?context=5)|Real campaign finance reform, so that we have a level playing field, is far preferable.  People ought to be able to decide who they want for as long as they want (or as short as they want).  I also support public financing of campaigns.
[Who is the biggest scumbag in congress?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/180lxh/i_am_congressman_jim_mcgovern_sponsor_of_two/c8aiaul?context=5)|I don't have nearly that much time ... 
[Being in a country with over 300 million people, don't you believe there is a need for massive amount of campaign spending to reach out to these people? A more direct question would be, how would campaigning with less money be more beneficial to Americans?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/180lxh/i_am_congressman_jim_mcgovern_sponsor_of_two/c8aif2e?context=5)|We need a system with greater access to the public airwaves for anyone who wants to run.  The notion that you are only a serious candidate if you have lots and lots of money seems contrary to who we are.  Members who raise millions of dollars from the oil industry will be influenced by that industry.  We need to empower people, and not Big Money special interests.
[As your last name is McGovern, did you always want to be a politician?  =\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/180lxh/i_am_congressman_jim_mcgovern_sponsor_of_two/c8ajebp?context=5)|No.  I thought I'd probably end up working in my father's package store (liquor store).  But I interned for George McGovern in college (no relation), he became my dearest friend and my hero, and my inspiration.  I was privileged to deliver the eulogy at his funeral.  I was a congressional staffer for 14 years for Rep. Joe Moakley before I ran and won in 1996.  McGovern taught to me to believe that one person can change the world, and Joe Moakley showed me how to do it.   
[Hello Rep. McGovern; thanks for doing this.  How many co-sponsors do you have for your bill?  Is Rep. Shrader (OR\) one of them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/180lxh/i_am_congressman_jim_mcgovern_sponsor_of_two/c8aij2a?context=5)|12 on each bill.  Rep. Shrader isn't yet.
[What about Rep. Fattah (PA\)? Actually, could you list them here?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/180lxh/i_am_congressman_jim_mcgovern_sponsor_of_two/c8ajilb?context=5)|Go to thomas.loc.gov.  The bills are HJ Res 20 and HJ Res 21.  You'll find all the updated cosponsors there.
[How much of your day is spent on fundraising activities and does your party pressure you to do more when it comes to fundraising? Thanks for your time. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/180lxh/i_am_congressman_jim_mcgovern_sponsor_of_two/c8aidjj?context=5)|I spend as little time as possible, much to the chagrin of my campaign staff.  One of the reason i want campaign finance reform is i believe members of Congress spend way too much time dialing for dollars.  This is not a good system.  I have 'dues' for the DCCC that I'm expected to raise. $200K last cycle, and I'm expected to raise $ for other candidates.
[How is it that the House only allows bills to come to the floor if they are supported by a majority of the majority party (currently Republicans\)?  This amounts to rule by a minority of the members.  Why is this allowed?  Isn't there a more democratic (small d\) way of proceeding?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/180lxh/i_am_congressman_jim_mcgovern_sponsor_of_two/c8aj940?context=5)|That's the way the Rules of the House are structured.  The Speaker controls the calendar.  Technically, there is something called a 'discharge petition' whereby if 218 Members sign then a bill automatically goes to the floor, but these are very very rare.  
[Hi congressman. Thank you for taking the time to speak with us here today.  How has the technology available today changed the way in which you approach your role as a congressman?  And how do you see technology impacting the political landscape in the future with services such as Twitter and this Reddit AMA granting easy and direct access between the people and their representatives? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/180lxh/i_am_congressman_jim_mcgovern_sponsor_of_two/c8aj5wq?context=5)|10 years ago I never thought I'd be doing this.  But I appreciate the fact that technology has made it easier for people to communicate with me and vice versa.  That's a good thing.  One issue, though - I get lots of ""petitions"" here in the office that many people don't even realize they electronically 'signed.' When you had to put pen to paper, it resulted in more thoughtful correspondence.  So I would urge people to take a little time when communicating with their elected representatives.  It goes a long way.
[Hello Jim,  MA resident here.  I was happy to see a resolution to overturn Citizen's United on my ballot this past election.  The resolution passed with an overwhelming majority - i believe about 4:1.  Link to www.boston.com.  How can we translate this momentum into a Consitutional Amendment.  The people clearly want this.  What are the road blocks preventing Congress from adopting your Amendment?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/180lxh/i_am_congressman_jim_mcgovern_sponsor_of_two/c8aic7s?context=5)|Big money, big corporations and members of Congress who benefit from the status quo.  One of the purposes of my amendments is to begin the discussion.
[Who is the funniest person in congress?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/180lxh/i_am_congressman_jim_mcgovern_sponsor_of_two/c8aicud?context=5)|With Barney gone, I think Linda Sanchez (CA) in the House and Al Franken in the Senate.

Don't let anybody tell you that you can't or shouldn't.  I believe politics can be a noble endeavor.  
[In what would you say is something the state of Massachusetts is great at? Conversely, what would you say is something Massachusetts needs to work on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/180lxh/i_am_congressman_jim_mcgovern_sponsor_of_two/c8aic5p?context=5)|We're great at education, k-12 and higher ed, great at innovation, medical research.  We need to improve our infrastructure, better support our agriculture and keep moving toward green, clean energy.  Also, a better Red Sox season would be nice.
[Red Sox fan! FTW!  Congressman, what do you think the odds are of successfully overturning ""Citizens United""? Should we be cautiously hopeful that it will happen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/180lxh/i_am_congressman_jim_mcgovern_sponsor_of_two/c8aiadp?context=5)|It's a long road ahead, but I'm hopeful.  Either the SC will overturn its own rulings or the people will demand a change in the Constitution.  We need to fight.
[Do you think there's a real chance that Congress will pass immigration reform this year or are we doomed to repeat the 2005-2006 efforts?  Also, what's your favorite Barney Frank story?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/180lxh/i_am_congressman_jim_mcgovern_sponsor_of_two/c8aicds?context=5)|I'm encouraged that there is a bipartisan group talking about imm. reform. I'm hopeful, but it has to happen this year before we head into another election season.  I have a million Barney Frank stories.  Most of them aren't family-friendly.  I miss him a lot.
[What's your favorite local pizza shop?  Followup question: what are your favorite pizza toppings?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/180lxh/i_am_congressman_jim_mcgovern_sponsor_of_two/c8aib1d?context=5)|Burncoat Pizza and the Wonder Bar - both in Worcester -  are two favorites.  Pepperoni, sausage, onions and peppers.
[What are your thoughts on The Peoples' Pledge that Warren and Brown made in the last election that severely limited outside group spending?  Do you think this model could be replicated?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/180lxh/i_am_congressman_jim_mcgovern_sponsor_of_two/c8aihao?context=5)|I thought it was a good thing.  But even with the pledge, Brown and Warren both had to raise about $45 million apiece.  I'm glad Warren run -- VERY glad -- but I'm troubled by all the money that has to be raised to run for Senate.  Or House.  
[Just a question about congress life in general: Do you ever ""hang out"" with your fellow congressmen? If so, does it get awkward when you vote differently on something you both feel passionately about?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/180lxh/i_am_congressman_jim_mcgovern_sponsor_of_two/c8aihpk?context=5)|Sometimes we hang out.  It doesn't usually get awkward - we try not to talk 'shop' in social settings.  But we're all grown-ups.  We understand that we all have different points of view and different constituencies.
[I am very interested to know of your colleagues who are also involved in this discussion.  What is the interest in the Senate?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/180lxh/i_am_congressman_jim_mcgovern_sponsor_of_two/c8aimnj?context=5)|Bernie Sanders, Tom Udall are two who have been active.  We're trying to find a senator to introduce the People's Rights Amendment this year.
[Congressman, do you still believe in the American Dream?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/180lxh/i_am_congressman_jim_mcgovern_sponsor_of_two/c8aj35z?context=5)|Yes.  Absolutely.  It's gotten much too hard for too many people, but I still believe that our best days are ahead.  I'm an optimist.
[Do you have any job openings in your office(s\)? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/180lxh/i_am_congressman_jim_mcgovern_sponsor_of_two/c8aidc7?context=5)|Sorry to say, not right now - but we can always hire more interns!
[Hello Congressman, thank you for doing this AMA. I am also quite upset by the Citizens United ruling and its consequences, but I do have a question.  If the ruling is overturned or negated through an amendment, how do you intend to reconcile the issue of corporations not having necessary rights to conduct business (such as the right to own property, the right to free speech etc\) with your proposed amendment?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/180lxh/i_am_congressman_jim_mcgovern_sponsor_of_two/c8aiybo?context=5)|Those are two separate areas - property rights are commonlaw rights under state laws.  On free speech, my amendment specifically makes it cleat that people maintain the right to free speech and free press.  But the notion that the artificial corporate entity, created under state law, should enjoy the same fundamental constitutional rights as citizens is just wrong, in my view.  NY Times did a great editorial on this ...
[Hi Congressman I am from Clinton, MA even though you do not represent my district I was curious what you thought about the recent leaked memo about the assassination of US citizens with no due process. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/180lxh/i_am_congressman_jim_mcgovern_sponsor_of_two/c8aio25?context=5)|I am deeply troubled and believe that the Administration owes us -- Congress and the American people -- some answers and some clarity on their policy.
[Constituent here, just want to say how awesome you are and how proud I am every time I get to vote for you.  Your speech in Worcester got me off my butt and got me volunteering on the Warren campaign.  Thanks for fighting the good fight for those that can't!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/180lxh/i_am_congressman_jim_mcgovern_sponsor_of_two/c8ajdzh?context=5)|Thanks for your hard work!

I've done enough that I'm probably a stand-out, or at least highly qualified, applicant, but I'm looking at this list of internships, the same list I've used in the past, and it's just so depressing. 

I'm incredibly unmotivated to waste my time-- AGAIN-- researching and putting together applications for summer internships that I'm just not going to get. 

I don't have any hope that I'll get them anymore. I'm just tired of tired of it. There are so many people competing, and probably about half the slots will be given to people because of networking anyway. 

Fuck it. I'm having trouble motivating myself to do this. I need to, I really do, but it feels like I'm knowingly engaging in an exercise in futility. A time-consuming exercise in futility. And fuck it. I'd rather just watch tv on my laptop and read A Softer World for the billionth time. At least then I'm not setting myself up to be disappointed again. And to have to admit to everyone who supports my application with recs and shit that I didn't get it. Again.

So far in my medical education, I've only had one patient ask me if I believe in prayer. They were, fortunately, understanding when I said no. 

For personal reasons, I do not participate in prayer in any way, including standing silently in the room. In dealing with members of my own fundamentalist family around the holidays, I politely excuse myself from the room until they are finished. 

I guarantee there will be patients/families demanding that I pray with them, etc., in the coming years. (I have seen other doctors faced with the request). I'm thinking I will address patient issues as I would with my own family. Praying is something I will not be a part of, even for placebo value. 

How have you dealt with these situations? Have you encountered negative fallout from administration?"

I think the NY opportunity would be a good way to get my foot in the door, and I also think I would have more choices in regard to career options. But again, this might end up only being a 3-month contract in which case I would be out of work if I couldn't find a FT position.

The main things I'm a little lost on are RAM and HDD.  Are the choices I've made in here good ones for the builds?  Also, I've read that the Corsair AX series is really good, but I'm less certain about the Antec I put in the cheaper build.

Is there a huge difference between the 7970's I've selected and the Vapor X GHz edition?  Cause the GHz Edition is like $80 more, and that adds up.  Even with the second build, I'd prefer keeping it under two grand.

Since I'm not buying *right now*, current sales aren't as useful to me.  I really, really hope to buy within the next month.  I *am* considering going ahead and buying the graphics card, so I can get Crysis 3 and Bioshock Infinite.  I'm not certain yet if I'll actually drive to Microcenter to get anything, it's a three hour drive; might not be worth it.  If it is worth it, though, I will.

Thanks for your help! :D  Really looking forward to building, whichever one I end up with.  I haven't built my own computer in like seven years.

Edit: Forgot to say what it's for.  Will mainly be using it to game and internet, stream to my PS3 and such.  Will likely do some video encoding.  I have two monitors and plan on eventually getting a third.  I know that the second build is likely overkill, but it's been way too long since I've had an overkill machine."

I don't have a precedent for my situation, so I need your collective advice:

In a few years, I'll be leaving college with no debt. I've managed a very small part-time job in addition to being full time student ($2400 in 2012, which I will file taxes on!). I'm looking at ~$3000 for 2012, + an internship stipend (which won't be much).

I've been depositing my checks at a 2:1 Savings:Checkings ratio.

I don't have a car and I won't need one. My room and food is taken care of (I even managed to get free housing for the summer) while I'm in college, and my parents have offered me a (rent-free) couch while I'm job-searching post-graduation.

Basic goals for post-graduation:
Out of my parents' house by winter, into an apartment, with a job.
It's not very realistic, but some recent alum from my department have managed it.

What else do I need to consider? What do I need?

I've been reading posts here, but I haven't seen too many very beginner posts, and I did check out the FAQs, but I don't exactly have money to do anything with.

A single pen for my notepad, and my computer. I don't have anything on my walls, although I've thought about it. I had to move desks and it took me less than a minute to grab my bag, pen, notepad and walk over to my new desk and log in.

However, this new desk is used by interns and some part time staff occasionally. I don't mind sharing at all, because although I'm full time, I mostly need to just check email between fabricating things in the shop.

One day, a part-time staffer came in and she was surprised I had moved. I told her I didn't need to use my computer all day, so no worries if she needed it. I come back a couple hours later and she put up drawing and papers all along the walls, changed my computer screen setup, and threw a bunch of pens and pencils and markers into my pen holder. She had all her things spread out, multiple jackets hanging on my chairs, papers everywhere, and so on.

I don't know if she was simply uncomfortable with how plain it looked, or if she was being passive-aggressive, but I thought it was quite odd. Now I'm not sure really what to do. She's only in a couple mornings a week. I can't imagine altering someone else's space, especially if I was temporarily using their space. Ultimately I don't care, but looking at the clutter is bothersome at times. A coworker said ""Why don't you just put some of your things up on the walls as well to make it your own?"" 

**It seems like most people believe the only way to personalize a space is to add to it, whereas I feel most comfortable and expressed through a clean, efficient, open space. That's most reflective of who I am and what I value and enjoy.**

187395,8,2013-02-09,Failed my dreams,blownaparte,MyLittleSupportGroup,https://www.reddit.com/r/MyLittleSupportGroup/comments/187395/failed_my_dreams/,"Hey there, MLSG,

I really don't like complaining - but I feel like I just need to share my thoughts with someone.

My problems are entirely emotional: I've got an education, I've got a job, I've got a caring family. But lately I've been getting suicidal thoughts about the smallest things that go wrong or just cause me anxiety - I already did some research on methods, the whole shebang but I still find good reasons not to go through with it: I couldn't hurt my parents that way - yet I have no doubt that I won't die a natural death.

If things keep going the way they're going, I'll see my parents off at their death beds and then choose some quiet way to go that causes the least trauma for anyone involved in recovering my body. My sister... I love her very much but we're not that close, I think she'll cope, she's a lot tougher than I am.

Thing is: I'm a doormat. And I'm failing on so many fronts right now that I think I'm just not fit to live. To give this a bit more structure, I'll make a list:

1) - the love life

I'm 29 years old but I don't feel any different to how I felt when I was 16 - totally inexperienced in terms of relationships. This November I can swap my v-card for the w-card: [Wizard status confirmed](http://www.vgmemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/legend-on-the-internet-virgin-30-wizard.jpg). The problem is: I don't like myself at all, I've had whole days ruined just by looking in the mirror in the morning. I'm afraid that if I get into a relationship without addressing this issue first, it will spectacularly blow up in my face and it will sabotage happiness left and right for two people instead of only one person.

2) - friends

Many of my old friends have found their love for life, married, kids on the way or already there - it's just the way the world works. They grow stranger every day, it's like living in different worlds, a different phase of life. As families they're self-sufficient now, friendships are less important, you cultivate relationships with the parents of the kids your kids befriend. Other friends that I have just have similar problems and I can't do much to help but listen. At the moment I'm a good deal better off than some of them are, financially - I try to help when it's possible but money can destroy friendships. They don't want handouts and I respect that. Which brings me to point three:

3) - purpose

In my teens I wanted to be an artist, make animated movies. Or be a scientist. Why not both? I simply love cartoons, all kinds, if they're well-made. And I'm interested in physics and math, I want to understand how nature works.

After ""high-school"" (European equivalent) I did a 1.5y crash-course in traditional animation and worked as an intern on a production for 4 months. During that time, I met some people who were just stuck in a business with low salary and little perspective. I met a storyboard artist who (for Europe at least) had done the boards for some really well-done feature films but lost his foot in the door when he got sick for two weeks during production. He told me that he'd rather be a bus driver now but he can't, because that would take a few months of courses and his kids need clothes and food.

A few of my friends followed their dreams of doing art and mostly haven't been successful or happy with it.

I was pretty turned off about working in such an industry (pretty non-existant in my country and I hate to say it: mostly crap productions) and tried passion number two: Science. I picked up physics and graduated and I'm now working on my PhD. I took a bit longer to graduate than my peers, maybe because I always had my art 'hobby' as a side project and personal issues to deal with. I thought I could follow two dreams at once. 

4) - what it boils down to

What I do now is mostly industry-related private research, designing optics and programming simulations. I feel that I'm a mediochre physicist and a mediochre artist. And the drive I had half a decade ago, to excel in either discipline has vanished. There's a glimpse of manic motivation for a few minutes and then it's a return to 'why bother'. I haven't felt alive for years, just like a machine, slowly falling apart.

Even MLP - as much as I love it and the community - has the effect of pulling me down as much as pulling me up. I feel like there's some kind of parallel universe where I could have been part of a production team on such a show.

So there I am, exactly where I was ten years ago but without any sense of direction or motivation. And I fear that this lack of motivation will cost me my current job as well.

PS: If I hadn't write this myself, I probably couldn't have made it through such a wall of nothing but self-pity and whining. The more respect for anyone who makes it this far. You're awesome for listening.

Edit:Grammar

**Update**: Thank you, everyone who replied. I didn't know what to expect when I posted my rant here, despite lurking and sometimes posting here myself. But that you took time to reply and had workable suggestions and kind words had more of an impact than I thought it would have. For the first time in months, I feel like getting up to try and change things again. I'm not going to let this moment pass by unused. I'm going to focus on only one goal for now - doing C25K to completion - and see where it takes me."

Currently I am in my second year as a civil engineering student and upon graduation I have two paths to take: Working as a structural engineer in office or being a superintendent and running the construction site. I just dont want to be indoors all day long also many of my friends say the superintendents earn more than the office folk. At the end of this year, I want to intern oversees in the construction site but heres the problem. I have no knowledge what so ever in construction as so far I have only taken theoretical courses math and physics and the like. II have no idea what I am going to do as an intern on the construction site with no knowledge. Also, In order to learn all the construction processes from the top (GC) to all the way down to the superintendent and how everything works out and functions can you recommend me a book? I am sure you treasure a book that you always referenced to. Thanks alot for reading this. I just need experienced advice.
I would like to learn all the facets of building construction and I was wondering what would be the best primer book for this as I am currently studying civil engineering and might become a construction superintendent (site manager) in the future."
186pyf,4,2013-02-09,Secret to getting an Internship?,theBenger,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/186pyf/secret_to_getting_an_internship/,"I am a Junior computer engineering major at Cal Poly Pomona, and even though I have been applying like crazy, I have been unable to land an internship.  I have a good GPA (3.4) and among other things, I am second in charge of the electrical systems on the Rose Float my school builds every year.   Even with all of that I am finding it impossible to get even interviews.  Am I expecting too much or am I missing something?

**EDIT 1:** I have a resume, a cover letter, and a portfolio of projects.  I have attended job fares at my school and handed these out, but the vast majority of my applications have been over the internet.  All of my material has been review by the career fair on campus and a few other people.  I think that my documents don't get across the work I have been doing, especially within Rose Float (I have completed 5 major projects, including making and programming a ""secondary"" animation system to control mechs our primary is unable to)

**EDIT 2:** Just for perspective, the Rose Float program is a massive year round project.  I put 10~20 hours in many weeks, with the 3 weeks coming up to the parade being 14 hour work days with almost no breaks.  It is done in conjunction with Cal Poly SLO and between people who have positions and volunteers, upwards of 200 students work on the project over the course of the year.   Outside of sports, it is the single largest program budget wise on campus."
186ozx,9,2013-02-09,I've spent too much money that wasn't mine and feel there's no going back. ,youseemrickety,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/186ozx/ive_spent_too_much_money_that_wasnt_mine_and_feel/,"So I'm in my third year now at a very expensive art school for film. Everyone that asks me about my ""career choice"" always says, ""Oh it must be wonderful living your dreams"" or ""wow that's so exciting"". Unfortunately though, since coming up with the idea to be a filmmaker when I was 18, and within the three years that passed, I've completely dismissed it as ""fun"" or ""my dreams"". I used to write stories. Ever since I was in elementary school I had this notion that it was the fucking coolest thing in the world to be able to use my brain and come up with ANYTHING I possibly could imagine, thus making stories out of them. I think I'll always truly love written narratives. Film though, isn't at all the creative medium for my grand ideas that I thought it would be. I'm not a huge people person when it comes to ""work"". I really enjoy staying quietly motivated to myself, deep inside my head whilst clawing through ideas to imagine a prose. But film is all face time, it's all ""who you know,"" it's very techie, very much so a popularity contest, I fucking hate having to deal with actors and the ego head fuck that comes with those kinds of people. And as a by product of being on feature film sets, meeting said actors, doing my ""intern grunt work"" and watching the pro's edit the films (I met with the editors behind MI: ghost protocol) I kinda hate the field that I'm marching into for the rest of my life. I'm not a million dollar kind of guy, I hate the idea that success in this industry means fame and for a successful story to be told is required to have a huge budget and and an even larger amount of people to help you do it. The only reason I'm still currently enrolled in it is because my parents. They've been truly wonderful and supportive with every decision i've made since graduating high school, and they believe this to be my passion. With all the money (myself included) that they are spending to help me, I feel awful not having my heart in it anymore, but I cant let them down, I just don't have a fucking clue what else I would do. 


What makes it worse is that to start a profession you have to start at the bottom, but in my case, that would mean editing commercials and sitting at a computer all day for shitty products. I fucking hate everything about that idea. "
186mcx,6,2013-02-09,Can I get my Associates and then continue right where I left off for my Bachelors?,chriswilliams54,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/186mcx/can_i_get_my_associates_and_then_continue_right/,"The reason that I ask is that when I graduated High School I wasn't really ready for college. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life, and I wasn't really mature enough to handle school. So I drifted through school for a few years failing classes(which caused my GPA to plummet.) and changing majors a few times before I finally straightened up. I decided on a degree in Information Technology and everything has been great since. The problem is that I am now 23 and I still have at least a couple of more years of school left before I can graduate. However, I should be able to get my Associates by the end of the fall 2013 semester. I live in rural Oklahoma so there aren't really many jobs unless you want to go work in an oil field (which I can't due to a heart condition). I am still working in retail, and even though I am in a supervisory position, I am barely making above minimum wage. I don't make enough to live on my own so I still live at home with my parents. I am anxious to start working on a ""career"" instead of just having a job. So my plan was to get my Associates degree coupled with as many IT certifications as I can acquire and try and find a job while continuing right where I left off to still get my bachelors. Can I do that or will I have to start over? If it is possible would it be a bad idea if I were to have to relocate for the job, meaning I would have to transfer schools? I looked into doing internships but my (slowly recovering) GPA is a big roadblock for those. So I tried to get involved at school and do the ""College Life"" thing, but living 45 minutes away makes it difficult. Plus now that all my friends have graduated (or are close), I am feeling more and more like Pierce or Leonard from Community everyday. Both at school and at work. And it is only going to get worse as time goes on. So any advice? Is this a dumb plan? Sorry about the wall of text; it's late and I am exhausted.

Thanks for any help."
186hjx,2,2013-02-09,"[MF] ""The Tease/Intern""",eroticwritingac,eroticliterature,https://www.reddit.com/r/eroticliterature/comments/186hjx/mf_the_teaseintern/,"The alarm rings as the clock strikes five a.m. and I slowly rise to my feet to stumble towards the kitchen to start my day as I have for the past year. I've really splurged on today's meal, with eggs and bacon as my main course and a shot of my favorite Orange Juice Vodka to finish it off. Alert as all hell I slip my shoes on, grab my coat and briefcase and lock my door behind me as I start my day. The walk to the train seems to be getting worse, always seems as if some sort of construction blocks the shortest route, turning my once one hour commute into a two hour ordeal to get to work on time. After zig-zagging side streets to find the station I board the train and take a seat. Sure most view the young businessman as a person of enthusiasm and energy, but this is not always so. I feel the touch of alcohol hit my body as I become more relaxed. My senses become dull for the moment and a new euphoria is found. My work is a few stops from my home and plenty of people seem to enter and exit each stop without my notice. Half asleep, I walk off the train and walk two blocks to the building I work at to start my workday and my ""paid time"" as I like to call it. I find my desk and begin to make my calls as I have done for my entire tenure here. 

Suddenly I'm broken from my cycle of mundane tasks by this seemingly angel like female, asking if I need assistance with anything. Surely this is a product of my sleep deprivation right? A few awkward seconds pass and I come to my senses that this female is real and is patiently awaiting my response. I tell this girl to sort my papers between my two active accounts, and she gets straight to work. Its hard not to notice her young body through the sexual clothing the others find as ""suitable business attire"". I strike up some quick conversation to find out a little bit about this angel, asking her what her official position is. Her response wasn't a surprise, ""Intern"" she said. As a recent graduate I knew right where she was, the ready-to graduate student finishing up their intern hours to get their degree. We make plans to meet up for dinner after work, and we split ways til then. 7:30 rolls around and we both arrive at a local place to grab some dinner. Shortly into our evening she asks me to act as her boyfriend, as her ex enters the restaurant. I quickly seize the opportunity by sliding into the bench next to her, and getting a quick feel for what she has got. The man sits down and asks the girl if they could talk privately. She continues by grabbing my hand and leading me to the door. She pulls my arm around her side and we leave the restaurant. Noticing the location of her college I offer to go home with her, as the area is known for crime and this hot body is likely to draw attention. After an hour of walking we arrive at her apartment when things take a turn, for the best. She unlocks her door, guides me inside where we proceed to make out, throwing all belongings to the side and sitting her up on the counter. After ten minutes of provocative kissing we part ways, and I head home. The next day at work we strike eye contact and I know that she's urging for more. That tight ass can't wait and I know it with my gut. An hour passes, and she drops a note on my desk reading ""Let's meet on the corner of fifth and X at 12:30"". 

I don't hesitate by nodding my horny little head and walking there by the specified time. A light hands grasps mine from behind and she leads me down the bustling street. We walk up some marble stairs to a lavish building in the center of the city. We enter the elevator as I question her as to where we are. No response from her, only a guiding hand down a wide hallway. She pulls a mysteriosu key fro mher pocket and opens a large wooden set of doors to a luxurious complex of a downtown loft. I close the door as she reaches into my pant pockets and pulls my phone onto the table. She places both of our devices in the center of the table and removes the batteries from both. She takes me to the main living room where she sits me down on a chair fit for a king. She turns facing the opposite way and slowly removes her winter jacket. Getting anxious I watch as she removes her tight skirt to leave her black lingerie top and bottom to stare at. 


She unwraps her hair, and lets her beautiful long brown hair out as she kisses my crotch. Quickly gaining an erection she slides my work pants off to find an erect cock pressing my underwear skyward. She uses her warm little hands to remove my underwear and stares deeply into my eyes the entire time. She faces the opposite way and presses my hot cock into her perfect ass, with her panties being the only thing to prevent me from going in. She stands only to remove the remaining clothing and proceeds by dropping to her knees, to place her mouth around my pulsing cock. Pushing her face deeper and deeper into my crotch she quickly turns around and presses her tight ass onto my cock. Screaming for mercy she slides my throbbing cock into her anus and continues by making extremely small moves. It's obvious that this is her first time and she blushes only seconds after penetration. We make our way to the shower and turn it to the hottest we can. Her amazing ass rubs against my body as we kiss in the steam. Her medium size chest gives my hands something to play with as my senses explode into a new sort of euphoria I've yet to experience. 

I lay her perfect body onto the floor of the massive shower and cycle between her perfect pussy and asshole. 



She screams in excitement and most likely orgasm. Getting close to orgasm myself, I remove my pulsing cock from her ass and explode all over her long hair. We quickly clean up and head out, promising to keep this our little secret.

This is my first story, I'm not sure whether to be very detailed or not, if you could add insight that would be fantastic. Thanks for reading!"
186h8x,6,2013-02-09,Why even bother. (Kinda long),This_Stranger,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/186h8x/why_even_bother_kinda_long/,"
I don't know why I'm typing this but I should feel like I get this out.

 I'm a complete and utter failure, and I have no incentive to even bother living. I just drone on and go to college just because I have nothing else to do. I barely have anyone to talk to and the ones that I do, simply don't want to hear my whine. I feel like I should just leave the city after May and just try to find a new life somewhere else. I'm tired of pretending to be happy and okay with my life.

 I'm a selfish person, having a parent who makes over six figures and able to provide whatever I want yet here I am depressed and wondering why I even should bother. I aimed to graduate but it seems I can't even simply fucking to do that. I get quick declines from loans because I aimed to do the internship quickly and that left me with no job for the quick meantime. Now I'm out of the internship, and finding work that can fit my schedule isn't easy. I wondered why I quit my last job, as bad as it was, at least it was stable and I could do it right. 

 I wanted to go to a different university than I'm currently am, because I wanted to get away and have fun. Now I'm stuck at UTSA and hate every day of it. I want to party, socialize and meet new people. Yet I never put the effort in because I should have done it when I first arrived to UTSA, not on my last real semester. I wanted to get wasted, do stupid shit, and all the fun college stuff but I nearly forced to be sheltered and unable to really go out. I'm 23, and yet I can't even tell my parents, whom I live with, where I'm going because I know they would not approve of it. 

 I'm a spoiled sack of shit, and I'm not happy of who I am. I'm a fat lazy sack of shit, who never did anything about but just now realized I should have taken care of that. I don't even want to finish my degree, I just want to live and I felt like that in my 23 years of life that I haven't even lived one day. I hate who I am, and wonder why I even have friends when I'm such a terrible person. Barely anyone know who I am, and I like to keep it that way. I'm surprised I just haven't just offed myself, but I think it could be possible in the next few weeks. People always say it'll get better, but since I fucked at at 18, it has been a never ending stream of failures.

 I want to be social but I feel like when I do go out, I just go into total aspie mode and don't even bother meeting new people because I always think: What is the point? I just wished I took classes I enjoyed within the last few semesters, but I never did and now I completely regret it. "

[How big is your current code base for your bigest project?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1853ap/we_are_spacex_software_engineers_we_launch/c8boc1d?context=5)|The vehicle code is on the order of a couple hundred k lines.
[Is it a hassle to maintain?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1853ap/we_are_spacex_software_engineers_we_launch/c8boc1d?context=5)|It's not a hassle to maintain, it's our job!  We're actually very happy with our code base.  It's a labor of love.
[What was the most challenging project that you had to take on and why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1853ap/we_are_spacex_software_engineers_we_launch/c8boc1d?context=5)|Dragon berthing w/ the ISS was a major challenge. Lots of new code had to be developed.
[What do you feel most accomplished about?  How do you like your job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1853ap/we_are_spacex_software_engineers_we_launch/c8boc1d?context=5)|Did we mention Dragon berthing w/ the ISS?
[ question: do any of you guys play Kerbal Space Program?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1853ap/we_are_spacex_software_engineers_we_launch/c8bo5o5?context=5)|Are you kidding? That’s how we design our rockets!
[, in case you can answer, I'd like to ask a question about the MCT and shielding. Elon talked about it a while back and said that to avoid excess weight it might be possible to have water as shielding, only directly between the crew-module and the sun like a column, instead of an all-encompassing ball. How does this cater for dispersed radiation incoming from the sides?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1853ap/we_are_spacex_software_engineers_we_launch/c8bo5o5?context=5)|Elon may have something to say about this topic soon...
[Who the fuck is downvoting every question?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1853ap/we_are_spacex_software_engineers_we_launch/c8boabd?context=5)|North Korea.
[What are you currently working on? Any exciting projects coming up? (I imagine they're all pretty exciting to be honest\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1853ap/we_are_spacex_software_engineers_we_launch/c8boafz?context=5)|We have so much going on right now--one of the coolest project is probably Grasshopper.  This is a development vehicle we’re using to test the engineering necessary to not just send rockets up, but to bring them back--something that’s never been done before.  You can see some of those tests on YouTube  [Link to www.youtube.com](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4PEXLODw9)  and we’ve got more tests coming up later this year.
[What is it like working with such a prominent company in the space industry just now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1853ap/we_are_spacex_software_engineers_we_launch/c8boafz?context=5)|We’re also working on getting Dragon ready to take people to station.  Right now Dragon just carries cargo, but it was always designed to take people.  We’re working with NASA to make the final mods necessary--basically seats, environments and pretty bad-ass launch escape system--and we’re looking to start crew trials as early as 2015.
[I've heard that the conveniences that C++ provides do not outweigh the cost in complexity that big projects usually create when using some of the advanced features of C++. What advantages do you experience using C++ over C?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1853ap/we_are_spacex_software_engineers_we_launch/c8bq29t?context=5)|Encapsulation is the big one.
[How is the work/life balance?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1853ap/we_are_spacex_software_engineers_we_launch/c8bof0c?context=5)|SpaceX embodies the small business mentality.  We are all invested in SpaceX and its success.  That being said, we do work longer hours.  At the end of the day, it boils down to what is important in your life.  We of course deal with burnout, thats what vacation days are there for ;).
[I have heard it is pretty easy to burn out at SpaceX. Do you guys struggle at all?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1853ap/we_are_spacex_software_engineers_we_launch/c8bof0c?context=5)|Speaking as one person, most days I don’t even notice that I have been at work for 12-14 hours. I take a look at the clock and think “where did the time go?”. I think that’s a testament to how excited we can get about our projects. When you really enjoy what you are doing, it doesn’t feel so much like work. (That being said, a vacation every now and then is still necessary to maintain sanity)
[How many ITAR violations are you committing right now? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1853ap/we_are_spacex_software_engineers_we_launch/c8boig1?context=5)|None! We have our President Gwynne Shotwell in the room!
[What kind of operating systems you use in your navigation/propulsion control systems?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1853ap/we_are_spacex_software_engineers_we_launch/c8bo7jr?context=5)|Dragon and Falcon 9 use a version of Linux.
[Did you mount Labview onto the Linux environment, and are you using Matlab as well?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1853ap/we_are_spacex_software_engineers_we_launch/c8botjc?context=5)|We run LabVIEW on Windows.
 |We use Matlab on the ground as an analysis tool.
[What experience/schooling does one need to get a job with spaceX? Or intern even?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1853ap/we_are_spacex_software_engineers_we_launch/c8bo9wp?context=5)|We all come from a diverse background of companies and schools.  Most of us are Computer Science students but we definitely have a good amount of EE, Physics, Math, Computer Engineering, and even some self-taught engineers here.  For Flight Software, C++ and algorithm/data structure knowledge are very important.  For Enterprise Information Systems, C# or Front End experience + great algorithm/data structure knowledge. For Launch Engineering (the team that uses LabVIEW), awesome LabVIEW + great algorithm/data structure knowledge. See the trend?  Study math and know your sorting algorithms. 
[Can you guys dazzle us geeks with some fascinating computer tech systems/specs/toys that you guys are using for your missions so we can feel envious?  I understand Apollo 11 didn't have much computer power on board when it went to the moon--how much computer power do you guys have in an SpaceX spacecraft?  Thanks for rocking us to space! \m/](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1853ap/we_are_spacex_software_engineers_we_launch/c8bocf1?context=5)|Re computing power: a shit ton.
[What was your ""I can believe that this is my job!!!"" moment?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1853ap/we_are_spacex_software_engineers_we_launch/c8bo69o?context=5)|We have these moments almost every day. It is amazing to come in to work and have part of your job be sitting in mission control and having live conversations with astronauts floating in microgravity onboard ISS (and watching them on our huge projector in realtime) to coordinate tests in preparation for sending them more supplies and helping them accomplish their missions.
[What is the main program language that you use on the rockets that ties everything together and makes it tick?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1853ap/we_are_spacex_software_engineers_we_launch/c8bo69o?context=5)|The rocket and spacecraft are all C++. On the ground, we use National Instruments LabVIEW extensively.
[Hi SpaceX engineers, appreciate you guys doing this AMA!  How do you guys account for anything that goes wrong with the software when the rocket/spacecraft is already in space?  Like what is the backup plan if there's suddenly a critical bug found when the spacecraft has already launched?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1853ap/we_are_spacex_software_engineers_we_launch/c8bo8l7?context=5)|We have a lot more opportunity for controlling Dragon than Falcon 9 (Falcon 9 only takes about 10 minutes to get to orbit).  We also have the ability to fix things should there be a critical software bug discovered (although we do a ton of testing on the ground before each flight so hopefully this won’t happen).
 |A recent example of an in-flight situation that required our intervention is on our first attempt at ISS rendezvous, getting very close and then discovering that due to an unanticipated lighting situation, Dragon had a hard time seeing its target!  We were able to fix this from the ground and it all ended well.
[Was Dragon using machine vision to guide it's docking?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1853ap/we_are_spacex_software_engineers_we_launch/c8bp7n6?context=5)|It uses LIDAR.
[How do you test rocket software without blowing up rockets?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1853ap/we_are_spacex_software_engineers_we_launch/c8bo35r?context=5)|We test it on the ground before we fly it. We have flight-equivalent systems on the ground that we can run the code against. So cool seeing Falcon in-person on the launchpad! 
[So as rocket scientists, do you ever encounter brain surgeons and have awkwardness occur? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1853ap/we_are_spacex_software_engineers_we_launch/c8bpogf?context=5)|[Link to www.youtube.com](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNnzi4NcKKY)
[During a tour of SLC-40 before the STS-135 launch, I snapped this picture: Link to flic.kr My question is this: Just what the heck is a ""sponge log""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1853ap/we_are_spacex_software_engineers_we_launch/c8bobrx?context=5)|We just misspelled Sponge Bob unfortunately. 
[Nice one with the rick roll, I salute you!  Also, How long is a typical program that you write? and do any of you play Eve?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1853ap/we_are_spacex_software_engineers_we_launch/c8bo3zo?context=5)|Each vehicle (Dragon/Falcon) is more than 100k and less than 500k... :) No more Eve players here any longer, sorry.
[Wow, you all look really young.  How old are you and how did you end up in that (awesome\) job ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1853ap/we_are_spacex_software_engineers_we_launch/c8bo9je?context=5)|We did a quick informal poll and we think the average software engineer age is about 30.
 |How did we get here? We applied through the website or were contacted by a recruiter. :)
[Hey all!  My question:  Are any of you working on guided entry for Dragon (à la MSL\)?  Are we going to see some pinpoint landings over the next couple of years?  Best of luck, and don't get totally burned out!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1853ap/we_are_spacex_software_engineers_we_launch/c8bo58j?context=5)|Definitely.  One of the key goals of the company is to be able to return Falcon 9 and Dragon directly to the pad area and relaunch in a matter of hours, much along the lines of how aircraft are operated today.  Stay tuned for progress on this...
[I hear a lot of people working at spacex get burned out due to the large amount of hours worked. Is this true? Have you guys experienced working *too much?* How do the hours effect your work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1853ap/we_are_spacex_software_engineers_we_launch/c8bobom?context=5)|Yeah, the hours can definitely be crazy.  But when you’re trying to change the future of human history, that’s to be expected :)  Our CEO has said SpaceX is like Special Forces--we do the things that everyone else thinks is impossible.  That means sometimes you’re going to work crazy hours.  There are definitely way easier jobs than working at SpaceX.  But you also get to experience things that you can’t find anywhere else at any other company.  Its definitely a trade off--and for those of us here, totally worth it.
 |We are hiring a lot right now so the more people we add to the team, the better the workload and faster we get to Mars!  
[You use fault tolerance in your system. How do you manage computers failing in flight without having the vehicle get confused about current program state? I know you had an incident on the most recent flight with a computer desync. What was that like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1853ap/we_are_spacex_software_engineers_we_launch/c8boypj?context=5)|We have a continuous barrage of high-energy cosmic radiation which wants to screw with our computers.  For this reason, we have a ""triple-string"" architecture where we have three redundant flight computers, any one of which can take control of the vehicle at any time should the others not be in good health.  On our last mission to the International Space Station, we took a radiation hit that temporarily knocked out one of the three flight computers, but the other two got us back home safely.
 |Our own John Muratore gave [an interview](http://www.aviationweek.com/Blogs.aspx?plckBlogId=Blog:04ce340e-4b63-4d23-9695-d49ab661f385&amp;plckPostId=Blog%3A04ce340e-4b63-4d23-9695-d49ab661f385Post%3Aa8b87703-93f9-4cdf-885f-9429605e14df) where he talked about this incident and our flight computer architecture.
[How do you see private space flight evolving in the next few decades?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1853ap/we_are_spacex_software_engineers_we_launch/c8bo3b0?context=5)|It may start with suborbital but we are close on those heels!
 |As a company, our goal is see people living on other planets--and for our part, we’re doing everything we can to make that happen.  Elon is driving to make this happen in 10 years.  Right now, we’re working with NASA to make the final mods necessary to start taking people to station.  And we’re working on making the world’s first fully reusable rocket--the single most important development necessary to start making space accessible for regular people.  Whether it’s us or some other company that ultimately figures out the best way to get people on other planets, the future of private space flight today looks a lot more promising than it ever has.
[I guess this is sort-of related, but why don't you hire international students for internships/FT positions? It said you were looking for permanent residents only. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1853ap/we_are_spacex_software_engineers_we_launch/c8boejq?context=5)|Unfortunately, due to state department regulations, hiring internationally is extremely difficult, but not impossible with the appropriate controls in place.
[What about in space?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1853ap/we_are_spacex_software_engineers_we_launch/c8bouwm?context=5)|Now that would be nice. Maybe if we get to Mars in 5 to 10 years, then we can remote a few employees remote-in from our red friend?
[From the engineers present today; whats's the iPhone/Android/Other ratio?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1853ap/we_are_spacex_software_engineers_we_launch/c8boebp?context=5)|We took a poll, looks about 50-50.
[Would you rather fight one spacecraft-sized duck or 1000 duck-sized spacecrafts?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1853ap/we_are_spacex_software_engineers_we_launch/c8bofum?context=5)|One Spacecraft sized duck would definitely be cool to see but scary to fight.

We also love to see passion about space; feel free to dork out on your resume or interview.  We use C++ a lot but there is also plenty of Python, C# and even some Matlab is used here.  Some experience with lower-level systems such as the networking stack doesn’t hurt. Align yourself with a professor and attach yourself whatever he or she is working on.  High altitude balloon projects are now relatively easy to get started with a few friends and can be very applicable.

I'm back again a few months later to say that we're still hiring! 

The company is Fullscreen. We are the #1 independent YouTube Network, with ~1.8b monthly views. In addition to YouTube content, we also work directly with many large brands (NBC, Lexus, Google, Pepsi, American Express, Nintendo, and others) to help them manage and improve their YouTube presence.  

We're hiring both front-end and back-end application developers (JavaScript, Rails).  This time, we're looking for people with experience and/or demonstrable skills.  Rails devs are a bit more self-explanatory, but I do want to point out that we are looking specifically for JavaScript devs who are comfortable developing JS-based web apps and who are at least familiar with using jQuery, underscore.js, and/or CoffeeScript.   

We're also looking to line up an intern or two for the summer.  We want people who are in CS, CompE, HCI, or similar fields and who are capable of cutting code of some sort.  Exact responsibilities would depend a bit on the person and their abilities/experience.  The positions will be, of course, in Atlanta.

Our primary wants:

* You're smart and/or good at problem solving
* You're interested in learning new things
* You can get stuff done without micromanagement.
* You have an appropriate background and experience (Ruby/Rails, JavaScript app dev).  Degree not required.
* You're a good cultural fit.

What you'll get out of this:

* You'll be working on a small team in a startup environment.
* Product ownership. We build out a lot of things. You'll build something, too, and see it through the full product life cycle.
* Learning. We're building products for a market in its infancy. We're constantly doing something new and learning as we go.
* A fast-growing company. We're currently undergoing explosive growth.
* A tech budget. Get some $ to buy the setup you prefer.
* The flexibility that comes with results-oriented development.  We don't have set hours and if you need to work from home sometimes, that's fine with us.  
* Standard company benefits -- competitive salary, health/dental/vision, free snacks and drinks, etc..

For more info, check out our super awesome webpage http://fullscreen.net or email me directly at mitchell at fullscreen.net.  We've had problems in the past with people's emails going to my spam folder, so pinging me here might also be a good idea.

P.S.: If you're interesting in moving to Los Angeles, we have some openings in our main office as well."

I have been fairly involved on campus writing for the newspaper, volunteering, working at the library. I also had some marketing experience working with a friend on a website.

I'll try to address some points where I think you get it from. 

* **Kick and Kill of ChubbyMoose**

He was [planning](http://i.imgur.com/97Zobrk.png) on betraying us, and we just happened to get rid of everybody we deemed untrustworthy shortly before hand. So don't believe him when he acts all innocent, he didn't smart his way out, he actually got temp-banned for combat logging against us and we got his inventory. He is the only one who got killed.

* **Inviting ""noobs"" over to join us and then killing them**

As many of you know, Reid and I are not the best fighters on the server. If somebody goes and says ""Hey, I have full diamond can I join you?"", we jump on that. We only had four active men most of the time, so we couldn't contest King of the Hill or Palace, and mining is unnecessary. The only way for us to increase coffers is shady tactics like so. I never once said one of these people could join us, I only said that they could trade, or intern with us to have a **chance** to join us. Either way it teaches the valuable rule #1, to trust **NOBODY**.

 * **Killing people who come to trade**

This ties to my last point. We have done this once or twice this map, and its a rather effective tactic. I mean, its a **Hardcore** server, so if someone comes into my base with things I want, should I pay them or just kill them? And onto attacking Zigman, we're on rather shitty terms with Platypus right now. It's hard to want them alive when Smiggyballs tried to get me killed last map, and with them setting us up in a trap this map.

 * **Noobkilling**

We had (1) member on that list. We don't invite noobs over to kill, if we find them in the wilderness we will kill them. Like I said above, we need all the resources we can get. Sometimes we get sticks, sometimes we get four or five diamonds, its a risk. If they aren't in a safe place by the time their protection is out, they need some more practice. Plus, there are **many** other players that are highly regarded on that same list, even higher above. Pikaoku told me I was a horrible noob killer, although Punkrocker, Boweee, and Russian_Roulette are all on the list/in his faction. In the next five minutes, he killed the same unarmed player twice.

 * **Trolling in chat**

This one actually makes me laugh. We play on a server were ""le"", ""x2013"", and ""fite me irl"" is said maybe hundreds of times daily. So what if we say ""u mad"" after a fight, who actually cares? It is a **joke**. Earlier this map I was joking around with the server and y'all freaked out calling me a troll and evil. Seriously, look in a mirror. Some of the people here are actually **bad** people, and everyones okay with them. 


 * **Conclusion**
  
I'd just like to remind everybody that this is a game, which is played to have fun. Albeit more hardcore than most, its purpose is still recreation. This is how we have fun. If we were in a large faction, these wouldn't be our actions, but we aren't and this has been the most fun i've ever had on HCF. I've experienced a mob mentality against my faction for reasons I do not comprehend, and some really mean shit has been said to me. CaptainPaanda said that ""You are worse than Hitler because he eventually killed himself"", that was actually really funny though. Everybody just needs to calm down, and start worrying about themselves.

I graduated from a state school with a BA in Language and Applied Economics (I studied French and Arabic specifically). Well the job market for International Trade dried up before I graduated [ThanksObama.gif] so I worked retail and then got into political work. I then got into social media management for political candidates.

A couple moves later, my wife lands a great (political) job, and I have the rare opportunity to pursue anything I want, focus on my studies, even learn new skills and change course without working, so I'm doing just that. I've decided that I want to get into development.

I figure that learning computer language/code is like learning any other language. It sucks and is incredibly hard at first but you eventually get the hang of it, and you can do more beautiful and fun things with it.

So I'm teaching myself basic HTML and CSS and should be done within the week. I'm also learning C++, and plan on learning Java, JavaScript, Asp.net, and probably PHP. I don't know what I'd study after that.

I'm also going back and studying Calculus and all the necessary maths on Khan Academy and other sites.

Having said all that, I want to be the best web developer I can be. I have the time and resources to pursue this, although I cannot go back for another Bachelors right now.

So far my career plan is this:

* Learn and practice languages, coding, and math as much as possible.
* Build projects and work on opensource stuff as much as possible to create a portfolio.
* Network with other developers
* Perform an internship(s), maybe even unpaid, to get relevant experience (?)

I'm young, and I believe I've got a good mind to learn these things.

All of that said. What can a person who has technical capability without a degree in CS expect in a career? Does the lack of a degree hold people back?

Also, how do most people transition with Web development? Do they stay with it or do they move to other areas? 

**TL;DR** *What can an aspiring web developer expect without a degree in CS? Do you think it would be better to focus on some other area of development instead of web developing, and why?*

Thanks in advance for the advice!

[Edit] It's a little discouraging to get downvotes. I really need some guidance here.

[Edit] Thanks for all the responses! I've learned a lot."

189jaz,1,2013-02-10,Student pharmacist graduating this year... I have no idea how to handle money like an adult.,ONpharmacystudent,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/189jaz/student_pharmacist_graduating_this_year_i_have_no/,"So, background.

I'm currently a pharmacy student in my last year headed towards graduation. 

I have over $15,000 in the bank, and $12,208 unused on a student line of credit (worth $30,000). I've lived in my parents' basement while attending University, driven shitbox cars, applied to whatever scholarships I could and worked multiple jobs for the past 7 years.

Between now and graduation, I have expenses totalling $15,000 – the majority of which ($9,000) is for tuition, my licensing exam ($2,000) and other fixed costs  (gym memberships, insurance, gas, trees). These are unavoidable expenses. 

Upon graduation, I have a few months' of internship before I'm licensed that should net me an additional $16,000 before the end of 2013.
In 2014, I already have a job lined up that will pay $105,000 annually (before taxes). 

I will have $30,000 debt - which is roughly a quarter what most of my classmates have, so I feel pretty good about it.

However, I've never really made money in my adult life. It’s pretty much been a constant cycle of work and tuition payments. I don’t want to end up like my friends who make decent money but piss it all away on weed, liquor, and whores/their girlfriends.

What are some things you wish you had done right out of school? What should someone in my situation be doing? Any advice is appreciated.

So I'm doing my tax returns with TurboTax and I started a Roth IRA ($2000) a couple weeks ago that I'm planning on reporting on this year's return. While I was in college (graduated last May), I had a job where I earned ~$1000 in the 2012 calendar year. In June, I started an internship where I am earning ~$4000 per month, but I did not get a W2 since they consider the income as a taxable fellowship/scholarship. I did report this on TurboTax and do owe taxes on it.

The trouble is, TurboTax is thinking that I contributed more to my Roth IRA than I actually earned and is saying that I will get penalized for my excess contribution. That is, it thinks that the only income that I earned was from my college job, and not from my internship. Is this true? Do fellowships/scholarships not count as earned income which I can use to increase my contribution limit? Should I just wait til next year to report my Roth contribution?

Sorry if this is in the wrong spot. I'm just worried that I made a big mistake due to my weird income situation."

It sounds like the duties will be a wide range but include a good deal of brochure making and some research projects. The application asks for a 'writing sample of at least 1000 words'. I take it from the internet that this really means an excerpt from something I've written before, but just to be sure, do you think it could mean a personal statement? That seems a bit long, and there are a couple of essay kind of questions elsewhere in the application, so I'm hoping not.

I have some ideas of what I would submit if it really is just examples of past work, but here's my real question: Can or should I submit more than one example? A bit of research and one educational activity for instance? And should I write a blurb first about what the writing sample is/where it's coming from? (eg Excerpt from the introduction of my thesis on xyz; educational activity written for a school lending resource on that important guy...)

189fcb,3,2013-02-10,Just venting,DeusExMachina09,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/189fcb/just_venting/,"I've been lurking on Reddit for awhile now and I just need to vent on how the past two months has been for me. Just for background I am a recent college grad with an I.T degree. I am also going to a S.A.T. therapist to work out some compulsive issues that i have.

So to say that I had a shitty past two months would be an understatement. As explained above I am a recent college grad and for the past six months I've been doing a really good internship that had a good chance to be turning into full time position. Last month I learned that I was not going to be hire nor was my internship going to be extended due to ""budget cuts"". I write ""budget cuts"" because I feel like I did not meet their expectations and that they do not want to come out and say that. Needless to say I've been trying ever since to find another job/internship with no luck and I am getting nervous because I moved into the area where the internship was located and now stuck in a year lease.

As I also stated above I've been seeing a S.A.T. therapist for about four months now to work out some issues. The main reason that go me going was my girlfriend( of over four years) wanted to see me get better. Now though my girlfriend is telling me I've been too depressed lately and haven't been talking much lately for her to be happy with us anymore. So two weeks ago we started a ""break"" to try to work through things which I prefer not to but accepted to keep her happy. And now a couple of days ago she ended things with me after coming out and saying that she formed an emotional relationship with a guy friend and is now confused on what she want. We I would been more ok with if we just ended things there. But she is stringing me along to try and see if we can fix things while still talking to the other guy. I  know I am not the boyfriend of the year material but all of these event are happening at the same time and is bring my already low self-esteem even lower. I just needed to vent for a minute so just enjoy your day..

Here is a little background to my story. I met this girl over a year ago at an event with some friends. As soon as I saw her I thought she was amazingly beautiful. I shortly find out that shes good friends with one of my friends so I start hanging out with him more to create a way to see and talk to this girl. (I'm incredibly shy and didn't want to approach her alone). I hung out more and more with this girl and decided to ask her to be my date to a formal student group event. She told me that she'd love to go with me and that's where my memories with her started. I cannot get that out of my head. A couple of days after that date night I ask her to be my girlfriend and she says yes. She also surprises me by saying shes never had a boyfriend before but just did a lot of hooking up in the past. Anyways we create an incredible amount of memories together and after about 6 months i tell her that I love her and she tells me that she loves me too. 

Fast forward to last summer, things start getting more difficult with us. I remained on campus to take summer classes while she went home to work for the summer. The separation bothered me and I did talk to her about it but she seemed like it didn't bother her and that she could handle it well. I remained confident that we could get through it and I got to see her at least every other weekend. 

Fall comes around and she comes back to school but I get a co-op (internship thing). Luckily it is in the same city so I could continue to see her. However, her major starts to get really difficult and she stresses out very easy. She says to me that she cant see me as much as we used to because of how much work she has to do in her design program. This spawned a couple of arguments but I got her to agree spending the night with me at least once during the week and once during the weekend. On top of being stressed out from her school work, she also had to find a co-op job for the spring semester which was very intimidating for her. There were something like 40 jobs and 90 kids in her program competing for them. At the end of fall semester she gets a job but its in a city 4 hours away. I start to stress out as I know as everyday moves by shes getting closer to leaving. I talked to her about my worries and asked her why shes not stressed like I am. She told me shes had an exhausting semester and at this point it doesn't feel real to her. 

Anyways, winter break rolls around but I never got to see her during it because she went away for the entire break. After break I briefly saw her for 2 hours on one day and when i first saw here and went in for a kiss she kinda turned her head like she didn't want to. I found that odd. I thought this was going to be the last time id see her for a while so i wanted her to come over to my place so we could spend more time together but she said shed be back the next day to say her goodbyes to everyone else. I stick with her that next day as she says her goodbyes and I couldn't help but wonder why her goodbyes to other people seemed so much more genuine then ours. Anyways I talk to her before she leaves and she seems optimistic about doing long distance for the semester. I tell her I want to talk every night and she said okay but I have to call her, not always rely on her to call me. She leaves and I begin to miss her an incredible amount. I did call her most nights and whenever I told her I loved her, sometimes she would say she loves me too, some times she would just say you too or me too and that kinda bothered me but i never brought it up. 

Fast forward again to last Saturday, she texts me, ""Hey I decided to come into town this weekend, I want to see you I feel like I need to talk."" I immediately get worried as I don't take that texts last part to mean good things. I ask all my friends and they advise me to stay optimistic but prepare for the worst. Anyways, she finally comes by and i decided to act normal just to see if i was wrong and I knew i wasn't she walked up to me with teared eyes and I hugged and and just said hey..she then asked to go inside and talk. Now for the breakup part, She tells me i'm a great person and i didn't do anything wrong, but her feelings for me have changed and shes not able to say why but this is how it is. She says she loves me and cares about me but she is not In love with me. She then tells me it was since last summer shes been having these thoughts and she wanted to try sticking it out and seeing if they changed but they didn't. She didn't want to break up with me last fall because i was going through a hard time with co-op but she has to now because she realizes there is no good time. Learning that shes been thinking this way for a while struck me hard because I knew i felt her love during the summer and fall and I only felt things getting different when she came back from winter break. Anyways, I did what anyone would tell you not to do and I begged her, told her how much I loved her and how she was perfect for me and I couldn't do being alone now. She was my guidance through my tough times in college and i needed her. She then tells me that I can still call her and talk to her about things bothering me and she wants to be a friend for me but she cant be with me because shes not happy and she cant say the same things i feel about her to me. I beg and I beg and she says she needs to go but mentions something about maybe agreeing to call her in 3 weeks and talk about it again after its sunk in better for me and Ive accepted it. She couldn't look me in the eyes very well during the breakup and I couldnt stop crying on her and I asked her if we could ever be together again and she just shook her head but when i asked more she just said she doesnt know where her feelings will be but right now they are not there so that seems impossible. I also just tried to say that maybe she just needs a break from us and she said no this is a break up and we will not be in a relationship after this. I wonder if theres someone else and i ask her but she said she doesnt have her eye on anyone this is just how she feels and it feels not right being with me. I Finally I just give up. I let her go but made her promise to me that she will think more about it more and come see me again when she comes back into town at the end of march. She says she will but I will have to respect her if her thoughts about me haven't changed. She leaves and I know that's the last time I will see her for a while. 

That was over a week ago and now Ive been going through a terrible week full of what ifs and how can i get back with her. Ive talked with so many people and everyone just says the same thing about having to move on and accept things but I just cant think about that right now. Its different because I think about how my life will be without her. Shes friends and hangs out with a bunch of guys I live with. She also goes to the same events I go to off campus. I know I will see her a lot when she comes back from co-op. I start taking peoples advice and going to the gym to try to feel better that way, of course it doesn't work because my mind has her constantly in my thoughts. I start coming up with my own reasons as to why shes done this and I think about how I can get her to find why she used to love me. I haven't spoke to her since she left and i decided to go NC with her for 3 weeks total (because she said this # during our breakup) to see if that would do anything. I feel like it will help both me and her by giving us both space and maybe space is what she wants. I cant stop thinking about questions that I have like what is she doing? who is she talking to? How does she feel at this point? Does she miss me? Does she ever think for a second that maybe she made a mistake? Is it inevitable for her to miss me? she couldn't possibly break up with me and not miss me..Anyways I have 2 weeks left before I am going to call her and trust me Ive heard from everyone Ive talked to its a bad idea to get my hopes up like this but It just feels like what i have to do. I don't know what im going to do when i talk to her, ill want to say how much i miss her and ask her questions but I don't want to freak her out and ruin everything. So im stuck between wondering if I should make small talk or bring up the relationship. It's very hard for me to be strong and move on because i get attached to people. I would say I have less friends then most people but the people who I call my friends I would do anything for. I'm not the best sociable person but that's an aspect about her that she is incredible in. That's why it felt like we were good together I think, because we complimented each other in so many ways. I see her on Facebook and I just want to talk to her but I cant because I don't want to ruin things..I have my 3 week NC plan and its the only thing that I feel gets me through these days and this stressful difficult semester of classes. 

So I guess Im writing because I want more advice. Especially from this subreddit. Ive been reading stories the past couple of days and just trying to relate. All my friends don't seem to understand but it seems like a lot of you are going through the same depressing thoughts. If you managed to read through this whole thing I thank you so much for giving me time. I just don't know how I should progress if I want this girl back and would do anything for her. There are too many memories for me to simply get over this. Any thoughts or comments or questions are appreciated..thanks. "

Then after receiving my grad certificate I swiftly packed myself up again and landed an internship at the Australian Consulate-General in Shanghai, China. It was while I was at the Consulate working that the furor over the Diaoyu Islands occurred. I worked at the Australian Trade Commission for a couple of months under the guidance of a Trade Commissioner and the Deputy Consul-General to China. I also helped to organise and attended Australia's largest ever trade delegation to China called the Victorian Super Trade Mission. 

After the Consulate I got a marketing position at luxury/lifestyle magazine - Tatler. This only lasted 1 month as they used me as a 'foreign face' and when it came time to cough up the working visa they lied and cheated their way out of the agreement we had and thus I found myself jobless.

Next I was fortunate enough to be in the right place at the right time and landed myself my dream gig - marketing manager for one of Shanghai's original craft breweries. They brought craft beer to China in 2008 and we are now introducing it to the Chinese one day at a time. Basically I spend my days organising some of Shanghai's best parties, drinking Shanghai's best beer and living the crazy fast-paced lifestyle which is life in China.

By the time I hear the screaming in Arabic, I have a pretty good idea what's going on. 

We'd be on the tarmac at LGA for three hours at that point, with repeated assurances from the pilot that the ""mechanical concern"" keeping us from taxing up to the gate would be resolved quickly. At least this is what has been explained to me by the marketing executive who stole my window seat. Truth be told, I've barely listened to a word of Don Draper's life story, nodding with feigned interest between Xanax and cocktails. I'd tuned his frequency out almost completely when the words ""security situation"", fully dressed in Texan drawl, pierce their way through my drug-fueled haze.


This is the same haze that keeps me from remembering I am claustrophobic. The same haze that keeps me from remembering the exact materials composing the sardines can in which I am rocketing through the atmosphere. Today, it is also the same haze that helps me forget I will likely be unemployed by this time tomorrow.


I fix satellites for a living. The by-product of a half-decent electrical engineering degree and a summer spent playing office sports at a telecom company in Queens. That latter part is called an internship, so I'm told. My employer, the NRO, is one of Uncle Sam's many little helpers. They tell me I am incredibly gifted in my field, so much so that my reliance on anxiety medication is worth overlooking in the security clearance process. More recently, they tell me I am doing so well that they are adding the words ""Chief Engineer""  to my title. I'm told this is important as well. At the time, I briefly laugh at the idea that this will be added to my birth certificate as part of my legal name. The laughter stops when I remember my employer does things like this before breakfast.


I travel extensively for this line of work. Tinkering on items that don't exist, in places that don't show up on maps, and filing reports to people without real names. We then occasionally send these items into space.


My last tinkering expedition, the one I'm returning from now, was something new. Usually I go to a military base or somewhere with an abundance of gates and incredibly well-painted logos involving eagles. This trip takes me to a warehouse in Sydney. Inside, bureaucrats watch as I re-assemble the surveillance payload provided to me by the liaison team and transmit a written report on-site back to Washington before being whisked back to my hotel, where I will remain under supervision for the duration of the week. I ask no questions of what I am working on or what it will be used for, and the bureaucrats ask none of me.


Several days later, my guard informs me I am being driven back to the warehouse. Another first, as the rule book states I am never to return to the site of an operation once I have finished working, and Uncle Sam loves his rule book.  The bureaucrats are prowling around a hastily assembled conference table like jungle predators when I get there, speaking a language so riddled with profanity I am not quite sure its English. My arrival causes the room's occupants to freeze, and it becomes painfully clear I am the raw meat.


It turns out my surveillance payload was quietly sent into space, and the information it gathered was used to make the decision to send men with guns into a place where Uncle Sam has been explicitly told both men and guns are not supposed to be. It then turns out that this information was wrong because of the faulty work that I did. As a result, several men, and their guns, did not successfully return to the United States. 


""Security situation"". The words pull the Xanax blanket off from over my head again, bringing me back to the plane and keeping me away from memory. Don Draper motions to me to look at his phone, waving it frantically until it is an iPhone-shaped blur in my peripheral. I cave and skim the headline, ""An evolving security situation has been reported on Flight 802 at LGA, the aircraft is being quarantined. More updates to come."" 


I look around for the first time since take-off and see the sharp glow of cell phones against the unlit cabin, hearing the concerned murmuring of one-hundred and six passengers and six crew members. I'm squinting through the liquor when the first wave of panic hits me, as I understand I am now smack in the middle of something alarming instead of watching it happen from a satellite feed. The noises spreading throughout the cabin make it pretty clear I am not the only one coming to this realization.


The drugs are fading now too. Years of operating in a culture of secrecy and paranoia have caused my adrenaline to start flowing early, my stomach churning into battery acid. 


Then, the screaming starts.

188fs9,2,2013-02-10,Why are people such sheep?,[deleted],conspiracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/188fs9/why_are_people_such_sheep/,"With all of what's happening right now in the US specifically, including: criminal abuses by Wall Street, government spying and killing of innocents (foreign and domestic), police brutality, restrictions towards gun ownership, and in general, a gradual deprivation of our rights by the government, why do the majority of Americans just sit back and do nothing (in most cases aren't even aware)? As a college student, I am driven to a constant silent rage at this general apathy and lack of awareness by my fellow students, but also at myself because I can’t/won’t do anything about it. I am just one of the thousands of students being shepherded towards the stereotypical middle-class American life of: getting a degree (in my case, B.S. in Management Information Systems and Economics) getting a job working 9-5 to pay off students loans, and then starting a family. Even though I have some interest in my majors, a relatively decent GPA (3.5), and also several internship interviews coming up, I am constantly distracted from my studies. I’m just not sure what to do with my life anymore. Sometimes, I’ll feel the urge to go on a violent rampage, but most of the time, I’ll just try to distract myself by playing video games or working out. 

(End of rant. I know my life sounds kind of hypocritical, which is one of the reasons for my constant anger, but thanks for reading if you did. I do feel slightly less angry now.)

The technology itself fascinates me, but I am truly intrigued by the projected social impact. This summer I plan to be involved with the tech in some fashion, preferably one that pays and provides firm intellectual insight. 

I could possibly work in a lab at my school that is limitedly involved with 3D printing, or try to design and build my own, however neither would be financially rewarding. I hate that that is my constraint. Strictly learning and tinkering would be much preferred but sadly that doesn't pay the bills. 

My exposure thus far is limited to reading a lot, online and on paper and talking about it with some of my professors. I am a mech e, so I have dealt with CNC machines, mechatronics and have a thorough knowledge of the field in general. We happen to have over a half-millon dollars of printers here, however they are kept secure and are only available to those who take classes which require them (which are few and far between). I've tried my best but it's not enough to prepare me for an eventual career, whether it is on the tech side of things or more related to business practice.

Do you guys or girls have any ideas as to which start-ups / companies would be most receptive to hiring a summer intern? Thank you for your input. "
188e5c,1,2013-02-09,This is a long summary of my life and why I feel depressed...,grapesarentforyou,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/188e5c/this_is_a_long_summary_of_my_life_and_why_i_feel/,"I'm posting to get a lot off my chest and hopefully get some sort of help. This will probably be long but I just want to tell anyone who'll read why I'm depressed.

I've felt depressed for as long as I can remember. Back in middle school I wasn't popular at all and got made fun of a lot. By the time I was in high school I learned to laugh with the people making fun of me and act like I didn't care about all the jokes even though it hurt badly. After that, I started making some more friends and by the time I graduated ended up ""fitting in"" with the popular kids.

After I graduated high school I decided to go to a tech school for IT, the only thing I've ever been interested in doing for a living. After awhile, I found out the school was shit and dropped out to look for a better school. Around this time I started to get into Christianity (I grew up a Christian) and started going to church again. I made some friends who went to a Bible college and I decided to go to the same college they went to even though they offered no degree that I wanted to study.

I thought ""getting close to God"" would help my depression and make me feel better. One summer break I got the chance to go to Brazil to help build a church and then the next summer I went to China to learn Chinese. I met a girl that I became obsessed with in China and we became best friends. I went back the next summer to do an internship (I had decided to study ESL for my degree) at her school and got to see her again. I decided that I was in love with her and that we were meant to be. She didn't share the same feeling at the time but I made it my mission for her to fall in love with me. A year before I graduated college, I decided that I'd move to China to teach English and start a relationship with this girl. I joined a Christian organization to make getting there easier but their recruitment process is pretty strict. Since I was trying to ""be close to God"" on my application under ""is there anything we should know about you"" I wrote that I was struggling with pornography addiction. That turned into me being turned down by the organization after months of going through the recruitment process and the organization sending me to a therapist for a semester to get help and then try to join again. I went to therapy for a semester and it went great but in the end, they said I wasn't ready... So, after all that, I ended up joining another more relaxed organization and then moving to China.

It took about a half a year but I finally accomplished my goal of getting the girl to start to fall for me. We hung out a lot she stayed over a few times in my room in my friends' apartment. My friends were also Christians but the girl I was in love with wasn't. They got pissed that she stayed over a few times and then another one of my friends found out. Since they didn't like it (or her for that matter; they were never nice to her) I found my own apartment after about a month and she moved in with me. The third friend who found out about is was part of the same organization that helped me go to China and he told them that I was dating a non-Christian girl. That all blew up and became a huge deal. The summer after I went to China I had to go back home for a one-year checkup with the organization and in the meeting they told me I either have to break up with the girl or leave the organization. I chose the girl and said fuck the organization... This whole deal lead to me losing my faith. I've got a lot to say about that but now's not the time. Anyways, a few months after that happened the girl broke up with me. This devastated me. I left an organization for her and then she broke my heart. I went into deep depression and thought about killing myself a lot. I started drinking a lot, smoking, and even had sex with prostitutes. I told myself I'd never love another girl so why not do those things? Well, eventually we got back together but after that it was always on for awhile, off for awhile, and the same thing all over again. Even before we broke up the first time she treated me like shit but I was obsessed with her and made her my life. She found out that I suffered from depression and basically told me that I was crazy and she couldn't be with someone that doesn't have the mind of a ""normal"" person so I had to convince her it was just culture shock.

After awhile, I got a job teaching English. I hated it so much and hated myself for not sticking with an IT degree in the first place but I kept on doing it because it was the only chance I had to be with the girl. After a year of teaching English I told her that I wanted to go back to the states. This was when we were together so she said she supported me. We were doing alright together and we decided if we were really meant to be, being apart would could be a test. If things went well, she'd move to the states and we'd have a life together here. She had to go back to her hometown before I left for America and we constantly had problems. Finally, we just made the decision to just be friends. We knew we loved each other but we just didn't understand each other. (not a language issue; she speaks English and I speak Chinese)

So, now I'm back in the states. I've only been home for almost two weeks but I already feel like shit. The first few days were amazing. I bought a car the day after I got back and got a nice phone as well. I missed home so much. But now, reality is starting to sink in and it's killing me. For the past week, I've thought about suicide everyday. I miss my ex even though I don't want to be with her at all. I always think ""what if this, what if that""... That hurts but the thing that hurts the most is that I'm realizing I've given up a lot to come home. I gave up everything to go to China and now I've given up everything I had there to come back home. Before I came home, I had my own apartment and a high-paying university job. I was respected as a teacher and was actually somebody people looked up to. Now that I'm home, I'm just a loser. I don't have a lot of money saved up. I live with my parents. I don't have a job. I don't have a girlfriend. I've only got one friend. I've been trying to call someone who said could help me get started in the IT field for a week but he won't return my calls even though I've left four messages. I just feel like I've lost everything.

I hated living in China. The culture was interesting to begin with but the interesting stuff got annoying quick. The differences were just too big sometimes. I had a lot of anger issues in China just because I would get so frustrated sometimes. I hated my job too even though it paid well and people respected me. Now that I'm hope, I'm starting to think that living in a place that I hate doing a job that I hate is better than the life I've got here. Everyday I think about dying and feel nothing but sadness. Sometimes the sadness goes away but it makes me feel even worse because when I'm not sad I feel absolutely nothing.

I've left out a lot of details that I think actually matter but since this is already long enough, I'll spare you. Thank you for reading if you did.

tl;dr went to bible college and took a trip to china, fell in love with a girl and sacrificed a career I'd enjoy and two and a half years to be with her, it didn't work, moved home and now have nothing "

This is all so petty. I have much bigger problems. I have a problems that would make you cry yourself to sleep. I have just plain and simply had it with you. I'm sick to death of this actual physical pain in my chest that I get when you're around. I'm sick to death of having to take lorazepam and neurontin just to get through some days with you. I'm sick to death of everything being about you. 

You didn't even cross a line today. Today wasn't even the worst you've been to me. I don't know why today is my breaking point, but it is. 

So yeah. I guess in the long run, thanks for telling me that I look unprofessional today. That my outfit (a fucking grey graphic tee, black blazer, and blue pants - OH HORRORS!) is ""awful"" and ""a big mistake"" - that my t-shirt has ""obviously been washed too many times."" You look like a circus clown from the 60s. Head to toe purple, orange, and red corduroy that you sewed together yourself is also not a good look, you frizzy-headed bitch.

I've put myself out there for you so many fucking times, I can't even count them. I had the best relationship with my boss that a person can fucking have, and I used up my time and energy going to bat for you with her - calming her down when she was pissed at you, planting seads in her head against your enemies, telling her how hard you were trying. When all along, you've just been a selfish, controlling, manipulative bitch. You're almost 60 - when are you ever going to act like an adult!? Why are you so over the top dependent on everyone else, but you go out of your way to make enemies?! None of your shit makes any sense. Thanks a lot for having me in complete tears, by the way, the other week. It was nice of you to tell me off in front of the public and to tell me that everyone hates me. 

When you didn't get this job, because you're too STUPID to fill out a resume and an application properly, and when you stormed out of your internship because of it, I wish to god we had let you go. I wish to god we had let you go on your way. But we're nice. We felt bad for you. We felt sorry for you for spending so much time interning here to not get the job. So we went to bat for you. HUGE MISTAKE. You are just an evil, bad, bad, bad person. I hope that you get alzheimers like your psychzo father. Do you know what it takes for me to wish that on someone after my grandfather had it?!  But you're just the kind of shithead who can make me cross that line, finally, after 3 years of love and patience and training wheels with THIS BULLSHIT IN RETURN. And you want to whine to me about having depression and you CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER THE NAMES OF THE DRUGS THAT YOU'RE SUPPOSEDLY ON?! Yeah, I don't really even believe a word you say anymore. There's just no possible way that you've been picking up a prescription for decades and you don't know what you're taking. It makes me doubt everything you say. About your father, about your life, about your work. 

And speaking of work - since we all went to bat for you those years ago, and since we continue to go to bat for you and forgive you for your NUMEROUS PUBLIC TANTRUMS, could you maybe try to get some work done? I shouldn't have to take time out of my day to double-check and then fix everything you do. I'm not your supervisor! I should LET YOU FAIL! You can't handle the simplest of fucking things. There are so many people out there trying to get good jobs, and you're just ditzing around like a flightly little hell-beast on a drama-fueled rampage. God, just fucking die already. Please. Just go. Fuck you.

This is all so petty. I have much bigger problems.  I have a problems that would make you cry yourself to sleep.  I have just plain and simply had it with you.  I'm sick to death of this actual physical pain in my chest that I get when you're around.  I'm sick to death of having to take lorazepam and neurontin just to get through some days with you.  I'm sick to death of everything being about you.  

You didn't even cross a line today.  Today wasn't even the worst you've been to me.  I don't know why today is my breaking point, but it is.  

So yeah.  I guess in the long run, thanks for telling me that I look unprofessional today.  That my outfit (a fucking grey graphic tee, black blazer, and blue pants - OH HORRORS!) is ""awful"" and ""a big mistake"" - that my t-shirt has ""obviously been washed too many times.""  You look like a circus clown from the 60s.  Head to toe purple, orange, and red corduroy that you sewed together yourself is also not a good look, you frizzy-headed bitch.

I've put myself out there for you so many fucking times, I can't even  count them.  I had the best relationship with my boss that a person can fucking have, and I used up my time and energy going to bat for you with her - calming her down when she was pissed at you, planting seads in her head against your enemies, telling her how hard you were trying.  When all along, you've just been a selfish, controlling, manipulative bitch.  You're almost 60 - when are you ever going to act like an adult!?  Why are you so over the top dependent on everyone else, but you go out of your way to make enemies?!  None of your shit makes any sense.  Thanks a lot for having me in complete tears, by the way, the other week.  It was nice of you to tell me off in front of the public and to tell me that everyone hates me.  

When you didn't get this job, because you're too STUPID to fill out a resume and an application properly, and when you stormed out of your internship because of it, I wish to god we had let you go.  I wish to god we had let you go on your way.  But we're nice.  We felt bad for you.  We felt sorry for you for spending so much time interning here to not get the job.  So we went to bat for you.  HUGE MISTAKE.  You are just an evil, bad, bad, bad person.  I hope that you get alzheimers like your psychzo father.  And you want to whine to me about having depression and you CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER THE NAMES OF THE DRUGS THAT YOU'RE SUPPOSEDLY ON?!  Yeah, I don't really even believe a word you say anymore.  There's just no possible way that you've been picking up a prescription for decades and you don't know what you're taking.  It makes me doubt everything you say.  About your father, about your life, about your work. 

And speaking of work - since we all went to bat for you those years ago, and since we continue to go to bat for you and forgive you for your NUMEROUS PUBLIC TANTRUMS, could you maybe try to get some work done?  I shouldn't have to take time out of my day to double-check and then fix everything you do.  I'm not your supervisor!  I should LET YOU FAIL!  You can't handle the simplest of fucking things.  There are so many people out there trying to get good jobs, and you're just ditzing around like a flightly little hell-beast on a drama-fueled rampage.  God, just fucking die already.  Please.  Just go.  Fuck you.

Your friend who works at the company will get you an interview before your shining transcript or summer internship experience will.

I don't do this at all. In fact, I avoid it if I can. It's too difficult for me to put on a smile, make small talk, and socialize with people for the purpose of advancing career-wise. If I had to, I could probably do it for a couple hours and be the most charismatic fucker in the room, but any longer than that and I will probably have a mental breakdown and spontaneously start crying mid-sentence. What about others here in /r/INTP? Do you network? If not, why? If so, how often, and for how long? Do you consider yourself good at it?"

I feel like Reddit is my last hope, as they have been before. So I'll post word for word what I have elsewhere:

""I'm 17, 18 in September. For the past 6 months I've gone to countless fast food joints, retailers, car washes, etc and no one will take me. I even went on Monster.com and sent out hundreds of resumes, even to ones I know I'd never get (because who knows?). I feel so bad because my mom still has to buy me stuff and I feel like I should be helping out since she's a single mother that doesn't make all the money in the world. It makes me depressed and I want to help. Any suggestions?

A few more details:
-I've volunteered at libraries, cafeterias and carnivals.
-I've had no jobs prior besides the volunteering above.
-I am home schooled since 8th grade. Don't know how you'd take that.
-I'm not good at too much, so there's nothing I know of that would stand out of me.
-Out of all the job applications I've never gotten ONE phone call or interview. It makes me so depressed.

One last thing is that my mother and uncle work at the same company and are in VERY good standing there. Both there for 15+ years, barely missed a day of work, and I've met and talked to quite a few people who run things over there. I'm not sure if I'd be able to have any kind of opportunity there, even a internship or something. I would however have to be 18 so even if that was in the realm of possibility it'd be months. That's just me grasping at straws because I have no idea what else to do. I know there's people out there who search for YEARS and don't get anything that will say ""you haven't gone through half of the hardships we have to"" and all that. I realize that, but I just feel bad sitting around like a bump on a log while my mom goes to work and STILL pays for everything I do.""

Anyone have any tips, ideas, etc? The best advice I've gotten is to start my own dog walking/snow shoveling/etc. business which would be great, if I didn't live in a small community where that's already taken care of and there's no snow. I don't know what to do."

Looks like some of the formatting didn't work out too well, but it's mostly just stuff that's supposed to bold but didn't end up bold on the googledoc.

Is the objective too specific? Will it hurt me from getting other internships that don't fall under that category?

Anything else I should add or get rid of?

If this is in the wrong place or anything, please let me know!

So, I attended an evangelical church in a city I had just moved to for nigh on two years. Was in the process of applying to intern there for a year, as the church had really made me feel welcome when I was so alone, and re-introduced me to God.

However, in the interview, I was told that I was a 'rebellious, Jezebel spirit' because I had close (single) male friends, and because I lived with non-Christians. They told me I was tempting my male friends, and that I should imagine how their wives would feel about it. They are single... and I think that that sort of issue should be sorted out between husband and wife anyway, not the 'outsider' as it were. They also advised me to stop taking my psychological medication because it was destroying my relationship with God.

I told them that I disagreed with what they were saying, that I knew I wasn't tempting my friends (as they had other ladies they were interested in!) and I don't agree with gender segregation. I also believe in the power of modern medicine!

I was then told that I didn't really disagree with what they were saying, I was actually listening to the Devil, and my opinions were sinful and wrong. They told me that I need to submit to my elders, and that my opinions and thoughts were not valid. I was told I wasn't spiritually grown enough to understand what they were saying, and so if I was accepted onto the internship, I would have to sign a document saying I would obey all instructions; if they hurt or upset me, it was all for my good in the end. I was told I have fallen into bad patterns, and the only way to save me was through struggles and difficulties.

They also told me that I wouldn't be able to do the internship I had desired to do, because I wasn't spiritually grown enough; I would instead spend my time inside the church rather than out in the community, and be taught intensively. I would also need to move in with some ladies from church, join a more intensive small group, and have a new accountability partner. They told me again that it would all be for my own good.

I was upset, and so met up with the elders as well as the pastor and the other person who interviewed me, and told them my qualms with what I had been told. I tried to follow Matthew 18: 15-17 when setting up this meeting. Once again, I was told that I was spiritually immature and I didn't understand, and that they thought I had an evil spirit influencing me. I left, crying and upset. I haven't returned since, and now most of my friends who still go there don't speak to me any more. When I spoke to the only person who does still speak to me (albeit occasionally as he works there), he advised me to go back to the church, rather than carry on attending the one I go to at the moment (Episcopalian).

What do I do? Should I go back? Am I just rebellious and are my thoughts and opinions invalid when compared to those of the elders and pastors?

tl;dr: told that all my opinions are invalid and that I am 'possessed' by evil spirits, and should obey pastor unquestioningly. Should I?

EDIT: Thank you all so so so much for your advice, you've no idea how much it means to me to hear from people who aren't involved that I've done the right thing by leaving. I'm actually tearful, I'm that grateful. "

So I graduated December 2011 with majors in both Chemistry and Chemical Engineering from Purdue University and then worked for 6 months in my undergraduate lab as a Lab Technician. I was accepted to a PhD position at another school and thought I might as well give it a shot since it was a good opportunity but I realized I was incredibly miserable. So long story short for my own mental and personal health I left after my first semester and I am now seriously looking for a job. Nearly everyone I know from my graduating class had offers lined up with decent pay (60k plus annual, even kids that never had internships) but I am now having a hard time finding anything :[. This is mostly my fault I know, so I am very stressed about it. 

I do have one offer that looks promising so far but it is from a lab staffing agency as essentially a lab monkey... pay is shitty too about 14-17 an hour. I really dont want to pursue this one any further since I want to be an ENGINEER. I have been applying to positions online but I have had no bites so far. Preferably I would like to work in the pharma industry but I will take any process engineering job over a lab tech. Any help would be greatly appreciated! :)

Edit: Also another thing I am concerned about is the apparent dead time that shows on my resume - the time in which I was at grad school. Right now I have nothing listed on my resume for that time but I discuss in my cover letter that I was a PhD student that left due to personal reasons. I'm open to suggestions regarding this too so please let me know if there is a better way to handle it"

""I’ve made some poor decisions. I’ve also made some great decisions. The thing about poor past decisions, which I’m thinking is genetically hardwired into our DNA so we do not repeat them, we tend to remember them better and beat ourselves up when we do. It is not as common to think about the good choices we have made, to pat ourselves on the back and say, 
“Good-job for landing an extremely competitive internship with one of the hottest start-up non-profit organizations in (...),  or that your ability to run just shy of 4 miles in 30 minutes in amazing physical feat that not many can do.” 

Yes, it’s good to focus on our poor decisions to improve ourselves in the future. But this needs a balance. If we constantly berate ourselves, we ultimately destroy our own self-confidence from within. To me, losing hope in yourself is worse than your closest group of friends jeering you. In the end, only you have the power to rise to the challenge and only you have the power to defeat yourself.""

I DEFINITELY do NOT want to wait to get to Europe to purchase clothes as a) I **have** been to Germany before, and I know that I won't be able afford a lot of shopping on my intern salary and b) why not take advantage of cheap US prices and free/cheap shipping before I leave?

* Practical shoes for a LOT of walking (especially on those stupid cobble stones)
* Work attire
* Exercise clothing
* Party clothes (trust me, I go out a lot)

So any tips on how I can make this happen without several suitcases? I am a NOTORIOUS over packer.

And I am not sure if the rest of this would help, but here goes...

* **Height**: 5'1""
* **Weight**: 130lb (but it will go down again once I'm there, since I don't like European food very much, and from my past experiences, I can say that I tend to lose weight when I am abroad for more than a month)
* **Age**: 22
* **Body type**: I'm in that borderline hourglass/straight body. And at 32FF/G I'm pretty busty.

* My current style is vaguely feminine. I don't wear a lot of pants or t-shirts. I tend to wear my brown riding boots every day with tights. For some reason, I have a lot of see-through tops. I like dresses. I try to wear heels, but they aren't the most practical with all the walking I do.

I hope this is the right sub to ask this in, I'm just curious if anyone has had any similar stories and if you could help me resolve my feelings about this situation.

My classmate heard I was applying for an internship and basically asked me to show him where I found it so he could apply. I didn't want to show him but, of course I did anyway. I'm trying to be a good sport about it, since its not like internships are secret but it's been bothering me. 

I do realize that everything will be a competition like this when I get out of school but I still can't get over it. I feel like I helped him and he's like ""Cool. Bye"". I mean he's a nice person and all so I can't tell if I got taken advantage of, if I'm being immature or am I just future-tripping too much?  

Thanks for any input. "

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[1\) Piotr asked: Will Dreamfall Chapters be compatible with older Windows systems than Windows 8 (Win7, Vista, XP\)?  2\) Anna asked: Do you have any plans to make The Longest Journey remake somewhere in the future? One that would introduce better graphics, technicalties, maybe even expand the story?  3\) Anna asked: Was Dreamfall storyline cut short for some reasons? (I've seen a concept art with Abnaxus, who didn't appear in the game\)  4\) Scorpion asked: You mean, mean person, why won't you make April Ryan a playable character? PS. You're the best for making this sequel happen!  7\) Will Zoe have a diary? I mean real diary, with emotions, opinions and funny commentaries like April Ryan did in TLJ (one of my favorite things in TLJ storytelling!\), not dry almost-questlog like we had in Dreamfall.  8\) On Kickstarter page you've written that Chapters will be 3D point-and-click. Meanwhile, on GameSpot interview you've stated that the way we play the game will be somewhat similar to Dreamfall (though with much better interface\). Simple question: will we need to use keyboard (or pad\) to play Dreamfall Chapters?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8cralq?context=5)|We will try to make it compatible with XP. 7, for sure. I'm not the guy to ask but we'll try.  No, it wasn't, but Dreamfall was only the first part of the Dreamer Cycle. We were planning on doing Chapters a long time ago.  We are striving to make Chapters playable with mouse only, if you so wish, at least for the most part. Keyboard will be necessary for some things. A joypad won't be required, but it'll be optional.
[Sorry for so many questions (I'm just too curious I guess\), I hope you'll have at least enough time to answer to the community ones! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8cralq?context=5)|Yes. Play Chapters.
 |SO MANY QUESTIONS.
[How the hell did you guys come up with that rubber ducky puzzle? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8cr9cy?context=5)|I have no idea. I think it was the lack of sleep. Also, possibly, the drugs.
[Here's a few questions for you!  The women in your games! They're so confident and sassy! If you could reincarnate and choose your gender, which would you pick and why? Go on! Be honest!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8cri7h?context=5)|BEST QUESTION EVER. Look, I love writing women, I love being around women, but I also like being a man for lots of reasons! Not the least of which is...women.
[Why do you make games?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8cri7h?context=5)|I make games because I can't NOT make games. I love games. I love how they allow me to tell stories in brand new ways. I love how games allow me to do something so different and unique and new.
[Here's a followup to the first question, if you happen to read it: I understand what you mean with the mystery and immensity of nature, I love that feeling myself. But in today's hectic, wired world, I'm having trouble staying in touch with it. How do you manage to keep yourself grounded? Do you go looking for mythical creatures in the fjords? Do you head into the woods naked on a regular basis?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8csqtc?context=5)|The world around me keeps me grounded. My daughter, my family and co-workers, the fact that this is also a job, it's not just about crazy dreams and storytelling.
[Hi Ragnar! Thanks for keeping an open line of communication to us fans! :\) I just got Andrew Reiner of Game Informer to re-tweet your Kickstarter, btw.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8cr97m?context=5)|Lots of questions! Neat-o!
[Anyway, here are my questions, happy for any answers you can provide!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8cr97m?context=5)|Um, let's see... Maybe, probably, probably not, definitely yeee-- or, y'know, maybe! (Some MIGHT be tied to stretch goals, too.) And: yes!
[If it doesn’t imply a spoiler, could you tell us whether the Maerum, Venar, Alatien, or Banda will be sighted in Dreamfall: Chapters? Along the same lines; will we get to visit any of the fantastic locations from TLJ, such as Alais or any underwater city beneath the Sea of Songs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8cr97m?context=5)|It will be very non-intrusive, leaving the screen nice and empty unless you're interacting with things or looking for things to interact with. Design wise it will be very close to our Norwegian hearts, and reflect a Scandinavian design esthetic. In fact, the whole game will feel a lot more 'Scandinavian' than before -- from a design perspective. Not in terms of accents or Swedish chefs.
[What can you tell us about the game’s user-interface? Will it always be there, or does it make itself unnoticeable while we’re not using the inventory or looking in a journal, for instance.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8cr97m?context=5)|The landscapes will change! And that will be awesome.
[I think you mentioned shifting seasons in the game; will the landscape change around us or are ‘winter locations’ exclusive to winter, and ‘spring locations’ exclusive to spring, etc.?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8cr97m?context=5)|We hope there will be more games. This concludes the Dreamer Cycle, but the saga will continue.
[This game is said to conclude Zoë’s story. What of Arcadia and Stark; might there be more games set in that universe, or are you turning your eyes elsewhere after ‘Chapters’?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8cr97m?context=5)|Further localisations will be part of both stretch goals AND discussions with distributors in all the different territories. Swedish would be awesome, but a bit of a long shot unless someone from Sweden gets in touch (hello Sweden!). Norwegian is a sure thing.
[Might a stretch goal for the Kickstarter perhaps include further localizations? I would love a Swedish version with Regina Lund back as April Ryan.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8cr97m?context=5)|Not very finished at all. First pass only. They'll be massively improved.
[How finished would you say the areas in the released screenshots are? Will there be much tweaking to those before release, or do they represent the final result? They are spectacular, btw!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8cr97m?context=5)|Um, a bit hard, but our aim is 10+ hours. Does depend on our budget, so: Kickstarter, yeah.
[Can you give us a very rough estimate on how long it will take to play the game from start to finish at a normal speed, should the Kickstarter stay at your intended goal? Longer / shorter than TLJ/DF?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8cr97m?context=5)|Trick question! For the saga, it's April, definitely. For the Dreamer Cycle, it's obviously Zoë. And then there is Kian. Ah, Kian...
[Who is the real protagonist of the franchise, April or Zoë? I’ve always connected more with April, seeing as how she was first, and I really love her cynicism. But with Zoë getting the lead role in two games, you seem to favour her?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8cr97m?context=5)|No, YOU stay awesome!
[How did you choose the cities in which to set your characters in the future (Newport, Casablanca, etc.\)?  Were the choices influenced by personal travel experiences to those places?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8cr62m?context=5)|Good question! Newport was VERY influenced by years of living in the East Village in New York. It IS basically the East Village, a place I love dearly. As for Casablanca, I've never been there, but we wanted to build a new and shiny Africa, and it was also tied to a certain obscure, black-and-white movie. Marcuria is based on actual travel experience. Lovely place, great summers, nice people.
[I love China Miéville! Good choice!  Also, Marcuria reminds me a bit of Dubrovnik now that I think about it. Any connection?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8csffo?context=5)|Actually, no. I've never been to Dubrovnik. And now I want to go to there.
[I loved TLJ but absolutely adored Dreamfall (particularly the bits set in Stark\). I'm so excited about Dreamfall Chapters - Will you be trying to get Ellie Conrad Leigh back to voice Zoe?  She was brilliant, and in a recent interview she says that she'd love to do it again :-\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8cr5h1?context=5)|Hi...you! Yes, we will definitely try to get Ellie back. She's moved to Australia and hasn't done a lot of acting since Dreamfall, but we'll get in touch with her as soon as the Kickstarter wraps :-)
[Will anyone else be back to fill voice roles?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8crv30?context=5)|Yep!
[Howdy Ragnar,  TLJ blew me away when I first played it and is still my favourite game to this day. Whilst I loved dreamfall and thought the story was rather brilliant if not a bit annoying because of the ending *shakes fist* it was a backwards step from TLJ.  Is this new game going back to the roots of TLJ or is it going to be more like dreamfall?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8cr8j7?context=5)|It's going back to the roots, for sure. We love Dreamfall, of course, but we also feel that it may have lacked a bit of the magic of TLJ, so one of the things we want to get right with Chapters is just that: our roots. Point-and-click adventure gaming. The soul, heart and magic of TLJ.
[You've said before that the guiding principle of Dreamfall was the concept of ""faith"". April's faith in the world, and all that. I'm curious, what's the guiding theme in Dreamfall Chapters? Is it an extension of that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8crd3g?context=5)|Great question, because themes are SO important to us. Chapters is NOT about faith. Chapters is about...chapters. About the changes we go through in life, the 'chapters' of life. It's about growing up, growing old, settling down, becoming who you need to be and accepting that. And it's about embracing the idea of change AND embracing the finality of death.
 |I could write about this for hours. But I won't! We'll get back to this during the production of Chapters, though.
[1\) Will we see more to the white spookey girl in Chapters? What was her name again? Faith?  2\) Wich city will the game action be in this time? Will it still be Casablanca or are we moving to another place this time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8crmca?context=5)|No, Faith's story is at an end. Dreamfall was all about Faith (and faith) and Chapters won't be.  We will only see a tiny, tiny bit of Casablance. We're moving the action elsewhere. Marcuria's in it, though. And we have two new cities!
[Some questions, will we see the more of minor characters from TLJ? Such as Warren Hughes (was that his name? The kid who required the hacking done on his record?\) or some others?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8crc71?context=5)|We definitely want to revisit some of the more minor characters from the saga, yes.
[What did Funcom ask for in return for the rights to continue the game under a different company? (Congratulations on delivering to your fans and doing this - glad beeing able to represent a small part of the founding blocks\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8criaz?context=5)|There is some profit sharing involved, which means that they get royalties. Other than that, they've just been awesome to let us do this and not ask for anything up front. We appreciate that a lot.
[Hi Ragnar! You're not only one of my favorite game developers, but The Longest Journey is definitely my favorite video game of all time. I fell in love with the story and characters and have been following this series (as well as The Secret World\) for years now.  My main question: Will Cortez be back?! And can Louis Aguirre voice him, if he is back? I miss Cortez.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8crbat?context=5)|Cortez WILL be back MAYBE! Aw, do you guys REALLY want spoilers? Cortez has an important role to play. He's a huge part of the saga, and a big part of the Dreamer Cycle. Happy? I love him, the big lug.
[I love how one of the themes of the TLJ series is struggling with the feeling of being completely ineffectual. It happens to both April at Zoe at the beginning and the end of their respective journeys. This is a pretty unusual even controversial theme for a game. I don't really have a specific question but I'm wondering why you are personally so drawn to this idea?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8crhav?context=5)|Good question, and I don't know. I haven't thought about it, but you're right, this is true. Both of those games are deeply personal, and there's a lot of myself in both April and Zoë. So I guess it's something I struggle with myself. Feeling out of control, like I don't know what my role is in this world, or if I'll ever make a difference.
[You introduct lesbian relationship in TLJ years before it started to become common in computer games. Why did do decided to make such characters? And will we see more not-heterosexual characters in DC?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8ct3mk?context=5)|Because there are lots of gay and lesbian people, and why shouldn't they be characters in games? It seemed only natural to me. And yes, Chapters will have gay characters, along with other equally normal people!
[Who do you like more - Zoe or April?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8ct3mk?context=5)|I love 'em both. They're like my sisters, both of them.
[What role are you preparing for Kian Alvane in the story of DC? Could you reveal anything? Will he be the playable character? Best wishes!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8ct3mk?context=5)|Can't reveal anything yet, but stay tuned!
[Hey Ragnar, I'm proud to be a backer, and really looking forward to more of your work. There's real heart to it, and I'm happy to see the chance for it to continue.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8crevg?context=5)|Most of those will have closure -- or at least a continuation -- in Chapters.
[1.One aspect I loved about Dreamfall was its diverse cast. Sadly with almost every character left on a tragic cliffhanger in the last game will we have time to have closure for the less major characters as well as the main three? Like the White Dragon's fate, the remnants of April's rebels, whether Damien was arrested, and the potential of Roper Klack's book getting a reprint?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8crevg?context=5)|Yep, for sure! Chapters will start on a pretty nightmarish (literally) note.
[2.Another aspect I really liked was the atmosphere and the themes that Faith brought to it. I was wondering, can we hope to see more ominous psychological themes, and nightmarish atmosphere within the story?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8crevg?context=5)|Thanks for your support, we REALLY appreciate it!
[Hi! I'm so happy we will finally get a sequel to The Longest Journey and Dreamfall! I was wondering if Dreamfall Chapters can work as an ending to the entire saga or if it will be full of cliffhangers so we'll need another game to get answers to our questions?  If you plan on making another game, will that be first priority for Red Thread Games after Dreamfall Chapters is released or will you move on to other games (like Funcom did\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8crbjm?context=5)|It will not be an ending to the saga, but it WILL be an end to the Dreamer Cycle, and there will NOT be any cliffhangers. Not big ones. Not major ones. Teeny, weenie ones. Nice cliffhangers. The ones you can cuddle up with and feel comfy with.
[Will there be a dwarf in the game? Will he be Scottish?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8crml0?context=5)|Hell, why not.
[You said your most optimistic projections were barely half of what you accumulated on day one. What were your most pessimistic projections?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8cra6y?context=5)|Ha! Do you want to know? I can be VERY pessimistic.
 |Well, for me the worst case would just be...silence. Like, a few hundred pledges the first couple of days. I was prepared for that. Let's just say I was NOT prepared for this!
[When we will see new playable characters?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8crmaj?context=5)|In a couple of weeks we will reveal a second playable character!
[Hi Ragnar, you're awesome! Somewhat unrelated to the Kickstarter: what are your favourite games?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8crby7?context=5)|Ooooh. I like these questions.
 |Last year it was Journey. I loved, loved, loved that game. All time? Day of the Tentacle, maybe, or Civilization. Right now I'm playing Ni No Kuni and it's amazing and beautiful and sad and lovely. Um...I love racers. I think Forza Horizon was one of the best games of last year. Katamari Damacy! Yeah, I love games in general.
[Hi Ragnar, are there any hints you can tease us with about The Secret World’s future story direction? Or is it uh… a secret? Thanks for doing this and best of luck with the Kickstarter! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8cr6vv?context=5)|The Secret World is in the excellent hands of Joel Bylos. We talk and he asks questions and I still write stuff and direct voice actors, but I try to not interfere much with what the team is doing. They're following the Big Plan, though, so I'm excited for the future of that game!
[Hi Ragnar! First of all congratulations, I'm happy to see how the kickstarter is at a 60% or so. My question is, what led you to create your own studio instead of sticking with Funcom?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8cra4a?context=5)|Mostly to get started on Dreamfall Chapters! But also to work with some of my favourite people again, and also to do something new and terrifying. I like terrifying. I'd been with Funcom for eighteen years, it was very safe.
 |And we have tons of ideas for the future too, and now we can do them, because we are LORDS OF OUR DOMAIN.
 |(not in that way though)
[Are you going to make the Chapters for which platforms?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8crhn0?context=5)|Right now it's PC (Windows) only. Mac and Linux will be our first stretch goals. I'd love to work on the Ouya and Steambox. And, of course, mobile platforms like Android and iOS. After that, maybe next-gen consoles, but it won't be a focus area for us.
[You know that the Steambox is essentialy a PC with Linux? So by supporting Linux you are going to also support the Steambox.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8cs79s?context=5)|Yep, you're right, but I'm sure there will be additional requirements, particularly in relation to how the game is controlled.
[Do you have/Have you had the complete story for TLJ saga since the begining, or are you sort of writing as you go?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8crcdb?context=5)|Parts of the saga have been locked down from the beginning. They're key to the entire story. Parts of it we adjust as we go along. Parts come out of the blue on a Tuesday morning, based on something we saw or heard or talked about, or something one of our artists have done.
[Edit: Also, will donate for kickstarter, just haven't decided on the tier yet. Good luck with the coming game! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8crcdb?context=5)|But for the most part, we have A Plan. And we stick to that plan in general, but deviate when it makes sense and when we come up with something better. Or when we read something our fans have theorised about and steal it because wow, our fans know their shit.
[How is making a 2D adventure game different from making a 3D one?  What are the unique challenges?  What assumptions were you forced to re-evaluate?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8crmv2?context=5)|Very, very different. 2D is easier, in a lot of ways. I'd like to go back to 2D again. We have had discussions. There are ideas. TLJH.
[Two questions -  1.\) How did you get started in game development? 2.\) What advice would you give to a near-college-age student who would desperately love to get into the industry - for the same reasons you have mentioned doing it yourself, simply loving games and the things they can do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8csd68?context=5)|I started out making games when I was 11-12 years old, and I kept doing that until I was 17. After that, I focused on what I imagined would be a career in film, and I went to film school. That actually brought me full circle back into games, when I did an internship with a development studio in New York, as an animator, and then subsequently got work at Funcom as a producer. So it was very roundabout, not your usual path into the industry.
[The Longest Journey was my first favorite video game when I was far too young to understand much of it, and I've replayed it probably hundreds of times since then. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8csd68?context=5)|Find what you're good at, focus on that, and be the best you can be in that field. If you can fill a position in the industry, and fill it well, you'll get a job. But the best way to go about it is to make your own game, either alone or with friends. Work hard, make something excellent, get it noticed, and you'll be on your way!
[ it really makes me want to write something even though I've never really written anything other than school assignments.  Do you think anyone can be a good writer just like that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8cs5pg?context=5)|I think people can do anything they want, if they put their mind to it, work REALLY hard, listen to advice and criticism, and don't give up.
[Also do you approach writing these games.  Do you just start somewhere or do you have different points pinned down in the story and just fill in as you feel like it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8cs5pg?context=5)|That said, not everyone can make money off writing, and not everyone will be able to do it well enough to make a living. But if you want to write, then WRITE. And keep doing it. Keep sharing your work. Never stop. Never give up. Not unless you're unhappy and you don't have the fire in you anymore.
[ if you pin down certain things, how do you decide on them? have you ever pinned something down and then kept writing and when you kind of catch up to it been like ""Nope, that ain't gonna work.""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8cs5pg?context=5)|Writing games is like writing anything. You have an idea, you work with it until it's more than an idea, and then you flesh it out and put it down on paper. It's very technical, a lot of grunt work, a lot of HARD work.
[What's the most important thing when writing a story?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8cs5pg?context=5)|We toss things out all the time, and rework stories from the beginning. That always happens. We discard a lot of what we come up with and write, and rewrite and rework it until we need to be done with it. And then we're done.
[Is there a difference in writing for a game compared to writing something like a book?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8cs5pg?context=5)|There's a huge difference between writing a book and writing a game, of course. A game is a collaborative effort, and you need to keep everything and everyone in mind. You need to keep your budget in mind. Every idea costs money, so you need to know what's doable and what isn't, what will be fun and what won't work, and you need to sell your stories. The team needs to believe in them.
[PLEASE tell me that Wonkers will be back for Dreamfall Chapters?! He's one of my favourite characters! (And I still want my own Watilla!\) ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8crsgc?context=5)|We sincerely hope so! Wonkers is amazingly lovely.
[What platforms will the game be on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8criq5?context=5)|PC first, together with Mac and Linux if we meet our stretch goals. Beyond that: Steambox, I hope. Ouya, maybe. iOS/Android, definitely.
[Will there be combat in the game? It felt pretty awkwardly implemented in Dreamfall.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8criq5?context=5)|No!
[Who is doing the soundtrack? DF had an amazing soundtrack and it would be good to see the same composer be on board. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8criq5?context=5)|Not sure yet!
[Hello Ragnar, Cesar Bittar from Phoenix Online here. Super excited over the Longest Journey.  As a designer myself, I've had stories in my mind that inevitably change over years if they are not fully written down. How different/same is the ""Chapters"" that we'll see in 2014 to the one we could have seen in 2007 story wise? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8crh34?context=5)|Some difference, for sure. We've grown. Time has passed. We've learned and gotten wiser. But the cornerstones of the story are the same.
[Do you imagine there would be any difficulty rounding up the same voice actors/actresses? Also could we get a callback to Fiona and Mickey in Chapters? I'd love to know what they've been up to after the Collapse.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8crnce?context=5)|I'd love to look in on those guys again.
[Here's a question, now that I'm in a position to ask one - How has the story affected you these many years since you started writing it? Has it always been with you, presenting itself in different circumstances? I know that I have carried it with me for more than half my life, and I'm certain it has been one of the most positive and distinctive factors that have made me who I am today. How do you think of it, from the perspective of having created the story and the worlds?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8crnrc?context=5)|Yeah, the story has affected me, and it has stayed with me. I think about it every day, and as I've said elsewhere, it's a very personal, very intimate story. TLJ more so than Dreamfall, but they both have a lot of my heart and soul in them. While I wouldn't say that the writing process was cathartic in any way, it was a story I needed to tell, with characters who had to exist, or they'd be chattering inside my head incessantly. They all had to come out at some point. They're all *me*.
[I am so happy Dreamfall Chapters finally is something concrete, and not just an abstract hope the future will bring, and I wish you and your team all the best in the making of the game.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8crnrc?context=5)|And this is why I had to return, why I couldn't let the story be untold. Chapters had to happen. It was preordained. 
[One of my favourite things about Dreamfall was just wandering around environments examining minutiae eg ""An Ancient Postbox"". Is this still going to be a part of TLJ in DF:C?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8crdma?context=5)|Yes! Definitely, definitely. Much more so than Dreamfall, I would say.
[I remember you saying not long after Dreamfall was released that from that point on, you'd only make Online games, due to the high piracy rate deemed of Dreamfall. What made you change your mind?  Personally I didn't buy Dreamfall because I didn't like the Demo, and magazine reviews said that it was an unbecoming sequel to The Longest Journey. At this point though I'm considering buying it from GoG.com and playing through it anyway, combat, stealth and bad controls aside.  PS: Any thoughts on re-releasing TLJ and Dreamfall in high resolution, and as for Dreamfall, in a Director's Cut with 100% mouse control and no combat? Ok that last one is a bit far fetched.  Also, regardless of what I thought about Dreamfall, I've pledged to your Kickstarter. Would be a shame to not see the continuation of this very long (15 years now?\) saga.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8cscqt?context=5)|That was Funcom's philosophy more than mine, to be honest, and also the world has changed a lot. Back then, there was no Steam, no Kickstarter. Things are very different now.
[I just have one big cuestion that I'm not sure you can answer right now. Here it goes: there is a big revolution about who is Lady Alvane. Would that be revealed in Dreamfall chapters?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8cre4v?context=5)|Yes! Maybe! Okay, yes, probably. But it's not as clear cut as all that. So...yeah. Do you really want spoilers?
[You are hinting that Chapters are going to have a little bit more freedom than Dreamfall. What do you mean by that? more areas we can explore and interact with? I always though that the biggest strength of TLJ was how big and deep the world felt.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8crq4z?context=5)|I agree, and yes, there will be more to do, more spaces to explore, more freedom in-between the narrative beats, more to interact with, look at, listen to and read. A bigger, deeper, richer world.
[Hey Ragnar! Congrats on the amazing start of the Kickstarter. Will the Tome of Balance and the other books be Kickstarter exclusives, or will they be able to buy later?  And will Leon Willet be back as composer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8crhq4?context=5)|The answer is really ""don't know"" to both! As for the first one, we want to make the Kickstarter feel exclusive, but at the same time we also want to make things available to people who didn't have a chance to pledge during this campaign. So we will do something on PayPal at some point, and it MAY include rewards that come from the Kickstarter. But like I said, we don't yet know.
[Ragnar, what is your method or process for developing the story for a game? How long does it take to go from concept and rough outline to full script?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8crw7t?context=5)|Wow, um, so hard to say. It really differs from project to project. With Chapters, we had the concept already, the rough outline took, like, a DAY. And the full script will be worked on until the last actor has left the recording booth.
 |I'd love to write more about this, maybe someone will ask me in an interview some day!
[850,000 dollars may seem like a lot of money, but it isn't really at all when it comes to making of entertainment. AAA titles often have tens of millions of dollar-budgets and even hundreds of millions at times. Dreamfall itself had a 5-6 million budget^1.    We haven't actually seen many successfully pledged games arrive yet(except for a few, FTL, woo!\), but the bigger projects haven't arrived yet for sure. We don't really know how much time and cost it actually takes etc.  How do you think it will be like having a sixth of the budget of Dreamfall and still trying to make a successor that can surpass the predecessor?   Also, unrelated to the kickstarter questions - which 'localization' is your favorite from the previous games -  the norwegian or the english one(or maybe a completely different one\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8ctbvb?context=5)|We have some money already, and we will be getting money from a few other sources, but the bulk of the budget will come from the Kickstarter.
[Are you kinda relying on breaking the 850 000 dollars with a lot, or do you find 850k to be a realistic amount of money to complete the game in a satisfactory way?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8ctbvb?context=5)|We are very confident that we will be able to deliver as promised. We're a smaller team, we're a lot more experienced, we have a very solid engine, and we know how to make games quite cheaply and efficiently.
[Are you tempted to add ""twitchy"" stuff like The Walking Dead does for ""combat""? If so would you consider a ""story mode"" the turns this off for people who like a slower paced, contemplative game?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8crmrs?context=5)|No twitchy stuff.
[Any chance for some non-linear storytelling in Dreamfall Chapters?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8creuh?context=5)|Yes and no. We will have a linear narrative, but we'll have loads of non-linear spaces where things can be done in any order you want. We call those places 'rooms' (although they can be as big as a city) and you will be able to wander around and do things at your own pace. Explore, interact, talk to people, and experience the world and the story in a non-linear fashion. But the whole game and story are linear by default.
[You could link these 'rooms', sort of transferring choices from one room to another. Would you consider this? It could give the player's choices more weight and freedom to play in an individual way. Replayability as well to figure out missed secrets.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8cs34c?context=5)|We are planning to give some weight to player choices, but we're still discussing that. And this isn't really a narrative with a lot of different outcomes. The TLJ saga is really about a preordained, predestined story.
[Do you have any reading recommendations right now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8cri7m?context=5)|Also The Great North Road by Peter Hamilton. Reading that right now. Good stuff.
[In the pitch video, you said Zoe saved April. But at the end of Dreamfall, I never really felt that was the case. Did I miss something?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8crrqv?context=5)|Yes and no. It wasn't obvious, even Zoë was confused about that, but it will become clear(er) in Chapters.
[Why there were fights in Dreamfall? Will there be any in Chapters? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8crs5u?context=5)|Not like in Dreamfall, no.
[Do you plan to make ""previously in the longest journey"" recap in the game? It'll help.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189al6/i_am_ragnar_tørnquist_creator_of_the_longest/c8csimu?context=5)|Yes, definitely!

18acc7,2,2013-02-10,Don't Know if I've[M24] fallen out of love with my GF[F23] of 5.5 years,WhatsTheNextMove,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/18acc7/dont_know_if_ivem24_fallen_out_of_love_with_my/,"I know that if i have to ask that question; have I really fallen out of love, that something isn't right.

I'm not sure how everything works here as far as structure, but i'l preface this post with some background. I feel it's appropriate since i've been with her for so long, and i feel that if i just wrote from a biased perspective in such a way to only confirm how i feel, I wouldn't be getting an unbiased perspective that i just can't get within my normal group of friends. 

[BACKGROUND]
My GF and I met the first week of college. It was a Summer semester before the initial Fall semester. At the time I had just gotten out of a relationship with my high school EX girlfriend of 2.5 years. I wouldn't sat that it was a particularly bad relationship other than the fact it was two equally dumb high schoolers with two opposing idealistic perspectives on what love is and what a relationship should be.(actually, writing that last sentence makes me feel like there might be a repeating chorus in love song that is my life, but I digress.)

My Current GF and I didn't start dating immedietly. I actually met her through another girl that i liked, but within 48 hours, i realized that i really didn't have it in me to be the second boyfriend to Jesus. We started dating in the fall, and after a rocky start when my EX made a surprise appearance sometime around homecoming, only for me to affirm that I had no remaining feelings for her.

Backing up a little bit, The first two months actually went swimmingly. Perhaps I might have appeared too clingy since i was the first one to say 'I Love you' only after a couple weeks. in hind sight, it wasn't the best idea, since I really had no concept of 'love' at the time, or at least not the same concept i have now. She returned the sentiment not long after, though I think that she was probably in the same boat.

In college, she was always such a go-getter; working really hard in her classes and always worrying about GPA's with a real interest in being at the top of her class. In college, I was more interested in learning than about trivial things like GPAs. I take on knowledge and apply it rather than memorizing for a test. because of that and my tenacity, i never got into the Advertising program at my school (GPA too low) and instead graduated with a degree in History; however, I was able to land an internship where i absorbed everything like a sponge and now I'm pretty successful working at a full service advertising industry.

She wanted to be a writer, and because of that, she internalizes a lot of her feelings; something that she's gotten better at over the years, but still far from my comfort level. I'm very open about my feelings; not in an overly expressive kind of way, but I'd much rather be angry for five minutes and talk it out in those five minutes than keep a grudge for a month and let it build up.

When we graduated, I was able to get a part time job at an agency for the summer with promises that it would turn into a full time job by the end of it. my GF though grew up very resentful of the state; not in a normal kind of ""i'd really like to live in London someday"" kind of way, but in a way where she blamed the state for her problems; the weather, the people, the driving, ect. I'm not going to be a cheerleader and say that where we live is the best place in the world, but if all you're going to do is hold up everything about your surrounding environment under a microscope, eventually you wont' see the good things about it. It's not like we live in Sudan or something.

Even though she had tons of Public Relations Internship experience, she never once reached out to them for a job. she was really resentful that she was still living here and often made exclamations that all of her problems would be fixed if she had just moved to New York City. I guess you could say that she stayed here for me, but i would have much rather have her

My rational for staying here, in a professional sense, is that it's a good stepping stone. work for three years, pay your dues, get the experience, and then we'll be able to move to virtually any city we want. I'd much rather be a big fish and a smaller pond growing fat, than a small fish in an ocean where you're as replaceable as the next tadpole that swims into your reef. (disclaimer: I have nothing against NYC other than the cost of living vs the pay. I don't live a lavish lifestyle, but i'll take a larger apartment here over a closet there if they cost the same.) If you were to ask me where I have inspirations to move to, i'd say Denver. It's got the city feeling of NYC without the over crowding and ski resorts. (that's not a direct comparison, but you get the idea) again, i digress.

Eventually I got a Full time job at another agency and I love It. She eventually got a contractor position doing Social Media, but it took her 10 months of unemployment and a direct referral from me. However in another 10 months, she was let go.

Because we had so many fights during her last stretch of unemployment about jobs and what not, i tried to take a less direct approach; subtally asking her if she's worked on her resume, see where she's at with her job search, ect. which brings us to today.

She's had some interviews, two of them actually in NYC, which were direct referrals from her older sister. I'm not against referrals; i mean a big part of the business is not what you know but who you know, but i would just really like to see her take the initiative sometime (her sister agrees with me; btw; what does it mean when your GF's Sister says semi-jokingly that 'she doesn't deserve you'?)


[QUESTION]
Sex has always been an issue for us. not that the sex is bad; it's great actually. She's just not interested in it. It always felt that any excuse was supplemental of the next excuse. for example, in college it was classes. if it wasn't classes, it was her internship; if it wasn't her internship, it was graduation; if it wasn't graduation it was not moving to NYC; if it wasn't not moving to NYC, it was unemployment; if it wasn't unemployment, it was now having a job; if it wasn't having a job it was unemployment again. If i had to throw a number out there, 2 times a month would be a big month. If i were in this relationship for the sex, i would've bailed freshman year. but why can't it be a bigger part of our relationship? why would that be a bad thing. we've talked about it and fought about it, and she still is always saying 'not now' with no explanation.

about a year ago, my GF said that she didn't love me anymore; quickly amended with she didn't love me the way she used to. This hit me really hard. thoughts of what i could have done wrong kept swirling though my head. I've never once cheated on her in any way. I know a lot of people say that and usually add an asterix of, ""this one time...but it didn't mean anything"" but in the five years we've been dating, i haven't once slept with, touched, kssed or otherwise anyone other than my GF. And i've been presented with opportunities also, but i love my GF too much to do that to her. 

I tried really hard to win her back. uhh...I got her a job, i threw a very lavish, very expensive valentines day, which only ended in a huge fight a week later leaving me feeling like she didn't appreciate me. Things have gotten better since then; a lot better, but now i feel like i'm the one who's drifting out of love. I mean, I love her, but things are defiantly different.

She's had two interviews in NYC, and i get the feeling that if she does go, it's going to be over as a natural bookend to our relationship. I mean, i hope not, but I just can't maintain this relationship 3000 miles away. Its hard enough getting her to express her feelings in person. I've entertained the idea of moving with her, but I don't know why i'm reluctant. I love my job and my friends, but i defiantly do intend to leave someday, just not today, you know?

but if she stays, then what? What if it's another 10 months without a job. How will our relationship improve with a job? she gets mad at me for the simplest things sometimes and paints me out to be the bad guy if i ever lose my temper.

I'm sorry if my composure has broken down. I've gotten a little teary eyed writing this. I just don't know who to talk to. in my circle of close friends, i'm the relationship guy. of my three closest friends, two have never had a relationship lasting longer than 3 months and the other has, but cheats like a scoundrel and has a list of women longer than the words in this sentence. I kind of wish i could talk with her sister about it, because she's very level headed and knows her just as well as i do, but I'm afraid to because who really wants to hear their sister's GF's boyfriend complain about their sister?

TL;DR
After 5.5 years and strenuous situations; am i no longer in love or should i ride it out for that much longer for things to get better?

18abk8,1,2013-02-10,Just laying out a whole bunch of stuff,bonerbags,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18abk8/just_laying_out_a_whole_bunch_of_stuff/,"I go to a relatively upscale school. It's the little things that get to me. The times when people make fun of me for having the same piece of shit phone for the last 3 years. When people point out my cheap-ass dollar store cotton gloves and ask me why I don't have a ""real pair of gloves"". I drink 4 dollar bottles of 10% shitty beer by myself before going out so I have an excuse not to spend any money but to still be a part of what's going on. I got to spend my last summer working a shit job digging trenches while I got daily updates on facebook of my friends traveling around Europe and doing internships. The other day a girl I know asked me to go do a course this summer in Europe. I don't have the guts to tell her I already know that there's no fucking way I can afford to go. 

The girl is another thing bothering me and it plays into my ever present feelings of anxiety. I tried to stop liking her since she has a boyfriend but she keeps on contacting me and then goes and asks me to go on a trip with her. I don't know what to think of the situation and it bothers the hell out of me. Throughout high school I was a pretty popular guy and managed to somehow always have a girlfriend or a girl on the side but I have had next to nothing the past 3 years. I don't know what it is. 

Sometimes my acne flares up again, that really destroys my self esteem. I had boils on my chest a few years ago that left pits in my skin. If the anxiety is bad and my self esteem is low from skin problems, sometimes I won't go to school. I know I'm a good looking kid but it gets to me.

My anxiety extends to my ideas about my future too. My ideal career choice (something involving intelligence/analysis) almost always demands military experience. I don't think I can make that kind of commitment, I think the lifestyle would make me lonely and just make things worse. I really have no clue what the hell I'm going to do about that. Having a family and finding someone to love is more important than a job, but I don't know what the hell else I will do.

Lately I've been self-medicating with weed. I got to the point of smoking it pretty much every day despite telling myself I would never do it more than once or twice a month. I've stopped now and I've always maintained some sort of exercise, so that's helped a bit, but the problems are still there.

Is there any field that would cover both CE and Physics? Would a major in CE and a minor in Physics be too much to handle? Would there be any benefit with a physics minor employment and internship wise? "

18eo6g,3,2013-02-12,potential solution to Atma's,mnkymn22,leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/18eo6g/potential_solution_to_atmas/,"hi guys! I'm new to this subreddit, so please be nice =) I'm currently a college student applying to the internship at Riot, as a game designer. For part of my application, I'm working on an analysis on Atma's Impaler. Here's a possible solution I thought of and wanted the communities input on it. Any constructive criticism would be awesome!

So currently, Atma's is one of the least used items in the game, seeing a producation value of .66% in all of LoL. Many say that it's unviable because the stats on it can easily be bought off other, more viable options (such as completing another armor item or buying a bf sword). 

My idea was to make Atma's build from Madred's and be turned into a jungler specific item. the stats would look something like

* **+70 armor** (combining madred's and chain vest)

* **+unique : 2.0% maximum health to attack damage**

* **+madred's unique effects**

**Pros**:  

* rise in carry junglers/decline in support-like carry junglers

* in turn promote more aggressive play

* more build options for junglers

* viable late game option for Madred’s

* junglers would actually upgrade their Madred’s

* bring back Atmogs/Fratma’s Meta

* rise in production of Atma’s


**Cons**:

* if bruisers other than junglers start rushing this, potential Meta shift to fast map objectives
 	e.g. really fast barons, dragons and buff steals

* would need play testing for configuration to keep away from bruisers

 	i.e. increase cost, unique attribute related to smite, etc.	

 		such as making the Unique increase AD percentage by amount  of smites used

* potentially too much armor (might need a different formula instead of chain vest)

that's what I had in mind. what do you guys think? 

edit: for all those down voting, could you state why? I'm open to constructive criticism."

This is a business card application that allows you to receive/store virtual business cards, and share your own preset cards with others. Your Klout score could be influenced by who you network with in-person

Notes:
* Handshake shows you people around you with the app, who you can send cards to (after in-person networking). Otherwise, you can search if you want to send your card to someone not near you, or text/email if they don't have the app
* Tilting your device horizontally while on the pile shows you the business card you were highlighting full-screen. The drop down arrow shows you the bottom half.

She studied abroad at my University from January-May 2012 and we've been together since January! We've visited each other twice since she left in May and she's coming back to visit in April. We are both scheduled to graduate in June 2013 and we decided we want to get married and live in the US. I just received a job offer after graduation that will be more than enough to support the both of us, so we think it's best to live here in the states. I start in June 2013. 

Sooooo...we're lost when it comes to navigating the marriage process :/ She will be visiting for 10 days in April, but can we just get married then? She obviously needs to go back to the Netherlands to graduate, but after that, can she come back? Or do we need to wait until we are both graduated and I start my job to begin the process? What's the best/fastest route to take? 

Also, will my future income be enough to justify financial support? I only make $10 an hour at my current internship, but will I need my parent's help for this aspect? 

ANY AND ALL TIPS APPRECIATED! THANKS SO MUCH!"

(WARNING long but hopefully enjoyable read)",[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/18e5fc/ladies_imagine_a_somewhat_nasty_breakup_9_months/,"Happy Squeaky Day!!!!
I have a plethora of words. It's never been a problem for me to think of things to say. Whether or not what comes out of my mouth or goes onto the paper should have been uttered at all, is another matter entirely. I'm learning to shutup. I'm sitting in Starbucks to write this. I hate Starbucks. I hate these people. They all go about their daily lives and they have no idea what's going on around them, nor do they care. ""Lemme get a Tall Vagina Latte for Karen!"" Comes the call that shakes me from my moment of self indulgent piteous reflection. I just want to get this over with. I want it to be over. I want this to be the last time your face flashes in my brain and sends butterflies of regret and loss scattering throughout my belly. I want today to be the last day I wake up thinking of you, and last night to be the final time I go to sleep trying to figure out what I could have done differently. I want to relegate you to my past on go on living for my future. I want what you so clearly have. But right now, at this moment, I want nothing more than for Karen to come get her goddamn Vagina Latte, cause I'm sitting right next to the pickup counter and this particular Barista is overly attached to the idea of fast service.

Even with my plethora of words, there is no combination I could string together which would turn back the hands of time. There is no sentence or turn of phrase that will make you forget just how neglectful I was of you. ""Sorry"" is a lovely word, and when paired with true intent, it can be a wonderous thing, but it does not make up for how I acted and it lacks the ability to swallow words that have already gone out to the ether. I think you know I am, so there's no use in saying it here. Tomorrow Laura will come and pick up your painting and some other shit I've been holding on to with the intention of forcing you to see me down the line, after that you will have absolutely no reason to contact me, I guess I'm scared that's what will happen. I have no idea why, as it's what I deserve and for a long time wanted.

I've been in a dark place that has nothing to do with you, and I'm finally coming out of it. When you left I had to take stock in my life, and when taken, what I saw scared me. Here I am at 32 going on 33, just having broken up with a girl who at the time I was glad to see go, but who I always knew deep down was singular in all aspects. A real diamond in the rough. That being said, to not let you go was not an option. How could I? When you were so close to something you always wanted, a chance to travel and to live abroad, a chance to pursue a dream and possibly end up in the exact career you've always wanted. What kind of person would I be, how could I even pretend to love you while at the same time refusing to let you go? This speaks nothing of my inward and outward neglect of you and our relationship, which I'm finally coming to realize was a result of more than one factor, but all of my own doing. The obviousness in hindsight that I had wasted the past year and a half of my life, if not the previous 33 years, on my own, and now had no one to point the finger at. All along the finger should have always been pointed squarely at me, but I was too weak and too scared to acknowledge it. You didn't make me stay in LA, you made me want to, but the choice was mine and I chose it and I would again a thousand times over. You didn't make me keep doing Locations (in fact, on more than one occasion you begged me to quit), but it was a convenient out to say I had to keep doing it to support ""Us"" and infinitely shitty of me to silently resent you for following the dreams I insisted you pursue and fully expected to pay for. You didn't make me smoke weed and play video games nonstop, those were all escapes I invented to avoid looking at the cold hard truth. ""I am unhappy, and nothing I've done to this point in my life suggests that I have the will or the means to change that fact. This is my life now and this is my life forever, I have no one but myself to blame. I am worthless,"" echoed in my head over and over again, every minute of every day, week after week, month after month. With the constant cacophony of negative thoughts and the reality of my situation fully revealed, I'm not too proud to admit, I lost something over those months. I wrongly thought it was you. I now know it was the part of me holding me back.

So I begged and I pleaded, I told you I would change, I told you things would be different. It was a lie. Oh I believed things would be different. I believed if I could only get you to show concern, if I could only get you to care about my plight, that would prove you still loved me, you still cared, but you weren't the problem, I was. If you had done what I so desparately wished, nothing would have changed, cause I would have been the same. Scared of failure, scared of going out on a limb and because of that fear doomed to live in the very situation I never wanted. Besides, and this is the best part, where the fuck do I get off asking you (now my ex) to give me the exact same considerations which I so miserably failed to provide you when you needed them most? Then, to top it all off, I began insisting you return the one thing I provided infallibly (as meager as it may have been) just because I was going through a hard time? Indian givers are the worst with a special place in Hell reserved just for them, and I'm embarrassed to have even gone down that road. I'm shaking my head now, and Karen finally having gotten her Vagina Latte is giving me a strange look as I do so. I can only imagine she's bewildered by the expression on my face. It's a mixture of regret and shame, and it's making my coffee just a tad more bitter. Keep all that I gave you Squeaky, it was given with love and respect, which I also gave and give to you ad infinitum. Should you return it, I hope you will do so in the same spirit, but I will not accept anything but the gesture.
Just a couple more paragraphs, then you will be done reading this and hopefully aware of why I did what I did when I did it. I don't expect you to respond or frankly to care, nor do I necessarily need or want you to. This letter is an attempt to give you and therefore me, some solace about the situation. It is the last and least of all my selfish gestures. To relieve you of culpability. To make me less of an enemy and repaint memories of me in a kinder light if only in my own head, so that I can forgive myself for failing me and by association you. I don't know if it will work, only time will tell, but just getting these things on paper and knowing they'll reach you someday, will hopefully allow me to move on and forgive myself for mistakes I've made but no longer have the right to correct. 

When Joey was little, I'd say about 9-10, he somehow got a copy of The Amazing Spiderman #1. This comic book is worth nearly $25k, but obviously it wasn't worth that back then (sometime in the 70's). To 9 year old Joey, this was just another comic book, to enjoy, to read, to leave on the side of his bed where it dropped from his hands the moment he fell asleep. Essentially, though a great comic book, and in retrospect the first edition of one of the most famous characters in Nerd History, this was just as normal as any Archie or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles trash that he got on any other day, and 9 year old Joey treated it as such. Talk to him about it now and you can see him mentally beating the ever loving shit out of his 9 year old self for his lack of foresight, cause 9 year old Joey traded that comic book away once he was done reading it. To him, it was just another comic, because he didn't know what he had till it was gone. If through some trick of Science Fiction present Joey could go back and talk to 9 year old Joey, he would relate to his younger self an appreciation of what he had, to cherish the unique gifts life sometimes presents, and to adore them for what they are. I'm also sure that 9 year old Joey, even armed with that information, would probably treat the comic just as cavalierly. You see 9 year olds lack perspective and describing to them the concept of rarity and accrued value is probably no easy task. To say nothing of the implications to the space time continuum (imagine my nerdy voice here) when one goes back to change even the most insignificant moments in human history. But should he somehow be returned to his specific issue of that comic in the now, he would definitely treat it with the ador and intimacy it deserves, if for no other reason than second chances are rare and he would feel happily obligated to make up for his past neglect. I think the metaphor here is pretty clear, but I do want to put in the disclaimer that I don't expect to get a second chance with you no more than Joey can expect to be walking through a comic shop and happen upon that very same issue of Spiderman. I will get another chance at something special, but our moment has passed. Also just as Joey lost his comic book for a reason, what happened with us was inevitable as our lives were going in different directions and these trajectories were impossible to stop without even more heartache. You needed to find your feet as well as your place in the world, and being with me wasn't allowing you to do that. The joy I felt in having you was masking my dissatisfaction with how my life had turned out to that point and you unknowingly provided the exact kick in the pants necessary to motivate me for change.

The comic book analogy is one of perspective. I want to illustrate to you that I know I was wrong, I know that there were problems and those problems were caused mainly by my dissatisfaction with my own life, but never with you. You were a convenient scapegoat, as others had been before you, but because of you will be avoided in the future. A part of me always realized how special you are, and the weaker part of me allowed the rest of me to be blind to that fact. As illustration of me knowing my mistakes as well as a display of just how much I've thought and been tortured by them, I will list them for you here:

1) I should have gotten you more than a discounted phone for that first Christmas. You never wanted my money, you only wanted tangible displays of my affection and love for you. You would have been more happy with a rock, if it had the right sentiment behind it.

2) I should have made every birthday special. It's your day and you are special. It wasn't and isn't too much to ask that I take one day out of a year to really show you through action and deed that I recognize I am very lucky to have you in my life.

3) I should have taken you places and shown you things. You so desparately wanted that. I was afraid. In the moments of my past where I have been the sole bread winner, I had been taken advantage of. You never did that, but that doesn't mean I was stupidly afraid you would. Not an excuse just a lame, weak reason.

4) I should have quit smoking pot. I have no other excuse other than I am weak, at the very least weaker than you and I was afraid without the weed, life would be boring. Fear should never be a motivation for anything aside from escape from imminent danger. 

5) I should have brought you to NOLA to intern at Tulane at the very least to be close to you. I didn't want that at the time though and I sincerely think it's because I was distancing myself from you because I knew you'd get into Bristol and if you did you would go there. I didn't think you or I could handle that unless I could maintain detachment. Man was I stupid. But now you're happy, so I guess in the end my reasoning was sound.

6) I should have shown you how much I love you every chance I got, but I didn't want to and it was because I was stupid, scared and stupid. I have no other reason.

7) Valentine's Day. Simple. What was important to you, should have become important to me no matter my personal feelings on the stupidity of the holiday.

8) I shouldn't have begged to get you back when I was the one who pushed you so far away. Stupid. Along with that I should have stood by my position that anything I said was yours was yours, and I should never have tried to get it back, no matter what my situation. In reality though it would be of huge help to me, I was doing it only to get a sign that you cared, and it was clear that wasn't going to happen, because I had done nothing to earn your concern.

9) I should have supported you, period. For no other reason than I said I would, and I love you. I instead resented you for what I thought was taking advantage of me because I felt somewhere inside I didn't deserve you.

10) I should have listened .... more .... constantly .... with all that I had. I should have listened.
There's more, and I could and would spend all day going over them in my mind and trying to put them down on paper, but I doubt you'd want to read them (I think I could go up to about 30, I was a pretty neglectful douchebag), so I will spare you all of it. I mention these cause they are the ones that are on my mind currently, but a whole slew of them are constantly swirling around in there. Mistakes, I should mention, that I've learned from and would never make again with whomever would give me the honor of putting me in a position to make them. Lessons that I never would have learned if I never met you, if we'd never been together.

Getting close to the end here. This must seem like an epic letter, it may bring up some emotions, but I doubt many on your end (maybe I'm wrong). I don't mean for the letter to be epic. I'm better now. I'm coming out of a pretty deep and dark depression caused by the many realizations I've had since you left. I have a girlfriend who is awesome, kind, caring, and lovely. I'm volunteering at a Neuroscience Lab at UCLA. I'm working Locations but able to still concentrate on aspects of my life I want to change. I'm applying to Journalism Grad Programs for the Fall of 2014, to pursue my perfect career (Science Journalism, I'm sooooo psyched), the working is so that I'm able to pay for it without taking too many loans. I'm taking sailing and/or flying lessons (starting next week) and I'm finally cognizant of why, for most of my 33 years, I've had a constant undertone of sadness I tried to mask with pot induced distractions and reliance on others. Even with, or in spite of, all these changes, there is something missing, and I guess this letter and returning your stuff is my final attempt to fill in that void, or at the very least do right by you in the end. I want, not need, not demand, just plain want you in my life. In whatever capacity you are able to muster or feel motivated to pursue. I've let go of so many things only to regret the loss later, I'm not ready to let go of you entirely just yet, and I'm hoping you can find it in your heart to accept my ammends and honestly try to stay in touch. That being said, in the end, all I really want is for you to be happy with or without my involvement, and more importantly for me to find that happiness myself. The shortcut to some happiness would be for you to write back and tell me how things are going with you, in whatever depth and fashion you feel is appropriate. Doing so will allow me to forgive myself finally for the mistakes I made, and would be a clear indication that at the very least you value my presence in your life and I haven't ruined whatever value you may have perceived in maintaining a relationship with me. You have my address, you know my email and you will always have my number. I know I've done very little to deserve even this, and am already ok with the idea that I'll never hear from you again, but I'm hoping that won't be the case and wanted to display clearly and openly that I'm here Squeaky now and always without condition. That I will live the rest of my days (ugh so lame and drama filled, but the truth) thinking fondly of you and silently wishing you get all the things your little heart desires. And hoping, every once in a while that I'll get to hear of your successes, and that in spite of it all, you'd like to hear about mine.

 Today is Valentine's Day, which you know I don't care about. Thankfully, Lauren (my new special lady) doesn't care about it either. I was lucky enough to find a girl who shares my particular alternate views on the subject. So with reverence to you and respect to your constanstly ignored wish for me to make it important, I am rebranding Valentine's Day in my own head. For me, from this point forward, it will no longer be a day where I'm forced to buy candy and flowers for whichever girl, present or future, is lucky enough to call me theirs. It is Squeaky's Day, and on this day for the remainder of your days here on Earth keep your eye out, I've missed two already and I don't plan on missing another. Squeaky's Day is so much better than Vantine's cause it's dedicated to you, the truest love I've known and lost to date and I'm determined to never forget that.

I hope this was well received and please take every word for Gospel. I don't expect or demand you respond in any way. I don't expect anything from you except that you live your life and be happy. Like I said I would love to hear from you, when and if you are ready and I would be immeasurably happy just to hear your voice or read your words no matter what they said.

Love in whatever capacity you can accept, now and always,
EDIT: Removed my name

PS Behind the ghoulish cyclists find the red string, pull the string and you will find the first Squeaky's Day tithe. It's nothing huge, and I only ask that you retrieve it on your own, if and when you get back. Just a small surprise to show I'm here. No drama, no expectations just a trinket and a trifle for my one and only Squeaky on the day I have now made for her."

I've already submitted it, but was curious about how feasible/viable y'all thought the idea was.

Concept: Not many people use Klout on a regular basis. I wanted to make a Klout-oriented product that did provoke more constant usage. This is a business card application that allows you to receive/store virtual business cards, and share your own preset cards with others. Your Klout score could be influenced by who you network with in-person

Notes:
* Handshake shows you people around you with the app, who you can send cards to (after in-person networking). Otherwise, you can search if you want to send your card to someone not near you, or text/email if they don't have the app
* Tilting your device horizontally while on the pile shows you the business card you were highlighting full-screen. The drop down arrow shows you the bottom half.

I can answer any questions about my design decisions but really want some feedback from all of you. Thanks guys :)

18dzxu,0,2013-02-12,Canadian universities(Masters degree) and permanent residence.,[deleted],canada,https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/18dzxu/canadian_universitiesmasters_degree_and_permanent/,"This might be a bit early to post this but I would rather know everything ahead of time rather than asking questions later when I might have done something that can make things harder for me later without knowing it. I asked /r/IWantOut and they gave me a few short answers but I didn't get enough actual answers so I thought maybe it would be best to ask people who are actually from Canada.  **TL;DR WARNING**

I'm currently enrolled in one of the top universities in my country, in the life sciences program and will be majoring in biotech next year when majors need to be picked.

Now I've wanted to immigrate for a LONG time and figured that getting a masters degree and trying to immigrate as a skilled worker is probably the only way to do that, so I'm getting my bachelors here(it's dirt cheap compared to North American universities) and then will be applying to Canadian universities for my masters(Probably in biotech or genetics, both apparently possible with my degree according to my university but apparently it covers enough subjects that I can expand it to a number of science related fields for my masters)

So I have a few questions:

Will graduating with high scores from a good university in Canada make me eligible for permanent residence?

Which universities are good for STEM degrees? I heard that in the US and Canada there are recruiters in universities(different ones depending on the subject the university is best known for, I know a guy who got recruited for both microsoft and google because he went to the right university), is this true and if so which universities should I be aiming to apply to? If I do get ""recruited"" for internships or even a job after I finish my degree it would definitely make immigration easier. I googled Canadian universities but I noticed that there is an insane amount of shit talking for any university in the entire country so I don't really know what to make of it.

Also, someone in /r/IWantOut suggested looking into a TA or RA job while I'm there because it could get me free tuition or something, but didn't elaborate. Would this really get me free tuition/living expenses? And most importantly, does doing something like this count as job experience that counts for permanent residence? I heard I can apply for a work permit during my stay under the student visa but also that entry level jobs most students get such as working in a shop or being a waitress don't count when you're filling in the permanent residence application papers.

Do I need to completely finish my degree(as in have a diploma in hand) to apply for my masters or can I do it during my last semester? If everything goes well and I won't have to extend my studies I will be finishing my degree in January 3 years from now, but exams extend until march and by the time everything is finalized it'll probably be too late to apply to start the upcoming fall semester. I was wondering if it was possible to apply earlier so that I can get everything in order and start right after finishing school.

Either way I don't have any work experience here, am working on my degree(at the beginning so if there's any stuff I need to do to get into a Canadian university like extracurricular activities or recommendation letters from professors I still have time to do all that once I know exactly what I need to do) 

**TL;DR** *desperate to get out of this place, trying to do it through getting a degree and wondering if I am going about this right or not*"
18dz0y,1,2013-02-12,"Struggling to engage with or get any enjoyment out of life, failing university, feel like I need a break",gourangamanga,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/18dz0y/struggling_to_engage_with_or_get_any_enjoyment/,"So despite not having anything particularly substantial to feel bad about, I pretty much feel horrible all the time right now, and think about suicide daily (though I think I'm a long way from actually doing it). I haven't attended university in nearly four months, I've missed all my deadlines and exams and I'm in my final year where everything really matters. 
 
I'm seeing a doctor on Thursday and expect to be diagnosed with depression. I've also started seeing a councillor, though I'm not sure if it's really helping at all. I hope that I will be able to get extenuating circumstances, which will allow me to either sit my missed exams and assignments in August, or else repeat them next year.
 
If I repeat the year, I'll have to spend another year at university, which will cost me - but I'm fairly sure I can actually afford it. Given a full year, provided I can get and stay healthy, I can hopefully get a good degree and be an employable graduate. Alternatively, I could repeat the year, make all the same mistakes again, be in this exact same situation this time next year, but a few grand down. 
 
If I don't repeat the year, I'll have to start studying again, and work hard to catch up. I haven't really done any work in a long time and right now I don't feel remotely capable of doing it. Just thinking about it fills me with an overwhelming sense of dread, despair, regret and self-loathing. Having said that, probably the best outcome would be to do this. I think that if I started working hard tomorrow and kept it up, finishing the work I missed over summer, I could probably graduate with a half-decent degree. But right now that feels impossible, I wish it were as simple as flicking a switch.
 
This makes me more inclined to accept that I'm not well right now, and focus on getting myself better and also figuring out how to stay well (depression's been a recurring theme in my life), before trying to take on anything difficult like getting a degree. 
 
However, a part of me thinks that this idea of taking a break is just a way of putting off work because I'd rather not have to do it right now, and the only thing that will change if I take a year out is that I'll be that much older and poorer. Furthermore, I already have a job lined up with a company I did an internship with, so I'd have to explain to them why I'm not graduating this year and possibly lose the job opportunity, but that's hardly the end of the world.

So yeah, I guess my plan at the moment is to see what my doctor suggests, talk to my university tutor about possibly postponing my studies, and then find something to do to get myself into a good frame of mind again.

Well, thanks for reading, I guess. Any advice?"

I am a returned peace corps volunteer and lived abroad for three years, making many contacts.

On the e-QIP, I didn't list any foreign contacts because the words ""bounded by"" led me to believe more than just associates or friends. I have already submitted my e-QIP which cannot be changed. Now I need to submit my SF-86c (which I've included foreign contacts). 

Did I just screw myself? I need to list foreign contacts, but there can't be discrepancies between the e-QIP and SF-86c...Should I just submit it with the contacts and include a statement explaining the omission?

18drd1,0,2013-02-12,Should I leave the United States if I'm overworked?,[deleted],IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/18drd1/should_i_leave_the_united_states_if_im_overworked/,"I'm 20 years old. I've been reading a lot about America being extremely overworked and in my own life I have seen it. My dad works upwards 50-60 hours a week and only gets 1-2 weeks vacation a year. Almost every person I have come into contact with complains of being overworked.

I live at home because I can't afford a place right now, I'm currently looking for work as a pharmacy technician (I just got my certification), and I'm planning on marrying my fiance sometime in the next 1-2 years. Pharmacy technician is a temporary thing and I don't plan on doing it forever, although that may change. Who knows?

I have had 2 jobs before now. A part-time retail position and a full-time 12-week internship at a public park. I hated both of them because for some reason I suck at absolutely anything manual labor. I'm fine with working 40 hours a week, but not much more than that.

Overall, I have to say that I just feel depressed. I have no reason to be. But I just feel like this is it. Once I move out, my life will suck forever. All because of the place I was born. You can call me entitled or lazy. I don't care. The fact that I will never have any time to enjoy my life and I'll likely never be able to retire or have financial security depresses me to no end. I value my time. I value my family, my hobbies, traveling the world. And I'll never be able to do that. Yeah, first world problems and all that, but it depresses me all the same.

This leads me to my question. Should I leave America if I'm overworked? Fuck it, I have one life, one chance to do what I want, and I've decided that I will not work myself to death while having enough to live. So if I ever decide to leave America, how should I do it and where should I go if I should leave at all? Me and my fiance of course have family here, there's culture shock, there's financial concerns, all of that. So I don't even know if it's possible. But I want to enjoy my life no matter the cost.

My dilemma in equation form is this:

Living in U.S. + Money = No Time

Living in U.S. + Time = No Money

Time + Money = No Living in U.S.

Which one of these should I choose and why? I value my time, money isn't as important to me but I obviously want to make ends meet and save some, and as much I want to stay in the U.S., I will leave if I can't do this. So, what should I do and why?"

I decided that in lieu of introducing myself and telling you about my hobbies and whatnot, I would just cut the crap and start things off with a contest! The title says it all, send me awesome automotive *(and thanks to eatcraftsleep, motorcycle)* photography **you have taken**, and one month from now (Ending 3/15), two lucky members will be gifted with one of my Family Prime spots (henceforth, you will be my sister/brother). 

Entrees will be put into a spreadsheet, one entry per user who submits a car/motorcycle photo. Each entry gets a number, using Excel's RANDOMBETWEEN function, I will pick two random numbers from the array of submissions.

Now that that's out of the way, you can quit reading.

Oh good, youre still here, so let me introduce myself, I am a recent graduate with a BS (and the 4 years of schooling certainly made it feel like a bunch of BS) in Mechanical Engineering. Thanks to my father's connections as a professor, I was able to obtain a paid internship early into my college degree in a small, but rapidly growing, aerospace firm. After two years of interning, they decided to take me on full time, and I am now happily (most of the time) employed. If you hadn't gathered from the contest, two of my favorite past-times are photography (i am new to this) and autos (pretty experienced in this). I got myself a starter EOS T3, and am slowly working on building up my skills/equipment. On the other hobby, I have an old beat up 1991 Acura Integra that got me through high school, college and the beginning of my career and a 2005 BMW E46 M3 that I gave to myself shortly after graduating as a congratulating gift.

tl;dr - Two prime spots for your awesome car shots! Engineer, likes photos and cars.

I'm a current PhD candidate at a top 20 school [in the US] in Chemical Engineering and I'll graduate in n years, where n&lt;=3 yr.

My issue is the following: my research is entirely computational. I do molecular dynamics simulations.  I don't and will not be able to obtain any graduate experimental experience (I've tried).  I do however have undergrad experimental experience and internships.

I'm curious about the employment options I'll have when I graduate. Many companies do not do molecular dynamics simulations, and I don't even think I want to do that for my entire life.  Ideally I'd like some balance between simulations and experiments.

I've been asking the question of employment possibilities for some time now, and I seem to be getting two types of answers.  The first answer says that it doesn't matter that I don't have any experience on SEM, TEM, AFM, [insert-abbreviation-here] --- that companies are looking for PhDs because of their thought process and problem solving abilities, and that they will train you on whatever you end up doing.  In addition, this answers says that most PhDs in companies do not actually work in the lab themselves but rather run a small group of scientists (and this I totally agree with, I've experienced this in my undergrad days during internships).

The second answer advises me to get my hands on any experimental projects that I can get (although I am unable to get any).  It warns me that I'll have a very difficult time obtaining a job in the future with a purely computational background. 

I just don't want to end up in a situation where I graduate and can't find a job because what I did in my PhD is not very often used in industry.

I've also played around with the idea of doing an experimental post-doc, but here again, I ask myself, what professor would pay to hire me as their post-doc when I don't have any graduate experimental experience?  In addition, if I do end up miraculously finding an experimental post-doc position, would that put me in the academic track, and close the door to industry?

What has your experience been with the hiring process for PhDs?  Are companies looking for specific skills (such as expert on [abbreviation-here]), or do they hire PhDs for the thought process?  Is there anything I should absolutely do now before graduating?

I look forward to any advice you can give, and I apologize this is so long! Thanks!"

If I study for a B.Sc in physics in Germany, what kind of jobs would be open to me? Would I have to do further studies? 

Essentially, what I'm asking is how I can keep my options open? There is a possibility that I change my mind and I feel like going into research. At this point, the odds of that happening are slim, but going from humanities to physics is hard, and would require a second bachelor's. I am no Ed Witten!

Would say, an art gallery, a library, a consulting firm, or environmental non-profit, be against the idea of hiring an undergraduate physics student for an internship position? I guess that relevant experience could help me get a job. Would ""networking"" help, in that regard?

We're both in graduate school at the same university and met on our first day.  We quickly became close friends and then began dating.  We moved in together after around 3 months of dating.  
I never thought someone like him would or could have existed in this world.  He made me laugh and think more than anyone I had met.  He was my best friend.  Lately, since we've begun working on our theses, things have gotten a bit tense between us.  We are both extremely stressed out with internships, classes, and our own research.  We made it a point to spend quality time together at least once a week with an extra special date once a month.  Those ideas haven't worked...

A few nights ago I got home after hanging out with some friends.  I told him I was upset that he decided to stay home and play video games instead of spending time with me.  He flipped out on me.  Things escalated and he grabbed me by both of my arms and shoved me across the room.  He left the house and I followed - wanting to get some insight into his mindset.  This was a terrible idea.  The fight escalated even more and he grabbed me by the arms again.  I have bruises now.  

This afternoon, he tells me that he's going to have drinks with a female friend of his on Thursday.  I've never met this girl and she was open about wanting to start something romantic with my SO a while back.  It didn't bother me until I remembered that Thursday was Valentine's Day.  I don't expect anything special for Valentine's Day, but I also didn't expect him to make plans to have drinks with this girl... So, I got a bit upset.  Things escalated again and he left the house.  I followed after, told him I was upset, then went to the gym.  
He texted me to let me know that he thought we were over - that he thought that my emotions were too much for him.  I'm currently sleeping at a friend's house.

On this internship, I am not taking any classes, and I don't have to be in to work until 11AM...That being said, this is the first time in my life where I don't have a constant deadline for school hanging over my head every day, and I can sleep in. I've had so much free time to myself, but a lot of that time has been spent alone in the dark on my computer. 

My roommate who sleeps 5 feet from me in my room is often in bed within an hour after I get home from work at about 7PM every day. She is a VERY early sleeper for someone my age, and she is the lightest sleeper I have ever met. She asks me to turn my lights off and drop whatever I'm doing whenever she wants to go to bed, so I just sit on my computer in the darkness with my spare time for hours. And I still manage to wake her up. She seems very passive aggressive and I feel like she tries to make my life miserable by completely shutting me out while I try to make small talk with the only person in my life who I see every single day. My life has become a blur of work and being upset alone and trying to be completely quiet pretending I don't exist. 

The time has started flying by but it feels like time wasted, because outside work, nothing eventful is happening in my life to make time passing very thought out. Another problem with this forced introversion, I've become very VERY disenchanted  about life in general, the whole 'the government sucks, capitalism is a conspiracy to control people, everybody is ignorant, so much hatred in the world and people in suburbia (like my parents) try to act like life is a christmas card, when it clearly isn't.

I know what you're probably thinking, ""go out and do something"" well the problem is money. I also have a job at an ice cream place, but the location I was working got closed for the rest of winter due to slow sales a day after I started working. I can get trained for their other location, but that wont be after the next pay period, and honestly I don't know how I'm going to afford to even take the metro to work. It it's like my money security is always just out of my grasp, but i have no choice because of my major (no paid internships are generally offered for music, but all my other engineer/business/etc friends have very nice paying jobs. I get to hear about all of my roommates problems about spending too much money on clothes and makeup...but at least she has money and can live to throw it away.

I wish my school could help students out with living expenses, having no choice but to go to an expensive city for an unpaid internship and all. This is too much, and I don't like the extremely withdrawn, dark, overemotional person it is turning me into."

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[Does anyone pre-record their performances at the Grammys?  Or perhaps enhance the performance with recordings or electronic aids?  Is it a big deal among musicians to do so?  Are there famous artists who get nervous about a live performance before people who may not be fans?  On the other hand, are there artists who just thrive on performing live?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8csu9o?context=5)|Yes, but I can't name names.  We never do on principal.  I can say at country awards shows it's usually about 2/3rds pre-tracked except for lead vocals.  It's much less in the rock world.  I've heard only 3 bands are using tracks tonight.
 |Last time we had a show with usher he had tons of laptops running.  3 keyboard players onstage and not even one of them even bothered to mime playing that 2 note intro.
 |Electronic aids is pretty vague.  There are plenty of drum machines playing click tracks in our ears...ear monitors could be considered electronic aid.
 |There's definitely a machismo to playing live as opposed to doing the milli-vanilli.  But pre-recording means you get paid twice...for the performance and the recording, so they kinda win that way.
 |Dave matthews came offstage at an award show and his response when we complimented him was (approximate quote) ""I almost shat my pants I was so scared"".  We thought somebody with his experience still being that moved by it was awesome.
 |Miranda is definitely one who thrives on the performance.  sometimes you have to reassure the producers that it will pick up for the real show.  I feel that for sure.  The stakes get high and I get lost in the fun of the moment.  I liken it to mountain biking.  It forces you to be as focused on the moment as you are capable of.  Seeing Pink doing pushups and jumping around like a badass just before she hit the stage at iHeartRadio was awesome to see.  However you feel about a star's music sometimes you can't deny the energy and entertainment they provide live.

I have a little inside info on that one:  The driver for one of the crew busses, probably full of technicians that never even interact with dave, decided to dump his toilet illegally...it smells awful when they get full and sometimes the drivers are too lazy to find a truck stop to empty the shitter properly.  Years ago I stepped in a stream of pee from Miranda's bus when her driver dumped on the desert roadside right when I was walking up barefoot to check on another crew member...pee mud, ugh.  I boiled my foot.  Anyways, going over a river on a grated bridge seems like a sneaky place to dump without getting caught.  But the decision had nothing to do with Dave himself...I'm sure he was asleep on another bus miles in front or on a jet.  And I'm sure that driver was a good man who got fired over a careless decision.  Still, it makes fun enough headline that people latch on to and don't care about details.

A lotta drop D loaded with distortion.  Country is more rock than it's ever been.  It's growing in popularity and I think that's a good thing.  Good music will always be made, what sells or gets radio play in a given year is not directly related.  I'm a fan of more songwriterish stuff.

As far as fun little details involving celebs: Kelly Clarkson was still going on about getting stuck on Miranda when she made her way back to the dressing rooms just after her grammy.  Miranda later said Kelly was not the first or last person to get stuck on her dress...it was an accident waiting to happen with every hug and many a faux diamond was lost.

They looked really cool, caught the light, and made little smoke poofs when they popped.  But they popped a lot and the dancers started slipping on the pools of soap.  After the song she announced into the mic that it was too slippery and they couldn't dance with the floor that way.  As she demonstrated to the producer how the bubbles made them slip she lost her balance for real... and to catch herself she had to double over in a full forward fold with her ass to the audience.  She was wearing a very short skirt and very thin underwear.  I'll be in my bunk.

I think most stars don't think of themselves as stars unless they buy into the ego trip.  And as much as people love shitting on celebs, the majority of them get to where they are by having an amazing talent.  At awards shows stars bump into each other in the hall constantly and as they are walking away you will hear them saying stuff like ""OMG that was amazing"".  It's kind of a mutual admiration society (older than facebook)... and I think that's half the purpose of putting all the dressing rooms in close proximity.   Miranda loves Beyonce and was giddy to talk to her.  Dierks looked like Mcauley Caulkin saying ""yes"" to himself after talking to Steve Martin at the ACM's, it was sweet to see.  Dave Grohl seemed excited to talk to everybody, but I think he's just the human equivalent of a happy puppy.

Never sober.  Everybody thinks they are clever signing me up for a miranda karaoke song.  The thing is I sing all her songs for soundcheck every day so I'm very experienced with performing them.  But this one time I was in hell when Blake's sister secretly voluteered me to take over for the pianist at a crowded piano bar and play Kerosene.  This was downtown little rock after a concert so it was packed with fans.  I had never actually played the song on anything but harmonica and I was unsure of the chords or how it could even be done with a piano.  I mouthed to Miranda ""help me"" but it was too late to let the bar down.  The bar crowd ended up being so noisy that nobody minded me searching for a few chords and lines...but I still catch flack from Blake's sister for not knowing all the words.  We ended up getting escorted from the bar to the busses later by a team of 4 mounted police.

And we had so many revolving crew positions when we were a Texas based band... hiring friends and friends of friends to tune the guitars and such...but somewhere between 2008 &amp; 2010 it got so big that we hired mostly nashville professional technicians, which is a professional pool that just isnt as big in texas.  To put it another way, we outgrew the supply of TX touring professionals.   Now we are such a well oiled organization that suggesting a friend for a position would just be laughed off if that friend hasn't already proven themselves in the hellfire that is the touring industry.  There were too many people at the shows to just stop things and say ""sorry, the guitar tech put the capo on the wrong fret"", as happened from time to time in our clubbier days.  People expect a bigger, tighter production once thousands start showing up for the show.
 |It's important to note that the texas region is big enough that it has its own country market that is often at odds with ""nashville country"".  Bigger Texas bands never have to stray far from Texas to make enough money to support themselves.  But if you want to play arenas you have to make it to a national market and Texas alone can't provide that...it's a hard or impossible transition for many southern country/rock bands.  Once you become a nationally famous band the Texas markets might reject you for not being Texas enough.  These are very vague generalizations but my point is that the nashville vs. texas tension is quantifiable.

 |It's all who you know basically...networking, networking, networking.  Having enough talent only puts you on the field, not in the game.
 |I record my own songs for fun and have the occasional session, but my touring (and insecurity about my skills) keeps me from any regular studio work.  Also, producers in Nashville generally have sets of musicians they prefer working with.
 |Before I moved to nashville, which is geographically convenient, I was gone more days than I was home.  We worked it out to 191 days on the road in 2009.  Now it's mostly Wednesday evening through Sunday morning and back home.  On a normal day I roll out of bed, sing a few songs for soundcheck, work out or work on songs, pretty myself up, then rock out for 90 minutes...and usually have some fun after the show until we roll to the next city in the wee hours.
 |I haven't worked with anybody as big as Miranda except in Miranda-related events.. I got to back up Fogerty when he joined us onstage.  I got to trade vocals with Carrie Underwood while standing in for ML at a rehearsal.  I got to jam with Charlie Daniels once and he tossed me a solo.  Paul Shaffer wanted me to do a solo on Honky Tonk Woman at a Letterman commercial break...but I didn't see his gesture...when he told me later all I could say was ""wow"" and froze up like a giddy little girl.

 |She treats us like family.  We are a band and we love being that way.  She's said we should get our own name, but we never play as a group without her.  I'm still the new guy after more than 6 years.  She likes us being able to roll with situations on the fly and not clam up when shit goes wrong.  Bands that don't really know each other are more susceptible to train wrecks without that trust.  We've finished out playing unplanned songs, the wrong song we started but played anyways, capo's being in the wrong place so we transpose on the fly, jamming until the microphone can be fixed, or when she wants to talk...that sort of stuff.
 |I had piano lessons as a kid and a teenager but I didn't really fall in love with music until I could learn songs I loved on guitar.  I had the odd guitar lesson here and there but nothing consistant.  University of Texas' music program was very old school: Jazz or Classical only.  But I took studio engineering classes at Austin Community College in the 90's.  I ran a music studio and played with local bands for next to nothing for years until I got this gig.

It's about the same with House That Built Me...she didn't write it but she's internalized it.  As far as Blake, that's not something I know or would ask about...but I can say he has been side of stage at plenty of shows when she sang it and spoke about it's significance beforehand.

I was not as confidant about it as I was at rehearsals...not as clear an ear mix but there are a million possible reasons for that.  Hopefully didn't muff any notes, I haven't heard it yet.
 |Did you mean Beyonce'?  If you're going to pick on an entertainer for prioritizing entertainment over a live display of musicianship then put it in an envelope and mail it to madonna in the 80's...nothing has changed.  Ill bet if Beyonce' thought she could relate more to her crowd by strumming an acoustic and singing with a bluegrass band around a single microphone she could pull it off.  Just my impression of her.  I didn't see the inauguration but I'm guessing it was enough of a formality rather than her regular crowd having a good time that she might have said ""fuck it, let's run the vocal track tonight"".  Or maybe she had a cold.  I don't know why I'm defending her, she just seems like she genuinely cares about music and has talent... and that's good enough for me.

His was through the Grammy Foundation i think.
[Are you a session musician? I have a bunch of friends to do tours with big names as fill in musicians and they love it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8ct3pw?context=5)|The term ""session musican"" means staying in town and recording in studios to me, not filling in on the road.  For the most part the nashville recording clique is seperate from the touring clique.  I haven't tried to break in.  I'm a bit insecure about my abilities in the studio...I lean more towards the showman side.
[What did you do at dell?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8d13dd?context=5)|It changed a lot over 7 years.  Most of that I was a contractor with no bennies coding in ASP and PHP, but it allowed me to work part time and run my music studio at night.  At first I was contracted to do internal facing customer relationship sites for people who needed inside information but didnt work for dell.  Later I was the junior developer for the Internet Partners Division...which was a specialized arm between small and large business for Dell partners who had few employees and large profits, and offered venture capital to potential companies like that.  Then the big tech bust happened in 2000 and those companies mostly flopped like fish in a dried up lake.  My entire division of about 300 dried up.  First the sales force was redirected to the small and medium business divisions.  Then one by one the marketing executives were either laid off or reassigned.  Before the admin (that's Dell-ese for secretary) knew she was to be laid off she handed me my contract.  She mentioned she had tweaked the employee database to give me a status somewhere inbetween a contractor and direct employee.  Eventually the Director and everybody I worked for was gone and I was left alone in the empty cubicle farm for 20 yards in any direction with no standing orders or responsibilities.  I realized it was some sort of glitch that might soon be fixed so I started wandering around looking for people that needed computer help...excel spreadsheets, mouse ball cleaning, pc load lettering, whatever.  About a month later I was helping somebody and they realized I could edit web pages and shouted to their colleagues ""WE HAVE A WEB RESOURCE!"".  Apparently they hadn't been able to update their web pages since the layoffs.  I handed their admin my contract, which was somehow pre-funded by Intel for keeping their logo on the site, and my job continued for another 6 years...now with flexible hours since I was effectively an independent contractor.  My contracting company had lost every employee but me and gone under...they sold out to another arbitrary entity whom I kept faxing in my hours to and I kept getting paychecks.  I did internal and external coding, photoshop work, copywriting, at my most prestigious point I managed the home page...then I took it a step further and re-did the menu system on the home page.  It was kind of a disaster because I went around the usual dell content and made a javascript system that was only PC compatible, but was there really much business we lost from people on Mac's trying to buy Dell's?  I knew it would be fixed soon enough and i knew I would never again get the opportunity to work on web pages that get millions of hits daily.  I had no more ambition left for the tech industry.  Right about that time Dell started gearing up for the second round of layoffs in 2006...maybe third if you count how many contractors they let go at any given time.  I had been forced to go full time and forced to lead a team of programmers, which was cool but i had turned it down because as a perfectionist it made me want to get there early and leave late to make sure shit got done.  It was a responsibility trap.  I had to escape and my solo music career had fizzled in the last few years.  So I told all my musician friends I was looking for a road gig...I'd even play country..but corporate money is a hard addiction to kick!  Miranda wasn't the first audition to come up but it was the first one I'd leave Dell money for...
[Are you involved with the songwriting process, or are you given sheet music to learn?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8dcu7q?context=5)|Miranda's songwriting process? No.  I do hole up in the back lounge and write songs while we're on the road but that's just my own thing.  She gives us rough mixes as the albums are in progress so we can have the songs ready to play before the album is released.  We often make nashville chord charts to get started and Keith always writes drum charts, but the songs are always quickly memorized.  It's all done by listening.  We use our own best judgement as a band on how to translate studio parts to a live performance by a 6 piece band.  We're very against using tracks to have a slick production in the live show.
[I was surprised about your answer that you made more doing Web Dev. Are you going to have to quit in a few years and get a 'real job'?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8dcu7q?context=5)|Well, nobody can tour FOREVER!  I hope to get involved in the songwriting scene so I can continue to pay my bills with music and not computer skillz...it's just more fun.  Although I do enjoy programming, I enjoy it much more when it's not for a company that I am not attached to..I like hobby programming like VST plugins and the Reaper SWS extensions i'm playing around with.

She will be finishing up a pretty good internship and I am a young professional working in my hometown for the year, so i don't have any bills (only big one is my truck, my parents are awesome) and will have some downtime on my project during that time period.
Neither one of us have ever really traveled and do not really know where to go. I would prefer to take off work up to three days max, i am thinking of flying out early on a Wednesday and coming back on a Saturday. Some places that come to my mind include; Banff Natural Park, San Francisco, San Diego, The Keys, Colorado, East coast somewhere... i am open to suggestions and/or tips for any of these places or other destinations. Any help on picking a place, hotel, flight, etc. is greatly appreciated!"
18cxki,4,2013-02-11,[20/f] How do I STOP my workmate (22/m) from... liking me? ,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18cxki/20f_how_do_i_stop_my_workmate_22m_from_liking_me/,"I'm away from home for two months for an internship now and I met this guy here. Let's call him M.

M works at the lab next door and we got close quickly as we are of similar age (other people on this floor are generally 10ish years older than us).

When I first got here, I didn't know where to go for grocery shopping so he has taken me to the shops once. We watched a movie together that day and had dinner at mine in the evening. The dinner was **IN the presence of my roommate** and it was my roommate who asked him if he wanted to join us for dinner. 

I'm afraid M developed a crush on me and now he comes over to my lab ALL THE TIME to talk to me. Talking itself is not a big issue but it's the awkward topic he keeps bringing up that's making me uncomfortable. He says things like you are a beautiful person, you are so cute, that's why I like you, you are boyfriend is lucky to have you etc **very randomly, in front of other people** and it's SOOO embarassing. My labmates noticed it and tease me about him but I hate that he makes it so obvious that he is interested in me (I know I might sound narcissitic but it's pretty fucking obvious). 

I have a boyfriend back home and I love him with all my heart. He's my one and only and I mention him a lot in the conversation. I've even shown his photos to people so there's no way M doesn't know that I have a boyfriend and most importantly, I'm not interested in any other guy at all! NOT AT ALL! 

I almost find it rude that he keeps trying to flirt with me even though he knows that I have a boyfriend. Whenever he awkwardly complements me I usually just say thanks and start talking with other people to avoid him but he's just always there, in MY lab. I'm sure he spends much less time in his own lab and I seriously don't know how he gets his work done. 

There is an event for couples at an art gallery on Valentine's day which looks really fun, so one day I asked a friend if she wanted to go there with me- she said no as the ticket's quite expensive. On the next day, M comes to me and says that he's got two tickets and I should go with him. I turned it down, saying that I wasn't comfortable with going to that kind of even with another guy.

But what happened today was, me and my friend (guy) found this free concert (which happened to be on Valentine's day) and we got the last two tickets - so it's gonna be just us two going to the concert. We were telling everyone about how lucky we were to get those tickets and later today, M wanted to have a serious talk with me about why I was going to the concert with another guy! I got seriously annoyed but didn't want to be rude so just said ""I do what I want"" and walked away.

I have been trying to hint him that I want him to leave me alone but it came to the point where I can't stand anymore. 

I don't want to hurt his feelings/make things awkward/be rude etc. What do you think I should do to stop him from doing what he's doing?"
18cwir,1,2013-02-11,"I should be doing something, I just don't know where to go",togetoffmychest,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18cwir/i_should_be_doing_something_i_just_dont_know/,"I've just been rejected from applying at a program and some thoughts have been bubbling in my mind, and I can't find anyone to actually lean on this issue...

I'm officially an engineer now, finishing a double diploma in an oversea school. Most of my fellow classmates seem to have found jobs, starting to work, have an active life and such. I've got this one paperwork I need to hand in, and I'm done. I could have finished in December, but chose not to, 'cause I like the city I live in, and didn't want to come back home (ie, the village my parents live in) too soon. 

Now the deadline is coming up. My research director doesn't give a damn about my work, even though we're working on a common subject. We're supposed to see each other tomorrow to finally discuss my work of the past two months (yeah, because I had to confront him and he told me he didn't read my last recaps because they were ""too long""), but he'll surely ditch out, or wrap it up in 15-20 minutes.

I studying management. Innovation and engineer projects management. I don't know where that'll bring me. At one point, I was fairly into intellectual property, but got freaked out by the world out there, and ethical issues. I don't know where the rest will bring me.

So I applied to this big aerospace company's in-house training program, which seemed to fit quite nicely. I got rejected, with no answer, even though I was sponsored by a guy in the company who thought I was fit for it. I applied to different companies lately, All of which are in a field I practice as hobbyist and early adapter, but I don't have an awful lot of answers. I'll have to dig in again.

The point is, I don't know what I'm going to do, where I'm going. In two months, I'll be leaving this place, travelling back overseas and, what, look for a job ? I'd consider myself as a fairly intelligent fellow. I have good recommendations from my internships, good school grades, but that doesn't land you a job, does it ? I don't have the 2-3 years of work experience some entry-level jobs require, or even considering my young age (skipped a class) some other graduate program my father ants to send me to. 

I would need to take tests, but I don't master maths as good as I used to, or have profound knowledge of say, economics. When people ask me : what are you good at ? I'll say project management, business strategy, 3d printing. Put those 3 terms together and try to find a junior position... I'm 10 years too young to have knowledge in this it seems.

So I have to get experience. How ? Do I have any technical abilities to work as an engineer ? Yes, I guess, I'm adjustable, I know how to learn quick, integrate skills and improve myself, but it seems people want plug-and-play fresh out of school graduates. I'm just not it. My former classmates ask me what I'm doing now or later, I just can't answer them.. I can't have a full-time job, but I can't find a part-time one meeting my qualifications...

I don't know if there are others out there, even from my friends, who feel the same way... I feel ashamed of myself, even though I was taught life isn't easy. I can barely schedule what I'm going to do in 3 months, and I can't even imagine what I'll be doing in two years. I've moved 6 times during my 5 year studies, and am about to move once more. My whole life stands in two pieces of luggage. I don't even bother decorating my walls anymore. I would love to settle, but that has to come with a job... Parents are putting a pressure on this. Not jealous either, but my brother has a very interesting part time job, becoming full time when he graduates, and a long term gf, I on my part don't have many things to be proud of. 

My troubles may or may not be as bad as they seem. I might look back at this post in a couple of months and wonder how bad inside do I need to be to feel that way. As Bill Withers says, I just might have a problem, that you'll understand. We all need somebody to lean on."
18cvw9,1,2013-02-11,"I [19M] want to get closer to the girl I like [20F], but I'm afraid that at this I might've burned every bridge for anything to happen... in purpose",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/18cvw9/i_19m_want_to_get_closer_to_the_girl_i_like_20f/,"What's up /r/Relationships? I'd like to keep this short, but as many things, this requires some context.

The girl I like used to be my best friend's girlfriend, about say 4 or 5 years ago. At that moment I totally despised her; there was some bad reputation around her because she used to date lots of guys at school, and when things went wrong she was always the ""bad guy"". You know how kids are. So after those two broke up (two times), the contact was basically lost. She was still there in the clasroom, but she was a ghost for me. She was the one who had hurted my best friends feelings.

Time passed by, and 2 years ago I started a internship on some IT enterprise. Fun thing was that she worked there too, on the same conditions as I did. So, eventually, we had to get along. At first there were next to none words, but some months later something inside of me forgave her; maybe she wasn't evil after all. My friend told me it was nobody's fault, relationships are just like that, but back then I saw him so hurted that I just couldn't accept that, she must've been some kind of devil; but we all mature, and started to jag the pieces.

Surprisingly then, around May of 2012, my friend said *""hey, what do you say we invite her to the movies?""*. I was sceptic at first, but after going out some more times I started to accept her. And fall for her as well. My first mistake must've been not telling her my feelings, my first and most important. You could say I was kind of obsessed, waiting for the weekend to go out with her and my friends, stealing hugs from time to time, thinking that she'd catch my stupidly weak signals. I've never been good at socializing, so the ways I had to express my feelings weren't the best, of course she'd never catch what I meant. Of course she'd still think that I hated her.

Anyway, this kept going on, and by that time (August 2012) she was going out with some other guy. I knew it wouldn't work, things weren't going good. My friend told me the same, and that day he told me ""she's more like a woman to you now, huh?"". Welp, he knew. ""I just think something between you two might work, you know? You both are autonomous in several ways..."" and other stuff. You know, everything seems perfect from some perspectives. I guess that was the excuse I needed to actually begin expressing my feelings.

Until one day, when she and my friend came home for dinner and some movies, she fell asleep with me, on some kind of embrace. So when my friend went to sleep, on another room, lots of things started to run through my mind. For whatever reason, damn me, I kissed her on her sleep. From there, say November 2012, things started to move.

I still don't know how she did to forgive me for what I did. She told me she was mad, but I at the same time I wasn't the kind of person that would do that; so she wanted to understand. I told her I liked her, and that if I hadn't told her before it was because she was on a relationship with someone else, and it wouldn't have felt right. As I expected, the same explanation was good for her to reject me, it was true that it wouldn't feel right to accept me while she was going out with someone else, so it didn't happen. Hanging out, though, was a weird experience from then and on, I was waiting for she to break up with him. I couldn't wait to start something with her.

The day finally came, and via my friend I found out had broken up. She wouldn't tell it to me, so everytime we went out was weird, awkward. I knew she was single, but at the same time she didn't want me to know it. Or she knew that I knew, but was afraid of what could happen. I started to become more jealous than before. Whatever, at that time she wasn't the happiest person in the world, breaking up ain't fun for nobody. That and her family problems? Nah, my feelings could wait. So I waited 'til new year to tell her... that I couldn't be her friend anymore, that I wanted something else, something more.

Then we started going out. I felt really happy, she was finally mine. It was a shame that she didn't feel the same, but I wouldn't find out until later. One week later she told me that even though I could've felt happy, she didn't feel the same, not even comfortable next to me. All those years of hate and indifference came up, and it was true that she knew little about me. She recited once and once again, how little we had in common, that she couldn't find something to call this a relationship. Then I took a break. I told her that if I couldn't be that, then I wouldn't be nothing, because I'd end up hurting me, and of course, her.

Idiot as I am, my distance lasted one week. I send her a message so we could meet up and do some chit chat. I told her how even though all that she said might be true, I still thought that it could work, and that I'd do anything for it to work. I said ""well, okay, you don't know me, then let's know each other!"". The idea sounded good, but there was a problem. During that time I wouldn't be more than a friend, or even less than that, because every action that I'd make, it would of course mean something else. I cannot play the friend.

So we started hanging out the two of us, with no one else. It'd be the only way for me to have her for myself. I kept pushing myself, trying to find the line between love and friendship... that didn't end up good. It didn't matter if I pushed further or not, she felt uncomfortable in any way. I couldn't even hold her, knowing that my intentions weren't those of a friend. Last two nights I went to her home. The first one we went to the chinese festival, it was supposed to be the last time we'd go out, since I couldn't go on like that. I tried being a friend, playing her game, not even touching her; we talked a lot. But in the end, I still felt empty. I said goodbye in the morning without saying much, so my mind led me to ask her out once again, promising that this time it really would be the last time.

I did not try to convince her to get away with me or anything, but if it was gonna be the last time, I moved a little further... it was midnight and I wouldn't go home that late, so I ended up at her home again. I knew it was all in vain, but still. I took it easy, with some hugs and stuff, sleeping next to her. She couldn't handle it and went to the couch. It was obvious that she wasn't going to feel uncomfotable. I slept alone. The morning after, she gave me a speech of how dissapointed she was for me, for taking advantage of the situation, for making her let me stay home.

Of course she was right. But I told her how selfish I was, and how if it was gonna be the last time, I would do it without remorse. She said she didn't want to be angry with me, because she respected me, and just didn't want things to end up like that. I asked for forgiveness, not sure of what had happened, and was about to leave, when she said ""one last hug?"". I accepted, and then walked down the road back home.

Hours later I sent her a message telling her why I had done what I did, all the last-time implications and such. That don't want her to be, but I don't have any excuse for her not to, after all I had done all wrong. One last time I told her that it doesn't matter how hard I try, I just cannot be her friend, and even if I could, then it wouldn't be a role I'd want to occupy; so I said I'd, once again, generate a distance.

*And I don't want to go, but I feel like I should...*

My best friend told me how love wasn't always logical, how she is a complicated person. That he thinks that things maybe ain't working out because not of me, but in the way I show who I am. I had already given up. I told him how every way I could have reached her, I threw it all away. Dissapearing would be for the best of me, him, and our group of friends. I don't wanna spend half of my time trying to be what I don't want to be, while hurting myself, but I do wanna be with her.

I'm looking for solutions, for other ways to reach her. I think I won't find much, but I lose nothing by asking.

TL;DR: There's this girl I've known for a while. I used to hate her, but now I realized there's no reason for that; therefore I fell for her and now I love her. Making her understand that I didn't hate her anymore was quite a process, but it finally worked and we tried going out. I thought everything was good, but in the end, she doesn't feel the same and said she wants to know me to actually feel comfortable with me. Thing is that while she learns who I am she wants me to stay as a friend, which of course is painful for me in everyway; so I've decided to take distance. Do you think there's any other solution for us to be without hurting each other like this?"

18ctrh,5,2013-02-11,"My Type 1 girlfriend attempted suicide in the Fall semester, started cutting again tonight",MarshRT,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/18ctrh/my_type_1_girlfriend_attempted_suicide_in_the/,"Hi reddit, I've been lurking for a while and I've seen that people really get results when they ask for help. I'm sorry if this isn't the right subreddit for this, but I'll explain for a sec. I've been dating my girlfriend for just over four months - in that time, I've bandaged her wounds from increasingly severe attempts at cutting and stopped her from overdosing on the day after Halloween. She was checked into the emergency room then moved to the Behavioral Health Center at the local hospital, and released after just under 5 days. Since then she's gone to regular psychologist and psychiatrist appointments on campus at our university, been put on 300mg of Seroquel, and has explained bipolar disorder to her parents and gotten their full support with medication and counseling. Her mom was just up visiting last weekend and they really made a lot of progress talking about medication and my girlfriend's disorder, and she was really scared her mom wouldn't accept her for it or be supportive My girlfriend's maternal-side grandmother was also severely Type 1 Bipolar.

I have late classes this semester but I always go say goodnight to her at her dorm on campus, and when I called her to say I was on my way she sounded really distant. She gets very quiet when she's depressed, and I could tell something was wrong when I got there. We sat together and talked about our days and then she said, ""I think it's weird that other people don't cut."" I asked her what she meant and she said it was so normal for her that it was hard imagining what it was like not to. Before I go on, I want to say her room was a mess with her books and clothes all over the desk and floor, and there were open bandage wrappers on her desk that I noticed when I walked in.

I asked if she'd been cutting and she said yes. She had two small cuts on her palm and her wrist, and said she had a much worse one on her leg. I lifted her pants leg at one point and it was caked with dried blood, and she said it'd stopped bleeding and looked much worse than it actually was.

She'd started with little cuts last semester before her attempt and it got progressively worse, and I'm terrified she's going to commit suicide again. She tried by taking handfuls of Advil last time besides the cuts, but with 300mg doses of anti-psychotics in her dorm I'm scared shitless she'll do it when I'm gone, because my schedule is MUCH heavier this semester and I just barely got to her in time to stop her and get the campus EMS last fall. She told me it was okay because the cuts didn't hurt when she did them, and progressively became more distant and groggy as we sat and talked. I wrote a letter summarizing what happened and what I'd said to give her tomorrow if she's more alert, since she has a long history of memory issues that only get worse when she has an episode. She didn't remember walking back to her dorm tonight from dinner or even how long her roommate was gone before she started cutting. There was a stretch of two months she didn't remember Junior year of high school that her best friend helped her through, but her best friend goes to a rival college and has becoming significantly more distant since December. She was also abused for two years by her ex-boyfriend but hasn't gone to victim's advocate yet, and she actually helped me realize and accept that I'd been abused in a previous relationship and helped me more than I can ever credit or thank her for.

She has a psychologist appointment tomorrow at 2 PM - I asked her if she'd talk about this but she kept saying it wasn't a big deal and that she didn't want to. I'm really hoping she'll change her mind tomorrow when she's not feeling slow (her words) and groggy... She has her first internship tomorrow morning observing in a high school and she's looking forward to it but she also gets really anxious about unknown situations.

I love her completely. She explained bipolar disorder to me the night I told her I liked her, and I've read all of the books and articles she's sent me about her disorder. I visited her every day in the Behavioral Health Center and brought her lunch, clothes, and whatever belongings they'd let her keep in her room. She means everything to me and I want to help her through this.

Her parents are supportive but they said they'd immediately pull her out of college if a situation like last semester happened again. I want to help her, she just got back on track and changed her major and she's going to be a math and science teacher (and a damn good one, too). I know she needs help and I'm terrified, I don't want to derail her from school again but I don't know if she can handle being by herself. She told me that whatever bad things she did weren't meant to hurt me, that she was sorry and she loved me, and that we'd talk about all this in the morning. I'm just hoping we can get her help before this spirals into another attempt and she's pulled out of school permanently.

I don't know what I'm asking for, maybe just for any helpful advice or any approaches I can try taking with her that genuinely help and won't alert her parents... She's medicated and going to counseling and if this is something we can work through together and with her counselor and psychiatrist instead of hospitalizing her I'd love to hear whatever you all have to say."

I don't know why they are so short, apparently they don't last longer than 50 min. Maybe it's to clear the head of the counselors.  
  
  
Anyway, I'm still scared. I have no idea where this is gonna go or if I'll ever even feel any better, or if I'm even capable of feeling better. I tried directly fighting my anxiety and stuff for the past 1.5 years, and that only helped short term, the long term fears and stuff still existed then and exists now.

I'm a senior math/CS student (graduating in May, whooo!), and through a combination of not knowing what I want to do with my life and general anxiety about working in the real world, I didn't do any internships during my undergrad.  Now I'm faced with the reality of applying for jobs, and I'm freaking out because I feel like an idiot for not doing an internship.  (If I could do undergrad over again, I would have definitely done some kind of internship.  I feel like a dumbass.)

So I feel unprepared for a full-time job, but I know that internships are typically for current college students.  Is it a faux pas to apply to both an internship and a full-time position at the same company?  I aim to be applying to programming jobs/internships.

For further background, I go to UT Austin (a top 10 school for CS, whatever help that is), with a decent GPA and a heavy tutoring background.  I've had the same tutoring job for 3 years, and it was a long-semester only job.  I've had jobs during the summer, but they were mentoring/tutoring jobs with extremely flexible hours.  I want to stay in the Austin area after graduation if possible.

Thanks in advance!"

I haven't had an internship before and this is my last summer before graduating. As it stands I have two options.

1) A position in the Technology division of an Investment Bank doing most likely software development. My title would be that of an Analyst, and I'd be in the same New England city as my school which would be nice.

2) A position in Miami in the IT division of a Fortune 100 company, in a group overseeing the international IT operations of its foreign subsidiaries. The role would be more about strategy, and management. It's also paying 50% more than at the Investment Bank. That said, although it's closer to home, and I have some family there, I don't really have any friends in the area. Although I considered maybe going there after Graduation because of the more agreeable weather.

I know career advice is difficult to dispense without my career goals, so here it goes:

Long term I would like to open my own business in the country I'm from, or to be CIO of some company. I enjoy business problems more than I do coding. I enjoy development and programming and I'm pretty good relative to my peers, but I feel I'm not as good as other people out there and I won't ever be ""top of my field"". I always considered Project Management to be my eventual destination, and coding as more of a step in that direction. 

I've been leaning towards the bank despite this though, just because i feel an Investment Banking internship is more prestigious, and I feel I can leverage that better than I do this position.

I'm talking with the career center at my school but I just wanted other people's thoughts on the matter.

1) Will it be possible to even get into an internship, per say, if I'm going to University in Canada? Is it required to be in an American college?

2) Now, I'm not too clear on requirements for work eligibility in the US. Say I wanted to get a job as a cast member there, what would I specifically need to do to be able to get a job in the US?

3) Regarding the previous question, let's say that I am eligible to work there. What University courses are needed/best suited to get specific jobs at the parks? For example, the photographers. I think that I'd be well suited to do that job, but is there anything specific I'd need to do beforehand?

4) Alright, let's say I wanted to suit up and be an entertainer/person in costume, are there any prerequisites that I need to accomplish before becoming Mickey Mouse?

If you can't push yourself during a run, how do you expect to push yourself in any other aspect of your life? Disciplined running can help you become disciplined in other aspects of your life and make you into a better person. That's why I love running. 2 years ago I was 230lbs, low self esteem, and lazy. Today, I just ran a 20minute 5k, doing well in school and at my internship, and have never been happier. Just last week I did a 4:56 mile.

Truth be told, money IS a big deal for me, which is why I'm asking what are the places with highest starting salary.

Location is no big deal actually, because I want to travel (international travel/vacations is a plus).  I don't want to be in an office 100%, and possibly wear a uniform and get dirty working with engines (quite envious of the navy).

I'm still waiting on 3 schools, but I'm not very hopeful for those.

I should also mention that I only applied to top-20 schools in theoretical CS, and this is probably a big reason why I didn't get accepted anywhere.

Undergraduate Institution: MIT, majoring in Mathematics with Computer Science (18C)

GRE: 169/161/4.5 Q/V/AW, did not take the subject test

GPA/Coursework: 4.83/5.0 overall, 4.93/5.0 in just math and computer science courses

In particular, I've taken 5 (+1 in progress at the time of application) graduate courses in theoretical computer science, 3 undergraduate courses in computer science, 2 undergraduate courses cross-listed in computer science and math, and 5 (+1 in progress at the time of application) math courses.  Among these, my only B was in Real Analysis freshman year.

Research Experience: 1 semester in a computational biology group freshman year that was only mentioned in my resume, 1 summer in a mathematics REU that resulted in two poster presentations at undergraduate conferences, 1 summer doing mathematics research in my school that resulted in a single author publication that's in submission, and 1 summer doing theoretical computer science research in my school where I only got small results, but was acknowledged in a paper for ""helpful conversations.""

Recommendations: 2 recommendations from my research advisors from the past two summers, and 1 recommendation from the professor I took a graduate course with (unlike other grad courses, this one had a midterm along with a research oriented final project).  All of them seemed positive about me applying, and all well-known theoretical computer scientists.

Personal Statement: To be honest, I didn't spend as much time on this as I should have, and this is definitely something I need to be better about next time around.  I just wrote that I liked theoretical computer science, about my research experiences, and a customized paragraph for each school that mentioned a few professors I would be interested in working with.  I didn't include any ideas for research projects, or grand reasons for going to grad school.  I did not mention anything about my pre-college years.

Random Extras that may or may not matter: I got top 500 on the Putnam last year, one of the surveys I wrote for a final project for a grad course turned into a publication in an undergraduate expository journal, have written a few articles in a mathematics magazine for middle school students, have graded for various courses in mathematics and computer science, have done two winter internships in finance.

Alternatively I'm also looking for team members to start a project. I've played video games all of my life and I am incredibly passionate about producing great work. I want to make amazing games and have a ton of drive to make that happen. I'm the kind of guy that can talk with you for hours about the design in various games and love every second of it. I hope we can create something amazing together. I'll outline my qualifications below so you can take a look at the category you're interested in considering me for:

**Writer**

* I have 6 years of experience as a very active writer ranging a large number of mediums. I've written short stories and lots of poetry. I've also written and staged (live performances) 5 theatrical plays including directing for one of them. Additionally I'm writing my own tabletop rpg system setting with an original world.
* I have video game writing experience writing the scripts for cinematic pieces including fleshing out the characters and setting involved.
* I've also been a very active Game Master in tabletop gaming for nearing 4 years, writing my own settings, characters, quests, dialogue, etc, including post mortem background information about each of those things. Lots of homebrew and mountains of experience putting it all to the test with players.
* I've completed some college (2 years) studying creative writing with an emphasis on poetry and an internship for game writing.
* I'm looking for a full time, part time, or contract / commission work, from writing new stuff from scratch or expanding on what you already have. I have a large portfolio of work I can show you based on what you're looking for or I can write you a new sample in the style / genre you're looking for to see if you think it's a good fit.

**Designer**

* With the 4 years of being a very active Game Master that I mentioned above, I homebrew my own monsters, encounters, settings, classes, items, settings, etc. I have a lot of experience designing and balancing those systems and proven my effectiveness in those areas through constant playtesting.
* I've designed the mechanics for several games (GDDs) that are loaded in the barrel ready to be used and fully understand the importance of regular testing to change and improve upon these things.
* I'm currently designing my own tabletop rpg system including the core dice mechanics, character progression, enemies, etc.
* I have an understanding of core, basic programming concepts and have worked with several languages enough to be familiar with them. I also have understanding of some core graphic design concepts. Both of these allow for easier communication between departments and an ability to better grasp limitations that we are working within. My knowledge in these areas is always expanding and I have no problem picking up new info quickly that is needed for a particular project.
* I'm an active reader of design articles and write many of my own analyzing specific games or design concepts in general (can provide a link to my articles on request).
* I'm a Support Lead for a web design company in my current day job and have a lot of experience with communicating to different department effectively in order to solve problems.
* I'm looking to expand my design portfolio so I am interested in both commercial and hobby work based on the project.
* I'm looking for full time, part time, commission / contract, or internship work as a designer. I can design new systems or expand the systems you already have in whatever direction you're looking for. 

**Team**

* I'm also interested in putting together an indie team, so if you're a programmer and/or graphic artist looking to team up, let's talk.
* On the team I would be filling the role of writer / designer / project manager. The support lead job I mentioned in my designer section has given me a lot of experience in managing and communicating with people of various disciplines to get things done.
* I'm looking for a programmer and/or graphic artist to work with. If you're interested we can talk specifics about what I'm looking to do.

---

If you're looking to hire or contract for game writing or design work, as full time, part time, contract / commission, or any other method you can dream up, let's talk. I have a resume, references, and writing portfolio / samples available upon request and would be happy to talk about my experience, ideas, or whatever else you want to know. OR if you're interested in forming a team, I'm also interested in hearing from you. Leave a comment or send me a PM and let's get in touch."

--------------
I will be graduating next year from a CS program from one of the top 5 universities in Canada. Its depressing for me to say that despite having a really good cumulative average in my program, a relatively decent grasp of the theoretical concepts we are taught in school, and a 16 month internship experience with a multi-national software firm, I don't think I'm worth anything and so will not be able to find a job after I graduate.

Let me clarify what I've said above: 
1) While its one of the top 5 universities in the country, apparently all the universities in that list have the same quality of education or 'training' that they impart to undergrads.
2) Yes, I have been a lazy bum when it comes to talking to professors about research opportunities they could provide me with, or in general networking with them - learning more about the course outside of the curriculum. I am not a scholar. Not one who'd think about going to grad school and doing research. I am one who sticks to school curriculum, does well, and parties the time he's left with. I realize that this habit of mine is possibly one of the bigger reasons or probably THE reason, why I think I'll be a failure after I graduate.
3) The 16 month internship experience I've had with the software firm has been that of a Test Associate intern. This is one of the decisions I regret most in my life until now (I know there are many more to come). I was offered 4 developer position internships and 2 test associate internships. I chose the internship of the testing position because of the money and the name of the software firm. And believe me when I say this, I really needed the money (no, not for parties. for family related issues). When I was deciding on which internship to choose, I knew I should go with the developing positions, but should I have gone with them, I wouldn't have been able to finish school.

I believe that internships are the best way to start off your career and a great opportunity for those who can get these. I faltered here big time. 

Now, coming back to my original point: 
--------------------------------------------
I'll be graduating in slightly over a year. And I believe that 1 year can be a relatively long period of time to set things right if one really wants to.

But here's my problem, I don't know how to do this. I know what I want. I want to be able to sell myself in a year from now to potential employers on how I could make a difference to their firm. Basically, get them to hire me. 

I'm not great with any particular technology. I have had some experience with a few of them. Nothing that would dazzle anyone. I know people without CS degrees have better experiences and work than I do.

Under web development, I have come across technologies such as HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, SQL. My experience here limited to creating a simple website I made.
Under core development, I have come across technologies such as Java, Python, C++. But my experience here is limited to school assignments extending up to a writing a few classes.
Under app development, I have developed a couple android apps. No exposure to iOS.
Under testing practices, I have written a few shell scripts and dealt with some automation testing. Nothing useful here.

I haven't ever worked with Open Source. Never had experience with GIT and open source projects on github. This, I hear is a very good way to expose yourself to real world problems and real world programming. However, I really don't exactly know where to start with this. Which projects to contribute to. How to contribute. I know what you're thinking.. its sad, I know. But that's why I need your help..

I have heard and read a lot about TopCoder. Apparently, you do well in topcoder competitions, gain a good rating and you can easily get hired by some top software firm. I don't know if this is really true. The problems on top coder are based on your knowledge of algorithms. I don't know if this is really worth the time and effort that will be put in to it. If just having a good rating, which obviously isn't guaranteed before hand, will do it for you.

I don't know if I should go about making some kind of web app or a phone app myself and bank on that.

TL;DR
-------
I don't know how I should spend the last year before I graduate to make myself sellable to firms, so that they hire me. I have no experience with open source, top coder. Don't have any fancy projects. Don't have advanced development experience. Just whatever one learns in school curriculum. These days, that doesn't seem to be enough.

Please tell me whether putting all my time in Top Coder can be worth it. Why? 

Or please tell me if I should start contributing to Open Source projects. If so, how? And what I can gain from it. 

Or please tell me if I should disregard the previous options and go about making some personal project of my own. If so, please tell me which technologies should I look to be working with? As there seem to be countless of them out there!

OR what would you do, if you were in my place facing the situation I am."

Basically, I'm looking for insight on how I should go about getting hired at a Big 4 firm. Here's my situation:

* 24 years old, prior military (6 years enlisted)
* Currently a Junior(ish?) at a state university
* Majoring in Accounting, collateral in Finance
* GPA is 4.0 / 4.0 (for now)
* All of the Big 4 advertise internships and jobs on my university's job website, but I'm not sure how much of a ""target"" my school is.

Ideally I'd like to power through and finish my undergrad, and apply for jobs in my senior year (no internship, school in the summer) because, well, I like money and dislike being poor. However, from what I gather my chances of getting hired are greatly diminished, especially because I'm at a state university that's not really a target. Do they *ever* hire undergrads that didn't intern?  

So, should I go ahead and try to get an internship as soon as possible, and accept that I'm just going to graduate a little bit later? I've applied for EY's emerging leaders program, and am considering applying to a similar program at Deloitte--are these helpful? It seems like team building exercises and a little bit of facetime at an office, but I feel like I might be a [bit out of place](http://i.imgur.com/CiMD2wF.png).  

Also, I'd like to get my CPA after graduating (obviously), and go for an MBA at some point. Should I go ahead and shoot for an MBA directly after undergrad, considering I've worked before (even though it's an entirely different environment), or should I seek employment, then do an MBA later (night classes, etc.)?  

**TL;DR: 24 years old, prior military, want to work at Big 4. Should I be focusing on internships or graduating more quickly? Also, should I go ahead for an MBA, or do that after working a real job for a few years?**  

Thanks for any help / advice!"

My boss told me about a guy he had met at a bank conference that was a (civil?) engineer for many years until he was laid off. In an attempt to find work, he applied to many different places and explained how his knowledge of advanced math could benefit their firm. He ended up working in a bank, and used his math skill to find customer account decay rates among a fairly homogeneous customer base. His background was stress testing materials used in buildings bridges, and he found that many materials used had a long life and some had a very short life, much like the customer base in a financial institution. 

He spoke at lengths with my boss about his work, and years later, my boss is very interested in precisely this kind of research. I am tasked to approach engineers at the local university with this problem, but I thought I would first turn to Reddit. I am going to try to detail exactly what I am looking for, but please keep in mind that I have no engineering background so I may (will) use incorrect terms or assumptions.

We have a homogeneous customer base that will all eventually leave the bank for very different reasons. Some may leave due to dissatisfaction or a better competitor, while some may leave the bank due to death (i.e. lifelong customers). We are trying to find the availability of funds in deposit accounts (savings, checking, CDs, IRAs) over a number of years, and the interest rate risk involved in establishing new accounts and gaining new funds as necessary, which would involve establishing new accounts at current rates. We are also trying to determine the point--or number of years--at which 50% of available deposit funds will no longer be available to the institution due to regular activity and account closures. 

We have the data for account closures, and are just looking at the best way to apply the data. This is a mock graph of what we THINK a chart would look like that would be generated by this application of data, and what we hope to gain is insight on how to do it.

18gorr,141,2013-02-13,I saw something on FB today that hurt me so badly it actually made me cry and I don't know who to rant about it to because I can't tell anyone who knows me why it hurts so much.,evasive_owl,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18gorr/i_saw_something_on_fb_today_that_hurt_me_so_badly/,"**DISCLAIMER**: I have to get something off my chest and I think this would be a good place to put it. My heart has been aching today and I have a lot to say. If you don't want to read a wall of text, venture no further. 

This is my throwaway because a lot of people, including immediate family members know my username, and I am about to divulge personal information I have never told anyone. The only other person that knows this information is my SO. 

I'm 21, and I'm a junior in college. I've been dating my boyfriend for exactly 2 years and 6 months Friday. We have great, awesome sex, and a lot of it. In the early fall of 2010, when we first started dating, I lost my birth control pill pack and I ended up getting a new pack after skipping 4 pills. I got pregnant. We had been dating for two weeks when this happened, so naturally, I got an abortion. I love kids and I have wanted to be a mother since I was 5 years old. I have the names of my children all picked up and lined out. I browse /r/BabyBumps all the time because I love seeing women become mothers. Am I weird? Maybe. 

Long story short, it broke my heart to get an abortion. Not only because I love kids, but that I was so careless about sexual protection that it got to the point where I needed to have one. I don't regret the abortion at all, but I do regret my choices concerning protection that led up to. I think about the ""what ifs"" if I hadn't had the abortion. I think about the adorable child my boyfriend and I would have made. 

I was a freshman in college when I got pregnant and he was a junior. We decided to have the abortion immediately after I discovered I was pregnant. We knew that our hopes, dreams, and aspirations would go down the drain if we had not. And two years later, we are closer than ever to achieving those dreams, and still together. I couldn't be happier.
He now has a wonderful, wonderful job in engineering, and I am graduating early next year with a 3.8 gpa from one of the highest ranked public universities in the United States. I have a solid internship, and a job offer for when I graduate. I'm applying to grad schools in Europe, because my SO and I both have dreamed of moving to Europe since we were young. He's taking me to the Bahamas in March for my Spring break. We love life, and we are making the most of it. I am in the best shape I ever have been: I work as a spinning instructor, and I'm running a marathon in March. We share a cute apartment in city my school and his job are located in. If I had not had the abortion two years ago, *none* of this would be happening. I am so thankful I live in a country where no one can deny me access to abortion. 

Of course, there are some of you who would indeed carry the child full term, and either put them up for adoption, or raise them on your own. To you, I say, you are brave. I give you props for going through 9 months of judgement, stares, and ridicule, and putting your own life aside for a baby. (I am sure that not all of you did in fact get ridiculed, but that seems to be the common trend with the girls I know who are young mothers)

For me, I knew that neither of these possibilities would work. I was (and still am) not ready to be a mother. I'm still a kid! I spend my nights partying, drinking, and getting high with friends when I don't have to study, and during the summers, I work and travel as much as I can. I am an athlete, and I did not want to sacrifice my body with pregnancy, because it is impossible to bring yourself back to the point you were at before. Maybe I'm selfish, but this is my life. I couldn't bear the thought of bringing a child into this world, and giving them up for adoption as soon as they were born. I tear up just thinking of how painful that would be. I can't even imagine what it would be like to go through that, and to those of you who have, you are so brave to have gone through with that. 

I was browsing my facebook newsfeed, when I stumbled upon a link to [a facebook page](http://imgur.com/a/93cvc) (I've taken screen shots and uploaded them to imgur, so the link won't bring you directly to the page) one of my facebook friends shared. I was immediately confused when I saw it bore the title ""I am for women, I am for children, I am for life."" When I read the description, my confusion turned to rage. The description is written by a male. I am not at all saying men shouldn't be allowed to have an opinion on abortion, but the campaign claims to be ""For Women"".

How can this campaign be for women if the person running it isn't even a woman? He never had to experience an abortion procedure with his own body. He never had to experience the terror and sickness one feels when sitting in a stall in dorm building's communal bathroom and staring at the little pink plus sign of the 7th stick they've pissed on to confirm their pregnancy. Maybe he has impregnated a woman who then got an abortion, but from how he worded his essay, he hasn't been. Regardless, the fact remains, until you've been impregnated at 18 years old by a 20 year old college kid you've only been with for two weeks, or until you've been any woman who has ever experienced an unwanted pregnancy for *any* reason, you can't claim your pro-life campaign is ""For Women"".

Campaign away for pro-life causes, I don't care! But don't mask a freaking campaign for pro-life under women's rights and ""liberation from the choice to end a life"", because that is where I begin to have a problem with you.

&gt;I guess I'm talking about this for a couple reasons. For one, the only people we hear from on this issue are women and priests. Well here is an average guy saying something now, and hoping other average guys will come out of the woodwork despite the fear of being ""that person on Facebook trying to push an agenda."" This is not politics. My father has told me my entire life that a true man is one who takes responsibility. Men: step up and show your girlfriend, wife, family and friends that you will say something, too. A society like ours is proud to be founded upon accountability in the vain of justice. This is justice. Simply saying ""I wouldn't, but its not my place to tell others not to"" like I once did is a cop-out. There is surely a place for tolerance in our world--we all come from different backgrounds, different religions, different upbringings--but as human beings, isn't it a given that we should all take a stand for humanity? As Americans, if we see injustice, especially pertaining to life or death, we do something. Let's be courageous men and women and stand up for real and true lives being ended. If we ALL wouldn't do it ourselves, then isn't something wrong?""

Maybe the reason you *only* hear it from women is because it's an issue about the biological female's body. And guess what, I have news for you. I have never said ""I wouldn't do it, but it's not m place to tell others not to"", because I HAVE done it, and I WOULD do it again if I got pregnant at an inopportune time. This is not justice. This is an ill-informed campaign run by men to stop women from making a very personal, private, and difficult choice that the majority of human beings are lucky enough not to have to make. The only thing WRONG here is your campaign and your bold claims, sir. 

Love,
An actual post-abortion female who doesn't regret it. 
(Yeah. We exist.)

The tiny company you think might be enough like you that you have a chance with it? It brags about how creative it is, how the corporate culture is laid back, and how they need people to think outside the box? That company's so incredible and you just want to work there so badly?

Guess who just hired me to consult and offered me a full time job? 

And what's more? I laugh at guys like you. When you cry about how much companies don't value your soft skills, and wonder why they can't just see that you're a diligent worker who would always go the extra mile for them? I nod and tell you to hang in there, you'll find a company right for you someday, don't give up hope man. But inside? I'm laughing my ass off at you, you pathetic liberal arts major. Every company you set your sights on, who isn't Starbucks, I'm going to work for 6 ways from Sunday before you even email your resume. I won't bother trying when you finally settle for Hardees, you can have that. Anything else I'm going to be in a management position before you even get an interview.

And the biggest reason I laugh? It's not me doing all this. It's the company's. When you cry about how poor you are? Or talk about how you just want to curl up and disappear, and all that emo bullshit? You're triggering their ""Don't hire"" instinct something fierce. You're a miserable weak coward, why would they want you? Feel free to have an unpaid internship and help them build their twitter account, you're great for that. But their HR department is barking orders, telling them to hire engineers and hold on for them as long as they can can. Companies need it, on a primal level you'll never get to see first hand, even if you do get a chance to work for them. Sooner or later one of them will agree to hire you, but you won't see any hunger in their eyes for someone with actual marketable skills. They won't beg you to stay forever. You won't know what it's like to see their animal side needing you as much as they need to make money. "

I just wanted to know if anyone gets really anxious/guilty when they don't work out. I'm pretty fit and healthy, but there's still some lingering trouble areas that I'd like to get rid of. I try to work out four times a week, usually something kickboxing/martial arts style, and I eat pretty healthy foods (except I snack often).

 This week, I've been feeling kind of burned out. My schedule is really packed since I intern all week, take classes and am part of student organizations, so I've started working out early in the morning before my day starts. I've been keeping up with it, but I think this week I'm starting to feel the pressure(since I had a big test on Monday), and I haven't been working out since Sunday. 

My problem is, when I skip workouts, I get really anxious about it. I'll stand in front of the mirror and examine myself more than usual; I'll check muscle tone, grab at fat. If I don't work out, I get scared that I'm becoming flabby. I think it's all in my mind, but I still can't help the feeling. "

**How do I record my microphone/guitar/preamp with my computer?**

If you're here you most likely want to record yourself or others onto some storage medium.  Computers provide a convienent, flexible, low-cost medium (compared to tape, et al) for recording audio.  For analog audio signals to be converted into digital signals that can stored and manipulated on a computer it must undergo the process of analog-to-digital conversion and for you to be able to listen it again, it must be converted back to the analog domain through a digital-to-analog converter.  Any computer soundcard contains these converters (known as ADCs and DACs), though for recording purposes a profesional device is typically used.  The professional converters we are interested in here are called 'audio interfaces', which is what we call converters that have some method of interfacing with a computer.  They can come in two forms: internal cards (PCI, PCIe) or external interfaces (USB, Firewire, Thunderbolt).

These interfaces vary wildly in their features and cost, typically in number of channels, how many of those channels have microphone preamps, if any have hi-z inputs for direct recording of guitar/bass, additional digital inputs, and internal hardware routing and effects.  Some will even operate independently of a computer in a 'standalone mode.'  External interfaces are increasingly common, with them being included in many low-cost mixers as well (though frequently only a 2-channel stereo interface on cheaper models), and performance of reasonable quality can be had rather cheaply.

**What kind of computer do I need for recording?**

This is not a computer-focused sub, posts regarding building a pc will be removed.  Post questions about building computers in [/r/buildapc](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc).  That said, a recording PC is not very different from a gaming PC, minus the need for a fast graphics card.  A quality motherboard, power supply, and fast CPU are pretty much essential.  8-16GB of RAM is a good idea, more if you're going to be running large multisampled software instruments like orchestra packs.  Two hard drives, one for your OS/applications and one for recording/sample libraries is also a good idea (required for PT) to avoid underruns due to hard disk paging.  The internal graphics in the newer Intel and AMD CPUs are fine, a graphics card isn't going to make your DAW run better.  In fact, high performance graphics cards can be a source of interference and noise.  I also have a sneaking suspicion that PWM fans may be a source of interference as well, but I don't use them myself so I can't test that theory.

**How do I soundproof my dorm/bedroom/apartment?**

The first thing you should know is that sound proofing is not acoustic treatment.  Soundproofing is a method of reducing sound transmission between the studio and outside the studio.  Acoustic treatment aims to treat the studio so that the acoustics are better for recording.

Unfortunately it is very difficult and expensive to effectively soundproof an existing structure. Another factor to consider is that if you are renting or otherwise do not own the property it may be against the terms of your lease to modify the space in any meaningful way. As well, soundproofing is effective only in certain frequency ranges, with cost and difficulty inversely correlated with frequency; that is, it is more difficult and costly to soundproof against low frequencies versus high frequencies. The following links describe soundproofing and acoustic treatment in the context of small spaces in more detail.

**What DAW (Digital Audio Workstation, ie recording software) should I use?**

*This is not an exhaustive list of DAWs or their capabilities.*

The answer to this question is highly dependent on your situation. You don't 'need' Pro Tools to do professional-sounding work; in fact many pros use DAWs such as [MOTU Digital Performer](http://www.motu.com/products/software/dp/) or [Steinberg Cubase](http://www.steinberg.net/en/products/cubase/start.html).  Pro Tools has become something of a de-facto standard in commercial studios due to a variety of historical factors (not the least of which is [vendor lock-in] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in)) and familiarity for outside engineers, however many have moved away from Pro Tools for some of those same reasons.  Other popular DAWs are [Cockos Reaper](http://www.reaper.fm/)(very affordable, lots of functionality), [Ableton Live](http://www.ableton.com)(focused on live performance of electronic music), [Apple Logic Pro](http://www.apple.com/logicpro/)(popular in audio post circles).  [Cakewalk Sonar](http://www.cakewalk.com/products/sonar/), [Presonus StudioOne](http://studioone.presonus.com/), [Image-Line FL Studio](http://flstudio.com), [Steinberg Nuendo](http://www.steinberg.net/en/products/nuendo.html), and [Propellerheads Reason](http://www.propellerheads.se/products/reason/) all have their devotees as well.

###Some advice to follow before posting a thread about noise or other problems

*******

**Basic Troubleshooting**


Before posting questions about problems, please follow these steps for basic troubleshooting.

Many of these may seem illogical, but many implementations of technology are more involved than they may seem.  Basic troubleshooting typically involves replacing components with 'known good' equivalents and seeing if it makes a difference.  For example, noise in a vocal recording:  replace the microphone cable.  If that fixes it, the microphone cable is bad.  If it doesn't fix it, try another mic, different preamp, etc.  

http://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/wiki/index#wiki_basic_troubleshooting




**I'm getting noise in my recordings, help?**


Before posting about a noise problem, please make a recording of the noise. It is impossible to properly diagnose the source of the noise through colorful language. Words like ""static"", ""buzzing"", ""clicking"" can all mean different things to different people. Buffer underrun sounds different from cellphone interference, however both could be described as clicking, buzzing, or stuttering.  Also provide a complete description of the signal chain from beginning to end, type/model of computer if there's a computer involved, and pictures of everything (including where cables are going) if possible. What may seem unrelated or insignificant to you may in fact be the source of the problem. Help us help you.  [It's also worth noting you may be experiencing *mechanical noise* rather than *electrical noise*.](http://recordinghacks.com/2013/02/18/fixing-microphone-hum/)

It is also FAR more preferable to re-record the source than trying to remove noise after the fact.  Audio never comes out the other end unscathed. 

*****
Some examples of common noises:

[Cellphone/GSM noise](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1mlponX_jw)

[Buffer Underruns](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6Ysh7Y9_bI)

[Ground Loop](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSA2F1AwboU)

There isn't much you can do about Cellphone/GSM noise other than banning cellphones from the studio.  In my experience the noise doesn't travel all that far, though, so if you get them several feet away, you may be OK.  YMMV.  Even if your entire signal chain is balanced, the voice coils and/or internal wiring of your monitors can still pick it up.  If anyone has a better solution, let me know.

Buffer underruns can be fixed by increasing the size of the hardware buffer on your interface.  How to do this varies with different software and hardware, check your manual on how to do this.  Note: Increasing your buffer size will increase the latency in the audio path, not generally a problem during mixdown but it can cause major issues for artists/talent during recording.  In general, it is best to keep latency low during tracking and try to minimize the use of plugins during tracking to reduce load on the system.

Ground loops can be some of the most difficult problems to fix in the studio.  The recommended method of fixing a ground loop is through an isolation transformer or using a 'ground lift' IN THE AUDIO PATH.  FOR YOU OWN SAFETY, DO NOT LIFT THE POWER GROUND.  IF AN INTERNAL FAULT OCCURS WHILE THE POWER GROUND IS LIFTED THE CHASSIS MAY BECOME LIVE AND POTENTIALLY LETHAL VOLTAGES CAN BECOME PRESENT ON THE CHASSIS OF THE GEAR.

18g3a3,6,2013-02-13,Advice for a new DM with the minimum # of dives and an uncertainty about his pro-readiness?,jberberich,scuba,https://www.reddit.com/r/scuba/comments/18g3a3/advice_for_a_new_dm_with_the_minimum_of_dives_and/,"I just returned to the US from Thailand where I trained in a PADI Divemaster internship on Koh Tao. It was a two month internship, but I fast tracked it and became a DM in one. In that month, I went from 14 logged dives to 67, putting me just over the 60 dive minimum for DMs. I'd really like to work as a DM, but I'm worried that my experience isn't adequate for a hiring dive shop or for my comfortability leading divers (I wish I stuck with the internship for the second month).

I'd like to find work as a DM (either freelance or full-time, and ideally somewhere in SE Asia). I male and speak only English, but the PADI Pro job boards are full of multilingual diver requirements with a preference toward females. Some working DMs I've talked to suggest just handing out my CV. Will anyone hire a DM having only 67 dives under his belt? Should I go back to Koh Tao where I know the dive sites?

I'm also considering becoming an Instructor. I've found a couple free, six-month internships at [Rainbow Reef](http://www.keysidc.com/internship_program.php) (Key Largo, FL) and [Dressel Divers](http://dresseldivers.com/en/courses/dive-instructor-internships) (multiple locations) that seem like good options for getting experience while increasing my employability. Also, [Blue Season Bali](http://www.idc-bali-internships.com/idc_bali_content.idcbali) has a four-week IDC that sounds very high quality. Is going straight for the Instructor route a better option for getting employment (I've seen a lot of posts saying to work as a DM for a while)?

Thank you very much for reading this far; this post (my first) has grown longer than I intended. Any advice you can give me is greatly appreciated."

With training in marketing and economics, I can fully assure ANYONE that they're not building companies, rather the management are using the position to make tons of money on taxpayers' dimes while encouraging business models that have a high risk of failure (read: shady college textbook and apartment sales sites in the ""lean"" methodology in an investment environment which is nearly nonexistent) while turning down assistance to companies for not being innovative enough, including some which have actual revenue (unlike ANY of the portfolio companies).

On top of that, I've been criticized for believing in global warming and evolution. I've also been intimidated for my civil words of disagreement about local university administration (at the school which I am getting a graduate degree from). Management has spouted racist things and once, participated in an office-wide protest of the ""decimation of real American family values"" by taking 4 hours out of their work day to eat at Chik Fil A. There has also been embezzlement of public funds into certain... non-necessities that are more commonly seen at my boss's place than at our office.

As ""PR coordinator"", I've got enough dirt on the place to likely cause a loss of public funding. Much worse than what I've described here, but I'd hate to give the identity of the place away. I have no interest in working here and, while I'd lose references for my resume, I can simply change them to the people who quit before me.

They're basically taking tens of thousands of dollars per month and returning nothing into the local economy while promoting hatred and being self-righteous ""innovators"" who have not raised a single dollar from anything they've started aside from F&amp;F (friends and family) investment. Should I release certain non-confidential inside information to our press contacts?

Also, I will add, that I've gained little from this internship other than a network of people in a market I wish to leave and never return to. They've constantly been in violation of my internship contract. I also have a new, more prestigious internship at a local finance firm awaiting.

It's tempting, but I'm also very angry and want to hear some of your experiences in attempting to bring down a place as you leave?"

Put in for one this morning, hoping to hear back soon.

I've been committing PMO since I was eleven (now nineteen, pushing twenty) and am only now starting to suspect where my lack of motivation comes from. I always suspected it was lowering my sex drive, never thought it would affect my drive for everything else. Finally got a reddit account, stumbled across r/nofap and had kind of a breakthrough. I'm a college sophomore trying to make very productive moves in my life (RA applications, internship seeking, possibly studying abroad) and thought this was the right time to give it a shot.

Like i said, i let myself have one last PMO on sunday and have been fapstaining since (where I used to have one a day before bed every night). As early as yesterday (Tues), i was already feeling all kinds of new productive energy, increased positivity, and went to bed optimistic about the future. Then came the most persistent boner (Is there an approved r/nofap term for boner?) I'd had in weeks. First i tried ignoring it, no sleep. Then i flipped over on my stomach, no sleep. By 4am i was considering edging, but I couldn't really see how it would help. In the end, I may have dozed for like a half an hour before my alarm clock went off on the busiest day of my week.

So (those of you who've borne with me through this long intro, sorry) what do i do? It was only my third night and I'm worried it'll just get worse. What are other fapstronauta doing when it gets *ahem* too hard to sleep??"

[Hi!  I'm one of your constituents.  I have a super important question for you: What's your Summoner name in League of Legends?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18err8/i_am_congressman_jared_polis_sponsor_of_hr_499_to/c8e6pko?context=5)|Private msg me with yours and I'll friend u.

The speech isn't for hours...how do you go to the bathroom without losing your seat(Is ""Quack-Quack Seat Back"" an appropriate seat-saver in Congress? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18err8/i_am_congressman_jared_polis_sponsor_of_hr_499_to/c8e50py?context=5)|Sorry to lose you as a constituent :\ And thanks for your service to our country! See my no labels answer and check out nolabels.org  Edit response: I am sitting next to Paul Tonko of NY and am actually holding his seat while he grabs a bite to eat. If I need to go to the bathroom later he will hold mine. I got here early to do my AMA and to get a great seat.
[I hope you can tell your grandchildren one day how you Bro-hugged the President.  Thanks for the reply. Hopefully I'll see you around in Boulder sometime. My usual Boulder hangout is Upslope Brewing. Good luck tonight!  EDIT#2: Have you ever given the Governor a ""Harrumph""?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18err8/i_am_congressman_jared_polis_sponsor_of_hr_499_to/c8e58qk?context=5)|We live near Pearl Street mall so usually hang out downtown, you'll typically see me walking with our little dog Gia and/or our son (1.5 years old)
[How well does having a 1.5 year old son prepare you for dealing with Republicans?  *(Edit: Thanks for the Gold fellow Redditor\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18err8/i_am_congressman_jared_polis_sponsor_of_hr_499_to/c8e6mf4?context=5)|He sleeps more than the Republicans.

 |I am fine with my identities of course (one has to get used to things). I always try not to judge people or assume things because of their identities. Someone's wealth, sexual orientation, etc says nothing about whether they are a good person or not.
[Certain municipalities in Colorado are attempting to keep marijuana illegal in their jurisdictions. Some still write tickets for marijuana paraphernalia, accessories explicitly legalized in the state constitution. What can be done to see that these municipalities respect the will of the voters of Colorado?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18err8/i_am_congressman_jared_polis_sponsor_of_hr_499_to/c8e4zkx?context=5)|The will of the voters (Amendment 64) leaves it up to counties and cities how to regulate marijuana. I fully expect that many counties and cities will retain or enact bans. That is entirely their choice. The answer is to elect a different city council if you don't like their decisions.
 |Just as when federal prohibition ended for alcohol, many counties remaind ""dry"" and there are dry counties to this day.
[It has always been my ambition to go into politics, and I have been seriously thinking about running for Congress, maybe very soon. I am currently 23, and I will be 25 by the time the next election cycle comes around (really not much younger than you were when you won your seat in Congress\). What advice would you have for an aspiring politician?  Have you felt that you have had less of a voice, or that maybe other Congressmen/women condescend you because of your relatively young age compared to the rest of the body? And lastly, let's say you have an idea, how difficult is it for you to gain support to create legislation for both and ordinary run of the mill idea and for maybe a more revolutionary idea (for instance, your state legalized marijuana, what if you were to take an idea like this that traditionally goes against the grain to the national level\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18err8/i_am_congressman_jared_polis_sponsor_of_hr_499_to/c8e4yrw?context=5)|I think running for office can be a great experience. Even if it is a long shot to win you really get to know a lot of parts of your community and meet a lot of great people along the way. You'll never know what will happen unless you try! Don't let it get to you if you don't win the first time, it's still a great educational experience and it gives voters a real choice!  I was the second youngest member of Congress when I was elected. I think I am maybe 10th or 15th or something now. No one ever gave me a hard time about it. I think it has more to do with how you carry yourself and your confidence than how old you are.  I do have to focus my time and efforts on things that have at least a chance of passing. If you want to go really against the grain you certainly can, but it would be more to start a conversation than actually pass a bill.
[Thanks for the response! I have to imagine it can be pretty frustrating trying to deal with creating legislation (and where applicable, especially legislation that goes against the grain\) and at the same time having only two-year terms. Ever think about running for the Senate?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18err8/i_am_congressman_jared_polis_sponsor_of_hr_499_to/c8e589z?context=5)|The Senate is just as slow-moving than the House, sometimes more so!
[What can be done to counteract the abuse of power by policing officials such as cops and TSA agents?  It seems more than ever that they are abusing their power on good, honest citizens.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18err8/i_am_congressman_jared_polis_sponsor_of_hr_499_to/c8e5ldt?context=5)|1) If there is something you are aware of that is an abuse please let me know.
[Why do you think the current administration has been so harsh on medical marijuana dispensories?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18err8/i_am_congressman_jared_polis_sponsor_of_hr_499_to/c8e507h?context=5)|I reject the premise of the question.
 |Wow, that sounds legalistic. I always wanted to reject the premise of a question. THis is my first time I've said that!
 |AnyWho, the administration has been very clear through the Ogden memo that medical marijuana dispenseries that are clearly following state law are the lowest enforcement priority. This means that largely the feds have left medical marijuana dispenseries alone. In my state of Colorado that has been the case. I understand that in California there have been several raids, but these are of dispenseries that are operating in a gray area or a outright illegal manner under California laws. California state needs to tighten its laws to have less ambiguity so the feds don't have a pretense to come in. 
[What can congress do to help the DEA reschedule marijuana from a class 1 drug up to lets say a class 3 or 4 or completely unschedule the drug?  As a doctor I can prescribe Cocaine for my patient legally but if I have a patient on marijuana they are still breaking the federal law.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18err8/i_am_congressman_jared_polis_sponsor_of_hr_499_to/c8e6ffd?context=5)|Thank you for highlighting the absurdity of current law.

 |My favorite thing is being able to make a difference on an issue. I helped delay SOPA which led to ya'll helping finally kill it. That felt really good.
[I love the idea of there being one singular congressional yacht. They all share it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18err8/i_am_congressman_jared_polis_sponsor_of_hr_499_to/c8e8x51?context=5)|Might actually be a good investment if it helped everyone get along and work together.
[Thank you so much for taking the time to answer our questions, Rep. Polis!  It's awesome that you're doing the AMA from the floor of the House. I heard that you recently became joined No Labels, an organization I'm really interested in, as a problem solver. Could you explain more about what that means?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18err8/i_am_congressman_jared_polis_sponsor_of_hr_499_to/c8e514k?context=5)|I'm actually wearing the pin for that right now and along with other members I'll be wearing it tonight.
 |The pin says (looking down at it)"" Committed to fix not fight""
 |It means that we need to look at our job as Americans first and not just as Republicans or Democrats. Specifically, the No labels group  www.nolabels.org is seeking a ""go big"" deal to balance our budget and restore fiscal sanity to DC.
[That's awesome! I look forwarding to see what the pins look like on TV. How do you and the rest of the problem solvers actually plan on ""fixing"" Congress though? It's seems a pretty big idea that could be hard to implement.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18err8/i_am_congressman_jared_polis_sponsor_of_hr_499_to/c8e57os?context=5)|The pins are orange, maybe the TV announcers will say something about them. Also all members have a red pin, that's our ID pin that identifies us as members of Congress.
 |Solving problems involves compromise.
 |Edit: we are also wearing green ribbons for the Sandy Hook victims.
[To what extent can law enforcement realistically prevent diversion of marijuana to minors?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18err8/i_am_congressman_jared_polis_sponsor_of_hr_499_to/c8e63yu?context=5)|I believe law enforcement is in a better position to prevent distribution to minors if it is legal and regulated vs. banned because the corner drug dealer doesn't care about selling to a kid.
[Do you have any long term plans for your political career, Senate? Presidency? Where do you see yourself in the next 2 elections?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18err8/i_am_congressman_jared_polis_sponsor_of_hr_499_to/c8e53an?context=5)|No specific plans, just elected to my third term in the House and looking forward to serving!

[Do you play any video games, and which ones?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18err8/i_am_congressman_jared_polis_sponsor_of_hr_499_to/c8e5g9y?context=5)|League of Legends, DOTA II, was into Starcarft/Warcraft.

 |League of Legends and DOTAII right now.
[Hi Jared!  You aren't old.  I remember Wizardry 1, and I got to beta test Wizardry IV.  Good stuff.  The Ultima series was amazing too.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18err8/i_am_congressman_jared_polis_sponsor_of_hr_499_to/c8e61nm?context=5)|PATRI!!! You got your own country yet?

 |I think the Simpson-Bowles plan is a reasonable plan to bring the budget closer to balance that includes cuts and revenue.
[I'm a CU student and a proud supporter of your campaign, but I, like many students, feel like my vote isn't really relevant. In a modern age of intense gerrymandering and stockpiles of secret money what can the average person do to feel like they get their fair say in the political discourse?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18err8/i_am_congressman_jared_polis_sponsor_of_hr_499_to/c8e5klu?context=5)|Go Buffs! And Rams! (both in the district I represent) You should just secretly stockpile a few million.
 |Absent that, of course your voice is heard. Contact me anytime, work in elections to support people you like and defeat people who stand in the way of progress. It's shockingly easy to get involved. It takes time or money, and most everybody has one of those two available to make a difference.
[What is one thing that you think everyone should know/ talk about that isn't being discussed here?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18err8/i_am_congressman_jared_polis_sponsor_of_hr_499_to/c8e6fsq?context=5)|Well my passion is for improving schools and education, so I would love questions about my many bills that do that also ideas from redditors.

I also admire Lawrence Lessig's ideas on this matter. I agree it is of critical importance to do what we can to reduce the influence of money in politics.
[Being one of your constituents, I want to ask you a question about the issue that concerns me the most: Money in politics. Everything from corporate lobbying to Citizens United, I believe that the role money has played in politics especially within the last decade has gotten worse and is the biggest issue that politicians are not actively discussing. What do you believe is a realistic approach of attempting to start to solve this broad issue?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18err8/i_am_congressman_jared_polis_sponsor_of_hr_499_to/c8e5xba?context=5)|

[As someone that's supporting marijuana, have you ever used it yourself?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18err8/i_am_congressman_jared_polis_sponsor_of_hr_499_to/c8e54zw?context=5)|Nope, no desire to. I like reality too much.
[Hi Congressman Polis, thanks for sponsoring the uniting american families act, a bill that is very important to me and the lgbt community. The senate has not included LGBT families in their CIR framework while President Obama has... any idea if the house is going to include us... how can we help you to make sure that it is an inclusive CIR, one that includes ALL families?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18err8/i_am_congressman_jared_polis_sponsor_of_hr_499_to/c8e5kqb?context=5)|Of course immigration reform needs to help reunite families, including same sex families.

The Vikings now drop to 0-6 on the season and sit dead last in the NFC North …The playoff’s are merely an afterthought now. The Vikings need to get there shit together and get a W!!  When the Vikings sent AP to Detroit in return for Megatron, many saw it has a phenomenal trade. However Megatron has not been a factor for the Vikings … It isn’t his fault either… Ryan Mallett has been as useful as some shit on a stick. Also the Vikings defense has been mediocre to say the least and that is a compliment.

So without further or do let me introduce to you the new head coach of the Minnesota Vikings …. [Nicolas Cage!!]( http://i9.photobucket.com/albums/a90/Kulo69/Cagevikings_zps61719a70.jpg)

**Cage walks out from the curtains , and approaches the podium** : 

* *”Thank you Zgyi, ladies and gentlemen... I have the utmost faith that I will be able to turn these losers into winners, Then doing something that has never happened in Minnesota... win a Lombardi trophy for this great city.*  **A Vikings intern walks up and whispers something into Cages ear** 0-6….. ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?!?!  *Whelp…. Its has been fun… Fuck this… I am going back to Hollywood FUCKERS!!”* **Cage starts to walk off stage...... then quickly comes back to the podium** *” Im just fucking with you!! I am very excited to have this opportunity, I promise to turn around this sinking ship!”* **Cage grins then walks off the stage**

I've applied to four graduate schools. Ohio State didn't want me. My GPA, though I've pulled it from a 2.56 my freshman year to a 3.2 last semester, is .05 outside the threshold for Wisconsin-Madison. UC-Santa Barbara is essentially MIA. My undergrad university denied me just today.

I have the best resume of anyone I know. I hate to brag, but here goes:  
***TWO*** federal summer internships: US Census Bureau and the US Senate.  
Experience abroad (Costa Rica).  
Student government for two years, vice-chair of two committees.  
Interned with the geography department last semester as an instructor and tutor.  
Been doing research with the department for a year and a half -- won an undergraduate poster competition and will present my work in the state capital next month. Furthermore, I'm the only undergraduate in this position -- everyone else is a grad or a paid staff member.

My resume is perfect -- the career center and several alumna have said so.

The ultimate hubris was blowing hundreds of dollars of my parents' money -- when they already pay out-of-state tuition -- on grad applications and I get in NOWHERE. I spent all last semester and part of the one before that researching, testing for, and applying to these schools. My GREs are in the eightieth percentile. I feel awful wasting their time and my own, and even my advisers and past bosses for writing letters of recommendation.

Maybe I'm drunk right now (which is quite possible), maybe I'm arrogant, maybe I really don't stack up to my peers, but **WHO IS BETTER THAN ME?** ***WHAT CANDIDATE COULD POSSIBLY MEET MY CREDENTIALS, LET ALONE SURPASS THEM?*** I had every relevant faculty member recommend me to the department, let alone other institutions! Some of whom were on the selection committee! Everyone I consulted said I should apply to grad school and more or less signed off on my four choices.

I'm terrified to start a job search. If I can't get into grad school, why should I get a job? The departments and agencies and bureaus I've applied to are paying well outside of what I could hope to earn starting off. $60K? Are you kidding? I need a doctorate for that kind of money. No design shop, cartographic or otherwise, would hire me; I can't draw freehand and my inkscape/illustrator experience is a joke. No contractor would want me because I'm too much of a liability for any clearance they want (and it would take forever to get said clearance). The idea a developer would want me is laughable; I can't program and can't understand code. And this is my fourth time trying.

I'm a useless geographer. Nobody wants anyone who just wants to sit around *making maps* all day. I always thought I could get a job in any field I wanted -- ""geography can be used on anything, anywhere"" I was saying even a few weeks ago.

But nobody's gonna contact me. I spun my wheels for years to get absolutely nowhere. My education has been a joke, my experiences are worthless.

I've got a paper due in six hours and research due to my boss in nine. My parents are supportive (and surprised), but I just feel like I've let them down. My friends will judge me, and I'll live in a shit apartment or my old room for years until I find a shit-tier job.

In the end, none of it mattered. I wanted to be the best -- to mean something to geography and cartography -- and today, I feel like one of the worst."
18fkq0,6,2013-02-13,Academic Suspension to Dean's List to Job at a Fortune 500 company,frenchybrown,GetMotivated,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/18fkq0/academic_suspension_to_deans_list_to_job_at_a/,"I had a previous post this summer about my trip from academic suspension to dean's list [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/togf6/my_story_of_academic_suspension_to_deans_list/). 

But now I have an update:

I had committed to and signed a lease for this year, but had no plan to pay for it. I had unsuccessfully searched for internships during the year but failed on every single one, so this left me starting the summer with $500/month for rent and utilities and no way to pay for it. I went job searching like crazy, got a shitty job working for a paper mill making $8/hr and working 10+ hour days. I quickly decided this sucked and applied to and got a job at a Car Rental Company at the nearby airport. I had applied to a basic position but was promoted during the interview and I cannot stress enough how much of a blessing this job has been. I can't think of many college kids who have made just shy of $20,000 in about 8 months of my senior year, this allowed me to stay debt free for school and housing!

Once the fall semester opened I finally had basically had it with the drinking and not caring scene to the fullest and decided that I would not fail in getting a job before graduation, no exceptions. I immediately starting applying to jobs and going to information sessions, writing cover letters, sending follow up e-mails. I wasn't perfect and definitely missed many application deadlines and had to work during some info sessions, which was a downer, but by October I had 4 interviews lined up!

Now I was understandably nervous that my GPA would hurt me in these, but again, it didn't matter because I told myself I wouldn't fail. Meanwhile none of my friends were really even looking, they commented on but weren't really interested in me heading out suited up with portfolio in hand, I think they just thought I would fail and jobs weren't worth trying for.

Well first interview went awful, she asked a lot of questions I wasn't ready for, she had me scrambling to answer and honestly we both came to the conclusion that I was neither right for the job nor did I really want it, regardless it was a crushing blow. Next interview I knocked out of the park! I had the good fortune of interviewing with someone I had previously met at an info session and had talked to her and her boss for about 10 mins at the info session. Interview went great, I had excellent answers for everything they threw at me, but the dreaded question of GPA came up and while I feel I handled it well, no doubt that hurt me. Finally, my last two both went excellent. 

Over the next 2 weeks I got several e-mails about how it was so nice to meet me but there were other more qualified candidates and I was freaking out, but I got one second round at the company's corporate campus. Although I knew I couldn't fail, only having one option...especially after I thought I had done so well really scared me. The interview was an all day affair with several panels and even a test. But three weeks later in mid november, I got the best call in the world, $50k a year and now while everyone else is scrambling I can rest easy and count down the days.

Even right now, my friends who have no idea, lead or anything towards a job are out celebrating fat Tuesday while I do homework. So long story short, nothing beats perseverance, not your past or others thoughts, nothing.

I'm an economics major, so i like to put everything in those terms, so remember, everything you've ever failed at in your entire life is a ""sunk cost"" nothing you can do, will change or remove the time, effort and opportunities you've lost, so stop thinking about how they're holding you back and just don't take no for an answer.

Hope this hits home to some of you who were/are in my shoes. There was a point when I thought I blew it, but now I can sit back and relax, knowing that I turned things around. Nothing would make my day more than to help anyone out with any questions or advice on righting the ship or looking for jobs, I left out a lot of details on what I did. It was about 2 months of non-stop class, homework, work, applying for jobs, sleep and repeat it's not easy but it is possible."

I'm about to graduate in two months from the U of Minnesota with a Political Science degree.  Two months ago, my hours were cut from 40 to 5 hours on my only source of income.  Two weeks later, I was fired outright for showing up more often.  So I am running on 60 bucks with no job.  I have a comcast contract until August, and an Excel bill I haven't paid. Oh, I also have 65k in debt.  That is the aspect I need monetary help on, if you've got the money to donate to a broke fuck.

As for the advice.  I picked political science as a degree my sophomore year, in partial naivety.  I thought I could, and wanted to change the system from the poisonous atmosphere we exist in today.  In the three years since, I have lost all faith in Capitol Hill, and have discovered that the only constant in my life has been video gaming.  I have decided that is the career path I want to follow.  So, as advice goes, here's my question.  I've got two political internships, eight different jobs since I was 13, ranging from short-order cook to Senior IT support, but a dismal GPA (2.6).  I spent college learning more about who i was than studying.  Many of you might be able to relate.

So, where could I start in the gaming industry? Are there any other semi-related jobs I should look to apply for as a recent grad?  What programs can I take advantage of in the next two months until I graduate, since no one will hire someone for two months?  Finally, is there anyone in Seattle, specifically in the gaming industry, who might be able to give me a leg up? I'll even start off as a QA tester, as long as there's the opportunity to work my way up.

I currently live in Minneapolis (which is my ideal work location), but would be willing to relocate.  Seattle is first choice, followed by Colorado and California, followed by anywhere else.  Thank you for your help and advice, it's all needed."

I'm mainly wondering if taking an extra summer off of work to pursue an internship during my junior year is worth the cost.

18fegs,1,2013-02-12,Last Tuesday,[deleted],shortstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/18fegs/last_tuesday/,"	Harry woke up last Tuesday morning. This wasn't a particularly unusual event, as he had woken up every morning in a similar manner for thirty-five years. He had developed the habit of turning the alarm off several times before crawling out of bed, and Tuesday was no different. He stumbled to the bathroom, scratched his stubble and emptied his bladder. All typical morning activities. He made his coffee, smoked a cigarette, and thumbed through the paper. Nothing atypical.
	He took a shower and pondered his existence. While this may have been an ordinary action at other times, Harry had come to a new conclusion: his life was no longer worth living. 
	Harry was a thinker, and knew to take each thought with care. He kept this thought and studied it. There was validity to the thought. Harry's life was never really worth living; but, it wasn't really worth dieing for, either. He was typically caught in a penumbra of apathy.
	He finished his shower, and returned to his newspaper. Another school shooting. At a preschool, this time. The culprit was a war veteran. He unloaded his fully automatic assault rifle into the kids while they napped. The teachers were unharmed; they were fucking a few blocks away in a rented car.
	The shooter then walked down the street to a retirement home where he murdered three elderly women who were sitting on their porch. On Mondays, they liked to drink tea and knit. They found it quaint. The veteran found killing innocent people quaint. It takes all kinds.
	In his final act, the armed man walked into the main office and pulled the pin on a grenade. Twenty-five people died that day. Twelve children, ten adults, and three old ladies. But who's keeping a tally?
	Harry didn't finish the article. There had been another shooting a week ago. And another not too far beyond that. Harry had become numb to the slaughter. He grabbed his coat and drove to work, at a minor chemical manufacturer. He was a bench-chemist. He mostly cleaned glassware for people who stayed in school longer than him. But it was a job, thankless and hopeless.
	As Harry swirled a dilute sulfuric acid and potassium dichromate solution in an erlenmeyer flask, his earlier idea bubbled back into his brain. His life really wasn't worth living. The other people in the lab weren't particularly friendly. They all had families and friends and things to do. Harry often wished he had things to do.
	He wasn't an unattractive individual, but he wasn't attractive either. This enabled to go through life practically invisible. Most people never knew he was ever around. Even as a child, his family barely acknowledged his existence. He'd often have to walk home from practice or work or school simply because his parents had forgotten they had had three children.
	Once, Santa forgot about him on Christmas. He never forgave Santa. Another time, his family celebrated his birthday three weeks early. No one could remember when he was born.
	While he was studying chemistry, his parents divorced and remarried. His cousin had over-dosed on benzos. Three friends committed group suicide. His mother suffered a mental collapse and was beaten to death by her abusive meth-addicted second husband. His older brother got married, had children, and got a divorce. Harry didn't learn any of this until five years ago. It took his extended family over ten years to realize they hadn't told him.
	Harry didn't care much about his family. He was disowned by his father when he was sixteen because he smoked pot. 
	Harry knew he had a gun at home. He'd stick the barrel to the side of his head and throw in the towel.
	As Harry finished his work and walked to his car, a stranger followed him into the parking lot. When Harry unlocked his car, the individual stuck the barrel of his gun to his ribcage and demanded all of Harry's possessions. Clothes, car and all.
	Harry laughed. ""I'm going home to kill myself. Shoot me if you have to. You'll only hasten the process and preserve a shred of my dignity."" The man shot him in the abdomen and fled. A woman heard the blast and came over to investigate.
	She saw Harry slumped on the ground, next to his car. She called an ambulance. She walked  next to Harry as he groaned. He was bleeding, as one could expect. She sat down and held his head. She stroked his hair. She said everything was going to be okay. She told him her name was Maggie. Well, Margaret, actually, but that's the name her mother used to call her when she was in trouble. Maggie didn't like that name.
	The ambulance arrived and Maggie rode with him. She lied and said she was his wife. Harry had never even been in a relationship longer than a week. Easy come, easy go.
	Maggie waited with Harry until someone close to him showed up. She was sure he had someone who would care if he got shot. Doesn't everybody?
	Nobody came asking for Harry.
	She stayed overnight, and read out loud from the book she had on her. She loved reading books out loud. Still no one arrived looking for Harry.
	Luckily, the bullet had missed the vital parts of Harry, and he was in no mortal danger. He was wounded and sore, certainly, but a far cry from dead. He woke disoriented and vaguely coherent. 
	Harry wasn't a religious man, but he thought he had reached the equivalent of an after-life. He saw Maggie. An angel, certainly. The rising sun silhouetted her frizzed hair giving the illusion of a halo. Harry was glad to have seen her. Harry liked seeing beautiful things.
	""Where am I?"" He asked towards Maggie.
	""The hospital.""
	""Oh.""
	Harry relaxed into his bedding and closed his eyes. 
	""Is there anyone I should contact for you? I'm sure someone's worried sick about you.""
	""Nope. What you see is what you get.""
	Maggie moved next to Harry and held his hand. ""I'm Maggie. It's going to be okay.""
	Harry smiled. Maybe things were finally turning for the better. ""I've got to go to work. I'll be back this evening."" She left, and passed a medical school student on her way in.
	The medical school intern stared at a chart, then looked at the name on Harry's chart. 
        ""Harry is like Barry. It must just be a typo."" The intern thought to herself. She attached the I.V. line into Harry's arm.
	Harry died later that afternoon. He had a major allergic reaction to the penicillin that the intern had pumped into his arm. Easy come, easy go."

I'm a third year mechanical engineering major so I'm really looking for internships (never worked one before). Here are my questions:

1. Should I include my cumulative GPA and my major GPA? I calculated my major GPA and it's a 3.0, as for my cumulative it's currently standing at a 2.8

2. I listed all the relevant courses I've taken (pretty much all the courses I put towards my major GPA), is this a good or bad thing? Also, I took some high engineering classes too, should I list those to show how long I've been into engineering?

3. Pretty much all the jobs I have worked have been in the same industry (fast-casual restaurants), and my job description between the jobs hasn't really been much different. Thus making my written responsibilities a tad redundant. How can I make this more unique?

4. What kind of references should I put into my resume, and how many? I was in scouting (reached Eagle) so I was figuring one of my old scout leaders could be a good source. I also still keep in contact with one of my high school engineering teachers, would that be good too?

During that time, I've lived with her abroad in Germany, studying and traveling. We're pretty serious about this and we've discussed this a couple times and thought about how to be together. If not the U.S, we'd go to Britain or something. But we've chosen the U.S. She's currently here in the U.S and nearing the end of her F-1 student visa, however, her visa was extended by the USCIS service because we initially wanted to change it to a J-1 visa and she had not found a company willing to sponsor her or take her as an intern - although she is very talented and extremely hard working I might add!

Anyway, the end of her STUDENT visa would be the end of February, however, due to the extension of her status by USCIS, she can legally stay until July 17th.....which also happens to be on our 2nd anniversary. (Fuck)

Can we get married and do it in legal bounds for the duration of her stay in the U.S? I don't want to be separated from her. I can't leave either because I haven't completed my schooling or started my internship. And she hasn't finished her degree yet. A long distance relationship would be difficult. And suck.

1. Are engineering-type skills needed at all by the Peace Corps? **Do they ever do some Engineers Without Borders type stuff?** I'd love to help with any sort of engineering related problems.

2. Would it be difficult to transition back into the engineering workforce if I take 2 years off directly out of school? **Has anyone else headed straight into the Peace Corps after graduating with a sciency/technical degree?** How it turn out for you afterwards? My worry is that if I get out of school and then go straight into something unrelated to my field for a couple years, I might have trouble getting back into engineering after I'm done.

3. How likely am I to get in? Graduating in June with a Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering, 2 summers experience working at a summer camp teaching kids rock climbing (CPR/First Aid certification is still valid), not much other work experience, but I've helped EWB fundraise for a Honduras project, and I've spent some time helping out a children's program for kids in the poor area of my local town.

Edit: Maybe since the application process takes so long (why does it take so long btw?), I could get some sort of internship in the meantime. That would give me some connections and experience so that I don't feel like I'd be losing my touch with engineering.

[Hey Burkie, how did you feel about JVR toe-dragging Luke Schenn last night?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dumii?context=5)|I was out scouting the Beanpot last night. Had to find more talented young players to keep our playoff streak alive. 
[Why do you think hockey and soccer are the first two professional sports to create You Can Play videos? Is there something intrinsic to those sports that makes them more open to LGBT rights?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dujgb?context=5)|Hockey and soccer (in the US, at least) do seem to be leading the way on this issue. I think the international diversity of the leagues help (Canadians tend to be very gay friendly, for example). There's almost certainly a large number of socioeconomic factors at play as well. It's an unfortunate truth that minority groups (whether based on racial, religious, economic, etc) tend to have different attitudes towards the LGBT community. We've tried to emphasize adding LGBT people from those groups who can really target our outreach.
 |Esera Tuaolo, for example, is a gay ex-NFL player who is religious and also Samoan. He's helping us as Special Advisor on Faith and Religion, and will also help with outreach to the many Samoan NFLers out there. Wade Davis, another gay ex-NFL player, works at the Hendrick-Martin Institute, working with inner city LGBT youth. He has tremendous, tremendous insight into how to reach inner city athletes, and will help us on that front. 
[Thanks for doing this AMA and for your amazing work with YCP. I recently attended an Invisible Athlete Forum where you touched on the fact that you set up YCP as an 8 year project because you think that the work will be done in that amount of time or less (I hope you're right!\). Can you expand on how/why you picked that time frame? Do you think that homophobia in sports can ever truly be completely eliminated? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8duxrj?context=5)|8 years is the amount of time it takes for a high school freshman to graduate college. That's why we picked that time frame. Give a kid who was getting out of the 8th grade in 2012 a full 8 years of YCP before he gets out of college.
 |It's never going to be completely eliminated. Like racism, sexism, or any -ism. Unfortunately hatred and ignorance will always be able to find a home. I firmly believe in 8 years it will largely be a non-issue, however. We will have openly gay athletes in every major male team sport, and it will be common place. Athletes coming out will be a non-story, and openly gay youth athletes will be drafted into pro leagues. At that point we'll have to re-visit YCP and see what we want to do.
 |I never had any intention of making this my life's work. I do this to honor my brother, and to try to do my best to do some of the work I think he might have done. I do this to give back to the LGBT community who was so good to my brother, and has been so good to our family. I do this because I love sports, and I want everyone to have the chance to experience the joy that I find in the game. I do this because kids are quitting, kids are being beaten up, and kids are dying from this. And I think I'm in a position where I have a story, a voice, a message, and a personality that lends well to being effective at reaching athletes. But my life before my brother's accident consisted of drinking beer, working out, watching hockey, and chasing women. I would very much like to fix this bullshit so I can get back to that. 
[Hey Patrick. Great cause. I love telling people about this project, especially when they inquire about my You Can Play tshirt.   There seems to be less of a stigma for female athletes who are out. I see that a big part of your poject has your message coming from male athletes. Is You Can Play more interested in getting the message out through male athletes or are you looking for female athletes to partnership with too?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8duk6k?context=5)|We've made female athletes a priority from the start. We're official partners with the CWHL (professional women's hockey), which was our first official league partnership. Our advisory board has many strong female voices. And we've made a priority to emphasize the voices of female athletes in our speaking engagements and videos. Our college videos prominently feature female allies and lesbian/bi/trans athletes. Too many people think it's a non-issue in women's sports, and it's really not. There's still a lot of work to be done. 
[Why is it so hard for athletes to come out of the closet ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dud9i?context=5)|There's a variety of reasons. Some guys don't want to be first and have to deal with all the media attention. Some guys don't want to be a role model. Some guys just want to play sports and not be a ""Jackie Robinson"" for gay rights. Some are nervous about their teammates' reaction, or about their job security, or about the fan reaction. There's dozens of reasons that may keep a professional athlete closeted, but I think we're rapidly seeing those reasons disappear.
[Also, what's your new favourite NHL team now ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dud9i?context=5)|I work for the Philadelphia Flyers. So, them. 
[Do you actually know gay NHLers ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dugks?context=5)|We have a no comment policy on that one. 
[If you're curious, Chris Kluwe is also a big Reddit user over in /r/nfl.  They say if you say his name three times, that he'll appear.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dvxcw?context=5)|I follow Chris on twitter and check in on him on Reddit at times. Really good guy. Funny as hell. 
[I know I've already asked a question, but I'd love it if you had some perspective on this for me: what's the best way to support a family member who's closeted?  It's still a secret to almost everyone, obviously, but I don't want him to feel like it's taboo either.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8duk84?context=5)|Be respectful of them. Mind your language. Find ways to be LGBT-supportive. It's a tough line to walk, because every closeted LGBT person has their own journey they have to take before they come out, and it's not up to us to force it. 
[Hey Patrick, I'm a big supporter of the project. Have there been any NHL players who have refused to support the cause?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dudv0?context=5)|We have a no-comment policy on whether or not athletes respond. We do not want any athlete to ever feel pressured to participate. Same thing for the teams. We've been asked to endorse email campaigns or Change.org petitions, and we always refuse. I don't want athletes who were guilt tripped into this. I want athletes who are excited about it. 
[Do you think when sports teams receive negative publicity because a single player said he would not be comfortable with a gay teammate, that that response helps reinforce your message? Cam Jansen or that 49ers player who said he would not feel comfortable with a gay teammate come to mind.  What the hell is going on with the Capitals, and what do you think GMGM is going to do between now and the trade deadline?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dud40?context=5)|I think that the responses from the sports world towards comments like Cam's or Chris Culliver's illustrate how far we've come. Ten years ago, those comments would have been shrugged off with no response, or even endorsed by people. Now they're being critiqued and analyzed. It's very encouraging to see. 
[What should I tell people that are hateful towards homosexuals and attribute it to their religion?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dufcq?context=5)|I wrote this in response to Torii Hunter's quotes about being uncomfortable around gay teammates because of his religion. Long story short, if you're trying to emulate Jesus, there's no justification for being an asshole to anyone.
 |[Link to deadspin.com](http://deadspin.com/5972579/what-would-jesus-do-about-a-gay-teammate-a-christian-response-to-torii-hunters-comments)
[What's your favourite memory from your time in Vancouver with your Dad?  And, can you still recognize Henrik and Daniel after all these years?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8duj3i?context=5)|I could never tell Hank and Daniel apart. No one could. One of them had a chipped tooth for a while, and everyone was thrilled because they finally knew who was who.
 |I really loved Vancouver. I was there from 87-92, roughly. The best memory of that time was Gino Odjick scoring on a penalty shot against Calgary. To this day, that was the loudest I've ever heard a stadium. I'm pretty sure he injured himself celebrating. 
[Do you think the flack Tim Thomas received for not going to the White House with the Bruins hurt your cause at all?  The guy basically 'came out of the closet' as a right-wing conservative and a lot of people feel that it was a huge distraction to the team.  You've proven the players will support their team-mate, but do you feel that the media reaction (even if positive\) might be a problem?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dujpe?context=5)|No. Most professional athletes are conservative, politically. Tim's actions had no affect on what we were doing, it simply underscored why we never take on any political issues. They're too divisive. Why give a player an excuse not to join you? We don't endorse candidates, we don't campaign on issues, we don't say or do anything political. The most right-wing athlete in the world can feel just as comfortable working with YCP as the most left-wing athlete in the world.  
[Is the point of YCP more about tolerance or acceptance- because if it's just tolerance, that stance totally makes sense. If it is acceptance, are you working first towards tolerance and then acceptance?   ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dwt5i?context=5)|I'll take tolerance to start. Then we keep moving. If we could get every athlete in the world to say ""I'll support an openly gay teammate"" and eliminate homophobic slurs, (which would be the basics for ""tolerance""), I'd be pretty happy. 
[What do you think is the proper punishment for athletes who use homophobic slurs in a game? I feel like Kobe's punishment 2 years ago ($100,000\) was a bad idea just because the fine only teaches him not to use the words BUT not why not to use them. Do you feel that sports leagues need better punishments for those that use these slurs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dupit?context=5)|Education. I don't care at all if a player is fined, suspended, whatever, as long as there is mandatory, EFFECTIVE, education. Not just some token, bullshit gesture to make it all go away, but real work, with real LGBT athletes.
 |That said, there should be discipline. My feeling is that as long as the leagues are going to regulate what players can and cannot say in terms of racist/sexist comments, comments about officiating, comments about fans, comments about league officials, etc., then the LGBT community deserves that same protection. If the leagues ever wanted to say ""We no longer police anything our players say on or off the field, on any issue, at any time,"" I'd also support that. Because it would be entertainingly chaotic and a total disaster for everyone. 
[Would you like to see players start to police themselves in this regard--so that using a homophobic slur was a reason to drop the gloves even if it wasn't directed at you? How much do you think those slurs are accepted/shunned right now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dvv7x?context=5)|I have no doubt that will happen once the first players start coming out. Someone's going to say something stupid and get the crap beat out of them. 
[What steps do you take to get a team to take the pledge? Do they come to you or do you pitch it to them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8due68?context=5)|Teams have generally come to us. The Toronto Marlies (AHL) originally reached out to us to have a speaker come in and address the team. So I went in alongside Scott Heggart, a gay goalie. We talked to the team for 30 minutes or so and then bounced out. Scott was amazing, as he always is. Afterward the team asked if they could do something more than just make a video. So, we drafted the Pledge for them. The Pirates and the Providence Bruins heard about it, and both called me asking for information. Now Hamilton is filming theirs for release soon. Wilkes-Barre, same thing. AHL teams are really excited about this. 
[You're a scout right?  Who would you take 1st overall in the 2013 draft if you had to decide right now?  What about 1st overall in the 2014 draft if you had to decide right now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dumx4?context=5)|I'm a pro scout, so I don't do the amateur side of things. I haven't seen those top amateur guys. I would recommend trusting Bob McKenzie on that stuff though- he's pretty plugged in at the scouting level. 
[Hey Patrick, you're the president of You Can Play, you're going to law school, and you're a scout for the Flyers. That sounds like a ridiculous work load, how do you balance everything?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dunq8?context=5)|I train for the Boston Marathon. Keeps me sane. We'll be making that a fundraiser soon, I think. 
[As a Hockey Enthusiast and fellow Runner trying to qualify for Boston (3:18:38, so close\), I'm glad to hear you raise money for this event!  I'd love to donate to your fundraiser when it comes up or (Even better\) run Boston for the cause!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dvg2a?context=5)|I'm just trying to finish the stupid marathon. The first guy who ran this distance died, and then other people went ""I bet I wouldn't die doing that!"" It has to be the dumbest thing I've ever done while sober. 
[Have there been any times where you've had trouble recruiting a particular athlete or team to support the cause? If so, how did you handle it? Were you able to change their minds?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8duhju?context=5)|We've had overwhelming success recruiting athletes. It's reached the point with hockey players where we no longer really recruit guys- they just call me and ask how to get involved.  We have a pretty easy message- support any teammate that's good enough to help you win games. It's something that's very simple for athletes to understand and endorse. 
[Hey Burkie.  I know you've got a lot (all?\) of the AHL teams on board with the project, how long do you think it will be before you get an NHL team (officially\) on board?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dv5hs?context=5)|I think we can count some of the teams as officially on board at this point, even if they never signed anything. The Canucks marched in Vancouver Pride with me this summer, as an official team event (and my thanks again go to Manny Malhotra, Jason Garrison, and Fin, the mascot, for showing up). They had several players express support for YCP publicly, they ""dyed"" their rink purple for Spirit Day, and they recently did a feature story on a transgender goalie. The Leafs regularly run our PSAs in-arena and have been working behind the scenes on some LGBT outreach as well.  
[My question: there was  a scandal with the SF 49ers the week before the Superbowl, when it turned out that 2 of the 4 players who appeared in an ""It Gets Better"" video had no idea that it was to end bullying specifically of LGBT teens (because LGBT teens have a 3-4x higher rate of suicide than other teens, among other things\).  Their responses to a reporter's question indicated they may not have done the video if they had known it was targeted to LGBT teens.  The video was subsequently removed from the ""It Gets Better"" site.   Watching it, I can see that neither of the two make any reference to LGBT status; and I can well imagine that a team PR guy put them in front of a camera, had them read a sterile script, and they had no idea what the recording was for.  This made me feel like my rights are being used for sports PR, and that the people there don't really stand behind what they are saying.  It makes me question every single ""It Gets Better"" video, and also the ""You Can Play"" videos.  So: what re-assurance can you give that the players who appear in ""You Can Play"" project videos know that it is for gay players specifically, that they back that cause, and are not embarrassed about speaking for equality of gay players?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dvhzt?context=5)|I spoke with every player that appeared in the original NHL videos and they were aware specifically what it was for and what it was about. In our first couple videos, we did not push the players to say the ""magic"" words- gay, LGBT, homophobic, etc. This allowed guys to get their feet wet a little bit and allow the league to be comfortable with the idea that NHL players were standing up for gay rights. Now we ensure that athletes are saying gay, or LGBT, or homophobic, or otherwise making a specific reference to the gay community in the videos. There's no doubt about what our athletes are appearing for. If you don't want to take my word for it, here's part 1 of a 3 part series of NHL athletes being quoted on YCP.
[I love the fact that Brooks Oprik is the NHL representative in commercials for YCPP.  Do you have any relationship with Brooks?  Keep doing what you're doing.  Great cause.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8ducqk?context=5)|Brooks is good friends with my brother-in-law Jared. When we approached NHLers, we already had Tommy Wingels and Andy Miele on board, but Brooks was the first non-Miami University guy to respond. He became a bit of a pied piper for us. I could go to other guys who might be hesitating or confused and say ""Brooks is doing one."" It helped a lot of guys realize they wouldn't be the only one out there talking about this. We've incredibly grateful to Brooks (and his lovely wife Erin!).
[Hi Patrick - firstly, Sorry about your loss. Brendan seemed like a truly wonderful person.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dvnug?context=5)|No. He had talked about doing some outreach, and had given a couple speeches, but the idea for the campaign had its genesis after the accident, in an article I wrote for Outsports.com.  Actually, what we had talked about was Brendan speaking on gay rights, and me speaking on mental health. I had a long bout with depression that I had to overcome, and we thought going into high schools and sharing our stories might be useful.  I put some of that aside in order to focus on YCP in his honor.
[Was YCP something you and Brendan had thrown around prior to his passing?  What has been the biggest hurdle you've faced as an organization? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dvnug?context=5)|The biggest hurdle has been the political, turf war bullshit that goes on behind the scenes with fundraising, advocacy work, speaking opportunities, etc. I don't have the patience for the type of crap that goes on behind the scenes. I don't want to get famous, I don't want to throw parades, I don't get paid for any of this. I want to do the work. Put me and my speakers in front of athletes and let us do our thing. Someone else can take credit, I don't care. I'll be the GE Coors Light NBC Universal speaking bureau if people let me stop playing politics and let us do what we do best- real, effective, practical, outreach. 
[What is your position on transgendered athletes playing in their own gender (sorry, the terminology gets confusing for me\). That is, someone who is born a man but identifies female. They theoretically have a physical advantage playing in a women's league. Is that fair? How is this issue handled? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dxio1?context=5)|Good question. I'll give you a overly simple response, with the notation for anyone reading this that it is an overly simple and not at all in-depth look at trans issues. We recently added Christina Kahrl to our Advisory Board to help on trans issues.
 |First, since everyone only seems worried about male-to-female trans athletes, I'll say this: the hormones taken during the transition period mean that transitioning athletes are actually at a disadvantage within a few weeks of starting their transition. It's harder for them to recover, to retain muscle mass, and to be an elite athlete. This is not Ladybugs, where Johnathan Brandeis puts on a wig and is a women's soccer star. This is an intense, deeply personal, and physically trying medical and psychological procedure. The competitive argument simply doesn't hold water.
 |Second, are we really, really worried about this? I'm pretty competitive. I've been in fistfights over Monopoly games. I once broke up with a girlfriend of three years because she beat me in bowling. I was that kid in gym class who tried too hard. Let's say you came to me and said if you cut off my finger, I could win a Stanley Cup. I'm in. Now let's say you came to me and said you could cut off my dick, but I could win an Olympic Gold Medal in women's soccer. Do we really think there are elite athletes out there saying yes to this idea?
 |Trans athletes should be able to play their sport as their identifying gender. And they deserve our support to do so. 
[1\) Do you find certain sports are more receptive to talking about homophobia, admitting it's rampant, etc. than others.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dv7ab?context=5)|At the college level, every athlete listens and responds well to us, regardless of the sport.
[2\) Do you find certain areas of the world respond differently?  A baseball played from PR vs a hockey player from sweden?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dv7ab?context=5)|There are absolutely cultural differences for international players. We learned that with Yunel Escobar and his discussions with us about Cuban culture.
[3\) (multiquestion, sorry\) Has Moneyball changed hockey scouting at all?  Do you use advanced metrics, or is more your eyes than anything else.  I know in baseball there was a lot of pushback between what eyes were telling people and what computers were telling people.  How do you attack the game (other than being where the puck will be\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dv7ab?context=5)|I know some teams that use advanced stats, but unlike in baseball (where each individual play is a set event), the chaotic nature of hockey tends to limit their value. And the ones that I've looked at tend to do a poor job translating from CHL-AHL-NCAA to the NHL. In addition, our game is so emotional and based on passion, work ethic, and desire. Different players serve different roles on a team, and building a great NHL team for an 82 game NHL season and 25 game playoff run isn't as simple as finding 22 guys with great Corsi or whatever. 
[, thank you for your work with You Can Play. I'm also in law school so I can't imagine how busy you must be.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dv4rc?context=5)|There's some overlap, obviously, between LGBT issues and sexism issues. Pro sports definitely has a sexism problem, and it trickles down to lower levels. I'd support a charity that wants to take that on- I've got 4 sisters who I love more than anything. But it's not really what we're geared up for.
[My question: Do you have any plans to discuss sexism in pro sports? I'm a big sports fan (especially NHL hockey\) and I often find the sexism to be really frustrating. It's so normalized that most people don't seem to even question it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dv4rc?context=5)|That said, we do our best to take stands on it when possible. We amplify voices of strong female athletes, media members, and front office members whenever possible. We try to do real work with women's sports leagues and groups. We've refused to work with certain pro athletes who have done some of the more egregious examples of sexism.  I'd love to see women get more opportunities in front offices, coaching staffs, scouting staffs, even media roles. But it's just not what we're built for. 
[Do you think the increasing acceptance of the You Can Play pledge by NCAA and AHL teams will help encourage NHL, NFL, and other major sporting league clubs to make their own organization wide commitments to YCP and LGBT rights?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8duo6m?context=5)|I think that at the one-year mark we've shown that the other leagues can trust us, if they choose to. Things like the Pledge give teams an easy and effective way to hop on board. We've shown we can handle crisis situations like Yunel Escobar or Cam Janssen. We've shown we can handle the PR side of things, the fan relations side, the media side, and- by far the most important- the athlete side.  Addressing athletes isn't easy. You have to be a part of their community before they take you seriously. I've seen some LGBT speakers doing sports outreach who aren't sports people, and it drives me fucking crazy. Some aren't even fans! And you listen to them talk about sports and it sounds so forced and unnatural. They try to make jokes about sports related things, or talk about the locker room culture, and it's just...off. You have to be part of the culture before athletes will listen to you. And with the background our advisory board has, and with my background growing up around the game, athletes relate to our speakers. It's effective because they feel at home. 
[Congratulations on the great work with You Can Play!  During the last year, what defining moment made you realize people were really embracing the movement or that you had such a hard road ahead?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dusqw?context=5)|The day we sent the emails out to every NHL GM. I was sitting there watching the emails go out one by one and was just thinking ""Holy crap...if this doesn't work, I'm going to be the laughing stock of the NHL."" There was no turning back, really. If the GMs backed us, we would be off and running. If they thought I was an idiot, I was going to have to try a new line of work. Thank god they backed us. 
[Just wanted to say thanks for all you have done. I have some friends in the LGBT community so this is a cause that hits close to home. I feel like the hockey community is the perfect sport for us to have our first openly gay athlete.  With comments like that of Chris Culliver in the NFL driving home how far the gap still is. Have you been in contact with the NFL or other leagues to try and get this initiative to the other big sports?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8duqil?context=5)|We've spoken with every major professional sports league about getting involved. I think you'll see each league start picking how they want to do their involvement (whether through us, or GLAAD, or Athlete Ally, or StandUp, or GLSEN, or some combination of all of us).  I think the first hang-up we encountered was that the other leagues don't know me. So a 28 year old NHL scout who's still in law school walks into your league offices and says he can run all your LGBT outreach and education initiatives. When I did that with the NHL, our guys knew I wouldn't screw it up. When I did that with the other leagues, it was kind of ""Wait, who the hell are you again?""
[How'd you go about becoming a scout?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dv5bw?context=5)|I started breaking down games with my Dad when I was like 6. When I was 12 I realized I wasn't good enough at hockey to be an NHLer. So I told my family I wanted to be a GM. I started to try to watch games as a scout and analyze players. When I got to college, my Dad put me on to help out in the midwest as a ""bird dog"". I got fifty bucks a game. So all through college I gave up my Friday and Saturday nights and went to watch games- ND, Michigan, Michigan State, Bowling Green mostly. I sent email reports to the chief scout for him to critique. I also spent time in the front office with the Capitals, working a bit with the coaching staff for the Portland Pirates when Kevin Dineen was there, and I spent a year with the New England Patriots as their chief legal intern. Long story short, I had an in because of my last name. That cracked the door open for me. Then I worked my ass off for the last decade to make sure I didn't waste any of that advantage. 
[Hey Mr. Burke, how do you personally feel when guys like Culliver from San Fran, and Torri Hunter from Los Angeles Angels (now Tigers I guess\) make homophobic remarks using the public platform.  I know you, or anyone, can't control this...but how do you feel it affects what you and others are setting out to try to accomplish?  And does it anger you, or do you just want to try to help those individuals get past their closed minded ignorant ways?  For my hockey specific question...do you agree with me that young d-men with potential are the trade chips in the league at the highest premium? And if you do agree, do you expect that to be consistent looking into the future? Or will there be a changing of the guard in that accord? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dv2mf?context=5)|I get angry, I get annoyed, and then I move past that and start working on finding a positive outcome. Some players are actually homophobic. Most players are actually just uneducated or unfamiliar with the issue, so they say stupid things some times. As a group that works on educating those athletes, I can't hold grudges. I have to give the athlete the benefit of the doubt and work with him to talk him through the issue, then set him to work making things right. Anger is unproductive. I constantly try to remember the quote by Lincoln- ""I destroy my enemy by making him my friend.""
[Where/when did you decide ""I'm going to do something about this"" in regard to homophobia? Alot of people just ignore or complain.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dvr33?context=5)|My brother's wake. I made some promises to him then.

Otherwise I think I get fired. Lots of good teams out west. Any team from 1-10 could be a Cup contender. Come playoff time it will come down to health, really. 
[If you could change one rule in the NHL, what would that be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dvkuq?context=5)|I think we need to find a way to punish the rats in the game. We have too many guys who are loudmouth, cheap shot, dirty players and don't back it up. Too many guys in our game treat the linesmen like the Grinch with the Whos- they hear them coming and their heart grows three sizes.
 |Two ways to fix this. One is a modification on the instigator penalty to allow for guys like this to get the crap beat out of them. Almost certainly never going to happen. I'd like to see some sort of Cumulative Asshole Penalty. Right now guys have figured out they can be a little bit obnoxious after every whistle as long as no one act reaches the point of a penalty. I'd like to see referees empowered to give an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty for actions that build up over the course of the game. Either that or hire slower linesmen. 
[Will there come a point when YCP will get involved at the recreational and high school levels of sports, or do you feel the organization's focus is better served on a larger stage?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dvcvc?context=5)|We do some speaking at high schools, and when we get our Playbook up and operational (which took way longer than expected) it will be available to high schools. 
[Thanks for doing this AMA! What's your opinion on the shortened season, do you think the Stanley Cup champions of this season will win it with a little * next to their name? Also, as an STL fan I've been really bumming over this recent 0-4-1 streak, do you think every team will hit a little slump like that this season or do you think with it being so short there is a possibility for teams stay hot the whole way through? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dvcev?context=5)|A season is a season. No asterisk. Everyone is playing the same length. If one team was playing 48 and everyone else was playing 82, sure, use an asterisk. 
[Hi Patrick. Has an athlete ever said that they would be uncomfortable with a gay person seeing their genitals? If so how did you respond?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dw6o6?context=5)|The shower question comes up during talks a lot. There's a pretty shocking level of arrogance behind that statement. ""Oh of course gay guys are going to check ME out."" And of course the same athletes have zero problem dropping their towel when female reporters walk in. It's a non-issue, in my mind. 
[Would you rather fight 100 Mighty-Duck-sized-horses or 1 horse-sized-Mighty-Duck?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dwu2u?context=5)|I'm answering this as if it's the usual question, because the question always annoys me in its simplicity. 100 duck sized horses could be defeated if you had a bench to stand on and a steel chair to rain hell down on them from above. Ducks, meanwhile, are ferocious as hell even at their size. And assuming, arguendo, that the duck retains the ability to fly for this fight, I can't imagine why anyone would ever choose to fight a horse sized duck. 
[Is Burkies Dog House still a thing at the ACC? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dvle8?context=5)|I guess it's just a Dog House now, apparently. I've never actually had one. Big disappointment. Like never getting to see Chicago Stadium. 
[2\) Have you met much opposition specifically from religious groups, or religion-based arenas? I don't mean to spark a religion debate at all with this but am curious since there is an arena in my area with such a base that has apparently been used rather often for practice by the Leafs. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dwj8a?context=5)|1) Yes, check the website either this week or next for the videos from the NLL. I forget what day they go, but we've had tremendous buy-in from them.  2) No, because nothing we do contradicts any mainstream religious teachings. We don't do any work on things like marriage equality, for example. All we ask is for athletes to say they will treat their teammates with respect whether they're LGBT or straight. Kind of tough for religious groups to argue with that. We also make sure we are always, always treating religion with respect. We recently added Esera Tuaolo as Special Adviser on Faith and Religion to make sure that we are respectful and inclusive of the many Christian athletes out there.

I graduated college in May '12, and have been working full time at the same company I did my internship at.  While this is not my dream job, I am happy and comfortable with where I am at.  I have recently been contacted by another company, and thought that doing an interview with them wouldn't hurt anything.  Turns out they really liked me and offered me a job with a 6% pay increase from what I earn now.  

Are there any big pros and cons to switching companies so fresh out of school?  I am not sure if in the long run it would look better to stay loyal to a company, or to have worked for multiple companies...

Also, if I turn down the new offer:  Should I pretty much consider that to be a burned bridge with the new company?  Or could I still have a chance of getting a job there later?

Thanks guys!"

18ewz9,38,2013-02-12,"Well 2X, she's pregnant.  We probably won't keep it.  How can I support her through this? [long]",[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18ewz9/well_2x_shes_pregnant_we_probably_wont_keep_it/,"My wife and I eloped last Friday. Her period was supposed to happen right around our wedding day. It didn't come. She kept thinking it would come any day now, since she'd had some spotting. She picked up a pregnancy test just to ease her mind.

She walked out of the bathroom white as a sheet. I immediately knew I couldn't freak out.

""We're pregnant?"" I asked her, seriously.

""I... I didn't think it was really possible.""

She walked over to the counter in our kitchen and sat there. She started to cry and tremble. She was totally unprepared for this. I tried to comfort her as best I could. I told her that I loved her no matter what, that we would get through this together, and that no matter what, it would be okay.

She wanted to use the other test in the pack (came with 2), so I got her a glass of water. Her hands were shaking so badly she could barely hold the glass. I made her something to eat since we'd just gotten home and we sat down and ate for about 10 minutes.

I came over to where she was sitting on the couch and rubbed her feet while we talked to try to keep her calm. She told me that she felt like this was the worst possible time. She's in her last semester of graduate school, and there's no way she'd ever get a job if she was pregnant. My income can't support 3. We struggle with just 2 people. She told me she wanted a family, she wanted to have children, but this didn't seem like the right time. She wanted a career too.

I told her that I agreed. She has a fantastic job, a fantastic internship, and her degree is really valuable. I told her that I wanted a family too, but maybe this was the wrong time.

My family has always disliked her, and she started crying again when she thought of when we'd tell them about the pregnancy. My father has made *horrible* comments about her (she's trying to trap you with a baby, she just wants to get married and take all your money, she's low-class trash). I can't even imagine the smug satisfaction they'd put on us if they found out we eloped and she was pregnant. It was just one more thing that upset her.

I want to stand by her, but I don't know what she's going through. She wants us to make this decision together, and she's conflicted about what she wants. She had a miscarriage a few years into our relationship. We had broken up at the time, and she never told me she was pregnant until it happened. She's scared that she's getting older (28) and won't be able to have children. Maybe it will never be a good time start a family and we should just do it?

I would deal with it if she wanted to keep it, but I think this is the worst possible timing for us. I'd get another job, find a better job, something. I'd make it okay. I don't want to tell her what to do with her body. She wants to make the decision together, and since she's of mixed mind and I think we should get an abortion, she's said that she'll probably get the abortion. She doesn't want to ""force you into that situation.""

I feel horrible. I feel like I've bullied her into giving up her control over her body. I don't want to make the decision for her, and I feel like that's what I'm doing.

She took the second test and it was positive as well. She's going to get an appointment with a doctor ASAP to get a blood test and confirm, then look into appointments with the local women's clinic for an abortion.

I simultaneously want to cry, punch the wall, and hug her. I love her so much, and I want to support her every step of the way. I feel like I don't understand what she's going through. What can I do to help her? What can I do to make her feel supported in this decision?

**tl;dr: Oh shit, she's pregnant. Probably going to get an abortion. How can I support her while we deal with this?**

**Edit:** Thank you everyone for the comments. I really don't think I have the strength right now to respond to everyone, but waking up to this helped a lot. We're going to get through this. I'm just freaking out in my own way.

**Edit 2:** Dropped her off at work. She cried in the car and apparently didn't sleep a wink last night. I spent ten minutes sobbing in my car outside of work once it all caught up to me. Today is off to a stellar start. I feel unimaginably terrible."

18ev6p,1,2013-02-12,"Finally feeling good enough to not need meds, and now I'm facing the worst withdrawal symptoms of my life.",[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/18ev6p/finally_feeling_good_enough_to_not_need_meds_and/,"So I'll try to make this short. I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder at 16 years old after struggling with symptoms from the time I was 10. I started on a low dose of Lexapro and moved my way up in Prozac. Even though getting help made me realize how prominent depression ran in my family on both sides (my grandma was in and out of psychiatric hospitals all of her life and frequented shock therapy) I had a really hard time coping with the stigma and having people treat me differently because my life was seemingly perfect to everyone. I attempted suicide and ended up in a psychiatric hospital where the psychiatrist put me on the 120 mg/day of Cymbalta in addition to the Prozac I was already taking. Time goes on, I drop the Prozac, and  I graduate high school and start college pursuing a BA in Psychology. I planned on getting off of the Cymbalta then, because I knew I'd be drinking, but it never happened. At 19 while I was out with friends I was kidnapped and raped and slipped into the worst depression of my life, but managed to overcome it on my own without therapy because I was busy with school and didn't have time. I graduated college with my BA by the time I was 21 and finally found happiness for the first time since I was a little kid. I had a great job, great boyfriend, and started a graduate program I really enjoyed. Everyone recognized how well I was doing, and said they had never seen me happier. I think about weaning off of Cymbalta, feeling I don't need it any more, but wait because I'm afraid of the withdrawals. Four weeks ago I decided to wean off the Cymbalta I've been taking at 120 mg/day for the past 6 years because I've been frustrated with my pharmacy getting it to me on time and the way it affects my drinking. It's been rough, lots of graphic nightmares, lost sleep, constant nausea, and total exhaustion. But I haven't been depressed which is a good sign. These past couple of weeks I've started noticing weird nerve pain and my skin feels like it's crawling. Today I had a full blown panic attack for the first time in years in the shower. I feel like reality is distorted and my dreams at night haunt me into the daytime. 

I'm so close to being off of this poison, I'm taking 30mg every other day. I want to be done with it now, because I know I'll have to get off of it someday when I want to have kids, but the withdrawals are killing me. I'm 22 now, I go to graduate school full time, work part time, and I have a fairly active social life compared to what I used to, and the withdrawals symptoms are making it really hard to function. I've been holding things together when I have to, but people are starting to wonder why I'm sick all the time and why I'm not as socially active. I'm so tired and so sick, I just want to know that this will be over and it will be worth it.

Names changed/client removed to protect the innocent but if you work at this firm, you probably already know the culprit.

    Hey Bob,

Hope things are going well. As interns we do not have access to ARMs so until Jack informed me I was unaware I was working 10 hours at [the client] next week. I'm not sure when I'm needed or when you would like me to come in but this Saturday (2/16) I have a highly condensed schedule of errands that I would like to run in the morning and early afternoon. This lists includes getting a new license because my license is expired. I have an appointment for my car to get a front end alingmnet and to get my tires rotated. I also need to run to the bank, and go to the bookstore and take back some items from Christmas! As an intern (and more so as an employee of a Public Accounting Firm) it is extremely difficult to find the time to get errands like these done because we often work til 7:00 or 8:00 pm or even later. At 7 or 8 pm nothing is open and I cannot run to the bank, the license bureau, the bookstore, or my mechanic.  We do have days off on Sundays but on Sundays these places are simply not open. During busy season with our lives so focused on work it is a struggle to get things done outside of work. This is why I am asking not to work this Saturday (2/16). I have made these plans and appointments to do these things this Saturday before I new I had to work with [the client] this week. I apologize for the length of the email but in its entirety I believe you can sympathize with me and understand my pressing need to get these things done. Hopefully you'll understand. I can speak with Bill, manager at [law firm], and ask him if I could go to [the client] one day during the week next week. I'm sure it wouldnt be a problem. In closing, if you desperately need me to work on Saturday no need to fret I will come in and work but if at all possible I am asking to not come in that day because of the short notice of me working at [the client] and me alreadly scheduling things to do on that day. Let me know what you guys decide. Oh, and tell the team I said Happy Valentines Day!

I'm finishing up my junior year for my accounting degree, and plan to go on in the future to get my CPA. I am probably going to work towards a BS in Finance while getting those 30 hours for the CPA. I currently work in a bank as a finance/accounting intern and will probably be there until May. Once my internship is over, what should I go for next to round out my skill set? I do not plan to go Big 4 because all of them are situated in Houston for my area, and I just bought a house in my town 3 hours away. There are a lot of CPA firms looking for interns around here so I could get on with one in an internship if I want to go that route. I could also stay in private accounting as there are a ton of private internships in my area.

I'll try to explain my self briefly.  I'm 22 and 2 semesters away from graduating from an undergraduate business school.  I chose business originally because I wanted to make money.  Both my parents, through actions not words, have taught me to value money a lot.  I was raised pretty sheltered.  My Dad has a PharmD and has been director of pharmacy for several hospitals, and my Mom is an ABD in Psychology and she was a community college prof but now a dean.  There combined income is $250k+ and we go on vacations and have a summer shore house.  So I wanted all that and that's why I picked business.  I was also a conservative republican (my parents weren't though).  **Then** I had the first of two life changing events happen.  I studied abroad in the Netherlands and I saw how a ""good"" society works and when I came back I saw how fucked up our society is.  I slowly became a raging liberal.  The **next** life changing experience was when I realized I was an alcoholic and now I've been in recovery for about 1.5 years.  I've had internships for a Congressman in DC, 2 business internships, and now interning for a Governor.  None of these have really been fulfilling. 

 I like helping people so I've been looking at getting a MSW preferably through a dual degree program with a Masters of Public Health.  I'm really interested in helping people with addictions.  However, I also go to school in Camden NJ (most dangerous city, drug ridden, poverty) and it makes me feel horrible for all these people.  Addiction isn't the only thing but that would be what I'd like to work with most.  I think I'd like the macro level better but I'm not quite sure what that is.  **Some things I'd like to do is work with addiction programs, treating it and preventing it (not directly though), etc.  I could see my self working for government agencies or even like the UNODC on implementing programs and policy.  Some of the stuff I read about around the world works there, but isn't even considered here (ie drug shooting centers, harm reduction type stuff, etc).  Would a MSW/MPH qualify or allow me to do this?**  

edit:  This summer I plan on doing a part-time internship with my states Department of Human Services.

Thanks in advance for any advice or comments.  I have no idea if this would be the right degree for my aspirations but hopefully y'all can clue me in."

18jjix,1,2013-02-14,Need help knowing how to read what's going on from people with experience in higher-ed admin.,Radiohead901,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/18jjix/need_help_knowing_how_to_read_whats_going_on_from/,"So, I'll try to make this short. Please also let me know if this should be on another subreddit, since I'm pretty new to this website in general.
I have a part-time job at a center based at a prestigious university. My job is basically communications-focused, since that is what I have my limited background in (I graduated from college about 2 years ago). I also have pretty bad issues with anxiety and self-confidence that I'm starting to confront more heavily, but I'm still worried. Recently, I started an internship and another part-time job, and the three basically make my weeks very full, but the internship and more recent job have given me more confidence.

But, for a while, my gut reaction to anxiety was to just shut off and go away from my responsibilities and slack off, going on websites like this one. My supervisors at this university job eventually caught on, and confronted me in October by saying that I was doing a bunch of things wrong and that I needed to turn around or else I would be fired. In the ensuing month, they decided to keep me on but said that I still needed drastic improvement. They could tell I had anxiety issues but told me to basically shut those aside. I wonder why they didn't fire me, maybe they would have trouble finding other people or thought they'd drive me to do something terrible but they didn't. 

A few months later, I'm steadily doing better and sometimes they're very kind to me but I dropped the ball on something today by accidentally ignoring an e-mail from my boss before sending an email to our constituents. The e-mail thus ended up not having all the information my boss wanted, and it made her think I was ignoring her. Clearly, she's upset, and I know it's not personal but it's hard to take at as anything but. I don't know what to do sometimes, since I feel like there's already broken trust from the initial incidents and every day I could get fired for something. 

I have trouble understanding how I'm supposed to exist in this environment from time to time, since in higher ed it seems like everybody's 1) overworked, 2) has no idea how to talk to one another, 3) exists in a world with strange and arbitrary values/norms that it's near impossible to get used to, and 4) straddles this weird line between caring and not caring about work. This job would be a lot easier to invest in if I were full time, but there's no way they could get the money and if they could, they could probably hire someone with better qualifications. 

I know I should probably just try to stay more organized and focused and less anxious, but other than that, do you think that there are ways to bounce back? I don't see myself being in this job longer than a few months, but we have some key events and I'm worried that I'm just going to fuck up everything and get fired. I wouldn't care, but this is a pretty big university (maybe the biggest employer in my area) and I wouldn't want a firing to get me blacklisted from applying for other jobs - even though I don't really like this field, full-time employees get the best benefits around (including for medical, which for my anxiety, could be glorious).

So, any advice? "

I've been sucking up to my physics professor, who is a huge asshole. Anyway, he's a hotshot and widely regarded as a top particle physicist.

Then, out of nowhere, he told 6 other students and I he would allow one of us into his research group (him, 2 other professors, 2 postdocs, and 2 phd candidates.) Even if I were to just be their errandboy, that would look perfect on a resume. Way better than any internship. Time went on and it was essentially down to me and one other student vying for the position.

18jh89,0,2013-02-14,"Prayer request. Even though this terrible event turned me into a Christian, I don't want other people to go through what I did. ",[deleted],Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/18jh89/prayer_request_even_though_this_terrible_event/,"Last summer I was selected to do an internship, which turned out to be very dangerous and I want to get the word out there to try and save some other students and families from the Southwestern Advantage ""experience"".  The recruiter went into my colleges classrooms before lecture and got people to fill out surveys to see if they ""qualify"".My friend got selected but couldn't go, she knew I wanted a job and I went in her place. I got selected and I was so excited. Basically I was told how much I could make, and I was so excited to help out my family I jumped at the chance (We've been having a really hard financial time). So for the rest of that semester I had meetings to prepare for the internship, I honestly didn't know what to expect though, I trusted the company since it had an A rating from the BBB.

 I had to pay for everything:to get to Nashville for Sales School, a hotel, everything. For a week we had sales school. We had to get up every morning at 4:30 am and had ""meetings"" where they basically brainwash you. You were not given a break at all, any break you got was to be spent practicing your sales talk. You had to eat lunch during presentations. I got yelled at for going to the bathroom ""too much"" (I have a health condition, I have to go alot). This goes on till about 11 at night, then you can go to bed. This was when I found out that what I was really doing was gonna be going to dropped off in a random neighborhood and go door to door to sell these stupid books. But the week of sales school, seriously all it is is for them to brainwash you. They make you terrified of being a failure and explain how if you aren't successful then you are lazy and completely worthless. As someone whose always had a very strong work ethic, this struck me. I wanted to make as much money as I could so my family wouldn't be struggling for my college expenses. Seriously, they sleep deprive you and I can't even go into detail how they brainwash you, it was horrific. Finally, they shipped me off somewhere far away from where I live. I got to pay 35 dollars a week to sleep on a couch. The work schedule was bare minimum 8:29 am-9:31 pm, everyday Monday to Saturday, Sunday was spent in meetings to improve your performance. You weren't allowed to take breaks, they taught you in sales school how to pee in peoples lawns out of the side of your shorts (dead serious). and you were suppose to eat while you ran from house to house (I didn't have a car, so I was suppose to run). 

You're all by yourself (Part of the brainwashing was to make you work your butt off even though you were by yourself). They dump you in a place where you don't know and your not allowed to use your cell phone or talk to your parents at all (my parents didn't even actually know what I was doing, the company told me to not talk to them, as they would ""talk to them for me""). Oh, and you know how you had to work bare minimum 80 hours a week? The only pay you got was from commission. If you didn't make a sale, you were shit out of luck. Thats why it's an ""internship"", if you were a regular employ they'd legally have to pay you minimum wage for when you didn't make a sale.

So anyway, my first day on the field I had to follow one of my student managers, who couldn't have treated me worse. At one point, I made a sale and she kept all the money from it (which was 165 bucks). Then my second day I was by myself in my territory. I started working at before 8 (I had to be dropped off and picked up by someone else, thus I had even longer hours). It was pouring rain, I was shivering. I kept knocking on doors and was turned away (but I was ready for rejection) I had set up 2 appointments to come back later.

 At about 2, this guy pulled up and started asking me what was going on. I actually remember our conversation word for word.
Him ""Hey you, Can I ask you what your doing?"" 
Me ""Oh, hello! I'm ____, I'm a Southwestern representative. I'm just in the area showing families these different educational materials for little guys all the way up to high schoolers. Do you know anyone who may be interested?"" 
Him: ""No, I just wanted to make sure that you weren't some religious freak. Just wanted to look out for the people here."" 
Me ""Haha, oh no. I'm just trying to help families out with homework."" 
Him ""Well, I've been watching you go door to door. If you need money that bad, I'll pay you to have sex with me. If your going to degrade yourself this much, you might as well become a stripper at least then people will want to see you."" 
Me ""I'm good sir, but thanks"" *Starts to walk away* 
Him ""ok, well I'll keep on following you. I've been following you off and on since this morning when I first saw you on (and he named the street I started on, I had to write it down). I'll just keep on following you. I'll get you later"". 
This was when I noticed 2 things 1) that he was getting out of his car and that 2) he was holding a knife. 
I ran and hide under a fence post until I saw his car pass by. it was still pouring rain and I was crouching in the mud. I took off sobbing, I called my mom and told her everything once I got to the public library. She honestly had no idea what I was doing and told me to come home, then told me to call my dad. When I called my dad, all he did was scream at me how life sucked and how I had to give it one more day. Once it stopped raining I decided to go back to selling.

 I walked back to the neighborhood I had taken off from.....just to see that same car circle around. I went back to the library and stayed there till that closed, then went to the Target across the street till that closed. Then I had to wait outside till my ride got there....at 12:30 am. We didn't get back home till 1:30 am. I called the student manager who was in charge of me and told her everything. I was beside myself, I couldn't stop sobbing. She calmed me down and told me I could have the next day off to pull myself together. My sales manager called me at 6 in the morning after I got no sleep and after hearing what happened, told me I was pathetic and that I don't get days off, no matter what excuse I wanted to use.


 I was moved to the next city over, but first I had to talk to the cops about the creep from the day before and to get a new sales permit. I was gonna have to walk 14 miles to talk to the cops from the previous city, but the new city hall secretary told me she'd give me a ride. I sobbed the whole ride, explaining everything. She tried to talk me into going home and offered to do anything I needed done. I talked to the cops and was able to identify the guy....turned out he just got out of prison for raping at least 6 other girls. The cop begged me to go home and I obliged. My dad got me a plane ticket for the next day home. and I stayed in the library for the rest of the day, sobbing and praying to just get home. 

The night after 11 I got picked up, I got home and by this time the student manager I lived with (the one I had to follow) had heard I was leaving. She came in my room, took all of my southwestern stuff and screamed at me for being pathetic and weak. She told me I would have to call a taxi to get to the airport (which was over an hour away) and that I better not ask the family we were staying with for a ride. I wrote a long note to the mom, explaining everything. I stayed up all night, crying and praying to get to the airport on time.

As soon as I heard the mom up, I went downstairs. I was sobbing and she was like ""OMG. WHAT HAPPENED?"" and I was like ""THE MAN TRIED TO RAPE ME"" She sat me down and apologized profusely. The student manager I was living with got to decide which city I would work in. The mom had told her not to send me to the place I got sent to, since it was known as being so dangerous but the student manager couldn't care less. The mom was crying and explaining how at work she was praying for me to be safe.Her daughter was getting ready for school when the student manager was about to leave. The student manager actually told the daughter who was 13 that I was weak and like most women ""used rape as an excuse for being weak"". The parents were livid at the student manager telling their daughter that. I got to the airport with one actual suitcase and a pillowcase filled with stuff (I had taken most of my stuff in trash bags, which I then had to throw out).

In the airport, my sales manager called me up to scream at me for being weak and pathetic.

 My mom looked into the company later on and found out that a bunch of families who had bought from the company kept having payments taken out of their account and couldn't stop it. The company also demand me to pay them a hundred dollars for having an accident while I was working for them. For a long time after this, I was very messed up, I couldn't study without sobbing, I could barely talk to my friends. I am doing better now, but I really want to help other people too.

Before this, I didn't believe in God, but I was certainly begging him through this whole ordeal. I got home, read the Bible regularly, got very involved in a church and got saved. While I am thankful for this, I don't want other people to be put through this. I figure that through pray, God can help others stay safe. 

Tl:dr, I really needed money to help my parents with college expenses, got involved in an internship that ended up being a scam and almost was attacked by a sexual predator. When I left afterwards, I was attacked by the company for leaving. Later I found out the company scammed the families who bought from them and I had a long, road to be able to function again and became a Christian, but I would like prays as I work to keep other people safe.

My roommate and I, formerly really great friends, had a decent falling out, and I no longer had classes or proximity to some of my other friends, so I started seeing them less and less.

I also stopped working so I could focus on my classes, but that's not a huge loss.  I was at an internship, so most people I worked with were about 20 years older than me; didn't really see anyone there outside of work anyway.

I was a year ahead in a lot of my classes, so I made friends with a few people who were a year or two above me, but now they've graduated and gone.  So now it's my second to last semester, and if I were to try, I doubt I could even get two people to go have a drink with me.  And, since I'm graduating in a few months, I can't bring myself to go out and make new friends, since I'll just have to move away soon and possibly end up putting someone *else* in my current position.

(This has been building up for a while now, and I think the fact that it's V-day is just a coincidence.  It's more the fact that I've finished my classwork, and now have pretty much nothing to do until Monday when I go to class again.)

So, I'm stuck in some weird sort of nonsocial limbo.  I'm not really depressed or angsty or anything like that, I've just never really spent so much time alone.  Anyone else ever have times like this?  What do you do to pass the time, how do you get through it?

I'm originally from the Sacramento area, and have a couple friends that live in the city, but have yet to find a suitable replacement for the place we were going to live. I'll be studying international business at SFSU.

About my SO: She is going to be transferring to a starbucks in the city full time as well as working an internship for photography. She is originally from Omaha, and this will be her first time to the city.
 
The price range we are hoping for is 1100 or less if possible.

I've been searching padmapper, CL, hotpads, rentjungle etc. but just found out that our original living situation fell through just this week, so feel very stressed knowing that I only have two months to get our situation figured out for our stuff to get packed up here and moved, any help is much appreciated even if you don't have a place available!"

I'm a Business student concentrating in Information Systems and Computer Science at a fairly well known Top 30 University.
I haven't had an internship before and this is my last summer before graduating. As it stands I have two options.

1) A position in the Technology division of an Investment Bank doing software development. My title would be that of an Analyst, and I'd be in the same New England city as my school which would be nice.

2) A position in Miami in the IT division of a Fortune 100 company, in a group overseeing the international IT operations of its foreign subsidiaries. The role would be more about strategy, and management. It's also paying 50% more than at the Investment Bank. That said, although it's closer to home, and I have some family there, I don't really have any friends in the area. Although I considered maybe going there after Graduation because of the more agreeable weather.

I know career advice is difficult to dispense without my career goals, so here it goes:

Long term I would like to open my own business (leveraging software and technology) back in my homecountry, or aim to be CIO of some company. I enjoy business problems more than I do coding. I enjoy development and programming and I'm pretty good relative to my peers, but I feel I'm not as good as other people out there and I don't see myself ever being ""top of my field"". I always considered Project Management to be my eventual destination, and coding as more of a step in that direction.

I've been leaning towards the bank despite this though, just because i feel an Investment Banking internship is more prestigious, and I feel I can leverage that better in the future.

Any thoughts?"

Basically, I'm planning on moving to Seattle later this year to pursue a career in the gaming industry at the tender age of 26. Unfortunately, I'm not a programmer/engineer and have never worked in this industry before. I do however have (what I believe) to be a strong resume, holding two Director level positions (political campaign first, a software company currently) that have gone very well and a degree in Business Communications (which is as worthless as it sounds.)

My questions is, where do I start and what kind of positions should I look at? I'd like to think I'm not delusional, I have no perceptions that a career in the industry will be ""lolzvideogamezallday"" and anticipate a high pressure, changing on a dime kind of atmosphere. I have no pride or shame in this matter, I'll start as an intern if I have to and am prepared to hustle however hard I have to in order to get my foot in the door somewhere. My specialties are in operations and project management. I also have about a year and a half's living expenses saved up to make this happen, so I'm at least going into it somewhat prepared.

TLDR; How do I get my foot in the door in the gaming industry?

Edit: You all are freaking amazing. I absolutely expected to be bashed out of existence with this question, but the feedback you have all left here is incredible. I feel MUCH more confident about chasing a dream and realize how much planning that I have left to do. Stay classy /r/seattle."

My boss told me about a guy he had met at a bank conference that was a (civil?) engineer for many years until he was laid off. In an attempt to find work, he applied to many different places and explained how his knowledge of advanced math could benefit their firm. He ended up working in a bank, and used his math skill to find customer account decay rates among a fairly homogeneous customer base. His background was stress testing materials used in buildings bridges, and he found that many materials used had a long life and some had a very short life, much like the customer base in a financial institution. 

He spoke at lengths with my boss about his work, and years later, my boss is very interested in precisely this kind of research. I am tasked to approach engineers at the local university with this problem, but I thought I would first turn to Reddit. I am going to try to detail exactly what I am looking for, but please keep in mind that I have no engineering background so I may (will) use incorrect terms or assumptions.

We have a homogeneous customer base that will all eventually leave the bank for very different reasons. Some may leave due to dissatisfaction or a better competitor, while some may leave the bank due to death (i.e. lifelong customers). We are trying to find the availability of funds in deposit accounts (savings, checking, CDs, IRAs) over a number of years, and the interest rate risk involved in establishing new accounts and gaining new funds as necessary, which would involve establishing new accounts at current rates. We are also trying to determine the point--or number of years--at which 50% of available deposit funds will no longer be available to the institution due to regular activity and account closures. 

We have the data for account closures, and are just looking at the best way to apply the data. This is a mock graph of what we THINK a chart would look like that would be generated by this application of data, and what we hope to gain is insight on how to do it.

The first time was when I was 20 and was living in a new city. I didn't have any friends yet and tended to self-isolate, which led to pretty severe depression. I came out of it for a while once I moved back home, but then underwent some major stress (working 3 jobs, finishing my degree) about a year later, and experienced major anxiety/depression again. 

After barely finishing school (I was a straight A student until the final semester, where I missed classes/assignments and bullshitted my way into good grades, I decided to take some time off at the advice of a counsellor, live off my savings for a while (Canadian here, apologies to student loan sufferers). I made lifestyle changes. I have always been healthy, but I cut out sugar from my diet, taking supplements, forcing myself outside every day and started exercising A LOT (I found 1 hour a day minimum basically eliminated my anxiety). 

I got a great internship, which led to a 1 year contract in an extremely competitive career. I felt like everything was okay, but recently I've been unemployed and I've realized that I may have just been masking my depression with being busy. 

I'm now more depressed than ever and have decided to completely cut out all alcohol (was never a heavy drinker), start taking medication (Cipralex), and seeing a psychiatrist.

Does anyone else feel frustrated with having to tightly control many aspects of their lives just to prevent relapse?"

I'm a college student doing my internship at Palmer Drug Abuse Program (PDAP) in South Texas. It's a non-profit organization that gives free substance abuse counseling (group and individual) to people ages 12 and up, and their families. But we don't do just that, we also give our clients a drug-free environment where they can come and hang out without worrying about getting pressured to use from friends and family or having the temptation. On Friday and Saturday nights we have activities like bowling, volleyball, or BBQ. We try to promote a positive environment and keep our clients clean from drugs/alcohol. I've learned so much from being there and interacting with different people. You'd be surprised at how addicts come in all shapes and sizes. I'm proud to be working with this organization and I hope Reddit can help donate to this cause. There is a camping trip PDAP takes every Spring Break to get the youth and young adults away from the partying that goes on in our area. We're 15 minutes away from Mexico and an hour from South Padre Island. It's crazy how much drinking and using happens during this one week. So this camping trip is a life-saver for some of our clients. During the four days we're out there, we do different activities like hiking, swimming, canoeing, football, or just sitting around the fire at night talking. Most of these kids come from single-parent homes that are low-income and can only bring themselves on this trip. So we try to provide the food, van, accommodations, activities, and gas that it takes. And it takes a good amount of money. We have some, but since it's non-profit (which means little money for trips), we don't have enough. We need at least $2,000 to make this trip possible. Please help us out Reddit! I know you guys love good causes and this is something I hope you can get behind. Even if you don't have any money to donate, thanks for reading my long post. Maybe when you do have extra funds one day, you'll remember this and donate to future PDAP causes.

We surrounded by very influential people– executives and leaders– and got the opportunity to take a part in hands on demos of products and, most importantly, work with the people we love to work with. We partnered with companies Nest Labs, Square, Peel Technologies, TCHO Chocolate, Speck Products, Pebble, Likeness, and Stanford University's School of Law. These organizations and entities are changing our day-to-day lives with each moment, and it was wonderful to have that kind of experience with each.

This year, we're heading back to NYC to continue this kind of work we love. We're right now planning out what we're going to be studying, who we're meeting with, and what our focus will be on. The plan currently is to visit companies Fab and Quirky and work with them in a group internship fashion. With Fab, we plan to discuss their goals of becoming a billion dollar company within the next few years. With Quirky, we are going to be working with them to come up with a 'next big thing', while viewing the inter-workings of the company.

I’ve been making a little money with a paid internship and just got hired full time in an entry level engineer with about a $60k salary. I wanted to know if I should take part in the 401k that the company is offering. At first I thought it was a good idea and my coworkers said that I should or at least contribute %5.75 since that was what the company would match. However, when I told my mom she said not to. Her reasoning was that my dad didn't have much success with it and I think he lost money. He also didn't really pay attention to it which I know I would not make the same mistake. She also said that it wouldn't be worth it since I wouldn't stay long with the company. I don’t plan on staying long, maybe a year max. 


I also have a student loan that's about $20k. I planned on putting all extra money from my paycheck into it to pay it off as soon as I can but wanted advice if I should contribute some extra money to the 401k or save some for emergency fund or savings? If i should do the 401k or savings how much or what percent of my pay should I be putting in?


Also if I do the 401k what should I do? I have no clue what I need to look for and how to do calculations. Is there anything that can make figuring out my 401k plan easier? Like where should I look first or the steps I should take.


Thanks!"
18hqyc,3,2013-02-13,"Five years of pain, and I just want it to stop.",[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/18hqyc/five_years_of_pain_and_i_just_want_it_to_stop/,"I have thought about committing suicide almost daily for the past five years - and I feel like this is the closest I've ever been to actually pulling the trigger. My significant other of two years and I broke up recently, and now I'm devastated, disoriented, and in a catatonic-like state. But this is not your typical post-breakup depression.  

Before I met him, I had been struggling with depression and anxiety related to a chronic pain disorder I've suffered from since 2004. Threatening to derail the completion of my undergraduate degree, I doubled down on my studies and eventually graduated. At the age of 22, I moved to a new city to try to start a career. I eventually landed an internship, and eventually, was offered a permanent position. I've been stuck, spinning my wheels, ever since. I'm still at the same, miserable job over five years later. 

I won't elaborate too much on my health condition. Honestly, what it's labeled as is irrelevant, and I am not looking for sympathy. I no longer obsess over finding a cure that clearly doesn't exist, and I've long since stopped going to doctors, besides routine check-ups once a year. But I suffer from unrelenting chronic pain in my neck, shoulders, hands, back, and feet. I have a constant headache that never truly goes away- just vacillates in intensity. My eyes always burn. My skin always hurts. My ears ring loudly, constantly. I cannot really sleep- I wake up dozens of times in the middle of the night. I have good days and bad. And until now, I've had the strength to carry on. 

I had tried dating in the past, but nothing really came out of it. I was also a late-bloomer- I came late in college and had only been dating for a few years. A few dates here and there, a few summer flings. Nobody I had truly loved. I didn't think it was possible. Loving me would be a bad investment for anybody, I thought. You know, damaged goods. Sure, I'll hook-up with someone every now and then, but for me, a longterm relationship was just not in the cards, right?

When I met him two and a half years ago, I was in a very dark place. I had been invited by a friend to a dinner party, and begrudgingly went. Once there, I saw him. Our eyes met, and by the end of the night, I knew that I had found somebody special.

Shortly after, we started dating. Things progressed quickly. But I knew it would not be forever- he would find out about my health problems and they would quickly obstruct our relationship. After a couple months, I broke down and told him about my problems. He said he understood and was shocked that I feared he would leave because of them. It seemed like I finally found a person willing to give me a chance. I was the happiest I had been in years. 

For a while, things were amazing. We hung out often- constantly on weekends, laughed, cried, travelled around the country, attended music festivals, ate at every restaurant in the city, and loved each other. But things started to unravel last year. Aspects of his personality started to become unattractive, and eventually, I even lost most of my physical attraction to him. He would also become easily annoyed at me. Our time together felt increasingly monotonous and tedious. We both knew the end was near, but I was afraid to let go. 

The end was a few weeks ago, and I'm still trying to pick up the pieces. I never thought a mutual break-up could ever hurt so badly. The only things getting me through the days are Jameson and Xanax. Almost every night, he haunts my dreams, and when I am sleeping, we are still together. When I wake up in the morning, a jagged knife stabs me in the stomach and I remember that he is no longer by my side. I am alone. 

You might think, well, you got along okay before him, so you'll get through this as well. But now things are different. I now know what I had, what I've lost, and it's something that I most likely won't ever have again. Even though I had been looking for an out in the deteriorating relationship for the past few months, I am now dealing with feelings of self-hatred for my part in the failure of the relationship.  

Now, I have nothing. I have alienated most of my friends, as I made the rookie mistake of letting the few friendships I had fade while I spent most of my free time with him and befriended all of his friends - and now they're gone, too. 

I was shown what life could be- that I could be happy, even with my chronic health problems - and now it's all abruptly gone. 

I'm not sure what the point of writing this is, possibly someone can offer some perspective that I haven't thought of. But I feel that my days are numbered, and I can only keep pulling myself out of bed for so much longer. I have the tools to do this, and at this point, it's really only my pride (and not wanting to hurt my family) that's keeping me alive. I feel like that won't sustain me for very much longer. 

Thanks for reading, I know it's an essay. "

18hmdt,28,2013-02-13,"Skeptic geek's corner: ""Tell Me Pink or Blue"" early fetal gender test",babytummyMD,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/18hmdt/skeptic_geeks_corner_tell_me_pink_or_blue_early/,"If you've considered doing one of those mail-in blood tests to detect fetal gender, you may be interested in what I found out about the ""Tell Me Pink or Blue"" test by Consumer Genetics Inc. (tellmepinkorblue.com). Warning, wall of text! I'll stick the **TL;DR up here: buyer beware!**


Quick facts about the test if you're not familiar:

* TMPOB purports to detect fetal gender by looking for the Y-chromosome from fetal blood within a small, pinprick sample of maternal blood.
* It's been known since 1997 that ""cell free"" fetal DNA is present in the mother's blood and can be analyzed for chromosomal defects - this is the basis of the Maternit21 test.
* With TMPOB, you order a kit with some lancets and band-aids, perform the test at home and mail it in to the lab in California. It costs between $170 - $330 for the test depending on the shipping/processing speed you select. The marketing materials claim 95% accuracy and detection as early as 7 weeks.

I was curious about TMPOB because 1) I'm impatient for my anatomy scan, and 2) it's a scammy-looking website, yet their story kind of checks out. Cell-free fetal DNA analysis is a real thing. They also provide a lot of info about their laboratory and offer a money-back guarantee.

Sooo ... I just spent a crap-ton of time researching this company, the people it claims are its management, their location, their accuracy claims, etc.

Here's what I found out. Add up all these facts and see what you get:

* The most damning evidence: Consumer Genetics Inc. has an ""F"" rating with the BBB and is not accredited by the BBB, after failing to respond to 21 of 22 consumer complaints. The home kit isn't sold on Amazon anymore, but old customer reviews claim they had to make multiple refund requests and were given false information about the whereabouts of their refund check. All of the positive customer reviews come from Amazon accounts which have no other reviews.
* Consumer Genetics Inc. recruiting materials found online (such as http://www.consumergenetics.com/pdfs/FTInternshipGuidelines051607.pdf), plus some LinkedIn profiles of former employees, seem to indicate there is actually lab work being done that involves purifying samples and PCR reactions, which fits with their explanation of the lab process (http://www.consumergenetics.com/pdfs/CG-POB-Publication-Oct-2008.pdf). So, maybe they aren't just throwing your blood sample into the trash. The fact that 3-month interns are the ones conducting the tests may not exactly set you at ease.
* Mail-in genetic tests like these are unregulated by the FDA or FTC. Additionally, the consent form you file which is supposedly in place to prevent gender selection abortions also relieves Consumer Genetics of any liability for damages to ""yourself or anyone else"" as a result of the test.
* From geneticsandsociety.org: ""Italian researchers published a study in 2005 demonstrating that they could correctly identify 98.7% of boys and 100% of girls by looking for male DNA in maternal blood drawn during the first trimester. But their method required a relatively large blood sample -- 10 milliliters -- that was processed within a few hours. The [direct to consumer] companies, in contrast, require just three to 10 drops of dried blood, which can take days to arrive through the mail."" By requesting a dried blood sample on a flat card, TMPOB avoids the challenge and expense of meeting mailing requirements for biohazardous material. 
* Consumer Genetics has been selling this service since about 2006. The study and article it cites on using cell-free fetal DNA to detect gender came out in 2011.
* The Consumer Genetics personnel listed on their site may not actually work there. For example, Terry Carmichael is variously listed as the Executive Vice President, Vice President of Marketing &amp; Sales, member of the Board of Directors ... and on his own LinkedIn profile, as having no connection with Consumer Genetics at all. Could be just various versions of the truth, but the stockpile of PhDs and MSs named by the company in contrast to the reported business size *kinda* points to some tenuous connections.

I'd be curious to know what any of you science-y types deduce, but just as a consumer and online researcher, I'd say TMPOB smells rotten.

**Edit/update:** I contacted Fair Oaks Women's Health, the clinic that helped TMPOB run their accuracy trial. A physician there confirmed they tested 20 specimens and TMPOB accurately predicted gender for 19 of them. The TMPOB literature cites a survey where they tested 31 samples -- 4 (13%) were inconclusive, 26 were accurate, 1 was inaccurate. Neither study confirms that they used dried blood samples taken more than 24 hours prior, like they do for customers. My own Scooby sense feels that they could easily turn an inconclusive into a fake result just to avoid sending out and performing a re-test.

**UPDATE 2:** I ordered a kit for myself before I did all this research. Frowny face. My experience so far? Did not send me an email with credit charge receipt, as they stated they would. Did not send email saying my test results were available. Did not respond to on-site customer service request. Customer service number is busy and has no voicemail/phone tree. I'm now emailing an address I found on the site (probably a slush pile) plus the CEO's email address. We'll see if anyone responds."

I find it very emotional and overwhelming to read all of your posts. It sucks me in, it makes me angry and depressed and its all very hard to handle.

I do want to say that you are all very brave souls, getting through the day as best you can and dealing with PTSD, as hard as it getts. When I see your posts I feel so much for you guys and I send you all hugs and support and I care.

I hope I'm not viewed as selfish for posting and not actively supporting you all. But I had a really rough day and I just needed to share it with people who might understand.

I've been struggling with PTSD since 2008. I was on antidepressants and xanax and ambien for a really long time until I got fed up with my antidepressants and decided to at least try to get off them. Anyway, long story short, it took me 2 years but after a lot of therapy, diet changes and exercise I've pretty much been the antidepressants, only have to take xanax and ambien very little. Not to say that I still don't have panic attacks, or nightmares or sleepless nights, I've just learned to deal with them differently and I feel so much better without the medication.

Anyway, today I had to stay home from my internship because someone was going to come and shut our gas on and if I didn't we'd be without gas for a week. I had all these plans to be productive and clean and finish some internship work and read and make the best of my day at home. A couple of hours into the morning I wasn't feeling all that great. I was anxious about doing my work, because I struggle with being an absolute failure (does anybody else experience this?). I've had HUGE confidence issues since the accidents. I doubt myself at every turn. After they finally got here to activate the gas, it started getting windy and that is one of my triggers and I was overwhelmed with a horrible panic attack that essentially rendered me useless. I was a mess and I was beating myself up for not being able to deal with it like I have in the past and I finally decided to take some xanax and crawl into bed. Within 20 minutes I was asleep and that was over 4 hours ago. 

I just woke up and though I physically feel a lot better, I kinda feel like a failure for a day wasted and not being able to handle my shit.

That's all. Sorry about the wall of text of a rant.

TL;DR: Had a massive panic attack. Took xanax for the first time in months. Passed out for several hours. Feel like a failure for a wasted day and not doing what I needed/wanted to to keep working on my career and life. "

I hope its a self post- I'm doing this on my phone, under the ""text"" option. Anyways, I am having this minor dilemma, and I just don't kbow where to turn to.

Lemme explain my work situation. I am 17 years old, and I work/study as an intern to a Paramedic. Every Wednesday for the past 4 months, I have had to show up at a hospital about 30 miles from my house for a different rotation. 

Anyways, I'm trying to keep this as short as possible. Basically my parents are making me go to an Ash Wednesday mass while I'm here, which start half an hour after my shift ends, in thirty minutes- meaning it starts at 9:30. It's also a Spanish language mass, which I don't even speak fluently in.  That means I'll be out of the mass around 11:00 pm, effectively causing me to get home around 12 midnight after. Even with my classes starting at 7:30 in the morning tomorrow, I have homework to do and I have had no chance today to do it. 

I have told my mother my situation, and she just simply replies ""you shouldn't have signed up for that program, you can't miss mass"". I know, ridiculous. This is my future I'm working on, and she is completely unreasonable in her zeal and piety. I am agnostic, and if it was any other mass I would just quietly skip it and do my homework at the library near my work.

Which is what I plan to do, minus one small problem. 

She will expect to see the ashes on my forehead when I get home (yes, I'm positive she will be waiting when I get home) to make sure I went. I have thought of just putting some dirt on my forehead...but that may not be enough. Do any of you have a better solution?

Sorry for the super long post.

tl;dr I need help fooling my parents I got ashes on my forehead for ash Wednesday, in order to stay on track with my classes- which my parents seemingly don't care about."

* Brilliant, close-knit team of co-workers in my department
* Potential to travel to Europe for business

*Cons*

* Car killing commute (~180 mi/day)
* Would have to drop out of school, at least for now

**2nd Potential Job - Part-time/intern GIS Dev for ~$21k**

*Pros*

* Potential to become full-time, which apparently most interns do after 3 months
* $15/hr, which is $5 more than I make now
* Small, but rapidly growing company with lots of gov't contracts (= security?)
* Very close to my current home 
* Wouldn't have to drop out of school
* Very casual work environment

*Cons*

* Only part-time, so no benefits
* I'm not familiar with the program they're using or C# (I'm a Java person), so I'd be starting at square one.
* GIS is apparently a very niche field, so if I lost my job I'd probably have to move elsewhere to continue my career."

About me: I'm separating from the military in April and plan to move to San Francisco to go to school, using the GI Bill, so will have a steady income as a full time student. I'm originally from the Sacramento area, and have a couple friends that live in the city, but have yet to find a suitable replacement for the place we were going to live. I'll be studying international business at SFSU.


About my SO: She is going to be transferring to a starbucks in the city full time as well as working an internship for photography. She is originally from Omaha, and this will be her first time to the city.


The price range we are hoping for is 1100 or less if possible.
I've been searching padmapper, CL, hotpads, rentjungle etc. but just found out that our original living situation fell through just this week, so feel very stressed knowing that I only have two months to get our situation figured out for our stuff to get packed up here and moved, any help is much appreciated even if you don't have a place available!"
18lovx,5,2013-02-15,I (20M) feel like my girlfriend (20F) is totally apathetic.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/18lovx/i_20m_feel_like_my_girlfriend_20f_is_totally/,"Yesterday was Valentines Day, obviously. Let me take you through the day. Me(20M), her(20F)

We live in separate college towns but were both coming home for VD. I posted a cute picture of us on her wall with a cheesy ""happy valentines day see you soon etc etc"" post on her FB wall. She gets on facebook, messages me, comments on a few things, and doesn't even like it, although 10-20 other people had. We were messaging back and forth and eventually I just said ""Chu don't like my post I worked so hard on???"" (trying to be cute, haha whatever), which then she liked it without responding to me. I know this is small, but the fact that she saw it and was totally apathetic kind of bugged me.

We get home a few hours later, both happy, and I give her ~$100 necklace and ~$50 flowers, as I had just gotten an internship so I wanted to do something a little extra special. After making everything look cute, I went over to her house to give it to her. When I got there, she said thank you and her mom had made me cookies and snacks to take back with me. She said she got me a card but hadn't written in it yet. I think ""this is fine, it was a busy week for her, whatever."" Then she offers to pay for a concert for someone I've never heard of that she wants to see. I say ""OK"" but I'll just end up paying for it anyways.

Then the worst part happens. We're laying in bed just watching youtube videos or something because it was late and we were tired, and I try to kiss her but she kept making silly faces or backing away. She then says ""All you ever want is kisses."" Although it's obvious she means sex. Now, we haven't had sex in months although we spent all winter break forever. Needless to say, I'm a little peeved because I already feel like if I was only here for sex, I wouldn't be here. And we've had this conversation before, I could have sex every day and she could go her whole life without it. So I say ""Because we never do anything anymore"" To which she replies ""I can make it never.""

I didn't say anything, but this has really been bugging me. I feel like she knows she has all the power and really doesn't care what happens to us. She seems totally apathetic to our relationship, unless I get on her nerves. Then she yells at me and ignores me. And she knows that she can 'reward' me with sex if I do something good.

Am I exaggerating? Making something up that isn't there? Thanks all.


**tldr**; I say ""We never have sex."" She says ""I can make it never."" and generally acts uninterested in our relationship."

18lkyv,10,2013-02-15,I am a student[21f] in love with her professor [36m],throw-me-in,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/18lkyv/i_am_a_student21f_in_love_with_her_professor_36m/,"As the title suggests I have fallen for a male professor at my university. Even though I am fully aware that this is a cliché, I just can't help it. I study outside U.S. so we don't generally care as a society about these kinds of relationships but school administrators may. I also have doubts whether or not he likes me- I believe he does too. But before that let me give a bit more info on us. 

- He is single, never married, no kids. 
- He is 15 yrs older than me but he has dated a women 9 yrs younger than him before. So I guess the age diff wont matter that much. 
- I am a student, but not his. I am pursuing a different major than his, so I have 0 chance to end up in one of his classes or his best buddies classes.  
- I still have a couple of years to graduate. I am top of my class and a bit scared if this happens and it gets leaked out, we both may be frowned upon, more over thrown out. 
- I have checked our school policy but couldn't find anything on the student/prof relationships, and my institution has no past on this issue either (maybe they are ignoring the possibility). 
- He is loved by majority of the students b/c he is so handsome, talented, and smart. So girls fly into his office during office hours but it is obvious he just likes the attention from them but don't take them too seriously or don't engage in their lives besides their internships. 

And as for us: there is no us, yet. But he does sense my attention, and differing from his reactions to other students, he is also interested in me. Although we don't get a chance to see each other outside school campus, I have somehow managed to have one on one time with him, talking about random things, and my future. At first he was a bit distant and scared of my attention and kept the doors open at all times, but now he is much more relaxed. And although he is not a chatty type, he tries to flirt -his attempts are so adorable :). He game me a ride home couple of times and I feel we have an attraction.

One big con is that a year ago before personally knowing him, and before I knew I had a chance, I talked to much about him with my friends about how I have fallen for him. Now even though I act cool about him, people still raise their eyebrows when two of us talk. I tell people that I have grown out of it, and we are just friends. So what I think is that since people all know I'm a bisexual, should I spread a rumor that I am with a woman so they will let it go? 

The thought of being with him, sexually, emotionally, numbs me. But I am also afraid of what might happen to him if this happens and if people learn. Some already think that we are a bit too close. And I am also scared of jeopardizing my future too. 
So what should I do? Anyone been though these? Any suggestions on how to get him embrace his feelings?

TL;DR I have questions on a possible relationship with a professor, is it worth it?"

18lk4c,1,2013-02-15,Review my SoP? &lt;3,[deleted],gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/18lk4c/review_my_sop_3/,"/***

this is my first draft for my computational linguistics masters application, its due march 1st and I'm in dire need of more eyeballs so I would greatly appreciate some reviewage. If anyone wants to trade statements for me to review just let me know.

I expect to make a lot of changes so don't be afraid to tear me down.

***/

My long-term professional goal is a career in natural language processing. This career will allow me to do what I find most fulfilling and satisfying in life; it will allow me to apply my analytical skills to solve complex real world problems. The &lt;school&gt; Computational Linguistics Master's program will ensure that I have the skills and experience required to achieve this goal.

My interest in linguistics derives from my love of solving puzzles. Picking apart and analyzing linguistic data to find patterns is like solving a verbal Rubik’s cube. A Rubik’s cube has over 432 quadrillion unique states, but any Rubik’s cube can be solved with an understanding of the patterns that govern its movement. Similarly, the complex surface variations of Language arise from simple underlying rules which can be deduced through careful analysis. I find it thoroughly satisfying to pick apart and explicitly describe these elegant linguistic processes that exist in my own unconscious mind. Through my undergraduate Linguistics courses I have learned how to think like a Linguist; how to analyze data, recognize patterns, and describe phenomena. I applied these skills in a syntax research project in which I provided arguments for the existence of null complementizers.  Other projects of interest I completed include a description of Swedish phonology and a study of American dialect perceptions. My efforts have given me a broad and comprehensive understanding of Linguistics that will serve as a framework for my learning in Computational Linguistics.

My aptitude for solving analytical problems also precipitated my interest in Computer Science. Every assignment I was given during my programming classes presented me with a new puzzle to solve. After starting a project, I could not stop thinking about it until it was finished. It was not uncommon for me to wake up in the middle of the night with new ideas for optimizing my code. What I enjoyed most about my Computer Science courses was the sense of accomplishment I felt when my hard work resulted in a functioning application. I am now applying the skills I acquired in school to build ASP.NET web applications at my current internship with the tech company CodeSmart Inc. My ability to focus on implementing theoretical concepts into working programs will be crucial to my success in the &lt;school&gt; Master’s program.

So far my academic studies have only covered Linguistics and Computer Science separately, but I am most interested in the intersection of these two fields. In order to learn more about natural language processing, I recently began an internship with the developers of an iPhone application called Nuiku. The application acts as a virtual sales assistant, managing sales data through a natural language user interface. Helping to test the Nuiku natural language processing engine has opened my eyes to the immense potential Computational Linguistics has for practical applications. I am particularly interested in ways that natural language processing can improve search engines. Search engines serve as mediators between the user and all of the wealth of information on the internet. The large scale implementation of semantic categorization and information extraction will one day revolutionize the way we interact with information. This is one of the many ways in which natural language processing has the potential to empower users of the internet with better access to more useful information. I am a firm believer that knowledge is power. It is my dream to apply my practical problem solving skills to empower the average person with better access to the wealth of knowledge on the internet. I will do this through a career in natural language processing.

The &lt;school&gt; Computational Linguistics Master's program is the ideal means for me to achieve my career goal. No other program places the same level of importance on preparing its students for the challenges they will face in the industry. The curriculum promises to provide me with the knowledge base, practical experience, and relevant relationships necessary for success in my career.

/***

Some specific questions:

1. How can I improve my intro/conclusion? Right now they feel very generic and my conclusion doesn't really do any concluding
2. Does the rubik's cube analogy help me at all or am I wasting my time? At first I tried writing it like an anecdote about my first experience with a rubik's cube but it was long and flowery and didn't seem like it fit in this paper. Same question for my lame attempt to show how much I loved my programming assignments.

18lfda,3,2013-02-15,[critique] Hi Reddit! How can my wife improve her university application essay?,[deleted],writing,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/18lfda/critique_hi_reddit_how_can_my_wife_improve_her/,"So my wife would love some feedback on this but I'm not a great writer. If any of you would like to lend a hand I'd love to buy the most helpful of you a cup of coffee (paypal) as a thank you for your invaluable generosity. We needed to cover a wide list of topics within 700-1000 words and decided to take a story approach instead of the awful My family history is... My challenges are... I hope to one day... 

So with that in mind, here it is.


	When I was 10, I remember opening my eyes at three one morning to sounds of my mother cleaning the house for her first day in business. As I matured I understood the depth of her immigrant success story. Sacrificing for what all parents want to give their children -a life with opportunities she didn’t grow up with. Today, I’m the first in my family attending college and I owe her so much gratitude. This alone is enough to remind me to smile as I write. She, however, is not the only person that made a major impact in my first years in college. 
 
	In elementary school I met the wonderful boy named Chris I’d marry one day: it just took us a decade to find out. During our first year together we could barely make ends meet, so I decided to work in a restaurant to help. Night after night I came home, often frustrated and unfulfilled. I felt I let my myself down. To my surprise though, this didn’t turn out to be a complete waste of my time. The real world helped me mature as I learned about myself and the value of a tertiary education. I also became aware of my avoidance of embarrassments through self limitations. One day as I vented about work with Chris he said something that I wish never to forget. “I would rather see you fail reaching what you love than watch you succeed somewhere where you will never meet your potential.” These words still echo in my head today.

	That’s when I let go of the fear and doubt that held me back for years. I understood then that courage and resiliency is what separates the doers from the dreamers. In 2010 I enrolled into the University of Central Arkansas while still working part time. Once I did, I finally understood where I belonged. Some nights were unimaginably stressful and I’ve pulled through some long night shifts followed by studying marathons for exams the morning after. I suppose it’s that same determination I saw in my mother, when I was a child, that kept me strong through the times I thought “I can’t possibly absorb another ounce of knowledge today.” I’ve worked restlessly to earn my 3.8 GPA and I’m proud of it because I can say I’ve given it my every bit of effort in me. Luckily this didn’t last long, Chris was soon promoted and I left my job to dedicate all my focus to school. Then, came another surprise. The military gave us orders to move to Washington in 2011.

	The move was a welcomed gift; full of exciting new opportunities including the search for a new school, however, the switch from UCA to TCC gave me a different list of available majors though so I was back to the drawing board. First I felt a medical field was the answer since it seems like an purposeful aspiration but I felt no emotional connection there. I wasn't thrilled about working in a medical field, but the more I grew and learned, I noticed my affinity for numbers, their rules, and systems. I was intrigued by the constant truth in the world of math where nothing is left to subjectivity. I had found my third love in life, and that's when I had an epiphany that connected it all. If my mother became a successful entrepreneur, alone and without a single day of business school; what couldn’t I achieve with an amazing education? That’s when I knew exactly what I wanted to major in and in life; a business degree with a focus in finance to open a commercial photography studio within a year of graduating. The perfect way to combine my talents with my husband’s.

	I want to attend UWT’s Milgard School of Business because I want to know I did everything I possibly could to reach my full potential. At TCC I’ve built my foundation very seriously to prepare for what I’ve heard is a challenging transition. I’m ready to embrace the test of pursuing a finance major with open arms with what can only be described as an unusual enjoyment for math. That however is not the sole reason for choosing UWT. I want to make a positive meaningful change in the lives of young adults who understand poverty first hand. One thing I love about this school are its ties to the community. Within ten years, I want to develop a scholarship for young creative entrepreneurs as well as an internship program. I wish is to one day help others find their dreams because I don’t believe there’re are already too many kind when it comes to helping students reach their potential. As my mother became a first-generation, immigrant, business woman, and as my husband bravely serves in the military, I will prepare for the day when I too can pay it forward.

	Life full of uncertainties, but I’ve come to be sure of a few things in mine. Two of those certainties are my wish to building a successful business with a strong financial structure and developing a community benefiting foundation to encourage new generations of entrepreneurs. It’s beautiful to remember that all this started from an idea of becoming more. Some see decisions as the end of choices but I prefer to see this a the beginning of perfecting. The masters of art earned that title through countless hours of commitment to their craft. Giving your daily effort to work you find meaningful is one of the most rewarding acts we can be a part of and if you travel through life with an unwavering purpose nothing can stop you. Thanks to my loved ones and those who have believed in me, I’ve found my purpose and with it I plan to fuel my success through my years in UWT and beyond.

**Prompt**: In an essay of 300 words or fewer (approximately 1950 characters with spaces), write about your goals for your time at Queen's University and beyond. Your answer will be evaluated for content and writing style.

**Essay**

Pursuing new knowledge and experience in my area of interest has always been an important goal of my life. I feel that the opportunities and resources offered by Queen’s University will allow me to develop new skills and fulfill my lifelong goals. The diverse student body, outstanding professors and the exceptional campus and facilities all contribute to the great appeal of the University to many students, myself included. I believe that Queen’s would be a great fit for my aspirations.

My desire to pursue a career in the computing industry stems from my great interest of the increasingly prevalent technology sector. My interest has lead me to do much independant learning and I would like to continue that learning at a world class institution such as Queen’s. In the next four years of my life I would like to receive the best education possible. The Queen’s computing program would help me achieve that. My goal is to not only achieve high academic grades but also gain valuable experience that will benefit me in the future. The Queen’s Undergraduate Internship Program, a program unique to Queen’s,  is a opportunity I am looking forward to.

so some help would be appreciated-
first is a mapping service that is moving their core product from a flash engine to a html5/js engine. they said as an intern id be very involved in that process (also may include researchy type work to figure out what oss technologies they can use). small dev team working with geography/mapping people within the company.

second is a java shop that works on news aggregators of sort. they are a social media awareness service for businesses. they would have all kinds of random development taskings, mostly in java. small dev team in a much larger company.

third is an IT security firm with a very small development team, they have offices in a few different countries but the actual dev team is very small (7-8 ppl?). id be working in c/py doing network/systems level stuff.

im still very early in my post secondary career, so i have many work terms ahead. however i still have to rank these places. any advice? if you have any questions- ask away. thanks!"

I'm about to graduate one semester early this December with a BS in Biomedical Engineering. I'm planning on pursuing a PhD in tissue engineering or something related (still haven't figured that out for sure yet, definitely life sciences though) and I'd like to get started as soon as I can. However, it seems like all the PhD programs I've found so far only accept students for the fall term, leaving me in a weird limbo position for about eight months.

The other option I've considered is working in industry for half a year before starting my PhD, but I feel like companies don't really recruit much in the winter, and all the short-term positions available are internships or co-ops that would require me to be a currently enrolled student.

Has anybody here been in a similar situation? How did you go about finding jobs / grad programs that allowed you to start in the spring?

Thanks so much."

Or are they all like this?,bustyLaserCannon,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/18l5ba/sort_of_just_came_to_the_conclusion_that_my_unis/,"I'm in my 3rd (out of 4) year of a Software Engineering degree in a fairly large University in London.

I'm currently in a work placement creating software for a few more months until I return to do my final year and one of the people I work with graduated from my University. He had plenty of previous programming experience where as I had none. 

Now being at this company, i've been asked to do things (programming-wise) which they expected me to know how to do. And after a few months here, i'm realising they barely taught me shit at University. 

The only OO language taught was a one year module in Java, and a few other bits of MySQL, Prolog, PHP, basic web dev and I have an optional C++ module I can pick next year which I will. There's also the choice of a Haskell module (any good?) and some other bits I can pick. Things like data-structures and algorithms were taught but there was nothing low-level, nothing practical, not a lot of programming, it just seemed very vanilla. 

That might help but I know for a fact that my software engineering course has less programming involved than the Computer Science course. I'm just disappointed to be honest, and wondering what I could do to 'catch up' on people that had a better CS course.

I also feel sorry for the people from my course that didn't get a placement and went straight into the final year as without the experience i'm picking up from this internship, I would've gone into my final year as a pretty shitty programmer.


Are all courses like this Reddit? Or does mine just suck? If it does, what can I do to put me on level terms?"

Last summer I applied for a job as a waitress at a resturant. I was going to try out for the job and I was nervous but not scared. I thought it was gonna go okay, maybe I would even get the job. 
I got there before they opened and was told to do little tasks such as cut bread, dry off wineglasses, set the tables and such. Everything went fine up til when the guests arrived.   
  
 
For example I was told to try and learn the numbers of the tables. There was a picture on the computer over the resturant and which number the tables were. I have a really hard time remebering and even getting stuff like this to stay in my head so it didn't go so well.  

Then I was told to put the knifes and forks on a table with 2 persons. I was told to put them in order, like salad, meat and so on. As I said, I have a hard time remembering things so I did it wrong. I was told to go do it again, and it took 3 times of me running back and forth to the couple and the table to rearrange their silwerface before I got it right.
  
   
Later I went around the tables refilling everyones water. I spilled a bit at one table and didn't even think to go get napkins to dry it up. Wtf brain? It wasn't before the guy at the table waved at me and pointed at the wet spot on the table that I went to dry it up. I apologized and felt so stupid and embarressed.  
  

Then, I was going to put some silverware at a table. Everything went fine until I knocked over the lady at the tables wineglass, over her blouse. I freaked out and said I was sorry a million times and went to go get napkins. The manager was talking to her and I proceeded to tell her how sorry I was. She was a sweetheart about it and said it was okay.
I had to go into the back and just stand there for a minute. I felt so fucking ashamed and was considering going home. I felt like I was gonna start crying but I held it together. I wasn't going to give up. The manager just told me it wasn't a big deal, this things happen. And I guess they do, but on my first day? I didn't even dare look him or the lady in the eyes for the rest of the evening.  
  

The rest of the evening I just walked around clearing tables. I was told to serve a table but the plates were to hot so I just couldn't do it. I would have dropped them. For everyone else it seemed to go like clockwork.  
   

At 22 at night I was told I could go home. Didn't hear from the resturant again. Felt like a failure. I cringe whenever I think about it and it's even hard writing about it.  
 

Another example is when I was an intern at a store some years ago. I was going to be the cashier while the guy working there was in the back, and he explained how it worked. I have always been bad at math, but he told me it didn't matter and that I just had to let the machine to the work. First customer arrived and I had completly forgot how it worked. I had to go get him and ask for help.  
  

It's not that I go in to jobs thinking I will fail, I am always feeling positive and thinking I can do it. But then it ends up like this.
  

But then, in august I got a job trough a company that provides people to different workplaces when they need extra staff (manpower) It's not that often, they text when they need people and there's a schedule for when there's free shift. It's in a store and my job is just 4 hours spent putting stuff on their shelves. Really really easy and I like it there.

Last time I worked there I was going home when I ran into the stores manager. She asked me ""how is everything going? you seem a little lost.""
I was kinda suprised since I had worked there like 5 times and I thought everything was going good. I told her I was fine, and she was like ""well okay, cause you may have noticed we try to do our work in a good pace."" I told her ofcourse I knew that and that I was doing my job without ever slacking off. She just looked at me and was like ""well, okay.""  
  
I was competely taken by suprise, I thought everything was going well. I try as hard as I can, but obviously that's never enough. I am retarded or something? 
This was in november and I havn't got a workshift from them since. I'm starting to think maybe she told the company I was lazy and they don't want me there anymore? I havn't been ""fired"" (since it's not the actual store i work for, and I don't know if you can get fired from a company likes this), but it feels really weird. 
  

So yeah. Basically I feel like a big failure that can't even do the easiest tasks. I can't get things trough my head and make them stay there, I'm clumsy and forgetful. I just feel like a burden wherever I go.
All my friends have jobs and I feel like I can't even do the easiest ones.
I don't have high hopes for the future. 
  
I don't know if it will always be like this. I'm just so tired of myself.

&gt; My really long term girlfriend (would have been six years soon) broke up with me at the beginning of the month because she ""wanted to be single for a while"". We're from the same town (out of state) and came to school together. I'm shy and she was my best friend, so I never put a huge effort into making new friends. The small group of friends I do have are all mutual, and so what was originally a heartbreaking breakup turned infinitely worse when I found out that she started sleeping with one of the mutual friends who I had been talking to and hanging out with for support (so he knew exactly what I was going through). 

Possibly relevant, missing details:

* ***edit:*** After originally writing the above, I found out that they first slept together before we broke up.
* I deleted my ex and ex-friend from my phone, blocked them on Facebook, and cut off all contact with my ex as soon as I moved out of the apartment we shared. I forgot a few things there, and asked my former roommate (and my ex's good friend) if she could give them to me when I came back to school. She must have told my ex because I got a really nasty text about it in August, which I promptly deleted (without replying).
* My ex and the ex-friend starting officially dating at some point soon after.
* I ended up finding out that she broke up with my ex-friend and started dating a co-worker.

All of that happened in April of 2012, so it's been almost a year. Fortunately, I managed to get a great internship from June-December across the country (away from school and away from my/our hometown), I made friends there, and had a blast.

Now I'm back at school. Knowing that she's here and me worrying that I'll see her occasionally triggers some anxiety, but it's gotten better over the last 6 weeks. Fortunately, I haven't seen her or my ex-friend. I'm still a bit bummed and lonely, but it's way better than the months following the breakup.

I talked to one mutual friend right after I got back, and she suggested that we all do something, but she mentioned that they would likely invite  my ex-friend, so I never really pursued the option. I've been hanging out with a couple other mutual friends once in a while and haven't had any issues there. Other than that, I haven't really made much of an effort to connect with the group like I used to.

A few weeks ago, I got a text from my ex-friend saying that he wanted to meet in-person to talk. This really triggered my new-found anxiety, so I just deleted the text and ignored it. Today I got a text from another mutual friend to the effect of ""ex-friend wants to talk so he can apologize and hopefully we can all start hanging out again. Would you be interested? We'd understand if you said no, we just want to see you more""

I really don't want to meet up or talk with the ex-friend, and I really don't think his apology will be worth much to me. I'm still hurt from the breakup, and I feel like a reminder is the last thing I need. Still, a little part of me feels like I'm being a dick if I don't try to accept his apology and move on.

**tl;dr: Ex-girlfriend cheated on me with a mutual friend a year ago. She has since moved onto another relationship. He wants to apologize and start hanging out again.**

Sorry for the lengthy post. I don't know what to do, and I could use some advice."

I have a major decision to make and I'm looking for some insight.

I've been offered several 16 month internships (May 2013 - August 2014).  These offers expire by tomorrow morning, and range from $40k/yr to $55k/yr.  These salaries are very tempting as it will allow me to graduate debt free and perhaps build a little nest egg.

However, if I take one of these internships, I'll be unable to attend the undergraduate business school at my university (Richard Ivey School of Business for those who know about it) and do the dual degree with Software Engineering and Business.  I have a few connections in that school so if I am accepted (guessing about a 60% chance speaking with past students) then I will have the opportunity to interview for good banking jobs.  However, I have no interest in banking.  I do not enjoy DCFs, or anything of that sort.  My passion lies both in Software Development and the industry as a whole.  I love talking about what I think about major companies, the next big technology, the quality of a recent release, etc.  My roommates are in IB and constantly ask me questions regarding the tech industry.

I'm not sure what to do.  Does anyone have any insight?  Like I said, I enjoy software development, but I also enjoy researching the industry and coming up with ways to make money from it, but I don't like the actual banking work behind it.  I've heard of banking firms that recruit solely software engineers because of their knowledge, but is there any validity to this?

My biggest fear is going the traditional software route and having my salary peak at ~100k.  But, if going the business school route, I fear being 50k in debt and being in a field I don't enjoy.  Or, not getting into business school at all and losing out on the chance of getting $60k in my bank account before graduation.

Does anyone have any advice?  My position is a bit unique so any advice at all would be appreciated.  Thanks."

I mean honestly, think about it. We, as humans, by design have it embedded in our neurological code to want to live for now. That's what we do best. It's not something hard to do. In fact, most people find it extremely hard to do anything but ""live for now"". To strive ahead in life, and to set a solid foundation for the rest of your life, we know that living for now is the last thing you want to do, regardless of how easy the temptation to do so is.

I understand it's all about marketing, and gearing product to a certain audience. But come on. What sort of messages are we sending nowadays? Live your life with complete disregard for the future! It just sounds ignorant and tasteless to me.

Maybe next time Pepsi shouldn't wait until the last second to get an intern to throw out the first thought that comes to their head for a new slogan idea, and really shoot for something that will sink in deep.

What are your thoughts Reddit?

**TL;DR Pepsi's new slogan is pathetically simpleminded and ignorant**"

I'm so freaking manic right now.  Anyone who saw how many replies I just posted in the one asking for help about sexual impulses would have gathered this.

Not two hours ago I was sobbing uncontrollably.  Why? Oh no reason.  Well there was a reason...my best friend got a girlfriend.  Should be happy for him, right?  Oh no...My thought?  He's going to be spending all his time with her and I'm never the peachiest person to talk to so he's going to get tired of my shit and never talk to me and I'm going to be alone.

Oh and that relationship episode?  If any of you guys remember that whole situation...We're talking about dating.  He told me a few days ago that he didn't think us dating was a good idea and it hit me like a ton of bricks...I did have feelings for him...damn strong feelings...and when he said that I realized that I'd just taken him for granted.  Anyway...today we decided that we would wait on making a decision on whether to stay friends for now or try to move forward into a relationship until my therapist apt on Monday.

Holy cow I can't even focus to type...too much.  TOO MUCH.

I should do something productive.  I have school work I could be doing.  But that would require focus.  I need to do some SPELL SOME RIGHT DAMNIT!

I need to be doing some research for my classes.  I could do that with little focus.  Maybe I will do that when I get done typing this..whenever that will be HA! Shouldn't be too long, I'll run out of characters. 

Oh, so my doctor knows I'm mixed right now.  I saw him...last Thursday and he put me on an antipsychotic and upped my antidepressant.  I talked to my therapist about it on Monday because I've never been in a mixed episode this severe before.  The manic is bad enough that I would have slips of delusions...WTF is that you ask? It's what I named this phenomena because I have no idea what else to call it.
**Slips of Delusion** - A gradual chain reaction thought process that starts with a logical thought and ends with a delusional thought, but you are still sane enough to realize what is happening and draw yourself back.

An example you ask? SURE!  I've been watching Supernatural on Netflix.  I was watching it the other day and this was my thought process ""That's really cool.  I wonder if there really are stuff like that out there (btw  believe in ghosts, was actually in a ghost hunting group..want to get back in one..anyway)...I'm sure there are.  But to this degree?  Well no one in this show knows about them but the hunters, so surely there  COULD be something out there like that.  That would be an awesome thing to do. Hunt these bad creatures that no one knows about and save people's lives...Change the world even!  That's it...I'm going to do it.  How do I do it?  I know, I have to find someone who is doing it now and get in it with th... wait ...WTF...You know that shit aint real!""  And I could actually FEEL myself being drawn out of it.  It's so weird, I can't even explain it.

So I'm laying here in bed.  I'll be embarrassed and ashamed and crying tomorrow because me and that guy up there ^^^ that I was talking about just went further than either of us ever meant to..and he's going to feel like shit, which is going to make me feel even worse and that's just going to be bad.  But right now?  I don't care.  I'm freaking wonderful right now.

Man this chick's going to cut her fingers off in a minute.  Just wait...Yeah, I'm still watching Supernatural.

I've been going to bed early late..OH SHIT SHE  IS DRINKING BOILING WATER

Guess I was wrong about her cutting her fingers off.

Like I was said, I've been trying to get on a regular sleep schedule, going to sleep at about 10 or 10:30 and getting up at 6.  I started a diet..but today I so came off of it.  I'll do better tomorrow.  And I've started doing Yoga in the mornings.  I love it.  I tried to add cardio today..I only got 5 minutes into that.  I SAY that I stopped because they started using weights and I don't have any.  Man, that definitely is not true.  It was hard.  I guess 5 minuets is better than nothing but still.

I've gained almost ten pounds in about two weeks.  It's crazy and I hate it.  And Thursday my Doctor put me on something and told me it was temporary because it made you gain weight?  Damnit man.  So, I'm trying really hard on this diet and exercise routine, even if I messed up today.  It's okay to slip up every once in a while, you just have to keep at it and keep motivated.

I'm not going to get any research done.  I'm almost positive that I'm going to keep typing here until I run out of things to type about and then go to bed.

Holy cow, so I wanted to see about how long I've been typing this.  Surly it hasn't been over ten minutes.  It's been over 20! Close to 30!  Whaaa???  Maybe I just looked at the times wrong.

I have a three legged orange tabby kitten named Nemo.  I should take a picture of him and show him off.  I did once before but he got downvoted and it discouraged me.  Not here! I'm pretty sure it was in /r/aww or something.  He's a spunky little thing.  He wants to play with my other cat but she's apparently in a pissy mood. 

So Nemo..When my mom found him he had gotten fishing wire wrapped around his paw and cut off circulation and it...well...fell off eventually.  So when we got him he had a poor bloody and worn nub.  That's when I named him Nemo because he had a ""bad fin""  But when we took him to the vet they said they would have to take his whole leg.  And now he's mine.  And he's awesome.  I don't think he likes that I've been putting so many hours in at my internship though because yesterday and today he's been unusually needy.  OH and he helps me do Yoga haha.  That's not fun, I have to make sure not to kick him or something.

Man that cat TRIES to make you kick him though. If you stand up he runs up to you and as soon as you go to step he runs in front of that foot to headbutt your leg and either you bust yours ass (Which I've done before) or you kick him or step on him...AND HE DOESN'T LEARN.

You know that guy I was talking about...I really do want things to work out with him, I'm just scared. It's long distance and...4 out of my last 5 relationships have been long distance and it's sucked.  The one that WAS locally completely crushed me.  So I'm trying to put back the pieces..but this guy is so good.  I've known him for somewhere around 10 years.  I can't remember him ever being selfish and has never tried to hurt me or anything like that.

Man I wish my foot would stop bouncing.  I'm twitchy.  

There was a postcard on postsecret this week that said ""No one sends you flowers when you are crazy.""  It made me cry.  It made me realize I've never gotten a valentines gift from a guy I was dating.  Or birthday.  Or Christmas.  Maybe that is true.

I'm going to take a sleeping pill and get some sleep.  I'm sure no one has actually read down this far...I can't say that I would have..

Well...at least I'm not crying and I'm not delusional.  I just want to be level again.  I want to be able to make rational decisions.


TL;DR: Nothing important."

I kept telling myself not to expect anything, because I knew he wouldn’t get me anything, but that small part of me kept my hopes up. Logical me told myself to forget it, but I always do this. I latch on to an impossible idea and keep it in my mind. I drove home, radio up, chatting with my brother as my mind wandered to what may lay in wait for me at home. I made myself stop to get the mail, to remind myself that nothing would be there. But my heart was aflutter with hope. I took my time walking to the door, telling myself nothing was there and that nothing will come. I glanced from room to room, hoping it was hidden. Then I grabbed my keys and ran out the door to do a hard, hard run. It seems stupid, but to me it’s very sad. I know we’re long distance, but this sort of hurts. Pretty badly. Last year he gave me a bag of Hershey’s kisses and a crinkled up card he had bought from the store. I was a bit sad that he hadn’t put much effort in, but I accepted it because it’s who he is. I ate a kiss every time I missed him.
Last year we went out to a cute little crepes place I had suggested and then went for coldstone on the river. When we were there we saw a couple become engaged, like something out of a movie. The young man knelt down on one knee with a little box as she gasped and began crying. From afar we saw the man whisper something and she fervently shook her head as though to say “Yes of course!” He stood to hug her and a group of men walked out from a restaurant and began cheering and applauding as the couple embraced. It was the most romantic thing I’ve ever seen. I wonder if they’re married now. What might they be doing together this very instant? 
Right now I feel awfully lonely. I have a significant other, yet he’s so far away and too busy to talk. Am I feeling too sorry for myself? I feel as though I’ve been neglected and ignored. Sometimes I think I’d really like the cute sappy romance. I’ve always loved that sort of thing, but felt embarrassed by it. He isn’t really one to think about such things. I got a happy valentines day text this morning. He must have been thinking of me today. With all the hearts and couples and cupids around, how could he forget? Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps. I’m alone, sipping soup and pms-ing on valentines day. How romantic is that.

I am a third year econ student at a semi-target.
I am currently working as a full time intern at PwC.
I have a PE SA position interview next week and I need some advice.

It is my understanding that normal PE interviews cover DCF modeling and LBO modeling.

I dont have much finance background as my degree revolves around behavioral and macro economics.

I understand DCF pretty well from 2 finance courses I took at school taught by former MD of Goldman Sachs but for LBO i just barely understand the concept of it.

so here it is.


1. Would they be asking me to do modeling during the interview?
2. If, yes how and where could I get the informatoin to study for LBO?
3. What questions do you think might be asked during the interview?


I have never prepped for a buy-side job before so I really have no idea how or what to prepare for this. The firm is around 300mil funds, one of the largest in S Korea. It is focused mostly on the IT and entertainment industries.

As our society is able to automate more and more of our labor, the demand for workers is clearly dropping.  Better job prospects are clearly something that you pay for (better universities often cost more).  In the case of Starbucks, it seems as those upper middle class people don't at all mind paying extra for their lattes if it means that there's a place in town that will offer their children better employment situations.  In the case of unpaid internships, it's clear that paying the opportunity cost of making money elsewhere is what ultimately gets wealthy people the jobs they want.

This seemed like too obvious of an idea for it to be original, so I figured that there has to have been some work done.  Anyone care to point me in the right direction?  (I'm a college student so I've got access to academic journals.)"

**Essay**

Pursuing new knowledge and experience in my area of interest has always been an important goal of my life. I feel that the opportunities and resources offered by Queen’s University will allow me to develop new skills and gain a thorough education. The diverse student body, outstanding professors and the exceptional campus and facilities all contribute to the great appeal of the University to many students including myself. I believe that Queen’s would be a great fit for my aspirations.

My desire to pursue a career in the computing industry stems from my great interest of the increasingly prevalent technology sector. My interest has lead me to do much independant learning and I would like to continue that learning at a world class institution such as Queen’s. In the next four years of my life I would like to receive the best education possible. The Queen’s computing program would help me achieve that. My goal is to not only achieve high academic grades but also gain valuable experience that will benefit me in the future. The Queen’s Undergraduate Internship Program is a unique opportunity I am looking forward to. This program will allow me to gain the practical experience and skills that I will apply in my future career.

I consider post-secondary education to be one of the most important steps of my life and I hope that I can have the privilege of furthering my education at Queen’s."

This is shit! Shit, shit, shit. The expectations, the lifestyle, the perfect picture that is painted for us twenty-somethings all throughout our lives and when you get here, its not the American dream; it’s the American fucking nightmare!


Let me explain, before you toss this blathering, complaint riddled, cynical and sarcastic writing in the garbage, next to the rotten bananas and spoiled leftovers.
I’m an Ivy league alumna. That’s right folks, It’s alumna. The singular form of the female gendered noun expressing graduation from an institution of higher learning. I had a relatively tough and damaging childhood but I persevered and made it to my dream school, actively accepting the adult mantra that was repeated to me throughout childhood “you can do anything you want in life if you try hard enough.” And now that I’m here, I wish I could have had my own brain, told the ignorant adults in my life to shut the fuck up, and made some other choices. Now listen; I’m grateful. In school I met an amazing man who loves me for who I am and we plan to get married, eventually, when we can afford it. When I was in school I masochistically took some of the hardest courses offered to qualify myself as a female engineer. School did a great job of building up my ego- YES, you got in HERE which means you get to walk around an inch higher than everyone else with an entitled look in your eye. “But I’m an Ivy league grad, that means I’m worth more.”


But let me let you in on a little secret. It means nothing. Today’s economy is nothing compared to the economy 20 years ago. It was great back then; you could graduate from one of the top schools in the country and make a hundred grand easy. But guess what. It’s not 20 years ago and it never will be again. Today, you see ivy leaguers in the worst positions, receptionists, car washers, drive through food servers. And quite frankly, the world has allowed the well-educated to drown. It’s better to be ignorant in today’s society- you have a better chance of survival. If you’re ignorant, you don’t bother to ask what more is out there for you and you have a handful of jobs available to you. Yes, they might suck your pride and dignity into a black hole of self-loathing, but you don’t know better than that so you’re content with your mediocre life! But no, we educated people have it worse because we know that we’re worth more, we’re smart people, we worked for it, staying up late studying endlessly just to do better than 75% of the class, we’re fucking brilliant hard workers! We have research experience, great grades, extracurriculars and volunteer work that make us better than everyone else. 


Which means that no one wants to hire us. So we graduate from our literally life draining educational institution and thank goodness you have that piece of paper on the wall proving you went there, because you’ll be paying for it until literally your grandchildren are grown. But what does it get you? Well. Not those jobs that the ignorant people have; no, they won’t hire you for those because you’re “overqualified” and won’t be happy being raped at minimum wage. And no, you can’t get any industry jobs because you were so smart to go into your field that you have to KEEP selling your soul for more school loans to go to graduate school in order to qualify for those. And you obviously won’t be able to get anything entry level in another industry that you like because you didn’t do internships in school. Forgive me, you worked full time through school, getting paid, therefore you can’t qualify for jobs that need internships because you didn’t starve to do free work. So what’s left for you? Administration. Reception. Secretarial jobs. Jobs where you want to rip your hair out because you have to talk down your skills to be considered. Even then, career secretaries have a better chance than you do at ever getting one of those.


I took an interview for a reception job last week in the big city, which would have paid a grand total $29,000 a year, and they told me to talk down my abilities to the CFO because he was scared I wouldn’t do the job for more than three weeks before quitting, like his last two hires. They’ll likely give the job to a ditzy blonde with a high school diploma and waitressing experience. Not like the 29 grand would have gotten me far, because commuting into and out of the city costs $30 bucks a day. Yeah. That’s the cost of more than a half of a tank of gas for your car, to sit next to poop stained bums and BO riddled passengers who don’t bother to wash while you squish like sardines onto a moving tube completely drenched in the stench of the underground city. So I’d be essentially paying to go to work.


What’s so frustrating, as I sit at a wobbly table fighting computer glitches and autocorrect on my texts “no, honey, I don’t love you I lie you.” Or “are you sucking on the train instead of sitting….” Is the fact that I didn’t have the entitled attitude before going to school. They built that up! I was so honored to be a part of a school with such a reputation when I went in. I was humble! And now, I’ve been taught to see myself as worthy of a legitimate, soul fulfilling career upon graduation and obviously, my expectations have come up short. So when I go into the working world with an air of confidence, competency, and willingness to work hard, I’m seen as arrogant, condescending, or demeaning. My resume, filled with research positions, jobs during school, and added value is deliberately cut down to look less intimidating for jobs that I am so overqualified for I could cry. But the only real way to get work today as a 20 something average nobody is nepotism. So forgive me for studying hard and not having social connections in college, because the only people employed out of college these days are the nepotistic, self-serving socialites with rich daddies, legacies in the Greek world, or people who slept with their professors in school and then blackmail them to get ahead.


Our society no longer honors the educated and honest. It no longer supports it’s generations of tomorrow. Instead, it punishes those trying to earn a living by working hard for an education they feel they deserve for their future family’s support, and tosses them away to be a part of the forgotten generation. I’m absolutely average. I wear a size 14, My butt is too big but not bigger than my enormous debt, my family has little interest in helping due to the fact I’m “an adult now” and my fiancé and I commiserate together on when we will get to live a life in which we can look forward to time spent together and working hard, instead of waiting for days to pass in a dog shit pile of misery. Why do we do this to ourselves?? Let me just put it into perspective. The highlight of my week was falling on my ass down a set of stairs and getting a baseball sized bruise, on my ass.


We do this to ourselves because it was spoon fed to us. One of my parents thinks there are jobs everywhere. “I’m desperate for directors and vps” YEAH right. Guess what. How many years of experience do you require for those positions? TEN. How many years of experience do I have? One. At a church in the deep south where people swapped stories of their childhood slaves and spend time gossiping around the lunchroom all day instead of, you know, actually doing their jobs. I got that job because a boss of my fiancé felt bad for me. I’m not even religious! And I took it, and I learned some great skills. But I also learned why the fuck this country is the way it is. We reward shitty workers who abuse the system and try to squeeze as much money as possible out of people for doing as little work as necessary. And when all else fails, they turn to motherfucking GOD. Unless he drops a meal down in front of me that doesn’t look like ramen and rice, I’m pretty sure he’s fucking useless.


So I’m going to sit here, drinking my overly sweet unnecessarily expensive coffee-ish drink, applying for job after job online because calling got me nowhere (what, you’re surprised no one has phone skills anymore? What you don’t accept calls for a position because you receive SO MANY applications from unemployed fully qualified idiots in my same position) and hope to god some poor bastard takes pity on me and hires me because of my rack instead of my brain and hopefully I’ll be able to show myself as a good employee. Who knows though, maybe I’ll get fired for working too hard and making everyone else look bad. It’s happened to people before. And the saddest part of all is that, compared to many out there, I have it good. I’m not sleeping because I worry so much about bills, I likely have an ulcer, I have to figure out how the hell to pay for an apartment that costs twice the price of a mortgage of a house somewhere else, stress about work and money daily, and be thankful for it. And I am. I’m thankful for my life. The roof over my head, the food in my stomach, the company of my fiancé and my cats, and the chance to keep going in this capitalist chaos called the United States. I’m so fucking thankful I could shit. But seriously. When does it get better?"

Let me explain, before you toss this blathering, complaint riddled, cynical and sarcastic writing in the garbage, next to the rotten bananas and spoiled leftovers.

I’m an Ivy league alumna. That’s right folks, It’s alumna. The singular form of the female gendered noun expressing graduation from an institution of higher learning. I had a relatively tough and damaging childhood but I persevered and made it to my dream school, actively accepting the adult mantra that was repeated to me throughout childhood “you can do anything you want in life if you try hard enough.” And now that I’m here, I wish I could have had my own brain, told the ignorant adults in my life to shut the fuck up, and made some other choices. Now listen; I’m grateful. In school I met an amazing man who loves me for who I am and we plan to get married, eventually, when we can afford it. When I was in school I masochistically took some of the hardest courses offered to qualify myself as a female engineer. School did a great job of building up my ego- YES, you got in HERE which means you get to walk around an inch higher than everyone else with an entitled look in your eye. “But I’m an Ivy league grad, that means I’m worth more.”

But let me let you in on a little secret. It means nothing. Today’s economy is nothing compared to the economy 20 years ago. It was great back then; you could graduate from one of the top schools in the country and make a hundred grand easy. But guess what. It’s not 20 years ago and it never will be again. Today, you see ivy leaguers in the worst positions, receptionists, car washers, drive through food servers. And quite frankly, the world has allowed the well-educated to drown. It’s better to be ignorant in today’s society- you have a better chance of survival. If you’re ignorant, you don’t bother to ask what more is out there for you and you have a handful of jobs available to you. Yes, they might suck your pride and dignity into a black hole of self-loathing, but you don’t know better than that so you’re content with your mediocre life! But no, we educated people have it worse because we know that we’re worth more, we’re smart people, we worked for it, staying up late studying endlessly just to do better than 75% of the class, we’re fucking brilliant hard workers! We have research experience, great grades, extracurriculars and volunteer work that make us better than everyone else. Which means that no one wants to hire us. So we graduate from our literally life draining educational institution and thank goodness you have that piece of paper on the wall proving you went there, because you’ll be paying for it until literally your grandchildren are grown. But what does it get you? Well. Not those jobs that the ignorant people have; no, they won’t hire you for those because you’re “overqualified” and won’t be happy being raped at minimum wage. And no, you can’t get any industry jobs because you were so smart to go into your field that you have to KEEP selling your soul for more school loans to go to graduate school in order to qualify for those. And you obviously won’t be able to get anything entry level in another industry that you like because you didn’t do internships in school. Forgive me, you worked full time through school, getting paid, therefore you can’t qualify for jobs that need internships because you didn’t starve to do free work. So what’s left for you? Administration. Reception. Secretarial jobs. Jobs where you want to rip your hair out because you have to talk down your skills to be considered. Even then, career secretaries have a better chance than you do at ever getting one of those. 

I took an interview for a reception job last week in the big city, which would have paid a grand total  $29,000 a year, and they told me to talk down my abilities to the CFO because he was scared I wouldn’t do the job for more than three weeks before quitting, like his last two hires. They’ll likely give the job to a ditzy blonde with a high school diploma and waitressing experience. Not like the 29 grand would have gotten me far, because commuting into and out of the city costs $30 bucks a day. Yeah. That’s the cost of more than a half of a tank of gas for your car, to sit next to poop stained bums and BO riddled passengers who don’t bother to wash while you squish like sardines onto a moving tube completely drenched in the stench of the underground city. So I’d be essentially paying to go to work.

What’s so frustrating, as I sit at a wobbly table fighting computer glitches and autocorrect on my texts “no, honey, I don’t love you I lie you.” Or “are you sucking on the train instead of sitting….” Is the fact that I didn’t have the entitled attitude before going to school. They built that up! I was so honored to be a part of a school with such a reputation when I went in. I was humble! And now, I’ve been taught to see myself as worthy of a legitimate, soul fulfilling career upon graduation and obviously, my expectations have come up short. So when I go into the working world with an air of confidence, competency, and willingness to work hard, I’m seen as arrogant, condescending, or demeaning. My resume, filled with research positions, jobs during school, and added value is deliberately cut down to look less intimidating for jobs that I am so overqualified for I could cry. But the only real way to get work today as a 20 something average nobody is nepotism. So forgive me for studying hard and not having social connections in college, because the only people employed out of college these days are the nepotistic, self-serving socialites with rich daddies, legacies in the Greek world, or people who slept with their professors in school and then blackmail them to get ahead. 

Our society no longer honors the educated and honest. It no longer supports it’s generations of tomorrow. Instead, it punishes those trying to earn a living by working hard for an education they feel they deserve for their future family’s support, and tosses them away to be a part of the forgotten generation. I’m absolutely average. I wear a size 14, My butt is too big but not bigger than my enormous debt, my family has little interest in helping due to the fact I’m “an adult now” and my fiancé and I commiserate together on when we will get to live a life in which we can look forward to time spent together and working hard, instead of waiting for days to pass in a dog shit pile of misery. Why do we do this to ourselves?? Let me just put it into perspective. The highlight of my week was falling on my ass down a set of stairs and getting a baseball sized bruise.

We do this to ourselves because it was spoon fed to us. My dad thinks there are jobs everywhere. “I’m desperate for directors and vps” YEAH dad. Guess what. How many years of experience do you require for those positions? TEN. How many years of experience do I have? One. At a church in the deep south where people swapped stories of their childhood slaves and spend time gossiping around the lunchroom all day instead of, you know, actually doing their jobs. I got that job because a boss of my fiancé felt bad for me. I’m not even religious! And I took it, and I learned some great skills. But I also learned why the fuck this country is the way it is. We reward shitty workers who abuse the system and try to squeeze as much money as possible out of people for doing as little work as necessary. And when all else fails, they turn to motherfucking GOD. Unless he drops a meal down in front of me that doesn’t look like ramen and rice, I’m pretty sure he’s fucking useless.

So I’m going to sit here, drinking my overly sweet unnecessarily expensive coffee-ish drink, applying for job after job online because calling got me nowhere (what, you’re surprised no one has phone skills anymore? What you don’t accept calls for a position because you receive SO MANY applications from unemployed fully qualified idiots in my same position) and hope to god some poor bastard takes pity on me and hires me because of my rack instead of my brain and hopefully I’ll be able to show myself as a good employee. Who knows though, maybe I’ll get fired for working too hard and making everyone else look bad. It’s happened to people before.
And the saddest part of all is that, compared to many out there, I have it good. I’m not sleeping because I worry so much about bills, I likely have an ulcer, I have to figure out how the hell to pay for an apartment that costs twice the price of a mortgage of a house somewhere else, stress about work and money daily, and be thankful for it. And I am. I’m thankful for my life. The roof over my head, the food in my stomach, the company of my fiancé and my cats, and the chance to keep going in this capitalist chaos called the United States. I’m so fucking thankful I could shit. But seriously. When does it get better?

18n2wg,13,2013-02-16,Led an exgf to cheat and I think I would do it again.,iwoulddoitagainlolol,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/18n2wg/led_an_exgf_to_cheat_and_i_think_i_would_do_it/,"In 2010, I started dating a girl while in college. She was a year older than me at the time (me 18, her 19), and we'll call her D. Now, our relationship was solely based around sex, and it lasted a good 8 months or so based off of our sexual chemistry. She never really complained about the quality of sex, and my I, having been a virgin before this, had nothing to complain about. Anywho, fast forward to the start of the next semester, and we break up back at school. Our casual relationship once again ended up being a sex fueled stupor. 

Sex continued pretty much all the way back to spring break, when she informs me that she's been chatting with an old friend (hereafter referred to as M) who she has had a crush on for a good amount of time, and he'd be coming to visit her in the near future. I thought, ""hey, whatever, it's all cool."" He comes around a few weeks later, in fact, I recall being in the middle of some fun with D when he called her to say he had arrived. We finished things up in my dorm room and she headed back to her room to change and go meet M in the dorm lobby. Turns out I had never really fully grasped depression until this visit by M. D came to see me but found me in bed. She realized what the problem with me was and apologized. I asked her, ""did you do anything with him?"" I don't know why I asked her, but i needed to know i guess. She assured me nothing had happened. I barely left my bed for a good few days, and I am really thankful for the friends that I have for forcing me out to distract myself. The week came to an end, and D had just gotten into the elevator with M to head down to the parking lot. I had to investigate. My ever curious brain needed to tell the truth. I heard the doors to the elevator shut and I quickly moved to D's room, which was conveniently only a few doors down. As convenient as it may sound for me, D always left her door unlocked for some reason. As soon as I was in, I went straight for the garbage. I grabbed a pencil from D's desk and pushed some paper over to the side when I saw a flash of red. I held the papers to the side and there it was: a condom wrapper. This was almost three years ago and D still doesn't know that I know she fucked M that week.

D started dating M basically immediately afterwards and our sexual relationship ended. She still wanted to be friends, so I thought to myself, why not be friends with the girl who I allowed myself to become so infatuated with before, what could go wrong? Basically, everything stayed remotely normal. There were some times were D and I got a little touchy-feely (a little cuddling), but no kissing or anything sexual. Summer came and went and we were both (D and I) back at school in September. She would call us best friends at this point. I would go to her apartment a couple times a month to hang out a bit and we'd talk and she'd tell me about M and how that relationship is going. Naturally I don't want to hear anything of it but in an effort to be a decent friend I listened to her problems. M started off as a really nice guy, but by the way D described it, he was developing a problem with alcohol and anger (once threw a chair almost at D, punching a hole in a wall) and it was scaring D. She really, really liked him, but there's no way this could continue to be okay. I did my best to let her talk through her problems herself, but I admit to nudging her towards breaking up with M. Several times, actually. Several times I verbally expressed my unhappiness with the situation D was in. She acknowledged this and said something to tune of ""I know, I know"" and we went along with our business. Months go by, and it's spring semester again! It's been a tough one, homework out the wazoo, a house off-campus complete with parties and a dick landlord, and hearing about D's continuing troubles with M. He doesn't drink anymore at this point but expresses extreme jealousy when I am brought up in conversation. At this point I'm thinking she's just not in a good position and once again gently suggest a break up. She seems more receptive this time around but nothing happens. It is now March 2012 and my grandmother has been in the hospital all month. I was walking to my first class when my father called me and told me that my grandmother (his mother) probably only had a few hours left to live. In fact, she died right before my last class of the day let out, less than three hours later. I was depressed, my last remaining grandparent had died, and my family had lost a matriarch. Coincidentally D had called to say hello and could tell by my tone that I was not feeling well. She didn't ask why and immediately come over to see what was wrong. Once in my bedroom I laid down on my bed and told her my grandma had died about an hour ago. She starts crying and lays down next to me. I cried a little bit then too, but felt happy because D was next to me. What came next sort of caught me off guard: D sits up, looks at me for a few moments, leans close, and kisses me. Not a peck on the lips: a full, passionate, kiss. I suddenly remembered what it was like to be with this girl and I kissed back. Long story short, we had sex. Afterwards we just laid there kissing and touching each other but reality quickly came back to us when an alarm went off on D's phone, it was time for her to go back to campus for class.  We both headed down the stairs and outside. She walked down the driveway looking a bit flushed and turned around and smiled at me as she got into her car to drive away.

Summer came around and I was to spend half of it taking a summer course at school and the other half in New York City for an internship. Of course, D and I kept in touch, our relationship changed slightly to be more sexually open with each other, often reminiscing about things we had done in the past and how her having a boyfriend (still with M) has kind of complicated things. One step further, she briefly moved to the state in which M lived because she thought the distance is what was making things difficult. It wasn't. After moving down there and having nothing but terrible experiences with M and his family, she decided enough was enough and broke up with him. She moved back home and all seemed well. Since then we (D and I) have not had many sexual encounters (once when she visited me at school) and has had a new, much kinder boyfriend since January of 2013.

What bothers me is that she has recently (2 or 3 days ago) expressed discontent in the fact that we didn't have more sex or do whatever we wanted while she was dating M and that she is wondering why she didn't make a move to have some fun before she started dating her new boyfriend. I guess my problem is that I'm not bothered by kind of leading her to cheat on her boyfriend, I (like her) am bothered by our immense lack of sex during that time.

My relationship with D right now is like this: touchy-feely cuddling, intertwined legs, nude massages, she still flashes me on Skype, and I can still make her laugh like always. The way i see it, we're extremely close, but to most probably a little too close for comfort. Given the chance I would definitely make a move on her again.

TL;DR: Dated a girl in college who took my virginity and took part in an extremely sexual relationship. Girl breaks up with me over summer, gets new boyfriend, cheats on new boyfriend with me during the following semester, laments that we didn't do it more often, I think I might end up doing it again."

Currently, I'm majoring in Hospitality Management, but the more I learn about it the less I feel it's right for me.  So I'm thinking about MIS.  I love the business aspect of it, and I also love the technical, hands-on computer aspect of it as well.  Growing up, I was into HTML and CSS and had a basic understanding of how it worked.  I loved learning it and using it on my awesome pre-teen/teen blogs (I wish I still remembered the names of them, they're hilarious).  I know those probably won't be used in that major, but just a little background on me.  And if you're familiar with the Myers Briggs test, I tested as an INTJ, which I feel fits me perfectly. Down the line, I could see myself as some sort of analyst.  

My biggest fear is graduating with a degree that is worthless.  I've read that if you do go with an MIS degree, you should defiantly get an internship while in school.  What kind of internship would be best?  And are there courses or skills I should take to help with an MIS degree that aren't necessarily part of the program? Also, how are women viewed in this field?  As in, are there a lot of them?  Would it be harder for a women to get respect(for lack of a better word) from their peers/supervisors/etc?  From just experience already with technology, I feel a lot of people think I don't know what I'm talking about just because I'm a girl, and most girls ""don't know computers"".

Also, would a bachelors in MIS be useful? Or something more like accounting/computer science, then getting a masters in MIS?  I plan on getting my Masters in whatever degree I choose anyways.

My ideal career: A nice mix of working alone, and working with others.  A 9-5, M-F work week(or something similar).  I want to have a family one day, and I don't want to have to choose family or career.  I want something that's challenging, something that will also find fun though, so I don't mind taking classes and staying up to date as I get older.  I want something that pays well, and something that will be easy to find a job in."

this is my first draft for my computational linguistics masters application, its due march 1st and I'm in dire need of more eyeballs so I would greatly appreciate some input. If anyone wants to trade statements for me to review just let me know.
I expect to make a lot of changes so don't be afraid to tear me down.

My long-term professional goal is a career in natural language processing. This career will allow me to do what I find most fulfilling and satisfying in life; it will allow me to apply my analytical skills to solve complex real world problems. The &lt;school&gt; Computational Linguistics Master's program will ensure that I have the skills and experience required to achieve this goal.

My interest in linguistics derives from my love of solving puzzles. Picking apart and analyzing linguistic data to find patterns is like solving a verbal Rubik’s cube. A Rubik’s cube has over 432 quadrillion unique states, but any Rubik’s cube can be solved with an understanding of the patterns that govern its movement. Similarly, the complex surface variations of Language arise from simple underlying rules which can be deduced through careful analysis. I find it thoroughly satisfying to pick apart and explicitly describe these elegant linguistic processes that exist in my own unconscious mind. Through my undergraduate Linguistics courses I have learned how to think like a Linguist; how to analyze data, recognize patterns, and describe phenomena. I applied these skills in a syntax research project in which I provided arguments for the existence of null complementizers. Other projects of interest I completed include a description of Swedish phonology and a study of American dialect perceptions. My efforts have given me a broad and comprehensive understanding of Linguistics that will serve as a framework for my learning in Computational Linguistics.

My aptitude for solving analytical problems also precipitated my interest in Computer Science. Every assignment I was given during my programming classes presented me with a new puzzle to solve. After starting a project, I could not stop thinking about it until it was finished. It was not uncommon for me to wake up in the middle of the night with new ideas for optimizing my code. What I enjoyed most about my Computer Science courses was the sense of accomplishment I felt when my hard work resulted in a functioning application. I am now applying the skills I acquired in school to build ASP.NET web applications at my current internship with the tech company CodeSmart Inc. My ability to focus on implementing theoretical concepts into working programs will be crucial to my success in the &lt;school&gt; Master’s program.

So far my academic studies have only covered Linguistics and Computer Science separately, but I am most interested in the intersection of these two fields. In order to learn more about natural language processing, I recently began an internship with the developers of an iPhone application called Nuiku. The application acts as a virtual sales assistant, managing sales data through a natural language user interface. Helping to test the Nuiku natural language processing engine has opened my eyes to the immense potential Computational Linguistics has for practical applications. I am particularly interested in ways that natural language processing can improve search engines. Search engines serve as mediators between the user and all of the wealth of information on the internet. The large scale implementation of semantic categorization and information extraction will one day revolutionize the way we interact with information. This is one of the many ways in which natural language processing has the potential to empower users of the internet with better access to more useful information.

My long-term professional goal is a career in natural language processing. This career will allow me to do what I find most fulfilling and satisfying in life; it will allow me to apply my analytical skills to solve complex real world problems. The &lt;school&gt; Computational Linguistics Master's program will ensure that I have the skills and experience required to achieve this goal.
My interest in linguistics derives from my love of solving puzzles. Picking apart and analyzing linguistic data to find patterns is like solving a verbal Rubik’s cube. A Rubik’s cube has over 432 quadrillion unique states, but any Rubik’s cube can be solved with an understanding of the patterns that govern its movement. Similarly, the complex surface variations of Language arise from simple underlying rules which can be deduced through careful analysis. I find it thoroughly satisfying to pick apart and explicitly describe these elegant linguistic processes that exist in my own unconscious mind. Through my undergraduate Linguistics courses I have learned how to think like a Linguist; how to analyze data, recognize patterns, and describe phenomena. I applied these skills in a syntax research project in which I provided arguments for the existence of null complementizers. Other projects of interest I completed include a description of Swedish phonology and a study of American dialect perceptions. My efforts have given me a broad and comprehensive understanding of Linguistics that will serve as a framework for my learning in Computational Linguistics.
My aptitude for solving analytical problems also precipitated my interest in Computer Science. Every assignment I was given during my programming classes presented me with a new puzzle to solve. After starting a project, I could not stop thinking about it until it was finished. It was not uncommon for me to wake up in the middle of the night with new ideas for optimizing my code. What I enjoyed most about my Computer Science courses was the sense of accomplishment I felt when my hard work resulted in a functioning application. I am now applying the skills I acquired in school to build ASP.NET web applications at my current internship with the tech company CodeSmart Inc. My ability to focus on implementing theoretical concepts into working programs will be crucial to my success in the &lt;school&gt; Master’s program.
So far my academic studies have only covered Linguistics and Computer Science separately, but I am most interested in the intersection of these two fields. In order to learn more about natural language processing, I recently began an internship with the developers of an iPhone application called Nuiku. The application acts as a virtual sales assistant, managing sales data through a natural language user interface. Helping to test the Nuiku natural language processing engine has opened my eyes to the immense potential Computational Linguistics has for practical applications. I am particularly interested in ways that natural language processing can improve search engines. Search engines serve as mediators between the user and all of the wealth of information on the internet. The large scale implementation of semantic categorization and information extraction will one day revolutionize the way we interact with information. This is one of the many ways in which natural language processing has the potential to empower users of the internet with better access to more useful information. I am a firm believer that knowledge is power. It is my dream to apply my practical problem solving skills to empower the average person with better access to the wealth of knowledge on the internet.

18mw4g,1,2013-02-16,I feel it coming back,throwawayy3211,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/18mw4g/i_feel_it_coming_back/,"I've struggled with depression before. I grew up in a very strict cult-like religion and only left last year in April. Last December was the first time I celebrated my birthday, wished other people happy holidays and do things I haven't done before. Life felt pretty empty though. I was at a temporary internship for 6 months last year and being alone all day with nothing to do really beats you...It was as if I was aware of my existence 24/7 and I'd comment on the status of my life all the time.

Fast forward to the Fall semester and I feel so much better. I have classes to keep my busy and distracted from those stupid thoughts and I made new friends. I started going to the gym to lift and stuck to a program since June. Now I'm at another 6 month co op and two days ago I decided to confess to a friend of mine...found out she wasn't available because she's taken which I'm sure is a lie. Boy did it hurt and it still hurts. I regret saying anything because we had a pretty solid friendship.

Lifting can only keep me up for so long. I'm only going 3 days a week and giving it my all trying to improve myself but it's so easy for these shitty thoughts to come back. Sometimes I'll just sit and stare at my computer at work not knowing what to do because I just keep letting shitty things hurt me.

Anyways...just felt like I had to post this here. Can't say I have enough close friends to just dump all of this on."

18muvk,2,2013-02-16,Engineering: start-up or arbitrage in a hedge fund?,Laugarhraun,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/18muvk/engineering_startup_or_arbitrage_in_a_hedge_fund/,"Good morning,

I'm a French engineering student and I'll soon start working (in 1.5 months).The French cursus is a bit different than US ones. I have a strong background in math and in {electrical, electronic,energy,software} engineering.

I've had a bunch of interviews over the last weeks and I'm now at a crossroad: I have several propositions by startups (esp. working machine learning on recommendation engines), including full-time positions. I also have a few opportunities in finance, the most interesting being an internship in a hedge fund specialised in arbitrage on financial markets. This would include modelisation (using R and python) and conception of trading automatons, probably involving financial maths, machine learning and genetic algorithms.

I like maths and I love computer science.

Both companies would be around the same size at my arrival (~80 coworkers, but the hedge fund does not grow while it's the startup's goal).

Here is what makes me hesitate:

* should I take this 5-months internship when I'm offered full-time positions? (I'm not really in need of money right now though)
* what should I expect in terms of career &amp; wages evolution? In case of a full-time position (which should occur if my internship goes well), finance pays *a bit* better than software engineering the first years.
* finance → every day is suit day, startup → every day is pajamas day
* finance → 50 hours/week, no public holiday, startup → 40 hours/week
* if I do not enjoy working in finance I believe I'll be able to go back to a startup after any length of time. Is that right?

Did you have such a dilemma? What did you decide? What tips can you give me?

Thank you very much, and have a nice day!

18mndz,3,2013-02-16,What more do I need to do to get an internship?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/18mndz/what_more_do_i_need_to_do_to_get_an_internship/,"First, a little background: I am a sophomore at a very well-known but not necessarily engineering school, and I am enrolled in an ABET-certified Chemical Engineering program. I have a GPA above 3.50, I have taken all the right classes, I have computer programming skills, and I have research experience. 

And guess what? That's right: I still cannot get an internship. Right now my focus is on energy/oil and gas companies, but I've applied to pharmaceuticals, chemicals, defense, automotive, finance: you name it, I've probably applied. Most have been through Taleo-based career websites (oh, how I detest thee Taleo). To count, I've submitted over 25 resumes, most with slightly personalized cover letters (the oil and gas companies get one format, and the chemicals get another one). 

What else can I do? Is it just a numbers game, and right now I'm coming up short? Is it because I'm a sophomore? Is it because I'm not from a traditional engineering school? I understand that sometimes I just have to be lucky, but is there anything that I can actually do to stand out from the college crowd?"

""Hey XXX,

Hope things are going well. As interns we do not have access to ARMs so until Tom informed me I was unaware I was working 10 hours at MMO next week. I'm not sure when I'm needed or when you would like me to come in but this Saturday (2/16) I have a highly condensed schedule of errands that I would like to run in the morning and early afternoon. This lists includes getting a new license because my license is expired. I have an appointment for my car to get a front end alingmnet and to get my tires rotated. I also need to run to the bank, and go to the JCU bookstore and take back some items from Christmas! As an intern (and more so as an employee of a Public Accounting Firm) it is extremely difficult to find the time to get errands like these done because we often work til 7:00 or 8:00 pm or even later. At 7 or 8 pm nothing is open and I cannot run to the bank, the license bureau, the JCU bookstore, or my mechanic. We do have days off on Sundays but on Sundays these places are simply not open. During busy season with our lives so focused on work it is a struggle to get things done outside of work. This is why I am asking not to work this Saturday (2/16). I have made these plans and appointments to do these things this Saturday before I new I had to work with MMO this week. I apologize for the length of the email but in its entirety I believe you can sympathize with me and understand my pressing need to get these things done. Hopefully you'll understand. I can speak with Matt Fifolt, manager at Jones Day, and ask him if I could go to MMO one day during the week next week. I'm sure it wouldnt be a problem. In closing, if you desperately need me to work on Saturday no need to fret I will come in and work but if at all possible I am asking to not come in that day because of the short notice of me working at MMO and me alreadly scheduling things to do on that day. Let me know what you guys decide. Oh, and tell the team I said Happy Valentines Day!

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[What's your favorite meteor/meteorite occurrence in history that you find fascinating?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frxbm?context=5)|Ever heard of Antoine de Saint-Exupery, the man who wrote The Little Prince? In the '20s and '30s he was a French Aeropostale (air mail) pilot, flying wood-and-fabric airplanes to deliver the mail to far-flung corners of the world. He was once forced down on a small, high plateau in Africa by mechanical troubles. Stranded, he walked around the plateau. He noticed that the plateau was too tall to ever have been visited before, and that it was composed entirely of light-colored rocks. There in the moonlight, he found an odd, dark rock that had no place there. Saint-Exupery identified the rock as a meteorite, as the only way it arrived was from the canvas of stars above, ""just as a blanket spread under an apple tree receives only apples"". He went on to find three meteorites there in the darkness, and to identify them as such back in the 30's was quite the intellectual accomplishment.
[What is your favorite mind boggling scientific fact?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frtu1?context=5)|Stretch your arms all the way out, and let's imagine that the distance from one fingertip, across your body, and out to the other fingertip represents 4.5 billion years. That's the age of most meteorites. Now, take a nail file and make a single swipe across the fingernail on your middle finger. If the distance across your outstretched arms is 4.5 billion years, then with that nail file swipe you just erased ALL of recorded human history. But your average meteorite has been around for the entire outstretched-arms distance - for 4.5 billion years!
[About how often do meteors of about the same size as the one from today enter our atmosphere?  If Superman was out there patrolling the skies this morning, would he have been able to spot the incoming meteor in time to do something about it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frn5n?context=5)|Meteoroids (that is, a body smaller than as asteroid) of this size strike the Earth's atmosphere about once a decade or so. As for Superman, it would depend on how closely he was paying attention! I suspect that he would be watching out for us if he saw it coming.
[Where the Mayans off by 2 months or what?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frspp?context=5)|Heheheh  Meteors like today's must have occurred during Mayan times as well. You have to wonder what they must have thought about such events.
[How do scientists go about tracking meteors? How do some meteors pass through undetected? (Like the one in Russia\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frpjc?context=5)|Meteoroids and asteroids are tracked using optical telescopes and sometimes by radar, although scanning the entire sky with a radar wouldn't work to detect everything out there - the sky is just too big. Some meteoroids get by because they're too small and/or dark to be seen by optical telescopes.
[Too dark? Could you expand on that please? And does the 'and/or' mean that we could  have a massive but dark one which would still get past our monitoring?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fss0g?context=5)|Yes, too dark as in, the surface is nonreflective and black.  Like coal! Many asteroids contain a significant amount of carbon, and so they can be very dark to look at. Trying to find these ones against the black night sky is a challenge.  So with the and/or, I was trying to say that some are too small to spot until they get very close to us, and others are too dark to pick out against the night sky. And then some are both dark and small.
[How common is it for meteorites to contain radioactive or otherwise harmful material?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frua4?context=5)|Asteroids, meteoroids, and meteorites (rocks that actually reach the ground) are NOT radioactive. On Earth, rocks usually are radioactive if they are part of a radioactive element's ore. That requires the movement of a lot of hot water in the Earth's crust, and that process does not happen on asteroids. Meteorites are safe to handle.
[What dangers does a meteor of this size pose? Is this a rare event?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frple?context=5)|This event has done all the damage its going to do. It was too small to reach the ground without breaking up in the atmosphere, so it didn't create an explosion crater on the ground like that seen in Meteor Crater, Arizona. The damage in this event was caused by what is basically a powerful sonic boom, as the very fast meteoroid struck the Earth's atmosphere like a rifle bullet fired into a swimming pool.
[This is truly your day to shine!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frt9w?context=5)|Thank you! I like to see it as a great day for the average person to come in contact with planetary science. It's a wonderful research field.
[How big must a meteorite be to destroy say, an average house?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frt9w?context=5)|To destroy a house, a meteoroid would have to be even bigger than the event today in Russia. It would have to be large enough to reach the ground without slowing down to an aerodynamically-limited speed, and to strike the ground and cause a crater. With that said, falling meteorites can still cause damage. Look up the Lorton, VA meteorite fall from a few years back - a ~fist-sized meteorite plunged through the roof of a doctor's office, which was luckily unoccupied at the time.
[How big of a bomb would Bruce Willis have needed to blow up that metor?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frvcn?context=5)|Hm.  That's a tough one. Scientists are divided as to the best course to take to eliminate dangerous asteroids, and blowing them up may not be the best action. If we were to blow one up, however, I would approximate that your average non-thermonuclear warhead (tens of kilotons TNT yield) would be enough to completely disrupt the body from today's event. Bear in mind that that is a VERY rough guess, though!
[Did we have any advance notice that the asteroid/meteor that hit Russia was coming? -I also heard that the one flying by is worth $195 billion, is the one that hit Russia (or whats left of it\) worth anything near that amount you think? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frt62?context=5)|No we did not. This meteoroid, for as much damage as it did on the ground, was too small and/or too dark to be seen before it hit the atmosphere.
[Suppose that we have spotted a meteorite, that will inevitably collide with Earth in, let's say, a decade. It has a very high density so it's hard to destroy, it has a diametre of about 7 miles. In what way would it be possible to prevent the extinction of mankind? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frx3m?context=5)|The best option, if we had all options available, would be to have thriving human civilizations on multiple planets and moons. That way, even if some doom-rock of an asteroid were to cause a mass extinction, humanity would carry on. Bear in mind that this HAS happened on Earth before - notice that there aren't any dinosaurs roaming your neighborhood at the moment (other than birds, but that's another story).
[What is the largest misconception the public has about meteors, meteorites, or asteroids? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frwky?context=5)|Hm. Pick your favorite - that they're radioactive, flaming hot, show up unannounced on your lawn overnight, or bring hazardous bacteria to our planet. None of these things are true.
[But are used to make magical swords right?   ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fteui?context=5)|Heheh  There actually are daggers made out of meteorite metal, to include at least one in the Smithsonian's collection. To the best of my knowledge they don't glow when orcs are near, however.
[Any word yet on what type it is?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frlad?context=5)|I've seen pictures of a hole in an icy lake that seems to have been caused by a falling meteorite. The description in that article says there are small, dark stones 0.5 to 1 cm in size among the icy debris. That hints to me that this was a chondrite - a type of meteorite composed of stone and small bits of metal. We won't know exactly what kind until the fragments are examined by an expert.
[Wiki said meteorites are most likely to impact at 45 degrees. Why is that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frw2a?context=5)|Beats me.  Very few to none are going to strike perpendicular to the atmosphere, so I doubt the average is 45 degrees. Sounds like a mistake to me.
[Thank you so much for doing this! I keep hearing rumblings about the meteor that is going to passing over today closer than some of our satellites, but I haven't read anything recently about when it may be passing back around potentially even closer. Do we have anything to worry about?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frly6?context=5)|You're welcome! And no, we have nothing to worry about. The asteroid 2012 DA14 will pass very close to the Earth today, but scientists have been watching it for many months now and are confident that it will miss our planet. On the other hand, we get a close look at this interesting asteroid without having to pay for a space mission!
[So... do the exhibits come to life at night?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frrm9?context=5)|Only when I'm not watching, apparently.
[I have nothing to contribute other than I hope your nickname is ""Big"" and your middle name is ""And"".  So you would be 'Big' Marc and Fries.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fy592?context=5)|Two of the scientists I cross paths with regularly are named Burger and French. I'm dying to write a paper - ANY paper - with them just so that we'll have the French, Fries, and Burger paper. A Happy Meal of Science!!  whee.
[What is the smallest meteorite we are able to detect from space? What technology exists to stop meteors?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frwy4?context=5)|The smallest meteoroid? (A meteoroid is a small rock flying through space, and a meteorite is one that reaches the Earth's surface) I'm afraid I don't know exactly, but it will be about the size of the parent asteroid of Almahatta Sitta (AS). AS is a meteorite recovered from Sudan that was detected in space before it fell to Earth, so we knew when and where it was going to fall. It managed to get pretty close to Earth before it was seen, so that's probably the lower size limit for detection.
 |As for stopping them? We currently have NO defense against asteroids. If one were spotted on a collision course with Earth, we could make preparations on the ground but there is no real plan in place right now for dealing with it before it strikes our planet. My humble suggestion is to fix that little discrepancy...
[How did you become an expert in meteors and meteorites?   When did you first become interested in the field?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frwmt?context=5)|I still have a lot to learn, and I'll be working to correct that until I'm too feeble to pick up a book. But I was first interested very late into getting a Ph.D. in materials science. A friend of mine brought a funny rock into the laboratory and asked me to collect some spectra on it. He told me it was a meteorite and I tried to kick him out of the lab because I thought he was pulling my leg - only museums have meteorites, after all! Turns out I was wrong on both counts. It WAS a meteorite called Portales Valley, and meteorites are actually very easy to come by, and are wonderful in the sense that they are ancient relicts of the formation of our Solar System that you can actually hold in your hand. I examined the meteorite for him and was spellbound by this incredible rock, which was unlike anything I'd ever seen. I was hooked, and have been studying them ever since.
[Why do meteors explode? Aren't they just large pieces of space rock that is heated up when entering the atmosphere?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frwyu?context=5)|They explode because they strike the atmosphere at very high velocity. Meteoroids are moving between ~10 and 80, even 100 km/s when they hit the top of the Earth's atmosphere. At those speeds, meeting the atmosphere is a pretty brutal event. It's like doing a belly flop into a swimming pool - sure, the water is nice and liquid and squishy, but if you hit it hard and slow down quickly, it's gonna hurt!  In a meteoroid's case, that belly flop into the atmosphere occurs at speeds high enough to turn solid rock into a superheated gas, and quickly enough to slow down from 10s of kilometers per second to tens of meters per second, all in only a few seconds' worth of blazing fireball.
[How often do people come to you with chunks of things like hematite or other oddly shaped mineral deposits and ask you if they are from space?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frp8f?context=5)|All the time! I enjoy it, actually. Most rocks that people bring to me are not meteorites, but I'm happy to show them what a real meteorite looks like and offer advice on how to find them.
[What are the chances of a meteorite smashing and destroying the earth?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fru0e?context=5)|The chances of physically destroying the Earth are vanishingly small. About 4 billion years ago, the Earth was struck by an approximately Mars-sized body and the resulting collision produced our Moon. Even then the Earth survived, and today there are no large bodies in irregular orbits that could reproduce that event. But if you mean an asteroid large enough to cause extinctions, the chances are very small. ...but not zero. Bear in mind this exact thing happened 65 million years ago with the Chixulub impact which played a major role in wiping out the dinosaurs.
[How would you compare the asteroid that hit Russia and the one that's going to miss the earth by about 15,000 miles?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frwqz?context=5)|We saw one coming, and missed the other entirely!  :-)
 |Seriously, we'll know more about both when we A) get pieces of the Russian meteorite into a laboratory, and B) get a good look at the near-miss asteroid later today.
[Where can one keep updated on such things? Normally this sort of thing is all over the internet/news for a day or 2 then seems to disappear! I find it fascinating too, and would love to know more about it after testing. Very jealous of your job, keep up the good work!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fstzh?context=5)|For meteors in the United States, I suggest the American Meteor Society's web page: amsmeteors.com.
 |There are websites for the various astronomy organizations who are watching for Earth-crossing asteroids as well, but I'm afraid I don't know them off-hand. A web search will get you there, though. Search for ""near Earth objects"" or something along those lines.
[Is the Russia meteor the same one the news said was going to pass between the moon and earth?  or something completely different? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frvxq?context=5)|We don't know yet.  The best way to find out will be to compare the trajectories of the two bodies and see if they are similar. At this point, we don't know enough about the trajectory of the Russian bolide. (A bolide is a very bright meteor that includes a detonation event)
[How does the angle at which a meteor strikes the earth affect its destructive force? For example, had this meteor entered our atmosphere at a shallower angle could it have exploded with more force like the one over Siberia a century ago? Or if it had come straight in, would it have struck harder, therefore resulting in a bigger blast on the ground?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fs2vt?context=5)|Ah, physics!  We love physics. The infall angle is one of the factors in destructive force. An asteroid plunging straight into the atmosphere MIGHT have a better chance of reaching the ground than one that enters at a glancing angle, but it depends strongly on the velocity, mass, and mechanical strength of the asteroid. The meteoroid that struck today would not have reached the ground in any event; it was too small.
 |With that said, some of the PIECES of today's Russian event probably reached the ground, but only as free-falling rocks and not screamingly-fast cosmic bullets.
[What about this particular meteroite was so different when it made the news? If they happen every ten years or so, why is it such a huge ordeal? The media plays it up to seem as if this is a once in a lifetime thing. But I don't recall anything ten or so years ago about a meteorite like this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fsbjb?context=5)|In a word, it was BIG. That, and people got hurt. Take your average everyday event and find a version of it where people have to visit the hospital, and you've probably got a news item.  And there have been several very large events like this over the past few decades. Another very large one was several years ago over Indonesia (and mostly over water). It didn't make YouTube, so it was overlooked. There was another one over India/Pakistan a while back during a particularly tense period in their relationship, but that was over a rather remote area if I recall correctly.
[(Also, unrelated, but I'm starting an internship with the Smithsonian in a couple weeks, what are some fun things to do in the DC area?\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fsbjb?context=5)|As for DC - go ride the Metro and watch the people. It is a train ride, an underground excursion, and a circus all in one.
[Due to this unexpected event in Russia, myself and several others I'm sure, are curious as to how safe we really are from space? And what precautions are being taken to ensure all dangerous space projectiles are spotted and accounted for?  Have there been any instances where rare Earth metals have crashed and been recovered for use here?  How large of an asteroid would it take to guarantee all life intelligent on Earth be destroyed?  Has your knowledge in this particular field ever had you wondering how we haven't been blown to kingdom come yet?  What's the most bizarre thing you've encountered in your line of work?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fs49j?context=5)|Oh boy...  I'd love to answer all of these but there are a lot of unanswered questions I'd like to get to. Let's see... I've answered the first one already, so I'll answer the second one here. There are no ""new"" elements in meteorites, in the sense that there's nothing in there that we haven't seen on Earth already. That makes sense, because fundamentally the Earth and asteroids were all originally assembled from the same cloud of dust that gas that swirled around our Sun some 4.5+ billion years ago. There are a few unusual new minerals in meteorites, however, and that's a consequence of their formation under chemical conditions that are unlikely on Earth. They were then protected from wind and rain by ...well, the fact that there are neither wind nor rain on asteroids! Kinda convenient, that.
[Are you trackin, gang? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frsw1?context=5)|Papa Whiskey, what's your position?
[It was reported that the meteorite today exploded while it was still in the air. Why did it not crash into earth as one, flaming ball? If I heard right it created a sonic boom when it exploded.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frxh3?context=5)|It lost the battle between mass and air pressure. The air pressure it experienced upon striking the atmosphere started breaking it up, and it wasn't massive enough to shrug off the damage and plunge into the ground. So it broke up between ~50 and ~20 km above the ground. If it were larger, it might have survived the trip to the ground and formed an explosion crater. As it is, the damage it could cause was pre-programmed into it by its size.
[Did the whole meteor break up into smaller pieces during entry? Or was there a larger piece that impacted?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fryus?context=5)|Most of the meteoroid was destroyed - the bright part of the fireball was basically the process of turning stone into gas. But some of it - a small fraction of the original mass - almost certainly survived to reach the ground as meteorites.
[Is global warming responsible for the Russian meteor incident?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frseg?context=5)|Nope.  The two are completely unrelated.
[How is the search conducted to find the bits that fell to earth (falls\)?  Follow-up: If I find one, do I get to keep/sell it or am I supposed to turn it in somewhere?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fs2j0?context=5)|The science/art of finding meteorites includes assembling eyewitness accounts, some trigonometry-heavy analysis of videos and pictures to re-create the path of the body, and some physics-based calculations of the expected flight paths of falling meteorites. Or, you get lucky and someone saw where they landed! As for keeping them, that depends on the law of the land where you found the thing. Some US agencies like the BLM are forward-thinking enough to have policies in place on what you can keep for yourself. Some countries, by contrast, have very restrictive policies and as a result the meteorites in those countries tend to rot into the ground, lost to science forever.
[What sized near-Earth asteroids/meteoroids is it currently possible to track with the systems nowadays in place? It seems this Chelyabinsk event caught everyone by surprise and wasn't on anyone's proverbial or literal radar...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frz4m?context=5)|The best tool in use is the optical telescope. We have radars, but there's simply too much space out there to effectively scan it all, given current equipment and funding. Many amateur astronomers contribute to this effort.
[Can you hooked me up with an internship on the anthro side?  Serious question: What is the most interesting thing to you that has been found/learned from meteorites.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frzbi?context=5)|The most interesting thing is basically that our Solar System is composed of many bodies, all orbiting the Sun and still running into each other even today. Before a few prominent meteorite falls a few centuries ago, this fact that we take for granted today was not commonly accepted. In ancient times, meteorites were explained as rocks ejected by distant volcanoes or ejected from caves! I'm glad we got that straightened out.
[If a large meteor impact was immenent, could we actually do anything about it?  Would we blow it to tiny pieces, or somehow split it into 2 large pieces whose trajectory would miss the earth.  If a dinosaur-extincting size meteor was on the way, could the government somehow keep it secret and only the privileged get into the shelters?  Or is it easy enough to spot these meteors such that your local university would see it and spill the beans?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fs7zm?context=5)|There are a variety of plans floated about for dealing with dangerous asteroids...  Blowing them to fragments is certainly an option, although there's some discussion as to just how possible and/or preferable that option is. (As a former Marine myself, I REALLY like the idea! hehe) Other plans include painting one or more sides of it and letting sunlight push it away from us. That sounds insane, but it really is an option - physics gives it a thumbs-up. There's also the option of putting some sort of engine on the thing and thrusting it away from us. The thing is, NONE of these options are currently available. All current nuclear-tipped missiles on Earth are designed to go from one spot on the planet directly to another, and don't even make it to Earth orbit much less a distant asteroid. The only plan we currently have available is to make disaster-preparation plans on Earth.  As for keeping it quiet, personally I think the notion of conspiracy is to antithetical to human nature to work well. People love to blab. But that's a discussion for another venue.
[How long until we start collecting raw materials from space?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fshn8?context=5)|The planet already is, in a sense. Some 40,000 tons (give or take) of meteorites fall to Earth every year. As for mining asteroids and such, that is a VERY difficult endeavor and I'm skeptical that it will be practical any time soon. But we should start NOW, or we never will.
[Why do these objects ""explode"" at a certain altitude, rather than slowly burning up little by little to nothing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fs1xu?context=5)|It lost the battle between mass and air pressure. The air pressure it experienced upon striking the atmosphere started breaking it up, and it wasn't massive enough to shrug off the damage and plunge into the ground. So it broke up between ~50 and ~20 km above the ground. If it were larger, it might have survived the trip to the ground and formed an explosion crater. As it is, the damage it could cause was pre-programmed into it by its size. (sorry for the cut and paste...!)
[Does the phrase ""meteoric rise"" when used to describe someone who has obtained some sort of fame frost your cookies?  \[it does mine.\]  They actually fall from the sky burning in flames if I remember correctly.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fs56m?context=5)|I'm convinced that the English language was invented pretty much to befuddle anyone who didn't grow up with it. But then, I suppose one could have a ""meteoric FALL"", too, which is a pretty dramatic descriptor.
[I'm a geology major and I want to go into planetary geology. Do you have any suggestions or tips for me?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fshhv?context=5)|Talk to lots of people.  LOTS of people - professors, other students, scientists, grad students. More than you think you need to. Ask anything and everything you can think of - they'll either help you, or you didn't really want their advice anyways because they suck. Research the schools that do the sorts of things that interest you, and talk to people there. Form a plan, but be willing to change it as you go. Try lots to things in order to figure out what you love to do, and then do that.
[How different do meteorites tend to be in composition from one to another?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fsm32?context=5)|Great question! There are iron meteorites, which are formed when molten iron-nickel coalesced into the infernal core of a larger body, then that body was broken up to scatter its iron heart through the cosmos. (I've been writing for a few hours now and I'm waxing poetic!) Then there are ""stony"" meteorites composed mostly of silicates, either from small bodies that never got hot enough to form a liquid, metallic core, or from the metal-depleted surfaces of those bodies. Then there's the carbonaceous meteorites, which contain - you guessed it - a large amount of carbonaceous material. That's the simple version. There are dozens of types of meteorites, from asteroids, comets (maybe) and even other planets. There are some whose origins are still mysteries, as well.
[Hi, thanks for doing an AMA.  One question:  How big do you think the meteorite that just hit Russia was before it hit our atmosphere? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fsjfs?context=5)|My pleasure! I've heard numbers from 10 to 50 tons pre-atmosphere, but we don't have enough info in hand to really tell yet. My estimate lies towards the top end of that range, but we need to know what kind of meteorite it is and how much power the fireball generated.
[Why do they always fall in Russia? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fsipd?context=5)|GREAT QUESTION. They have some sort of national meteorite greed over there! Seriously, there were four meteorite falls in the US last year. Two in California, one in Nevada, and one in Alabama. Meteorites were recovered from all of these events.
[I've heard that the event in Russia has nothing to do with the huge meteor that's passing by us... how can that be true? It seems like a big coincidence. Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fsa9f?context=5)|&lt;snip from above&gt; Dunno (if they're related) yet, and I wish I knew! We will be able to answer that question when we know the trajectory of the Russian object, and can compare it against the trajectory of the near-miss asteroid. I understand that Phil Plait of Bad Astronomy was hinting that the two events are unrelated, and so was the NASA Space Environment Office. But I retain a healthy degree of uncertainty at this point. :-) &lt;snip&gt;
[What made you interested in meteors/ meteorites?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fsko2?context=5)|Had a buddy bring one into the lab one day, when I was finishing up my degree (of course! bad timing). After I stopped trying to throw him out of the lab because I thought he was pulling my leg, I was fascinated by the Portales Valley meteorite he had and was hooked on meteorite research. I then served as a post-doctoral student at the Carnegie Institution of Washington. The Carnegie is a wonderfully permissive laboratory where research is involved, allowing and encouraging the scientists to follow their interests. I was able to start studying meteorites in earnest, and have been doing it ever since.
[If there was a huge meteorite hurtling towards earth that would cause significant damage to society or completely wipe out civilization, would astronomers tell us ahead of time? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fs9ga?context=5)|Would the astronomers? Oh you bet they would. That's the whole reason they are looking!
[Whats your favourite meteorite? For example I'm an amateur collector and I have a soft spot for Allende , I have a small slice and its just fascinating in terms of its age and composition.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fs7u7?context=5)|My favorite meteorite is the one I most recently handled.  I'm simple.  :-)
[I've heard that when a meteor/asteroid explodes in the air it does more damage. Why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fsln4?context=5)|Not necessarily. Impact craters like Meteor Crater in Arizona require an object to hit the ground, making a big hole and flinging debris over a large area. If the same amount of energy were dissipated into the atmosphere by an airburst, you'd still get tremendous damage but no hole in the ground. There are a few cases where this apparently happened and left great quantities of molten glass, called tektites. But both types of events are very destructive in their own way.
[About how many joules of energy does a meteorite coming into the Earth's atmosphere produce?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fsf6p?context=5)|Depends on the mass and velocity of the meteoroid. The vast majority of meteors are caused by tiny (sand-grain sized), fast-moving (30+ km/s) little fragments, and many of those aren't even powerful enough to be seen with the naked eye.
[What kind of utility vehicle do you prefer for meteorite collecting?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fsns7?context=5)|My 1980 turbo diesel International Harvester Scout II.  :-)  wheee.
[What are the chances that the meteor that exploded over Russia yesterday was a fragment or a tag-along of the asteroid that's zooming past the Earth today?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fs3g6?context=5)|Dunno yet, and I wish I knew! We will be able to answer that question when we know the trajectory of the Russian object, and can compare it against the trajectory of the near-miss asteroid. I understand that Phil Plait of Bad Astronomy was hinting that the two events are unrelated, and so was the NASA Space Environment Office. But I retain a healthy degree of uncertainty at this point.  :-)
[Dr. Fries, how big do you think the meteorite was originally before it hit the atmosphere size wise?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fsfr8?context=5)|I've heard estimates ranging from 10 to 50 tons before it struck the atmosphere, and I think that's a reasonable range. I'm inclined to believe a number towards the upper end of that range. We won't know for certain until we find out what kind of meteorite it is composed of (by finding pieces) and by measuring the total power of the meteor (e.g. from seismometers, the same as measuring the Richter scale number of an earthquake).
[He shouldn't take his job for granite.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frve2?context=5)|Heheheh.

[Greetings! I am online and happy to take your questions at this point.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frq83?context=5)|I just received an email from a prominent meteor expert who estimates the energy output of this bolide at greater than 100 ktons of TNT, which makes it the most powerful meteor since the Tunguska event in 1908! His estimates also state that the pre-atmospheric size of the meteoroid was roughly 15m in diameter. Compare that to 2012 DA14 passing by the Earth later today, which is twice that diameter! Now imagine what would happen if THAT one were to strike us...
[The 'darkness' of a rock out in space is called its albedo, which tells you how much light it reflects. It if has a really low albedo, it means the surface material doesn't reflect much of the sun's light, so it's difficult to see out in space. I'm assuming that's what DrMarcFries is referring to. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fyegx?context=5)|Bingo.
[Curious if the video coming in from so many different sources can help you with data analysis--like angle of descent, speed, other variables that might be quantitative in nature or if it's helpful 'qualitatively' speaking. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fs0ms?context=5)|Yes! Basically, once you measure the angles in the pictures and videos and locate the spot where the pics were taken, it is a matter of trigonometry. You re-assemble the 3D path of the meteor from the various images. From there, you will get an idea of where any meteorites landed.  Yay, science!

Some technologies I've worked with:

* Ruby / Rails
* Mongoid
* Test driven development with Rspec / Capybara / FactoryGirl

AMA,jzzsxm,IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18m9yh/iama_museum_exhibit_designerengineerbuilder_ever/,"Proof:  http://imgur.com/a/7say8 - one of those pictures shows me on my phone (AlienBlue) on the job so you know I'm a Redditor :)  

Some background - 

I started right when I got out of college.    I have a BS in Mechanical Engineering and got the job because the CEO and I went to the same college AND because I busted my butt during a 1 month internship.

We build whatever places/museums asked us to build.  All the wiring/programming is custom and in-house.  Everything we build is done in-house.  Most/all of the design is done in house.  We've built things for the Boston Museum of Science, the Spy Museum in Washington DC, the Smithsonian, Blue Man Group, and a whole host of other clients.

I've posted several of my projects to Reddit before and people seemed to enjoy them.  I've also received several requests for an IAMA and I'll be sitting at an airport for the next 3.5 hours so here we go.  I'll also probably spring for the in-flight wifi so have at!

Here are some of my past reddit submissions:
[For the Boston Museum of Science](http://www.reddit.com/r/cableporn/comments/1892o1/overhauled_a_museum_interactive/)

[For a mall in NY](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/154ne9/im_building_an_interactive_tomb_for_a_mall_in/)

[For a museum in Springfield, MA](http://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/141b32/my_minigolf_booth_was_well_received_thought_you/)

[Another for Springfield, MA](http://www.reddit.com/r/somethingimade/comments/y2wob/i_built_a_giant_game_of_life_spinner_now_with/)

[For a tradeshow](http://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/13zasd/a_made_a_miniminigolf_course_for_a_tradeshow_i/)

Also, if you've seen [MathAlive!](http://www.mathalive.com), a travelling math exhibit, we built that too.  That was a big one.

Ask me anything - museums, exhibits, design, or even just making random things (which I do a lot)"

O. Ma. GAWD. This server is so awesome it made me change my schedule so the server I had originally planned for today is now tommorrow. So yeah, InvisionCraft is yet another survival server, but what makes this server special, you ask? Well, a lot. The admins and players are as you expect them to be, but the gameplay and builds are just fantastic. Ok, let's start off with the community. They're respectful people who follow the rules seamlessly. This is the exact community I'm looking for, mature people who just want to make the experience all the more enjoyable. Admins are great, they are nice and the rules they set out are fantastic. Alright, gameplay. Holy fuck, is it good (please excuse my language! D:). I feel this server would be lost without all the plugins this server has. It really gives a rich feel to the SMP experience without taking too much away from the vanilla Minecraft. And lastly, the builds. This server is in what they call ""Generation IV"" which in a nutshell means this is their 4th world. The spawn is wonderfully built and the information of the server gives you everything you need to know from the server's history right through to website links. So yeah, please go on this server, you won't regret it. I talked with one of the admins, staticpast, and asked him some questions!

**Q:** What made you become an admin?

**staticpast: I've been apart of the InvisionCraft family, a year this month. Upon reflection, to my days as a player. I had one thing in mind. Helping out players. I decided to apply for a staff internship, which of course as a result of a lot of dedication, loyalty and commitment led to where I am today. Something I did not expect.**

**Q:** Have the players on this server been to your liking?

**staticpast: Of course, and why rightly so? Everyone is welcome within the InvisionCraft community. Over the course of four generations - spanning since the 2nd June, 2011. InvisionCraft has come to be known by its noticeable sense of community, our friendly atmosphere. Our arms are open to all.**

**Q**: Do you think being Server of the Day could help you gain more players?

**staticpast: Hopefully, so. Any source of advertisement is good! Thank you for this opportunity.**

**Q:** Final question; will Server of the Day be a big achievement for you?

**staticpast: Definitely so, I can not say that we've ever been featured as a server of the day before. There's a first for everything!**

In the next few months I will finish a Bachelor's degree in software engineering and want to try to find an entry level java or sql programming position with my ultimate end goal as being a database administrator. I figured my best chance at being a DBA was to become a developer first and then make the move over. 

To get the current position I have, I had to do an internship in order to get experience. Now, I am older and don't have the ability to an internship due to finances. Will I be able to land a job as an entry level developer somewhere? Or will I have to have an extensive profile of work on somewhere like github? Any advice is appreciated.

TL;DR - Possible to become a developer from IT Support position with no internship/experience?"

I'm already a senior and I'm 24 years old with no experience and now I've been applying to Marketing internships. The only experience I really have is the business classes I have taken in community college. 

When I graduate with a Sociology degree, will I be able to get a Marketing job or even an internship? I feel like it is too late for me to transfer to another 4 year college since I am 24 and a senior.

And we don't see the intern at first. We just see him put his hand out and say night to meet you Mr. Stark. Tony then says something awesome and follows it up with, ""You father interned here under my father right?"" And the intern, nervous because he is meeting the legendary Tony Stark bumbles out a yes. Tony says that's cool and to have Pepper show him around. He then walks away and asks what the interns name is. The camera then zooms in on Andrew Garfield and he says, ""Peter Parker, sir."""

Freshman year, living in London. How amazing!- but they planned on only accepted 10 freshman out of my about 10,000 person class. But I made it. They accepted me. And now I wish they hadnt.

Heres why I am so blessed:
-I'm only 19, born and raised in small-town NY, and now I'm living in London, England until June 2013.
-Through my dad (in the military), I've been able to get this funding for this schooling tuition.
-I have three beautiful (american) flatmates who i've bonded with faster than I have with anyone else.
-Classes are only once a week. Meaning I spend only one or two hours in class (never before 11 am), four days a week, and have almost no homework.
-I have plenty of time to play sports and work out and get good grades because I dont need to work.
-I have an iPad, with a texting app, so I can talk to my friends and family whenver.
-I have savings money to cover my transportation, food, schooling, ect expences, and STILL have enough left to be able to go out, buy clothes, and make unnecessary purchases.
-I'm only a freshman, so on top of having a fucking great resume, I'll be able to go abroad/ do internships mutiple times because ill  have the time.

Reasons why I'm a little shit:
-I'd give it all up to just be back at my homeschool to finish my freshman year, because I miss a boy, who I dont even know if he wants a relationship with me when I'm home.

I'm worried Ill look back on this trip and regret it, because I spent so much time thinking about someone from home.

First fucking world problems, right?

I just wish I could be more thankful. I realized i am so blessed, but I feel so guilty. There are so many people who are denied this opportunity, I wish I could give it to them. I can't wait for June."

-Developing test systems to simulate vehicles
-Developing documents for control
-Developing point to point tests
-Reverse engineer PCB's
-Feasibility studies

Etc.

The other job (#2), is unpaid, but I'd basically be getting directly involved with the design process for a fairly large and successful guitar-effects-pedal-company who builds analog guitar pedals (and also they have a couple pedals which are based around atmega chips for looping and whatnot that they said I could get involved with if I wanted). Basically my dream job, however it's unpaid and I'd be living away from home so I'd have extra expenses.

The first job actually sounds very good, and I think perhaps the problem is I'm not exactly sure what an internship should be. #1 seems like it'd be a better overall ""job-like-experience"", #2 seems a bit more unorthodox and I'm worried that while I might get a lot of analog design experience, and possibly a job at the company, that if it doesn't work out I might be left without some of the boring, but necessary ""job experience"" that future employers might prefer seeing from #1.

My name is Logan Healy, and I am a sophomore at the Davenport University. I have friends and family living in the Austin, and am seeking an internship opportunity in the area for this summer. 

Over the past few years, I have challenged myself academically and have received a 3.68 GPA at the collegiate level, including several courses pertaining to computer networking. While taking classes to obtain a bachelor’s degree in computer networking, I entered a computer networking internship to better my understanding of the field. To further complement these educational attainments, I am seeking an enriching, hands-on experience in an information technology working environment as an intern this summer. I know that an internship role at *place company name here* would be an ideal setting for me to thrive, and I am confident that I could add value to *place company name here*, as well. With the experience from my current internship, I have learned excellent customer service, troubleshooting skills, and plenty of networking based knowledge. Over the phone support has been a great way to better my skills as an IT support specialist. The specific dates I would be available for an internship are from May 7, to September 1st. These dates can be adjusted, if needed.

As you will see from my enclosed resume, I have also completed Kent Career Tech Center with a 4.0 GPA. In this we focused on computer networking basics, visual basic programming, Sony Vegas video editing, and computer mechanics. 

Please consider this cover letter and resume as my application for an internship at *place company name here*.I would welcome an interview opportunity and will willingly provide any additional information you might require. Thank you in advance for your consideration of my application. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

I graduated from college in May 2012 and moved across the country for a job in marketing. I do social media marketing at a boutique firm that larger brands hire out to run their campaigns. For the most part I really like it, but some structural changes at my office have left me feeling very insecure about where I stand in the company.

I started out as an intern and then was hired on full time. My position wasn't spelled out explicitly, but we're a tiny company and everyone does everything so I wasn't too worried about it. Then we acquired two new people above me and instead of moving up to manage my own campaigns  I was kind of thrust back down into an intern/office manager type roll. I do a little bit of everything for everyone and again. For the most part I like it but when I'm given a series of little assignments that I can't relate to the larger picture of the campaign it's for, things get a little confusing.

I've made a few mistakes. Nothing has gone horribly wrong, but a few things have been over looked or have slipped through my fingers. I'm a bit of a perfectionist and I'm smart and I feel like I'm above the slip-ups I've made. Part of me is frustrated with the directions given to me, and the other part recognizes that I need to take responsibility and work harder. 

Not to mention when I do own up to my mistakes (because I'm not a child and I feel like things should be adressed head-on, why shift blame?) people I work with get a little condescending/act like my boss when they're not. It makes me want to scream ""you were new once too you arrogant prick. I do great work every day, have you forgotten all of that?"". I'm afraid I'm only remembered by my last mistake. 

I also work for pennies. I want to ask for a pay raise next month but I'm horrible at stuff like that. I guess I'm just uncomfortable all the time and I don't know where I'm going or if I should be doing things differently from where I am. I don't want to stay in this job forever, but I don't know how to move forward. 

I'm stuck and I am completely frustrated. I'm sick of making mistakes that are below me and I want to move forward but don't know how or where to go. This is a tricky one, Reddit, got any advice for me?

18pdjv,20,2013-02-17,Are high bonus programs + low starting salary jobs a good option? ,The_Wowee,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/18pdjv/are_high_bonus_programs_low_starting_salary_jobs/,"I have received my first job offer as a Mechanical Design Engineer, but I am thinking the offer is kind of risky. Does anyone here work for a company that has a high bonus program, but a lower starting salary? What made you work for that company instead of one with a higher starting salary, but little to no bonuses?


A little background about me: High GPA, a few good internships under my belt, and about to graduate with my Masters degree in mechanical engineering. The subreddit rules didn't say not to talk about salaries, so I hope this isn't breaking the rules. But, the offer I received was around $50k, but included a company performance bonus program that has a bonus level of 10% starting out (which can be promoted later), which is multiplied by a company performance multiplier, which has recently been as high as 4 or 5, thus giving a 40%/50% bonus in those cases. The average bonus has historically been 2.0 x bonus level (20% in my case), but there have been cases of years with no bonuses. 


I am still looking into other companies (I think I could get more offers), but I need to let them know by this week. I haven't seen any other information online about programs like this so any advice would be much appreciated."

Unfortunately, a class I had to take in order to graduate was only offered at the same time as the machine learning course at my school. Luckily, there were video lectures of the ML class available, so I could still take both, and I participated in projects and exams regularly. 

The problem is that a decent chunk of my grade is based on participation quizzes which I obviously got a zero on, because I couldn't be there. This lowered what was probably an A- to a B- in a class where the average grade was either a B or a B+. I don't want people to dismiss me off the bat because one of the few experiences I've had with ML looks unimpressive on my transcript. Should I explain this in a cover letter or interview, or should I not even bring it up unless they talk about courses specifically? How should I handle this?"

Since I've had the opportunity to teach future software engineers at my old university and since I am now helping interns in my company, I have started to write articles with dozens of screenshots and explanations about the various features that Eclipse can provide you with while you are developing a Java application.

While learning to code, people are mostly taught about the language and the popular frameworks but not that much about the tools that they will use to code. So I've created those articles to help you master Eclipse for Java development.

Starting slowly with the details about the creation and organization of your project, those articles move later on the feature available to code your Java application. Then I talk about how to configure properly your Eclipse in order to let it help you or even handle most of the boring work for you. Finally, I conclude with a presentation of the various refactoring and debugging tools embedded in Eclipse.

* [Create and manage a Java project](http://stephanebegaudeau.tumblr.com/post/37344384280/create-and-manage-a-java-project)

Those articles are first aimed at newcomers in Java software development in Eclipse but trust me, **even Eclipse veterans will learn tons of new tricks starting from the first posts**."

I'm hoping to acquire a position in an application development job related to GIS, but as a new graduate, I'm looking for any position that will give me experience in the GIS and/or software development fields.

I have programming experience with Java, C++, VB.net, SQL, Python and ArcPy, HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript. I also have a lot of experience using ArcMap (v.9 - 10.1) and many of it's functions such as Spatial , Network, and 3D Analyst. Many of these skills began at school but continued ""beyond the classroom"" as taught myself more about each language.

* It's their cynicism that said that sending our young people abroad was okay.

* It's their cynicism that means that all junior entrants to the work place are expected to work for nothing on an internship or minimum wage while not touching their own pay.

* It's their cynicism that will not release us from the tyranny of the old ways with them still molycoddling the church after all the crimes that have been revealed.

* It's their cynicism in Government that refuses to reform or change how the country is run for the benefit of it's future generations of citizens.

* It's their generation that got rich off the boom by cynically telling the younger generations that **NOW** was the time to get on the property ladder.

* It's their cynicism that perpetuates the system of Law that they play to their own profit and denies reform to the law.

* It's them who will be voting for FF again as their own personal interest takes precedence over the welfare of the nation.

IMO, they grew up in harder times meaning a lot of them take that as carte blanche to have no empathy for anyone other then themselves and their families.

I'll try to make a nice, concise list of the important stuff so you can get a better idea of the position I'm in...

* Interning @ a smaller firm, 12 partners, ~60 staff, 12 interns
* Family friend (partner) got me the internship
* HR lady hates me, mainly because I'm sure my connection basically told her to hire me and gave her no say in the matter, prior to even interning (I mean, every other intern got an ""offer letter"" for the internship, I didn't get squat and didn't even know what my pay was until I got my first check)
* I'm the youngest, still in undergrad (senior @ Berkeley)
* The other interns are all a year or two out, taking extension classes, doing masters programs, or simply looking for job experience
* Not to be conceited, but I have the best educational resume (3.6 @ Berkeley) while the rest all either went to San Jose State, Sacramento State, or Cal State East Bay.
* Firm typically offers full time positions to 3 interns


* Thus far, I've completed the most returns of anybody while having very few, if any mistakes.
* A few of the other interns seem to simply be ""going through the motions"" and don't seem to be fit for a higher-paced and stressful environment
* I'm always asking for more work and trying to get more involved.
* When asked what I want out of this internship, I replied... ""I want to get prepared to be a CPA.  I want to attain meaningful hours.  I want to be exposed to anything and everything.  I want a challenge with regards to the returns I prepare - I can't guarantee you they will be done 100% correctly, but I can guarantee you I will complete them to the best of my ability and learn from them as best I can""

So what else can I do, if anything, to try a secure a full time offer?  I really like the firm as it offers a lot - 20 minutes from home, very friendly and family like, everybody works together and partners are accessible, etc, but obviously as an intern I feel below everyone else and would like that to change in a matter of the next 3 months.

I have an unbelievable amount of free time on my hands during the day. Before my internship starts up, I'm looking for people to hang out with and do something during the day. I'm extremely sociable, but most of my friends have school during the day while I have night classes at DePaul. 

I'm a musician, I love to travel and take day trips, I love cooking and baking and have a reasonably-sized kitchen to do so in, I like to be active outside, be it biking or going to the gym, etc. but I **hate** to do anything alone.

18o3pk,7,2013-02-16,At a loss is a good way to describe my heart right now.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18o3pk/at_a_loss_is_a_good_way_to_describe_my_heart/,"I have never felt so incredibly alone as I do right now. The closer it gets to me having been out of college for a year, the closer I am to a break down. I've resisted crying, but my resolve is trembling and I may shatter soon. I feel unnecessary, unimportant, and terribly under-valued. Everything I knew about the world has proven to be a falsehood of... what? innocence? college? Was I blinded by arrogance, ignorance, or just the belief that goodness generally prevailed? 

I cannot do this. And I cannot give up. I am so sick of being taken advantage of and seen as disposable. I am constantly wondering if I am simply confused and if in reality, my view of the world and myself is entirely wrong. I thought that I was smart and informed. I thought I was talented, intuitive, clever, and quick to catch on. But not having a job by now has me in an utter mess. I feel worthless and stupid. I feel like it reflects on who I am. When people used to ask me what I was afraid of, I would've said bugs or something. Now I know that my deepest fear is that I am actually of no value. That in the scheme of things, I can't make a difference. That I'm not a fighter and will give up when things don't go as planned. And maybe that's the truth, but knowing it makes me weaker and not stronger. My heart just aches if I actually think about it, so I've been avoiding it. 

The work I am doing right now is so demeaning that it makes my thoughts go places that they shouldn't. I need to be able to ask questions. I need to be able to give feedback and provide efficient solutions. I need to be heard on some level even if I'm not listened to. I'm an not just an intern. I am not just a sales associate. But I am an almost 23 year old college graduate with a dwindling self-esteem. I just want a job. A good job. A chance to really try and to really think. To really improve things. I can do this. I can really, really do this. So why am I faltering in job interviews and why am I getting stumped on questions that I know? Because I actually and truly care. I want to do a good job so badly that I freeze. And every day that goes by it gets a little bit harder to believe in myself enough to get someone else to. I'm utterly miserable not being able to think for myself in my internship and being told that I don't need to think, just do. I'm so unfulfilled that it's making me turn on myself. And if I do, I'm really never going to get anywhere."

let me know.

After 5 years and 8 months of living with my girlfriend.  It looks like it isn't
going to  work any longer.  Only the first 8  months were peaceful.   Other than
that, the  rest of the  time we have  fought or she  has thrown a  fit virtually
every night.  I feel  like a fool for staying on this long  and now she wants to
split up.  I  have certainly done my share  of wrong here but the  end result is
that I'm probably going to wind  up semi-homeless, I've had a substantial amount
of money taken from me, I have no transportation and no job.  My best friend has
been telling me  to leave for years.  He is under the impression  that I've left
and I'm too ashamed to tell him that isn't true.

A little background: I'm a male currently in  my 40's.  For twelve years I was a
software engineer making a substantial amount  of money.  I had some college but
had not  finished my degree. When  I was laid-off  in 2002, I decided  to switch
careers to  something safer.  I  finally settled  on civil engineering  since it
seemed difficult to  outsource that kind of work overseas.   Even to the present
day  though, I  still kept  my feet  wet in  coding.  I  started some  projects,
and learned a couple of new languages.

I worked  at lower-paying jobs  with flexible hours and  went back to  school in
2003.  Some  semesters I took  off, others I went  part-time.  I also  shared an
apartment with my brother.

In 2007, I met this woman (my soon-to-be-ex  gf) and we dated she was very, very
nice but within two  weeks of going out she places her apartment  keys on my key
chain, which I found a little unusual.  I  stayed for a couple days but when had
to leave and she begged me to come back.   I came back a few days later and when
I had to leave again she said that ""it feels like we are breaking up""

A few things  about her: she is six years  older than I am and her  son (in his
early twenties) lives with her.

So eventually I moved in but kept paying my portion of the rent on the apt I was
sharing with my brother.  After one semester, I needed to move  back to my place
but it is clear  that this isn't what she wants.  She is  nice, she cooks meals,
she does my laundry.   We had some fun times together but ..   and I can't quite
describe this  .. I couldn't  seem to connect.  There  was this lack  of ""shared
understanding"" or emotional maturity.

Here is the part where I get stupid:

Eventually  I  left my  old  apartment  and  moved  into hers.   Problems  began
occurring.   I'm not  going to  go into  details but  it felt  like I  was being
bullied and controlled. Several  times I walked out but she  would follow me and
convince me  to come back.  But the  worst was her  tendency to come  home EVERY
NIGHT and  get upset at some  small facial expression or  some innocuous comment
that I'd make but  was taken the wrong way by her.  This  usually resulted in me
walking on eggshells for  the remainder of the evening to  avoid getting my head
bitten off.  This behavior continues to the present day.

I sold my car.  I  have no idea why I did this - but at  least it is easy to get
around where I live and I don't  like driving anyways.  There were other things:
she set  up my automatic  online credit card  payments and receives  the monthly
statement.  She had  access to my bank  account (card and online).   In short, I
fucking allowed her to manage my life.

All the while, she  is also happy to do some great things.   She never said ""no""
to sex.  She helped a great deal while  I was going to school.  The fact is, she
provided a foundation that I could rely  on.  (Note: she was *not* paying for my
expenses or tuition).

She has  always hated  my best friend  and accused us  of being  ""fags"" together
(which  is  false).  Her  hatred  of  gay men  knows  no  limits, which  is  odd
considering that she is  bisexual.  I was *not* allowed to  visit him except for
special circumstances.  Emailing my friend was frowned upon as was chat or phone
calls.

In Aug 2010 my grandmother died. My grandmother basically raised me.  When I was
young my mother and father divorced and  I went with my father for several years
.  My Mother never really came back and dad was a fairly nasty person so I spent
a lot of time at my grandparents.  In 2006 she was in slow decline mentally that
would last for  four years.  She had  several strokes and finally  was unable to
breath on her own.   After talking to the doctors, my family  and I decided that
it would be best to let her go since she would never regain consciousness again.
And here was the ONE TIME that I really needed some kind of emotional connection
or support  from my  girlfriend.  I  stood in  the bathroom  thinking that  if I
didn't  go  to the  hospital  then  this  horrible  thing wouldn't  happen.   My
girlfriend comes in and I just can't help  but break down and tell her: ""I don't
want to  do this.""  She  just stared  and commented that  she had never  seen me
like this.

Here is were I do something really stupid:

All of the grandchildren receive a substantial annuity.  As an act of good faith
and partly to  show my gf that I  want to build a real relationship  with her, I
place it  in the bank  in both of  our names.  I was  planning on putting  it to
better use but at the time just leaving it in the bank seemed reasonable.

In 2011  I find  an internship.   I landed  this internship  based partly  on my
programming skills  and it  was an absolute  pleasure to be  paid to  write code
again.  I had other duties but coding was  what I most looked forward to.  I had
forgotten what  it was like  for an  afternoon to just  melt away because  I was
totally absorbed in my work.

At this  point, things were really  bad with my gf.   Her son moved out  and she
blamed it on me.   Her son and I never really talked but  never really got along
well either.  I walked  out on her again and she tracked me  down in her car.  I
refused to come back but stupidly did a few days later.

Last June, I  became friends with a  woman who worked where I  was interning and
somehow we wound up  chatting online.  She told me about her  husband and I told
her about about my  gf.  I told her how we fight constantly  and how I wanted to
leave.  I am very attracted to this woman and tell my best friend (the one my gf
calls  ""a fag"")  that I  want to  cheat  (the actual  words were  a little  more
descriptive).  Somehow  my gf was able  to get  almost complete transcripts  of my
conversations with  my friend  at work and  my best friend.   We had  some nasty
arguments  and I  agreed not  to have  any contact  with the  woman at  work any
longer.

A few months later,  I discover that all of the money from  the annuity has been
withdrawn from  the shared account.   There was no  real explanation from  my gf
other than ""it  was used for expenses"".   This makes no sense since  we had more
than enough money.  She said that she can prove it to me but I doubt it.

I left again, this time she didn't stop me  or try to drag me back and it seemed
like we were through:  I was angry at what she had stolen  from me, and she said
that I  had cheated  on her.  I  was staying  with my brother  but, like  a fool
again, begged her to come back.  I came back a month later because the apartment
we are renting had both of our names on the lease and I didn't want her to break
the lease.  I also  came back because I was miserable,  jobless and thought that
maybe things would be  different. I had been telling myself  this time and again
for years so I  had no reason to believe it. She was  nice when I visited though
and genuinely seemed to want me back.

After several  months it has come  down to this:  she is leaving when  the lease
expires (with her  son - who has returned),  I'm looking for a job  in my field,
going  to grad  school,  and things  are  likely  to get  rough.   I have  given
everything I have to  this woman in trust and gotten screwed.   I am also afraid
that our beloved Chihuahuas  might wind up in a shelter.   I would be devastated
if this happened.

She claims  that she  can't trust me  and that is  something that  I understand.
There have been times  in the past when I've tried to  contact people on various
sites (but  never actually met).  She's  found pron sites in  my browser history
(and does  not approve). On  the other hand,  her behavior has  been suspicious.
For several  years, she refuses to  tell me why she  came home from work  two or
three hours  late every  evening and  jealously guards  her phone  and computer.
Under no  circumstances can  I use her  comp or  look at her  phone.  All  of my
accounts and chat logs are available to her though.

I know that I'm just as much to blame for this mess as she is but when you can't
find  a job,  lose  your home,  lose  almost all  of your  money  and lose  your
girlfriend then  the next  thing to go  is losing hope.   I keep  fooling myself
thinking that everything is totally my fault and that if I fix a few things then
she won't  always be biting my  head off, putting me  or my friends down,  be so
demanding or  so controlling.  I  keep fooling myself  and think that  she'll be
affectionate some  day but  it is  just a  lie.  Ultimately,  I don't  think she
would've been happy with me no matter what I did or didn't do.

Fortunately,  the last  six  years haven't  been a  complete  waste.  I  finally
finished  my degree  and am  going to  grad  school.  I  have a  whole world  of
interests and study new material, hack on some of my side projects or draw.  I'm
definitely not suicidal but there are times when  I feel as if I can't go on and
wonder if I'm going to be able to rebuild my life.

HOW can this be solved, scholars of reddit?

For the last few months of 2012 I worked a full-time, 3-month, internship doing a pretty niche job that I absolutely loved  (I am an unemployed graduate previously in crappy min wage jobs so I took it to gain some office/'real job' skills, and never expected to enjoy the substance of the work as much as I did). I have since been out of work for a couple of months and have been unsuccessfully seeking another 'real job' in any sector that will take me.

The same company that I worked for has recently advertised for a position that is essentially my internship, plus a few additional responsibilities. Due to my previous experience I believe that I would be a strong candidate, however, the catch is that the job is only part-time and lasts for only 2.5 years. If it were full-time and permanent it would be the dream first 'real' job, but it isn't, so there you go. However, I am still considering applying for it.

Like I said, I loved the job, but there are some clear downsides to applying for it on this basis. The job was pretty niche, and as a career it is only as enjoyable when working for a company with the most interesting projects (i.e. good jobs in the sector are very few and far between). It is almost inevitable that I will face another stretch of unemployment afterwards or face potential relocation across the country to do the same job for a less interesting business. I will also have to find a second part-time job to supplement my income; this may be tough in this economy and there may be logistical problems in balancing two part-time jobs.

Alternatively, there *may* be networking opportunities, the contract *may* be extended (the job is key to the business and will probably still be required in some form in 2.5 years) and, because it's part-time, other jobs/volunteering opportunities may prepare me better for the job market in future. The skills are transferable to an extent.

As a graduate I have had a tough time in the job market over the last few years and it seems silly to stop seeking my first stable, full-time job to pursue something that may be unsustainable long term. However, it seems equally silly to avoid a job that I actually enjoy in favour of a full-time 'real' job that may be months/years away in the current economy. 

Has anyone dealt with this before? Should I be more focused on sorting my graduate employment problems short-term, as opposed to potentially stretching them out into my later 20s through short-sighted decisions (I'm 24 now)?

Any advice welcome!



TLDR; opportunity to continue a job that I love part-time with a questionable career future or should I hold out for something full-time and permanent but, perhaps, with less job satisfaction?"

I'm 25 years old and have had serious problems with drugs since I was about 15. I started because I was depressed, and continue to be depressed but felt much better on the drugs at times. Mostly my use revolved around marijuana and prescription drugs. I've been clean for 6 months now, and used very little in the six months before that, but I've never been more depressed. I don't really have any friends anymore either, as much of our relationships were built around the use of drugs. 

I was never a motivated student in High School but could bullshit assignments easy and tested very well so I got into a top 25 university that I was never able to finish. I had a couple great internships where the offices seemed to love me and thought I'd do great in life, but as my problem with prescription drugs grew I pretty much stopped working. I'm currently on a (now 2 year) leave of absence with just over a semesters work left, but I've been gone so long that at this point I had to reapply to finish my degree. To do this I'd need to take a couple community college classes and work a job to prove my ethic and such. My grades at university were all over the place depending on how motivated I felt in the class: I have a string of Fs in introductory courses (failed some requirements 3 or 4 times) and straight As in some of the most challenging classes.

This gets me to my next problem, I haven't been able to hold a job down at all. I dealt to support my habits and have a small income from a couple rental properties I bought with inheritance. My parents paid for my schooling and tried their best to get me help. It took years for this to finally work, as I kept getting depressed and falling back on old habits as I felt like I didn't fit into the world. 

Now that I've cleaned up I'm trying to find work experience. I have no degree, and won't be able to finish it for at least a year and maybe two despite the small amount of work left. My parents are unwilling to pay for more school so I'm going to have to make a descent amount of money or get loans. I have very little work experience and can't find a job. Even jobs postings that say no experience necessary or that they will train you seem to want people with 2+ years experience in the field. I've been trying for two months now and just can't find anything in my area to even build experience. I really feel like if someone would give me a chance I would excel in any field, but I understand that on paper I look like a bad investment. I just feel discouraged about jobs at this point and don't want to even try anymore.

My parents are continuing to get angrier and more frustrated with me, and I really hate to let them down. I have two siblings that have by far outshone me, my younger sister is a star athlete at her college with sports management jobs lined up. My brother is an investment banker with an ivy league background. I often feel like my parents care about them more, I constantly over hear them talking about how great my siblings are and never overhear anything about myself. My siblings did a lot of activities when they were younger (Athletic camps, comp sci camps, competitive squash, tennis, sailing and skiing, etc) while my parents pretty much left me alone to go to school and play video games. I just feel like I was unwittingly and unknowingly neglected and have suffered for it.

I wish I could do better, but I'm at a loss for what to do. I just feel like I was happier when I was high, and want to go back to using. I don't feel like there is room for me in traditional society. Nobody seems to want to hire me and I don't hold out much hope for things getting better. The way I see it each and every day I am becoming less and less valuable to society. I was never this depressed on drugs and feel like I should just use again and melt away.

I'd really appreciate it if any of you guys had some advice on what I should do."

18rg5p,13,2013-02-18,Should I (22F) quit my job because of my boyfriend (21M)?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/18rg5p/should_i_22f_quit_my_job_because_of_my_boyfriend/,"Hi guys,


My boyfriend (21M) and I (22F) have been dating for about 2 years.
He graduated high school last year, and I graduated college 2 years ago. We live in a really small village, where just about everyone knows us. Bonus: our dads have known each other since high school, and are good acquaintances.

Anyway, we met each other during an internship at his dad's office. He's an insurance broker, and I interned there for about 10 weeks. After those 10 weeks, he and I started dating, because I didn't want this to influence my grades. I was hesitant at first, because he wasn't really my type (both mentally and physically), but we got along very well.

After I graduated in June 2011, we went on a vacation with my parents (3 weeks) and his parents (3 weeks). After that, I started working at an insurance office about 5 minutes from home. This office is a lot bigger than theirs, and they obviously disliked this. After I told them I got a job, his dad asked why I didn't ask him for a job (I did, he said they weren't hiring), but I dismissed it. After about a month at my current job, I wasn't really happy with the mood and I tried to resign. My boss asked me to reconsider, and he asked me to gave him my final thought after a week. Okay, I once again went to my inlaws, and asked whether his former offer was still standing. He didn't answer, no matter how many times I asked. After a week, I told my boss I would like to stay at my current job. Case closed.

I've been working there for about a year and a half, and in October 2012 my boyfriend started working at his dad's office. The trouble started in January.

I asked my parents if they wanted me to check out their insurances, and it became quite clear that they were paying way too much. I told my bf about this, and he got very angry about this. He said that we were greedy, and that we were stabbing them in the back. Mind you, I only told him that I made my parents a quote. I did this for 3 insurances, and the total cost was 4000€ (my boss) vs 5000€ (bf).

Because of this fight, my parents decided to just leave it the way it was. This month, I did the same for my brother, and again it was way cheaper. Because of the previous fight, I decided to first take over his insurance and tell my bf after I did this. My brother is marrying this year and is also planning to build a house, so it's pretty important for him to save money wherever possible. He also isn't too keen on my inlaws, so it really didn't matter to him. What's also important (because I realize I might sound like a complete and utter bitch now because I'm ""stealing"" clients from my inlaws) is that my current boss hired me KNOWING that I was in a relationship with my bf, the son of his competitor. I felt (and feel) like I should show how grateful I am for this opportunity he has given me. He easily could've given me the cold shoulder because of my relationship.

Now, of course I understand his point, but he just keeps blaming me for this, and I get very defensive about it. He starts talking shit about my boss (who is a very nice guy btw), and I honestly can't stand it anymore.

My plan wasn't to keep this job for the rest of my life, but only temporary (for about 5 years, or until I got pregnant). Right now, I'm wondering whether I should quit my job (not right now, but in a few months or so) and get a new job in an entirely different department, or if I should just give up on our relationship.

I've tried ""not talking about work"" but even when I have nothing but good things to say about my job (let's say about my colleagues, because we've been having a good time at work or whatever) he gets really annoyed. And we're both very talkative people so it's really hard, but I understand that this might be something we have to work on.

PS: My dream job would be helping the elderly, working in a clothes store (seriously, folding clothes or something, whatever, I'm starting to dislike the responsibility I have at my current job) or working in a bakery. 

TLDR: My bf and I are competitors in the insurance business. We argue about this a lot. Should I quit and find a new job?

I'm so sorry about the rant, but it helped me get things off my chest.

This will be a long post to get all who are interested all the info they need to help out. About nine months ago i was finishing a 5 mile run and i was sprinting the last 300 meters. I specifically the onset because i had to stop my sprint. As i was in mid stride i remember being in about 90 degrees of hip flexion and about 45 of knee extension through my stride and i felt i sharp pain through my patellar tendon. i walked the rest of the run and at the time didnt think much of it (no treatment after) and it didnt hurt much. About a week later, i noticed what seemed like a bump at the base of my patella and a little divot right above that. The bump is not tender to the touch but is visibly noticeable when standing. The painful part is at the patella/patellar tendon junction. When palpating the tendon, down the middle from the base of patella to tibial tuberosity feels like a tight band when compared bilaterally. Also, there are tracking issues in that it pops into the femoral grove constantly. Without leading to an early conclusion, the most painful activity is jumping which would lead u to believe patellar tendinitis. I do not believe this is the issue because of an acute onset of injury (not chronic even though it has developed into chronic) not swelling or inflammation of patellar tendon and no pain is alleviated with common treatment methods of patellar tendinitis (which i will go into depth later) or relief from patellar strap or mcconnell tape or kinesiotape.
ROM/flexibility is WFL in hip flex,extension, abd add ext and intern rotation, knee flex and extension and ankle plantar and dorsi flex. bilaterally. I have built up strength up to 5/5 for all above motions as well, my hip strength was originally 4/5 and glut med was an issue but is now back to 5/5. Quad (and VMO) and hamstring strength is functional and when compared bilaterally is equal. If you guys need the exercises i have done then i will explain them but i have done a good amount of research to find out what works with hip stabilization and hamstring/quad strengthening. My core is also up to par incase that is in question.
Treatment wise i have tried everything i can think of. I have completely stopped running, jumping, knee bends (although recently i have been trying very slow controlled deep knee bends focusing on eccentric contractions while holding on to trx suspention bands). I have used ice, heat, friction massage KT tape, Mcconnell tape, ultrasound, e-stim, NMES (russian), TENS, tennis ball massage for quad and hamstring, foam roller for quad and hamstring and glutes, muscle energy contract relax quads and hamstrings, clam shels,SAQ, LAQ, knee extensions with ball inside to activate VMO, SLR in all directions. I have tried these exercises for 6 weeks at random times during the nine month period and made sure to ice after all exercises. I have done a trial of NSAIDS for 10 days, pain deminished but problem did not resolve. My hips are in alignment, no leg length discrepancy, i wear brand new shoes all the time (gel blur 22 and gel kayano 18). I have no history of previous injury to knee or hip although ankle has been rolled multiple times. At this time the only thing that makes sense that happened was that i have avusled part of my patella off from the patellar tendon which causes the bio mechanics of the knee to be off. Please any solutions to this problem or other ideas on what it could be would be much appreciated.
Short-I was running felt sharp pain in my patellar tendon nine months and every rehab idea i have had i still am not back to normal possible avusled kneecap."

In just about everything I have ever done I'm always number 2 at best. I'm a black male who grew up in Brooklyn, NY. My whole life i've grew up in a culture who's motto was ""i'm not afraid of anything"".

For the first time in my life, I've hit this wall. And to be completely honest, the wall scares the shit out of me. 


**I'm afraid of whether i'll be able to get a good job and pay back the tons of money I owe:** I'm currently in college. My 5th year to be exact. I almost failed out my first year and have generally never really done that well. Despite not having done extremely well, I know my stuff and have done well in some pretty testing internships. This worries me because I have no idea how I can prove that to potential employers and if I will make enough money coming out to pay back the debt college has put me in. 

**I'm afraid for my social life:** I've always been an introvert. I've always kept very small group of friends and have never been one to go to parties and things like that. I exist in a weird gray area with people. Someone close to me once told me, ""you're too cool for the nerds, but not cool enough for the popular kids"" Last year my small group of friends graduated and I was left friendless. I've spent the better part of what I hope is my senior year, with noone to talk to  
or hang out with. After college friends will be only harder to achieve. 

**I'm afraid for my love life:** I left my girlfriend of five years not too long ago. We were what I thought to be madly in love, but we were moving into a long distance relationship and we knew it couldn't work. She called me last night and told me that she was falling for this other guy and wanted me to talk about other girls that i may have been seeing. This other guy has everything I don't and is incredibly more extroverted than I will ever be. I'm afraid that the  person I was without a doubt sure I would marry, doesn't love me as much as I love her. Like friends i'm terrible at meeting girls, it just seems like there is always another guy i'm competing against. I've been trying to change this and been doing some of the stratgies on /r/seduction or simple pickup, but the rejections i've faced just make me less confident in myself. I've gone to bed alone with no one to even text, for way longer than I care to admit. 

**I'm afraid for my family:**  To make this part short, my family is poor, in debt and sick. It feels like they are counting on me(being the first one to go to college) to get a good job and contribute/help out. Everytime I fail a class in college I can almost see the disappointment in my father's eyes 400 miles away from him. 


I guess my problems are pretty good compared to some other people. But I constantly worry to the point of tears on especially tough days. Its been like this for a while and it gets old very fast when you keep failing and failing. I'll never take my own life. But that doesn't mean I haven't thought about it. I'm just hoping getting this off my chest and putting this all into perspective will help me feel better.

As the title reads, I am a soon to be intern at one of the Big 4 this summer. I am pretty psyched up that I got the offer. It is for an audit position in financial services and is located in a major city on the east coast (think NYC, Boston, Philly). I have been researching the various boards and forums, and speaking to some people about the experience of public accounting, specifically Big 4 audit. However, I keep getting varying answers depending on where the sources come from.

For instance, I spoke to a few former interns from my university who all had really excellent experiences and had nothing but good things to say about the firm; they all accepted ft offers for when they graduate. I spoke to my first round interviewer, a senior manager at the firm, and he gave me a very honest and straight forward opinion which was, that while it is definitely not a typical 9-5 job, it is a great place to learn a lot in a short period of time and your experience is basically what you make of it. Lastly, I read endless posts on here and other boards that big 4 is hell on earth, with hours comparable to a sweatshop, and that I should turn around and never look back.

So what exactly am I looking at for the summer ahead in terms of hours, travel, actual work to do, intern events, and the like? "

She claims that their relationship escalated within the past few days and she would have told me, but I had already bought my plane tickets. She didn’t have it in her to tell me beforehand... at any point before I was literally in her home. Wow. WTF.

I was a gentleman about it of course... but with the snow storm and all I got stranded at her apartment on the couch for the rest of the night (no sleep).

She didn’t have it in her to tell me beforehand... at any point before I was literally in her home.  Wow. WTF.  
	I was a gentleman about it of course... but with the snow storm and all I got stranded at her apartment on the couch for the rest of the night (no sleep).  I left her place the next morning and booked my return trip 2 days early...  I ignored so many obvious challenges that faced the relationship because I felt something extraordinary for this girl. Did I make a mistake in pursuing her?  Did my risk outweigh my reward? Does anyone have a clue what happened here!?  

TL;DR Sometimes I ignore obvious dating obstacles with the girls I'm interested in.  Should I reel it in a little?"

Basics: Graduated in July (UK) (MEng Civil Engineering; 2:1 grade) and relocated to Australia (dual citizen), lacking in extracurricular, internships and relevant employment. 

I'd be looking to work anywhere where I wouldn't be at risk of harm and particularly enjoy hydrology.

What I want to ask is do you guys have any recommendations into what I should do? 

What can I work on in my spare time to bolster my resume? 

Where's best to look for jobs? 

What's the best way to approach PHDs, EngDs and/or CEng in future?

I know my post may be a little loose but it's a big world and I'm well aware that there is stuff that I don't know that I don't know that might be helpful to me.

Basically any advice for a fledgling (but keen) engineer would be greatly appreciated.

I'm a freshman in college, the work isn't even that hard. I just sleep in and miss my classes. I don't even have an excuse, I'm just to lazy to care about the rest of my life.


I'm so disorganized and a slob. I haven't showered since like last Thursday (people don't notice), and I don't even bother to remember to apply for internships because I know I'll fuck up and realize I can't even do what I'm going to college for.


I'm 5'2"" and a guy. So even if I were a social superstar, which I'm not,, I couldn't get a girlfriend cause fuck short guys. And I know I should just 'be confident' and don't come off as 'Desperate'.. But I'm not confident, and I am desperate, not that it would make a difference.


I'm going to be single, never get a job, and die a pissy loser. Why bother trying so fucking hard every day to pretend I don't care and things will work out when they won't.

I hate my major. I hate having to live in this shitty small town. I hate being so far from home. I hate the weird locals. I hate how bars here close at 1. I hate that our athletics are subpar and the stands at a football or basketball game will never be packed.

I feel like I hate everyone here. Everyone is so uptight, concerned with what everyone thinks about them. Being involved in Greek life makes it that much worse. Everyone is so caught up in rankings and which sorority has the best looking girls and whether or not they mix with top fraternities. Girls are vicious to each other sometimes making personal attacks on anonymous forums online to bring other sororities down. Frat boys are just dicks. 

All everyone here talks about is how much sleep they didn't get the night before, how they have jobs and internship lined up at all these banks, how they ""failed"" exams though they only got a C. Everyone here is only concerned with wealth and status.

I don't have many friends. Despite being in a sorority, I wouldn't consider many of my sisters to be my friends. They're more like drinking and partying pals who I only see on weekend nights. My best friend and I got into the same sorority but lately I feel like our friendship has been deteriorating. It's gotten to the point where I'll only see her to party. I hate how most people here don't do romantic relationships and just have casual hook ups. They claim to not have the time or something.

The only thing that keeps me going through the week is the weekend, which to me begins Wednesday night. I spend so much money at the bars and I justify it by the fact that I work two jobs.

I wish I would have gone to a different school. I wish I could transfer out. I doubt anyone would even care if I left. I fucked up really badly last semester. Seeing as I hate my major, I just don't feel motivated to study. My GPA took a beating and I could never be able to get into a decent state school like University of Illinois or Michigan. I've already signed my housing lease for next year which is probably the biggest deterrent to me transferring. 

I don't fit in. I'm a very chill, laid-back girl who loves to have fun. I don't care if I'm rich or not in the future. I'm not looking to be a lawyer, doctor, or banker. I really only just want to be happy. I'm pretty miserable here to the point where I'm depressed and thoughts of suicide have crossed my mind. Sometimes I wish I could drop out. However, I have two younger siblings who look up to me and a mother and father I want to make proud. With the shit job I'm doing in school, I'm essentially wasting my time as well as my parents' and government's money. I'm frequently homesick. It's not that I miss my family much. I just miss my hometown. I'm just going to keep on keeping on I guess."

I spent a year and a half as an intern in a pretty complex IT department at a marketing agency in Seattle...and I loved it! I was primarily doing level I-II desktop work and I learned a whole hell of a lot more their that I did going through vocational courses at my community college. I was preparing workstations for new employee's, creating and administering AD accounts and security groups, removing viruses, troubleshooting calendaring issue's in outlook...etc. I participated in cool projects like Office 365 email roll out, and a bitlocker encryption roll out. 

I gained gained all of my colleagues and customers appreciation. I was always willing to help. If I was stressed I would hide it, because I really enjoyed working with my customers to solve their computing issues. I only left the job so I could focus on getting my transfer degree in a shorter amount of time. Beginning in Fall, I will look for a similar role and take night classes to work toward my Bachelors. I think I want to stay in the desktop role the though. Sure, it doesn't pay a sys admin's salary but it's enough for me to have a life outside of work and put food on the table.

**tl;dr**

I really love desktop work, particularly in fast paced environments where I can do some leg work. Would holding the desktop role for my whole career be suicidal? I feel an aversion to becoming a network / system admin...seems really stressful and complicated.

I love the cast and the new stories. Knowing a few people in life that are exactly like Cole, I feel the writers and Dave Franco just nailed the character.

This will be a long post to get all who are interested all the info they need to help out. About nine months ago i was finishing a 5 mile run and i was sprinting the last 300 meters. I specifically the onset because i had to stop my sprint. As i was in mid stride i remember being in about 90 degrees of hip flexion and about 45 of knee extension through my stride and i felt i sharp pain through my patellar tendon. i walked the rest of the run and at the time didnt think much of it (no treatment after) and it didnt hurt much. About a week later, i noticed what seemed like a bump at the base of my patella and a little divot right above that. The bump is not tender to the touch but is visibly noticeable when standing. The painful part is at the patella/patellar tendon junction. When palpating the tendon, down the middle from the base of patella to tibial tuberosity feels like a tight band when compared bilaterally. Also, there are tracking issues in that it pops into the femoral grove constantly. Without leading to an early conclusion, the most painful activity is jumping which would lead u to believe patellar tendinitis. I do not believe this is the issue because of an acute onset of injury (not chronic even though it has developed into chronic) not swelling or inflammation of patellar tendon and no pain is alleviated with common treatment methods of patellar tendinitis (which i will go into depth later) or relief from patellar strap or mcconnell tape or kinesiotape.

ROM/flexibility is WFL in hip flex,extension, abd add ext and intern rotation, knee flex and extension and ankle plantar and dorsi flex. bilaterally. I have built up strength up to 5/5 for all above motions as well, my hip strength was originally 4/5 and glut med was an issue but is now back to 5/5. Quad (and VMO) and hamstring strength is functional and when compared bilaterally is equal. If you guys need the exercises i have done then i will explain them but i have done a good amount of research to find out what works with hip stabilization and hamstring/quad strengthening. My core is also up to par incase that is in question.

Treatment wise i have tried everything i can think of. I have completely stopped running, jumping, knee bends (although recently i have been trying very slow controlled deep knee bends focusing on eccentric contractions while holding on to trx suspention bands). I have used ice, heat, friction massage KT tape, Mcconnell tape, ultrasound, e-stim, NMES (russian), TENS,  tennis ball massage for quad and hamstring, foam roller for quad and hamstring and glutes, muscle energy contract relax quads and hamstrings, clam shels,SAQ, LAQ, knee extensions with ball inside to activate VMO, SLR in all directions. I have tried these exercises for 6 weeks at random times during the nine month period and made sure to ice after all exercises. I have done a trial of NSAIDS for 10 days, pain deminished but problem did not resolve. My hips are in alignment, no leg length discrepancy, i wear brand new shoes all the time (gel blur 22 and gel kayano 18). I have no history of previous injury to knee or hip although ankle has been rolled multiple times. At this time the only thing that makes sense that happened was that i have avusled part of my patella off from the patellar tendon which causes the bio mechanics of the knee to be off. Please any solutions to this problem or other ideas on what it could be would be much appreciated.

Short-I was running felt sharp pain in my patellar tendon nine months and every rehab idea i have had i still am not back to normal possible avusled kneecap."

I really want to go to grad school for Industrial engineering or Systems engineering, I find both fascinating and complementary. I know I have waited to long, but I'm just starting to send applications to certain schools. 
The reason why I didn't send applications before is because I didn't think my grades were good enough. I have a 3.6 GPA, but a 4.0 in the Comp Sci major. I'm minoring in Math, Physics, and Economics.
In addition I had an internship over the last summer, along with an IT job for 3 years at the school I go.
I recently took the GRE and I got a somewhat low score in english (mainly because it is not my first language). In verbal I got 151, and in math I got 161. I just learned that those scores are not too bad, so I finally decided to go ahead and apply to grad school.

I have a student visa, and I'm really looking for ideas to places where I can go either to continue my studies or to get an internship as a computer programmer. I'm scared that, if I don't get accepted, I will have no other choice but to go back to my country were my chances of getting a good job are very slim.

I've been trying EVERYWHERE. I've submitted over 200 applications in the past 2 years. 

Most jobs I am well qualified for, but then they throw in one requirement that is impossible. Like proven experience with a very specific program that I can only achieve once I have been accepted and trained for the job. Or internships/ entry-level care jobs that require 2,000hours of supervised experience. Uhh, Hello! That is not entry-level.

I've applied at chain stores as cashiers or clerks. After signing up for online registrations, filling out a tedious application, and occasionally filling out a repetitive questionnaire, I get a ""Thank you, your application has been submitted"", which I presume really means my information has been sent in to space or flushed down a digital toilet somewhere. I draw this conclusion because if I actually can reach HR (they don't provide contact info anywhere) they can never find my application, and I never hear back. I guess these positions are just for show - legal posting requirements when they really had a person lined up all along.


I've thought about going back to college, but even with advisors help I can't decide for what. My interests are too broad, and my grades weren't good enough previously to get scholarships. It's not as simple as just picking and doing something. I want to be happy with what I do.

The 3 temp agencies I've joined say they have jobs, but after I sign up say they have no openings. They even told me that networking is probably my only hope. But when I ask to network with the few friends and family I have, the flat out refuse. Like there's some social stigma against actually helping people with something so normal. Apparently the useless advice ""keep trying, it's a hard out there"" is free and easier than talking to their bosses or HR on my behalf. And stop claiming you don't know who to ask, you got hired there somehow. HR and recruiting have departments you can easily find, but as an outsider I'm not allowed to access. I might as well burn my applications for how far they're going to get.

I'm doing everything right - I have a solid resume, different cover letters (reviewed by career counselors) I interview well and follow up. I'm trying to meet new people, stay positive and available, volunteer, even using community resources like workforce centers and vocational rehab services. But I simply don't have enough experience or sway to rise above other applicants. Pray, tell me, how am I supposed to get your required experience without working first? Internships and learning at home aren't available or don't cut it. Why on earth are these jobs listed as entry level with so many requirements? Greed, stupidity, or both.

I don't want to steal anyone's job, I just want some help internally from HR. I have a great work ethic, but that doesn't compare to the 30 other people applying with me who have more.. Even internships in volunteer opportunities jus people with experience over me.

Is helping someone get a job really such an extension of oneself? People admit that's how they got their job, but when I imply that's what I need they act uncomfortable. What's the deal? I'm not asking for money or favors, just to pay it forward so I can get started like they did. I'm sick of getting pity instead of actual help.

I have a lot of fear, for one: even if I did manage to get a simple entry level job, say as a cashier again or bartender, it would only give me experience to get another crappy job doing the same thing. The skills don't transfer up to something bigger and better on their own.

I would like to excel and work in the middle class. I have medical bills piling up, and need more tests done. I want to support myself and work hard but I can't get any chances to even get my foot in the door. LinkedIn and networking groups have been useless, no one seems motivated to help someone else start out. As if my bad luck will be contagious, or talking to HR for 30 seconds on someone else's half is unreasonable.

Not being able to find work for so long has made me bitter and depressed. You are what you do, and if you're unemployed people look down on you, like you're lazy or worthless (of which I am neither). It's unbearable to see younger people, or those who have just started looking for work, get lucky and find jobs before me. 

I would like to start out in a great company and be groomed with training for an in-demand position, acquire skills. But I feel like I might as well try to start a potato farm on the moon. I don't even have any people that will vouch for me as a reference.

I feel like trying hard, sticking to it, staying positive, and being flexible/open have all failed me. I'm also trying to do the right thing and be a good person. Apparently its the wrong thing to do. It has gotten me NO where. Just keep trying? Doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results is the definition of insanity. 

I feel disphoria, I feel like society has let me down. I was taught that if I try hard, and try to be a good person, I would do well. So I keep trying and trying and helping others whenever I can, but I just get left behind. I know all too well that having a job is not a guarantee nor a right.

If you'd like go know where (in the USA) or for what (if I can be specific) I'm looking for, feel free to pm me. Individual suggestions would probably work best as a pm as well.

til;dr
The requirements for getting jobs require me to have the job first, or get lucky. I guess I'm just not one of the lucky ones.

Thanks for letting me get this off my chest.

I'm a senior in high school, she's a sophomore in college HB8. When we originally met she thought that I was a junior in college, but I reassured her that I was at least 18. We met at my my internship for school &amp; we had been flirting for about a month off and on over text/at weekly meetings. It wasn't until last Monday however I decided to make a move.

For three days she was extremely into me. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. I met with her on Tuesday &amp; we ended up kissing. That Tuesday night however, I asked about her... Boyfriend. Her boyfriend lives 500 miles away &amp; I'm not very sure about his situation but I made it very clear that I didn't really want to hurt him... She was confused. So was I. Anyways, she said ""let's just go back to being friends."" I said... ""Eh :/"" &amp; we just kind of dropped the subject and that night she didn't want me to stop texting her even though I had an exam the next day &amp; throughout the next day we texted constantly. I couldn't see her, I had a meeting and a very long church service since I am Orthodox.

Thursday comes along. Not flirty anymore. At all. I asked her if she wanted to hangout, we could get dinner, go to this basketball game, but she said that she was SUPER busy. She wasn't responding to me anymore with heart shapes in texts, and there was a solid two hours where she didn't say anything to me.
Friday was worse, same with Saturday, &amp; today we haven't texted at all.

Should I text her now? No. That would be weird &amp; possibly pushy... Right?

I'm seeing her tomorrow night at a meeting... What should I say? I was thinking of having small talk, and eventually asking if she was still into me... It was extremely obvious that we cared for each other more than friends would.

You don't lose feelings for somebody in one day, so something must have happened. I'm super confused. What should I do? My goal isn't to ""bone"" her either. I want to connect mentally before I connect physically. If this isn't the right subreddit, I'm sorry.

I'm a senior in high school, she's a sophomore in college HB8. When we originally met she thought that I was a junior in college, but I reassured her that I was at least 18. We met at my my internship for school &amp; we had been flirting for about a month off and on over text/at weekly meetings. It wasn't until last Monday however I decided to make a move.

For three days she was extremely into me. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. I met with her on Tuesday &amp; we ended up kissing. That Tuesday night however, I asked about her... Boyfriend. Her boyfriend lives 500 miles away &amp; I'm not very sure about his situation but I made it very clear that I didn't really want to hurt him... She was confused. So was I. Anyways, she said ""let's just go back to being friends."" I said... ""Eh :/"" &amp; we just kind of dropped the subject and that night she didn't want me to stop texting her even though I had an exam the next day &amp; throughout the next day we texted constantly. I couldn't see her, I had a meeting and a very long church service since I am Orthodox. 

Thursday comes along. Not flirty anymore. At all. I asked her if she wanted to hangout, we could get dinner, go to this basketball game, but she said that she was SUPER busy. She wasn't responding to me anymore with heart shapes in texts, and there was a solid two hours where she didn't say anything to me.

Friday was worse, same with Saturday, &amp; today we haven't texted at all.

Should I text her now? No. That would be weird &amp; possibly pushy... Right?

I'm seeing her tomorrow night at a meeting... What should I say? I was thinking of having small talk, and eventually asking if she was still into me... It was extremely obvious that we cared for each other more than friends would.

You don't lose feelings for somebody in  one day, so something must have happened. I'm super confused. What should I do? My goal isn't to ""bone"" her either. I want to connect mentally before I connect physically. If this isn't the right subreddit, I'm sorry.

It happened again. Boy meets girl, boy likes girl, girl likes boy, enough to fool around, but not enough to date. Girl meets new boy, old boy is led on and eventually left in the dust. It's been the story of my love life since I started college three years ago. 

But, for the first time in a long time, it's someone I met online. r/r4r, you are a cruel mistress. Early on in high school, I dated a couple girls online. Since then, I had always told myself I wouldn't get involved in it anymore. But, I found her post on r4r. I wasn't looking for anything romantic. I was just looking to talk to new people. But the more we talked, the more we had in common, the more we flirted, one thing led to another. It just sucks. I saw it coming, it's happened to me enough that I saw the signs, I knew she was talking to someone else. This time, after six months. It's not for a lack of connection, either. 

When I like a girl, the connection is usually right there, nice and strong. I'm not a super good-looking guy either, I'm not sure how I get caught up in these friends-with-benefits situations. I shouldn't have let myself get attached like I did, but it's a mistake I always make. I dunno. It's just rough. And I've lost contact with a lot of my friends as of late, so I don't really have anyone to talk to about all of this. I guess that's why I'm here, reaching out. 

I just feel like I'm constantly on the losing end of this equation. Yeah, sure, I can bury myself in schoolwork, video games, TV shows, job searching, internships... but this is still going to be in the pit of my stomach. It's that feeling of abandonment. To know that you can be so easily cast aside. It really hurts. She said she still wants to be friends. I don't know if I can do it. And I can't tell her how much it hurts me that she chose him over me. I don't want a pity party from her, and I don't want to send her on a guilt trip. It's not her fault that she wants what she wants. I can't blame her for that. I fell into my own emotions again, even though I willed myself not to. 

If you made it this far, thank you. I just really needed to get it off my chest."

My idea is to make a nation based on the principle of Open Source. To those that don't know Open Source is when you make the source code of something you have coded open to anyone interested. My idea is to have a small group of people move far away from civilization at the beginning of the game (this won't be hard considering the mentioned ""spawn far away from civilization"" and ""spawn near friends"" options mentioned by Nick in the FAQ).
The basic merits of being a group have already been explained by Nick, but aside from protecting each other people in this society will also be teaching each other everything they know. They might charge for it as i think people will in other nations, but ideally people will teach for free in the belief that they will later be taught something in return.
The merits are obvious but i'll explain them anyway:
     1. In the beginning of the game, everyone will be quickly be able to build a cottage, kill animals with spears, make a fire, instead of everyone having to discover ""how to walk"" by themselves.
     2. Because of this the society will develop extremely quickly compared to other. Ideally every time someone makes a discovery in the society, it will be something completely new to everyone.
     3. It will be easier to keep the village peaceful if everyone is taught how to defend themselves.
     4. It will be easier to defend the village if everyone is taught how to make weapons, armor and how to use it.

I have a few ideas for how this might be able to work in practice, but any input is appreciated:

A forum is created for intern communication.

All knowledge you possess should be listed on your forum account (making it easier to find a teacher).

If you want to learn something, you make a contract with your teacher. The contract might go along the lines of: ""Person X and Y agree that X will teach Y how to make a spear. X agrees to teach this for free if Y promises to give 95% of anything he gets in return for teaching this knowledge in the future to X. If Y has not taught this to anyone within 4 weeks, he shall give X a cow, unless everyone in the village possess this knowledge.""
The idea is that person Y now wants to teach others how to make spears for free because he doesn't really get any of whatever chooses to charge for his knowledge and he doesn't want to pay a cow. 

This would make new knowledge quickly spread to everyone in the village to the benefit of everyone.

I'm too tired to write anymore, but let me hear what you think of the idea. :)

**Background:** I sort of dated this guy James about 2 years ago. We were really close friends for about a year before anything happened. I liked him a lot but he sort of strung me along for 3 months until he ended it. I was hurt but got over it quite fast because I felt he'd treated me like crap. I moved on, he seemed not to even though he ended it. He asked me out a few months later and I said no. I heard later from friends that he was still trying to get me back a couple of months after, but it was around then I started going out with my boyfriend Dan. James and I are still friends, but not close. We have the same circle of friends so we occasionally hang out in groups and we still get on really well, but I haven't hung out with him alone since I turned him down. I assume he's over me now as this was over a year ago.

**Current Dilemma:** My problem is this. James and I work in the same industry, and it's not an industry flush with opportunities. The place he works is one of the few that are growing and hiring. They're hiring at the moment in fact. And it's a job I think I would be good at. But it's a small company, maybe 30 people, and only about 5 work in the section the job opening is in. James is one.

I don't think James has anything to do with the hiring of this job, but if I got it I would be, if not working directly with him, at least sharing a small office with him. For me this wouldn't be a problem, but would it be unfair to him? I'm certain he doesn't still have feelings for me, but would he feel awkward, would I be invading his territory? 

And what about my boyfriend, is it beyond inconsiderate to apply for a job with an ex? I know I would feel at least some pangs of jealousy if Dan was working with an ex, particularly if he purposely applied for a job knowing he would be. But is that enough reason not to go for it? I almost certainly wont get the job this time, but they hire and take on interns every few months so I know this dilemma will repeat.

Normally my instinct would be to talk to the people involved, but I know neither of them would tell the truth of how they feel about this. Who would tell a friend they don't want to work with them, or a girlfriend not to apply for a job.

What is the right thing to do here?

**TL;DR: My ex and I work in the same field, and his small company is hiring. Should I apply for the job or would that be unfair to my ex and my current boyfriend?**

I'm just the average Joe who got into a Computer Science degree (Technical degree, not really sure of the equivalences, a 3-year university degree quite similar to the ""superior"" degree) because I wanted to make video games. Although I really loved the coding (And design) related courses, I got a bit unlucky due personal issues and took way too long to finish the degree, as I ended it with 27 years.

I started the search for some work and things got messy. I managed to score an internship for a big company, only that in their IT department. The position was advertised to me as a more coding-related position (Not exactly ""developing"", but with chances of get dirty with code), and, given the lack of any other offer as a programmer, I accepted. I have spent over 6-8 weeks there and, besides some small scripting work, I haven't written a single line of ""serious"" code.

So doubts arise. I'm now 27, I have some small personal projects going on which I develop on mi scarce spare time, and I don't really know if the pros of the position (The place is great, the coworkers are really smart people, I'm learning a lot of new stuff, the company really cares for its employees -even the interns-, having a big name in the CV...) over weighs the cons (The STRONG feeling that I'm getting too old to start a successful career as a programmer and that it will be harder for me when I end the internship, the fact that time spent there is time not spent programming, the doubt that anything that I do here will ever be useful on a programming career, the fact that I don't really like the job...) 
Right now I don't really know if I can take it easy and enjoy the ride until it ends (""I'm being impatient"") and put it in my CV or jump through the window in mid transit and search for other opportunities (""I'm being realistic"") as this is going nowhere (besides me being older).

18u4ja,72,2013-02-19,Advice to aspiring web developers,aquilaFiera,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/18u4ja/advice_to_aspiring_web_developers/,"Here are some tidbits that I've found successful in my career as a web developer. I'm only about five years in the field, but I've been pretty successful. I certainly can discuss my credentials if you wish, but that's not what I want to dwell on.

1. College degrees are far from a requirement. Development and in particular web development is very much a meritocracy: those who are good do well and those who don't sink. As someone who has done hiring, I looked more favorably on one year of professional web development than any four year degree. A degree *will* help get you interviews but little more than that. I am not at all implying degrees are not helpful, particularly if you want to do some of the more specialized types of applications like natural language processing, machine learning, or Bayesian analysis. Even then, with some spare time and a desire to learn you can do those too.
2. A good place to start is HTML and CSS. Too many web devs can't do CSS worth a damn. Both of them are pretty easy to wrap your mind around and pretty essential in my opinion. After getting a firm grasp, then I'd move to more server-side learning. I personally started in PHP and was happy to have done so. I think it's among the easiest to pick up. As far as a first database, I'd say start with MySQL. You'd be hard pressed to find any major app that doesn't use MySQL in at least some minor way. Be sure not to neglect JavaScript either. One of my former colleagues made a very astute observation that knowing JavaScript will likely make you the most money. First because no matter the back-end language, you're always going to be using JavaScript on the front-end and with node.js occasionally on the back-end. And secondly, they're just aren't as many good JS devs as there are jobs for them.
3. Keep your LinkedIn up to date. I can't tell you how many awesome opportunities I've gotten because of this. It's not just Joe's Dev Shack in Timbuktu that's calling (though he does call), but cool new start-ups and cool tech-giants calling too. I've interviewed with Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, Tesla Motor Company, SpaceX, Amazon, and some other really cool companies. Where did they all find me? LinkedIn. Every time.
4. Going back to experience, open-source work does indeed substitute for real job experience. I'm not great at this because I don't contribute regularly to any particular open-source project, but I have hired based on it. Contract work (as in small, one-off jobs for Consuela's Maid Service made in Wordpress in a week) does not substitute. I rarely bring those up, if ever, in a professional interview.
5. Look for internships if you can't get a junior position. Maybe the pay isn't great, but the experience and the résumé material is far, far more valuable than any sum of money they could offer you.
6. When you do get hired somewhere, find somewhere where there is a deficiency of knowledge and become an expert in it. At one of my companies, we were going forward with the idea of using MongoDB as the database. The issue was that none of the devs had any experience using it. These are opportunities to make yourself indispensable to your company. I went on a weekend coding bender and built an entire app using MongoDB and by the end I was pretty proficient at it. By the end of my tenure with the company, I was still known as the MongoDB guy.
7. Keep up to date on new technologies. Occasionally have a weekend when you lock yourself in a room and build a whole new app just to learn a new technology. When I got one of my jobs, I didn't know the back-end language of what was being used there. However, the weekend previous I had just gone on a node.js bender (despite the fact that it really had little to do with the then-present job.) That fact that I showed I picked up on a new language over a weekend was enough to convince him that I would have little issue working in a new language. In extension, always be tinkering on your own. I've had so many positive experiences that way and learned a lot. Apps don't have to make you money. If you learn something while making it, that's an investment that will pay off later.

That's all I got off the top of my head. From the other grizzled dev-veterans, what tips can you offer to have a successful career in web development? What do you wish you had known beforehand? 

**TL;DR**: Be a web dev. It's super rad."

I've already been accepted YAY but now it's about that time where I actually make my decision and finalize things. I'm kinda terrified haha. 

I go to the University of Dayton right now which is a pretty small school so I'm nervous to go to a massive school like OSU. In your opinion, is it really all that big or do you get used to it pretty quickly? Also, I wanted your opinion on the class sizes and quality. My parents are worried about me transferring because they think the education here at UD is more personal and hands on. Does it bother you that it can be impersonal? 

Also, how do you get involved in things to further your career? Here I'm in an honors professional communications fraternity and didn't know if there were things like that or what the chances of getting internships were. I am very serious about gaining as much experience as I can and I worry that OSU is just too big for me to be able to find anything. 

Sorry for the novel I just need all the advice I can get since I am completely split between what my parents are saying and what I feel is right for me. So please give me your full honesty on what you love and hate about OSU so I can weigh those against my pro/con list of staying or leaving. Are you so completely happy with your choice or do you have any regrets? Thanks so much!

Read تاريخ فلسطين, about 200 pages of history on Palestine until WW1

Read most of تاكسي, a short novel, about 200 pages of different stories surrounding taxi drivers in Cairo

I've also been doing random writings and recordings etc. for class. 

Apart from classes, I'm a student aid, or a kind of ""mini"" T.A. in two year two Arabic courses, so that is giving me an opportunity to review old grammar like the i3raab etc.

I went to a good-not-great private local college (pretty well known for academics and basketball - highly regarded in New England). Studied political science and took a few computer science classes though I didn't finish the minor. At this time you weren't seen as a leech on society when studying liberal arts. (Much better days) 

I applied for job after job and had interview after interview but ended up working at a bookstore for two years after graduation before landing a professional job. I moved out, started law school the following year (while working - so nights at a good school, but not the best I got into because they only had day programs). This is 2008. Bad timing. 

I was laid off after my first year, unable to find work. I moved back in with my parents. I finished law school, but not well. I was miserable all the time and my grades were all over the map. This put me well into the bottom half of my class. And by this point, the legal market had collapsed so only top 1% got internships, jobs, etc.

Since being laid off in 2009 I haven't have full-time work. I've had a few part-time jobs that were temporary. Do a bit of freelance and have done a lot of work for free as ""internships"" with companies (not in law) that ""could lead to pay"" but never have. 

I'm turning 31 this year. I am not medically depressed or suicidal but I hate my life. My peers all kept their jobs through the recession, have mostly gotten married, and are having kids. I'm barely scraping by and it's killing me. I share an apartment with my younger brother now, so not at home, so at least there's that. Until he gets married.

I still feel like I'll find a real job again with the economy on the mend, but I have big loans and am almost 10 years older than all the people I'm applying against because my work history is so hit or miss.

When do you just give up on your life goals and settle for less? I probably won't get married at this rate, I won't be able to afford a house, I'm almost as old as my parents were when I was born and every day it gets worse. 

I have been rejected for jobs so nicely I have wanted to beg the person. Say I'd work for less. Just for something. Just so I could start to scratch my way back into the world.

I accept my failure. I studied subjects without jobs. I took on debt to make my legal dream come true only to have it go as poorly as possible. 

I seem people with my same background in the jobs I apply to. I feel like I'm on the right track. It's just like that Futurama episode, one flip of a coin, and I'm losing each flip the last few years.

TL;DR
having a crisis at 30. wasted money on law school right before economic collapse."

The first church I grew up in was also a private school, it started out as a church and the private school helped fund the church, and now the school pretty much runs the church.

Then I became apart of church called the Church at South Las Vegas.

I came across this article that really pissed me off, a made me lose faith in Men's Health in general.

It was titled.
""12 Things to which you should never admit""
Interesting title aye? So I gave it a read. Some of it is alright, some stupid, but most down right ridiculous!! 

1. Hang over - Ok, fair enough. Basically saying ""don't be a pussy""

2. What you did with that girl last night - I don't have a problem with my mates saying if they had sex! Fuck oath, Men's health would kill themselves if they saw what is posted on seddit!

3. Your Salary - Good point!

4. A Childhood trauma - I personally think talking about that heavy shit makes you alot peaceful person! So no to that!

5. What makes you cry - ummmm?

6. Fancying your partners friends - True!

7. Your Favourite ""Adult entertainer"" - cant really relate! Not really a topic with the boys.

8. You can't fix something - If you dont ask you will never know. This is what I love about seddit. Everyone is willing to help you out with your technique. So no to that!

8. again?? (for some reason men's health dont believe in 10's) - Who you voted for in the election - Who gives a Flying Fuck!?

9. You believe in Ghosts - wft?!?!

11 (no 10 remember) - Breaking an ornament - True, i would just leg it!

NOW number 12. this is the one that really pissed me off! 
12 - Defeat!
Not accepting defeat is basically letting your pride/ego win. From what i know of Inner game, your ego is that little motherfucker that says ""Dude don't go up to her, she will just reject you."" It makes excuses, and stops you approaching women. You know what I say to my ego! FUCK YOU!

So not accepting defeat is basically making your ego bigger, which intern makes you into a class A douche-bag! Accepting defeat allows you to learn from your mistakes and makes you a more humble, ""better"" person.

Example - picking up a women
Say if you approached a women, and she basically told you to ""FUCK OFF"". Now someone who didnt accept the defeat of this approach would probably think, ""Fuck that bitch"" and probably go and creep out some other chick.
Now a PUA who did accept defeat would probably realise that he might of come off a bit creepy around her and was giving her kino at the wrong times. This allows him to assess what he did and improve his pick- up game. Thus making his chances higher with women! 

What are your thoughts seddit? I can post the article up if you want me to! I just feel sorry for the AFC who reads this and ACTUALLY believes this shit!

Part 2: Recovery


Enter seddit.  I slowly rose from the ashes, reading post after post about being high value, openers, keeping conversation going, body language, etc.  I started learning to refine what I'd already done naturally before, and attained results more consistently.  Being on my own helped me work on myself more, and I started getting better at pickup over the summer.  I began meeting a bunch of new people, and I soaked in all the wonderful advice.  However, I was doing it for the wrong reasons.  I read the posts but didn't fully understand them.  I saw seddit as a ""shortcut"" for sleeping with women.  I didn't understand what being an alpha male truly entailed.  I was running game and getting better, but getting more and more frustrated with rejection because I became so focused on the end game.  I did improve however, and by the end of the summer, I'd slept with more girls than I had in my entire life combined.  Yet, there was no further interaction with any of these women, I could turn them on but after that they'd be gone.  Everything felt so empty.  I didn't realize how easily they noticed I was still in love with somebody else when we'd be cuddling after sex.  They knew I was gaming them for self-validation, I was just able to keep it holed up until we'd be talking late at night and the real me would come out.  My front came crashing down once I reached that intimate point.  I thought sleeping with women would conquer my oneitis like so many sedditors had said.  I couldn't figure out what was driving this black hole of rejection and sadness.

Summer ends and the semester starts.  At this point I was a wreck, I still had feelings for her and even improving my game was making me more depressed.  I was so confused.  One day as I'm studying she called me and told me she wanted to see me.   We were living in the same city finally, and being my AFC self, I gladly invited her over.  She told me how she was still dating that guy but she had been having regrets the entire time.  I was crushed by the news and I tried to be strong by pushing her away and refusing to get back with her.  I told her about a girl I'd recently slept with and was starting to get to know better, and she went home shattered.  The next day I got a message from her boyfriend who angrily accused me of stealing his girlfriend which I laughed at considering I could say he did the same.

She came over that night, and that's when I left my self-respect behind.  I took her back.  We kicked it off right away, I forgave her for everything and we went right back to our old selves.  She lived at my place for an entire semester.  I was so happy, it was amazing, I had gotten my second chance and my life was back on track.  The depression was gone, so I stopped looking to improve myself.  That's where it all went wrong.  I went back to my old ways, I didn't feel the need to go out because previously the only purpose was to find women to sleep with.  Things went back into motion so quickly, and she felt super guilty about what she'd done so she tried really really hard to please me all the time.  This completely blinded me to my prior errors, and I reverted back to my content self, not creating any excitement, not pushing harder in school, playing a bunch of video games, just smoking with my closest friends every once in a while.  She became the reason behind everything I did, and I lost sight of everything else again.  It's crazy how obsessed I was.  As long as we were having sex and hanging out, I didn't need anything else.  

We both went back to our home town to visit family for winter break.  She broke up with me a day before we went back, all her stuff was still in my place.  This was a month and a half ago.  Turns out she had been cheating on me with the same guy and left me for him, AGAIN.  I had repeated my mistakes, and had become even more of an AFC during the time.  I had gotten her back into my life, and she became a bigger crutch for self validation than ever before.  

Before we'd become intimate I was a leader, confident, independent, outgoing, opinionated, smart, and willing to do anything to get what I wanted.  When I finally got the opportunity with her after waiting an entire childhood though, keeping her around became more important than everything in my life before then.  I lost all my other passions because I was so determined not to lose her.  When she left me the first time I didn't know how to handle it, I became a mess.

I was so caught up with her, that I became a needy person and it had only got worse after spending an entire summer failing to fix it.  When she came back to fix her ""mistake"", she found a weak beta looking for a girl to hold on to make him feel better about himself.  I had completely lost everything that had attracted her to me in the first place because I let myself be defeated by what she'd done to me.  I'm surprised she even lived with me as long as she did.  Had I been the person I am today, she never would've even considered leaving me.

This past month and a half has been brutal.  I let myself fall into the depressed state again, and it was worse than ever.  I was even suicidal.    I'd been browsing seddit on and off, but I wasn't myself at all.  I couldn't even pull myself to go out.  Women were repelled at even greater rates than ever before.  I wanted to drop out of school.  I was back at square one, and completely lost.  At this point I decided something had to be done, I couldn't live my life being dependent on her to feel good about myself.  I hated feeling so weak.  Luckily I'm passionate about school, and my Computer Science professors began to send plenty of my work my way as the semester picked up.  I was a complete mess still, but I kept myself busy and stopped thinking about everything else.  I spent the month alone mostly, trying to figure out what was wrong with me.  I began going to meditation sessions to clear my head.  I applied to a couple of internships, and finished my work early.

One day I tried texting her, and all I got for a reply was that she was in love with that other guy and that I needed to leave her alone.  I holed myself up and cried the rest of the day like a loser.  It was at that point when I broke.  I went off the edge and I considered ending my life.  It was drenched in tears, sobbing all alone in my bed when I realized something.  My entire life everyone had been telling how intelligent I was, what a good friend I was, what a great lover I was, how much I had going for me.  I didn't realize how much that had gotten to my head.  It's funny how no one ever tells you how you're going to get there, they just assume you've already got it made.  As if I never had to work for what I had.  

Everyone always believed in me, but at the time I thought it was just something that came naturally like everything else about my life.  I never understood that everyone had been talking about the strong person that I used to be.  I thought it was something I was born with, not something I had earned by being the confident passionate person I had been my entire life.  I was always reaching further than everyone else, working harder, and I never doubted myself.  That's why I accomplished everything I did, never had trouble in any area of life, and always women around.  I inspired people to better themselves, everyone was always trying to keep up and I had fun staying one step ahead.  I had thrown that all away because I thought this girl was more important than myself.  I had stopped my own ascent of self-improvement that had enabled me to do all the great things I've done.

Finally we get to the present.  This week has been crazy.  I just landed a research position with a professor at my school, and I got a potential job offer at a startup that just raised $18 million in venture capital last week.  I'm 20 years old, turning 21 in two weeks, and I finally found myself again.  I've reconnected with all my friends, cut my hair shorter then it's been since I was in 6th grade, and my approach anxiety is completely gone.  Women everywhere have been noticing me again, and I don't have trouble talking to any girl I want at any time of day.  I finally opened my eyes again and realized that I am worthy of attaining whatever I want in this world as long as I'm willing to work for it.  I don't need somebody to tell me I'm going places, I KNOW that I am and I'll be damned if I let anyone stop me.  I don't need any external validation anymore because I finally understand how important it is to have validation from within.  I no longer need to seduce women because I have become confident enough to be myself again.  All those posts about high value finally make sense to me.  I've stepped foot into my natural alpha state and it feels damn good to be focused on my passions again.  I've gained back my self-respect by reaching further than I ever have before, and BIG things are happening in my life because of it.  I've never been more excited for the future in my entire life, and it feels incredible to be a source of inspiration for other people again.  Never again will I believe somebody when they tell me I'm not good enough, because I know that's bullshit.  I'm done sitting back and waiting for my life to reach that point that everyone has always talked about.  I'm taking my life back right NOW.  

Thank you seddit for all your wise advice and for your patience in reading this.  I never could have gotten back into state if it wasn't for all of you.  For all those who didn't bother reading the wall of text, learn to have faith in yourself and nothing in life is ever going to stop you.  Everybody always talks about how important confidence is, but no one can teach that to you.  Get out and accomplish something, you're never going to convince others that you're something worth fighting for unless you've PROVED it to yourself.  Work every single day on being a better person, be healthy, and do stuff that you're truly passionate about.  If you don't reach out and take what you want it's always going to pass you by.  Don't stop believing in yourself, and focus on one step at a time.  Go talk to that cute girl you saw on campus today, she'll never have any idea how wonderful you are unless you go and SHOW her.  The way I see it, you can mope around and feel sorry for yourself or you can get off your ass and start becoming the person you've always wanted to be by working at it everyday.  TRULY believe that you ARE that amazing person, and one day you won't have to tell yourself anymore, it'll be apparent in every aspect of your life.  Your aura alone will begin to inspire the people around you, and the energy you radiate will attract more friends than you know what to do with.  If you want to be a social person, you have to learn to just let go and be authentic.  When you are genuinely satisfied with who you are, you'll never hesitate to go talk to that beautiful girl who just smiled at you from a distance because you won't be afraid anymore.  No woman can ever take away your accomplishments, your intellectual passions, or your value because they all come from within.  Stop feeding off other people's value, and become someone who takes joy in sharing their abundance with others.  Lastly, never stop striving for more.  The only limits are the ones you impose on yourself.  Anything is possible if you're willing to do what it takes."

This is the first time I've ever dated anyone before, which has left me with no history to base my choices off of. I met her online, and we've been dating since last June. But because we're both very busy, I'm in my last year of University, and she's working an internship, we haven't really been able to see each other for more than once or twice a month.

It's coming on a year that we've been dating, and things aren't how I'd pictured they'd be. I'm not excited by the relationship, but I do like the time we spend together. I've had one sided crushes before where I've felt giddy and excited, but in this relationship, it's calm and somethings I can forget that I'm even dating. Sexually, things are getting there, considering that this is my first relationship ever, and first sexual partner. 

I just don't know if I haven't given this relationship enough of a chance yet. Yes, it's been a year, but with barely 12 dates, it's not been much of a run. Or should I take the signs that I'm not as excited for this relationship as a sign and break it off now, so I'm leading her on?

tl;dr Should I give my relationship a longer chance if it doesn't excite me, or break it off to spare leading someone on?"

First, I'm not technically a computer science major.  I transferred from Junior College after getting A's on both my C++ classes, and then got a B and two C's at my 4 year school in my first semester, which is the one that I just completed.  That not only locked me out of the major (which requires a 2.5 Minimum GPA) but its also representing my GPA for the school as well.  This isn't really reflective of me as a student, I just had one bad semester.

What should I include on my resume?  I have completed courses on introductory,advanced, and data structure-related C++, the UNIX OS, and am currently enrolled in both a database class and an assembly language class, both of which I'm doing well in.

I still have a year and half left at school so this is just for summer internships,  I'm 25 years old and have quite a derth of customer-service related work in my past, including now."

I have always loved designing spaces and have been getting good grades in my design classes. One of the things that is required for me to graduate is that I complete a summer internship. My problem is that though I have been doing my research, for the past 3 years, on which internships I would like to apply for to fulfill this requirement, there are quite a few that are not being offered this year. There are many implications to the possibility that I do not get an internship for the summer, the worst being that I will not graduate on time. 

I am, of course, freaking out. 

The other problem I am having is that I am required to provide a portfolio for these internships and while I have enough material that I am proud of, I am having a really hard time putting it into an acceptable format. I have a crappy layout that I put together quickly to just start working with it but the more I think about it the more horrifying it becomes. So recently I have been avoiding working on it at all because I am chocking so badly on providing a graphic layout for my projects.

I have no idea how to fix either of these problems and the deadlines for the internship applications that I do know about are closing in. I was hoping that someone out there in /r/Design could provide me with some insight on how to get over designer's block and maybe even some internship suggestions? Anything would be appreciated.

TL;DR: I have very few internships to apply for, and I need one to graduate. I am also having major portfolio layout issues."

I'm working part time...go to work in the morning, go to class in afternoon  

I've only been at this 5 months and I am already sick of it.  Basically it's the wrong job for my personality.  I can handle talking to people but getting yelled at, getting in minor arguments and getting talked to negatively nearly every damn day really fucking wears on me.  Not to mention the stress...I don't get how someone could do this for more than 5 years, I seriously commend whoever has the skin thick enough to be a claims adjuster that long.  I'm a part time intern who works half the day so I don't even get as many claims as the actual adjusters but the phone ringing constantly with multiple people who want me to do something for them right now is too much. 

But it pays pretty well for a guy in college and my company has a pretty good reputation for paying well, giving good benefits and retaining employees.  I'm sure once I graduate I'd be able to get a decent full time claims job here.  

So, would it be difficult to get into underwriting if I worked a year as a claims adjuster?  And how is underwriting compared to adjusting?  Less stressful, less angry people, less juggling of a million different things all at once?

Any advice would be awesome, I'm just totally stressed out by this job.  I'm actually sitting here at home right now just dwelling on how I'm going to be able to fix or take care of quite a few number of difficult claims I have open at work when I get there tomorrow.  "
18ssla,5,2013-02-18,I graduated from med school last year and need help making financial decisions with big debt. ,The_Dot_,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/18ssla/i_graduated_from_med_school_last_year_and_need/,"Hey guys, I've been doing a lot of reading on personal finance lately. I'm 27 years old, married, graduated from med school in May '12, and am now working as an intern. I'm very torn with what to do with my finances at the moment. Before I start asking questions here's a breakdown of my wife and I's income and debt and a little about our goals. 

* Income: 80,000 combined
* Student Loan Debt: 126,000 combined student loans (108,000 of it mine)
* Other Debt: 6 more months of $150/mo car loan at 3.2% ($900 total)
* Savings: 2000 emergency fund
* Index funds: 5500
* IRA: 1000

About 88,000 of my student loans are at 6.55%. The rest of our student loans are at 5% or lower. 

We live relatively modestly and pay just over 1,600 dollars per month on our student loans, with everything more than the minimum payment going towards the 6.55% loans. Up until very recently I've felt this is the smartest thing to do financially. In fact, I was even planning on just applying the $150/mo I'm spending on the car loan towards my student loans when the car is paid off. 

In 4-5 years I will finish my residency training and make somewhere in the ballpark of 200-250k. We don't want children, and do want to retire very early (45 years old or so). Our plan is to keep our current lifestyle once I enter practice and put as much away as possible to retire on. 

Now for the questions. Should I keep paying so much on the student loans now, or start investing and saving more? I know you're supposed to do whatever brings the greatest increase in net worth, but the reason I have so many high interest student loans is because I had and continue to have no equity. Plus, I've made almost 8% on the S&amp;P 500 index fund since August. We also take a big hit in taxes being DINKs and all. Should I take the money I'm putting towards loans and put it toward my 401k (I have no employer contribution, but it'd be pre-tax)?

Any and all help is appreciated.

Dear Sir/Madam **(that's what they told us to put)**:

I am writing to express interest in your Summer Internship Program for the Summer 2013 season.  I believe the Institution's strong, diverse research core in developmental neurobiology would provide me a rare opportunity to immerse myself in my field of interest.  In addition, I have experience and skills that would make my summer at the Institution not only fruitful for me, but a worthwhile investment for my host lab.

I am a fourth-year biology major at My Neat University, and will be graduating in Spring 2014.  My research interests revolve around developmental neurobiology of invertebrate central nervous systems.  Invertebrates represent 97 percent of all animal species, and several non-chordate phyla have independently evolved nervous systems that show surprising similarities to, and differences from, our own.   The taxon on which I'd like to spend the bulk of my career as a principal investigator, as evidenced in two summers working on squid at the Museum and in Marine Biological Station, is the molluscan Cephalopoda, because of their complexity of neural organization and behavior which surpasses even those of some lower vertebrates.  This of course does not mean that I would limit myself to these animals; they may be the taxon that draws my interest most, but I am also interested in working on better-characterized model organisms such as Drosophila and C. elegans for the sake of exploring frontiers in neuroscience that are more useful to explore in proven genetically-tractable and easy-to-keep animals, and organisms in other phyla with nervous systems that are positioned somewhere between the diffuse nerve-net of Cnidaria and the most complex nervous systems in organization.  

The reason that I am applying to the Institution's program is twofold.  There are several researchers here (to whose labs I'm thinking of applying for graduate school through the Institution-Other University Joint Graduate Program for fall 2014) doing developmental work on invertebrate systems, both from a genetic and circuitry perspective.  There is also an opportunity to meet the enormous number of people working on developmental neurobiological work in non-invertebrate systems would provide added opportunities to become familiar with the state of developmental neurobiology and to develop further insight into what path I want my research to go down.

Working at the Institution this summer would be an incredible opportunity to add to my base of experience in research before graduate school and to start working toward becoming a mature researcher in my field.

Sincerely,

Here it goes....
The show is finally televised, it becomes a hit on tv making everyone from the office famous. In the first weeks of the show they become a hot topic in pop culture and are becoming a household name in the american home. 
Dunder Mifflin at this time is the same as always and not growing as a company. Andy is having problems managing the Scranton branch.
Michael Scott becomes the most famous out of all of them and everyone that was on the show becomes wealthy from the new found fame. 
Jim decides to come to Scranton because he realizes that the show has given him enough money that he can quit Athlead and go back home to settle with the life he had. 
Michael comes back to Scranton.
Toby reveals that he is the Scranton strangler out of a raged outburst when Michael arrives.This is due to his jealousy of Michael's huge fame. So he reveals himself so he can gain more fame for himself.
Michael goes to David Wallace and asks for them to be partners in owning Dunder Mifflin and says that he will pay for the costs of expanding Dunder Mifflin into a big chain store. He tells him that they will not only sell paper and printers but computers and have a cafe. A lounge cafe. So that people can make business lunches with clients, but also use Dunder Mifflin products in the cafe like the computers and paper so that clients of all businesses can show each other business ideas or presentations on PowerPoint. Michael comes up with the idea from his love of mixing fun to the work place, making business that is boring to him more social. He always thought the office is a family so he introduces a place where you can have the tools to do serious things and lounge and have snacks and drinks with coworkers or clients. 
David Wallace accepts the idea although it is very risky, because he took a risk with suck it and succeeded. He says they would be a perfect team because he is logical and Michael is creative.
They tell the office about what they plan to do and everyone in the office wants to put in there money to be apart of it. 
Michael tells Ryan to come back to Scranton and that he will hire him and Kelly if they decide to be apart of it. 
Holly and Michael move to Scranton. 
From all of there new found fame they get lots of investors in the new business and decides to make Dunder Mifflin International.

Flash Forward, to present day a salt and pepper haired looking Andy walks out of the airport. He is holding a little boy in a colorful suit and a bow tie and they both follow a beautiful red headed woman. They run to a town car. They finally reach their destination and walk towards a very tall building and on the first floor is a famous store, it is a hybrid between a Staples an Apple store a Starbucks and a Dave and Busters. They walk in and go to the counter and a Young woman says ""Hello Mr.Bernard i have your beet scones and coffee ready upstairs i just sent it up."" Andy says "" Wow your getting big huh? give us a hug! why are you behind the counter today aren't you coming up with us?. Young woman says ""yah i just have to get someone to cover the counter for me. How is Andrea?."" Andy says "" shes at band camp for the summer. But don't worry we are going to bring her for Christmas to play the cello you know how your uncle Mike loves that. I heard you been seeing Dwight's son."" Young girl says "" Yeah my mom said that if i marry D.J. my dad will have a heart attack. Last week me and D.J. hid the coffee beans bag so that when the new intern had to make coffee he would have to go to the back of the store to get more. Brian's daughter Sam recorded the whole thing and put it up on Youtube. We got in trouble and my dad said we always cause trouble and Hank is to old to run after us."" Andy laughs and says "" Lets go upstairs together CiCi we are going to be late."" they hug and talk while going up to the second floor. 

They enter a big cafeteria what looks to be still a few remains of an old office. In it there is one room that use to be a conference room that says ""T.V. ROOM"" on it. It is so full that teens and toddlers are sitting on the floor. Everyone smiles and cries out ""Hi"" and Andy passes all of the people from his old office to say hello. They are all wearing a name tag. Dwight, Jim, and Andy wear a name tags that say COO, CFO and CTO. Others have Name tags that say Accounting Executive ,  Quality Assurance Executive, Sales Executive, Customer service Executive. Michael has a dvd in his hand and his daughter says "" Dad can i have some of your coffee"" Holly says "" You don't want that trust me."" The girl sips the mug that says Worlds Best CEO on it she spits a little on the floor. Holly says ""Honey, that's your dads milk and sugar"". Philip is sitting on the floor and says ""HEY YOU GOT SOME MILK ON ME!"". Meanwhile Dwight says ""MICHAEL THIS PLACE IS A DEATH TRAP"". Pam says "" Yeah Michael why didn't we do this in one of the big conference rooms!. We have at least 4 in this building!."" Everyone starts to argue, and Michael screams ""SHUUUUU---Shuuuttt shhutt it"" Michael is next to a T.V. on the wall trying to put a dvd in it. He cant reach and gets annoyed and says "" Who put this so damn high"" Erin replies "" You told Nate to put it high so it looks bigger because you said that you wanted a t.v. bigger than 80 inches and we could'nt find one.' Michael screams ""Can someone put the damn dvd in please? Not you Gabe you'd just mess it up, your worst then Toby. 

The Video Plays with a tune and then it starts with a bathroom sign with the words The Office on it.Then our tv screens go to black.
 
Sorry this post was so long and so different from the normal ideas of how the office should end."

But if you have any you think would be more helpful please let me know.)

I really need help. 

My anger has ruined my life. It is ruthless, cruel, and unstoppable.
The best way I can explain it is that my anger is like boiling water. It slowly builds until it overflows and burns. 

Just last night, I tried to beat my boyfriend up. I punched walls until my knuckles were bleeding. I threw my phone, multiple pieces of furniture, and hid in a corner banging my head against the wall. This is even harder to admit but I have done self harm (cutting) and woke up not knowing what I had done. I hate it.

I cannot stop. I cannot stop. I want to so bad and it just gets worse. I really do not remember everything I do. It is terrible and I am ashamed.

I cannot focus in school. My boyfriend is afraid of me. My mother is miserable.

I am miserable. 

I have hidden it from my friends and family but they can now tell something is wrong. I have fully admitted that I have a problem but no one knows what to do. I have always been angry but over the past six months, my anger has become another person.

As a broke, college student without insurance, I am so lost. 

I have been to a free weekly therapy session through my university. It only helps so much. My therapist/counselor is an intern and unsure what to do with me. She is kind but I can tell I overwhelm her.

I do not know whether I need therapy or a complete brain transplant. My mother believes I have a hormone imbalance. She thinks it is something biological. My boyfriend and intern therapist think I have just held in too much and now it has exploded.

This angry person is not me. She is the cruel She Hulk. I cannot control her anymore. 



My questions:

* Should I see a doctor, therapist, hormone doctor or someone else?

* Is there anyone out there with this kind of crazy, uncontrollable hulk anger? What helps you?

* Does anyone out there have a hormone imbalance and receive shots? Have you behaved in this hulk-manner?

* **What do I do?**

I ""missed the boat"" so to speak for applying for internships for this upcoming summer 2013, bc I was planning on doing summer school and I spent most of free time studying for the actuarial 1/P exam (I ended up not passing the feb sitting, simply because I ran out of time, even though I knew how to do over 85% of the problems).

Anyways, I have this summer and summer of 2014 to find internships before I graduate. I'm starting to feel the pressure, because I've now realized that I won't get an internship summer '14 at a big name ibd, if I don't get some sort of experience this summer. 

So, for this summer, I was wondering if I should forgo summer school (it wasn't needed anyways in order to graduate), and apply for an expensive, scam-like internship program where an internship in finance is guaranteed. I was thinking of doing either the Dream Careers program or the New York School of Finance. However I'm scared that after giving them a chunk of change, I'll be stuck with a crappy pwm internship, or future companies will look at my resume and see that I ""paid my way"" into the industry? But how is paying my way into the industry any more unfair than people who use their family connections?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

He says it's due to stress from school. He also recently started an internship (his first job) and that's taken a huge toll on his energy, even on weekends. I really want to be understanding, but it feels like something new always comes up to stress him out. He feels more distant than usual, but he assures me that he still loves me more than ever. I've talked to him about it but all he really says is that I pressure him when I initiate. He says that if we lived together, it would be different because I would be around when he's actually in the mood as opposed to me only being there twice a week. But we won't be graduated until late this year and I'm worried about how he'll handle things like a full time job, taking care of bills, and all the other things that come with it.  My question is, should I continue to be patient with him and focus on being supportive until we actually have the opportunity to move in together?

So: Career over Relationship?",loving_intern,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/18wyoj/update_im_23m_about_to_decide_whether_or_not_im/,"Hi guys,

Here is the previous post: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/18vol6/im_23m_about_to_decide_whether_or_not_im_going_to/)

It was already a pretty tough situation. Most of you encouraged me to do the internship because it was a once in a lifetime opportunity and if my relationship was strong, it would survive.
Some gave beautiful anecdotes about their successes, others  told me LDRs wouldn't work. I kindly thank all of you for your input. Much appreciated.

Now to make it more interesting: I got an email today from a big pharmaceutical company in Berlin, asking me for some info and implying that they want to invite me to their facility on their costs for an interview for an internship.

Now what?
I have the internship opportunity of a lifetime on the other side of the ocean, possibly messing up my personal life but career-wise a pretty solid move. It's a good option and when I got it, it was the only option.

Now I might get the chance to do an almost equally awesome internship in the city that I initially wanted to live together in with my GF, at a pharmaceutical company (which I like more than academia). Now I don't know the specifics of the internship so I can't tell which one will be better based on content. The one in Boston seems pretty solid, for my skills as well as the credentials. The one in Berlin has a lot of perks... but I still need to find out what they can offer me.

This may be the toughest and most important decision in my life and you guys already helped a lot the first time. I would really appreciate your input with this one.

Note: initially, it wasn't even my plan or ambition to go to the USA for an internship. Not even sure if I want a career there (though saying no to anything, in this economy: not smart). Still, a major opportunity overseas, even though alone, will probably be incredible for my resumé. Same goes for the pharmaceutical company, excellent for my resumé and definitely better for my relationship. Also might be the financially more viable option (closer to home, lower living and travelling costs, possible internship pay which I wouldn't get in Boston).

So hit me with your best shot, Reddit.

P.S. going to sleep soon. will respond to as much as possible first thing in morning. 

**TL;DR**: Shit just got even more crazy."

I was so excited to come to college this past fall because it would be my first time out on my own, making my own decisions -- my first foray into adulthood and independence! After the first few exciting weeks, the activities started to die down and the real grind of work kicked in, along with some crippling homesickness. My parents have always been two of my best friends. When I was in high school and got ditched by some of my friends for more exciting plans, my parents would spend their whole weekends hanging out with me. My mom and I would get our nails done together, and we'd shop, and we'd have a grand old time. I really look up to and respect my mom. There are a lot of qualities about her that I want to see myself with one day. She's a great role model, and we love each other very much.

The problem is, we're not on the same page about something in particular: the very independence I was so excited to start experiencing last fall. In my opinion, I'm eighteen (I have been for some time) and living away from home for most of the year -- I should be able to operate sort of autonomously, without much interference from her. She texts me every day. Last weekend, she asked if it was OK for her to come visit me at college even though I'm coming home for a break next weekend. I have no classes on Fridays, but when I had a school-sanctioned break that really only consisted of a Friday free of classes (plus Saturday and Sunday off) she insisted I come home to visit. And even now, I'm working on a play (theatre major) that has rehearsals over Spring Break, and she expects me to tell them that my mom wants me home for the week, so I can't come back to my college town early. I've tried explaining that I need some space, especially when it comes to establishing my professional reputation (and that no professional director is going to take ""my mom won't let me"" as an excuse for an absence), but she takes it all so personally and thinks I don't want to be around her. Over Christmas Break, my boyfriend deployed overseas, and she would sort of make me feel guilty for spending so much time with him before he left because it meant that I wasn't spending it with her. The thing is though, when we spend time together, it typically just consists of us sitting in the living room on our computers watching TV. I mean, I love my mom, and spending time with her is important to me, but I feel like I'm being smothered a little. What if I just wanted to stay at school over spring break and enjoy the introvert time? I can't imagine her being okay with that. And, one day soon, I'll probably want to spend a summer away from home working at an internship or something like that, but I'm not sure I could even try to broach that topic without her getting upset. 

There's also the issue of my boyfriend (22). I feel like my parents should have no say in how I choose to conduct myself with my boyfriend. I'm on the pill, we're monogamous, and we love each other. My parents like him a whole lot, they think he's good to me, and they're totally fine with us dating, but they act like I'm still this pure thing that needs to be protected from all men. They're not even religious in the slightest, but they act like they have to protect my (long-gone) flower with all they've got. He and I are going on a trip together this summer with some friends, and the only way to get my parents to agree to letting me go with them was to assure them that he and I would not be sharing a room. He's in the military, and before his current deployment, I wanted to go to see him for a couple days before he left. He had a hotel room and arrangements were all made, but they refused to let me stay with him and made me stay with my grandparents who live nearby the base. Before he freakin' deployed! There's no way they can think that I'm not having sex with this man that I love, and there's no way that they can actually think that them forbidding me to sleep in the same bed as him a couple important nights before he left (for months) would keep me from doing it. My mom even knows that I stay at his apartment many nights when he and I are both at school. I know for a fact that my parents were living together for at least a year before they were married. They can't be oblivious. I think they just don't want to think about it. I also think that the actions that occur in my relationship should be none of their business. I know they're uncomfortable with that, so I'd never go against their wishes in their house (and I've told them that), but I think they need to butt out. 

There's definitely a double-standard between how my parents treat my brother (21) and how they treat me. I get that he's older, so they give him a lot more space, but when he was my age, they never asked where he was going at night. Occasionally they'd ask who he was going to be with, but for the most part, they just assumed they'd see him sometime. He'd ignore their texts and calls for weeks at a time, and though I saw how much it hurt my parents to feel like he was cutting them out, they started letting him do his own thing. Currently, he's not in school and he's living at home while he's saving up money, but he spends every night at his girlfriend's apartment. They realize this, but shrug it off because they ""cant control what he does."" I certainly don't want to hurt them and make them feel like they're not important to me anymore, but I don't know how to set the boundaries of my own life. 

Basically, I guess I'm just worried that my mom (and my dad, I suppose) still thinks of me as a child that she needs to check in on. I know I'll always be her baby, and I like that. My mom's a really cool gal. But I pretty much view myself as an adult. I know that I probably sound like a whiney teenager right now, but I really need some advice from you all who have had to do this. I definitely don't want to cut the cord with my mom, because I want her in my life, but I need to feel like I'm on my own, or I'll never learn how to be independent. 

Sorry for the long rant, and I'm really sorry if I sound dumb and stupid. Any advice is helpful. Thanks, twox."

Trying to breathe and not stress. Last time I was overcome with stress, I had panic attacks. And then having panic attacks stressed and freaked me out... It was a vicious cycle. I don't want to go back there. 

But I have been struggling with my brain and how foggy and tangled it is constantly. It all makes me feel so nauseated sick and also frustrated with myself. Stuff like this, anyone could make the decisions and take the steps. I want so much for everything to just be strands of yarn, simple and pointed out and clear. Instead, my brain takes everything and tangles it up in one ginormous ball and as I try to untangle, it just spins around and around.

My older sister wants to help me. I live with her and help take care of her two sons. She knows about my depression and wants to help me be active. Right now, she is making a nanny contract to help me. She wants me to tell her soon if I'll accept. 

What I struggle with is the fact that I don't want to live here anymore. I can't stand her arrogant and egocentric husband, I can't stand the days just passing with nothing to live for. I want to move out and live on my own or with my friend. But I can't because my dog. So until (and I really don't want this day to ever come) he dies...

No parents, no place that I feel like I'm home... I'm just one big ball of worthlessness and pain and hurt and lies. I feel nothing positive. And I just want to go to sleep till everything is how it's supposed to be or for everything to just stop. For me to just stop being. Because the journey to how things are supposed to be feels like walking around in a dark and empty land, like I'll never get there. I need to get there though. I don't want to end up living like this another day, let alone forever.

So this is my tangled web of a brain and heart. It's actually pretty clearer than what I thought I would write.

**A little on my life: 

-I've been struggling with depression for about 8 years

-Mom was severely physically and emotionally abusive, my three sisters and I were removed from her custody the summer before my senior year. Now 2 years out of high school

-Father left at 6, back at 10 and left at 12 on Christmas Eve.

-Raised and took care of three sisters while living with my mom. Used to taking care of myself and being left alone.

-Last year, I was in an internship. Lived with a family for about 6 months when I decided to move in with mom to try to mend the relationship. She drank a lot and we argued. She kicked me out with no notice within 3 months.

Any advice or comments are well welcomed. Thank you"

I am new to this subreddit so please direct me elsewhere if I am lost.

My business partner and I started up a small video production company just over a year ago. Over the course of that year, we have discovered that the people that we most want to provide media for are other small start-ups, non-profits, local artists/musicians (who self-promote and give back to the community), and we also enjoy helping students get on their feet in a real world environment (internships, training).

I have been toying with the idea to somehow work it out so we operate as a non-profit, but instead of giving away food/shelter/etc., we give away media (which, let's be honest, get's expensive!). This combines our two goals - helping those that need a leg up, and doing the media work we love.

Is this a viable goal? How would we get this in order?

Thanks in advice for any help or advice! Still trying to get our feet on the ground over here. :)"

Oh, and you need personal projects to show that you're passionate about programming. Like college applications all over again.~~

On a bright note, I actually deeply enjoy school and developing my practical coding skills in my free time. It's just that getting an internship is such a hit-and-miss game, and I'm starting to get desperate because most companies supposedly are full for the summer. For example, I'm waiting for a reply from Bloomberg after a coding interview last week, but there's no guarantee they'll reply or that I'll even be progressing in the interview process. Maybe I could shoot out more applications to companies (I've only applied to 10 or so, after all), but that's time better spent studying and coding, or maybe I could try for Google's Summer of Code but there are no guarantees I'll get anything.

TL;DR. Is this internship rush normal? Do people really spam internship applications and get used to rejection? Maybe my [resume](https://www.dropbox.com/s/bget8b4kz4t4b3o/example_resume.pdf) sucks, or maybe I should network more, I don't know. I'm just really lost."

I recently graduated from college a couple months ago with a B.S. degree in EE. I'm currently searching for hardware engineer/EE positions and have been applying for posted positions on company websites and on LinkedIn. I even tried putting my resume on job sites like Monster and CareerBuilder, but I've only been getting phony sales/recruiting job offers via email and phone. So far, I haven't had any luck. 

In terms of waiting time, a website once told me that 40 days after the original job posting, if you don't hear back from the job, then it's safe to assume that the position has been filled (or no longer available). **What's a good rule of thumb when applying for jobs to safely assume that the position is no longer available?** I keep hearing different things. What about applying to jobs and internships on LinkedIn? I have a well-polished profile and a decent amount of connections which are mostly classmates, friends, and family. I heard that recruiters browse around on LinkedIn a lot and they usually look for those with recommendations. I know it's helpful to have them, but is it really needed?

I also heard that in order to get the first job, you must have experience, which most people get from internships/co-ops while they're still in school. Since I'm a couple months out of school, do I still have a chance of getting an internship after college? I heard that they usually only want college students with 3.00+ for internships. I'm aware that around this time is internship application season and I've applied to a couple internships. However, only one of them replied asking for my GPA, which isn't that impressive (2.77/4.00). **How do I get a post-college internship with such a GPA?** I feel embarrassed and awkward to put it on my resume or even mention it. However, if I don't put it on, it'll be assumed that my GPA is even worse than it actually is. Besides my poor GPA, I have nothing else to hide. 

All I want now is an opportunity to gain some relevant experience so that I can eventually get my first job. "
18wns8,6,2013-02-20,What to do with two Roth IRAs?  One at Vanguard and one at TD Ameritrade.,NorwegianPearl,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/18wns8/what_to_do_with_two_roth_iras_one_at_vanguard_and/,"Howdy folks,

In 2011 I opened a Roth IRA (without brokerage ability) at Vanguard with wages from my summer internship and put in as much as I could.  I've since graduated, got a job, and maxed contributions for 2012 and 2013.  

I figured it wasn't much of my mom's business what I did with money, but she casually mentioned to me that I had a Roth IRA.  I was puzzled how she knew I had opened one, but it turns out she was speaking of another Roth IRA with TD Ameritrade opened by my grandfather without my knowledge.  He never put in much money...100 dollars here, 100 dollars there for Christmas or Birthday.  I'm in the process of gaining control of the funds here.

I have also opened a separate brokerage account with TD Ameritrade.

The TD IRA is at approximately 3000 dollars and my Vanguard IRA is at approximately 13,000

I know that I can have multiple Roth IRAs so long as yearly contribution is &lt;5500, but it seems to me that it would make sense to consolidate this money in one way or another.  

The options that become apparent to me are these:
1) Roll TD Ameritrade Roth IRA over into my Vanguard Roth IRA

2) Roll Vanguard Roth IRA over into TD Ameritrade Roth IRA

3) Withdraw contributions from one of my IRAs and roll over/take penalties on earnings, and invest contributions in my brokerage account.

I'd rather not pay any fees or lose money, but to me it doesn't make sense to me to keep 2 separate IRAs going as the funds are not easily transferrable to me. 

I would appreciate your guys' opinions on this subject. 

Thanks!"

18wm63,1,2013-02-20,Former soldier / Columbia student looking to pick up an engineering major: Advice Requested!,[deleted],EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/18wm63/former_soldier_columbia_student_looking_to_pick/,"Hey folks,

I’m currently in my junior year as an economics major at Columbia University and am planning to pursue my school’s combined degree program with SEAS starting next year. Unfortunately, one of the aspects of the combined program is that I must choose an engineering major in advance and do not have an opportunity to change majors once I make my selection.

To that end, I was hoping I could get some of your opinions about what path I should pursue. The two majors I am currently most drawn to are Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering, but that is not to say I’m not interested in other fields as well. The only majors I’m really not terribly interested in are Applied Math/Physics, Civil, Environmental, and Financial.

For a little background about me, after high school I served 5 years in the Army as an infantryman, radio-telephone operator, and drone pilot. I’ve been at Columbia for the past two and a half years, and had originally planned to work in finance upon graduation, but after experiencing the industry through recent internships I’ve realized that I’m not at all interested in the work.  

It would probably help to list some of my motivations for studying engineering in the first place, so below is a very non-exhaustive list of my interests:

Augmented Reality,
Automation,
Artificial Intelligence,
Cloud Computing,
Educational Technology,
Human-Computer Interaction,
Information Science,
Materials,
Powered Exoskeleton,
Prosthetics,
Weaponry

I suppose the common thread here (besides my status as a Heinlein enthusiast) is that I’m interested in making individuals more productive through the applications of technology.

I know that there isn’t a ton of demand for people to work in some of these fields, and I am definitely concerned about “real job” prospects upon graduation.

Thanks for your help!"

18wl12,5,2013-02-20,A new type of suicidal thoughts,[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/18wl12/a_new_type_of_suicidal_thoughts/,"First off, might as well give some basic information. I'm 21 and I've been plagued with these thoughts since I was in my early teens. I've been through years of therapy, tonnes of different anti-depressants and anti-psychotics, none of it really seemed to help that much at all. I've just learned to live with it. Even after going through all these different professionals I've still never been properly diagnosed as having anything other than a slight anxiety disorder. 

I do like therapy though, it's nice to have that, but since I'm out of work for the next month or so, I'm out of therapy until I get my insurance back and I haven't been on any pills for over a year now.

In the past I used to idealize suicide as an escape from the pain and monotony of living, but lately it has become a much more intriguing idea. Nothing is necessarily wrong in my life, in fact things are going pretty well. I hang out with my friends as much as I can, I'm doing well in my college courses, I have two possible internships lined up for the summer, I go back to work in a month or so as I previously stated, and lately I've been hooking up with this girl every other weekend or so when we both are free. Despite all this I still constantly live with these suicidal thoughts.

They just seem to be there, as they've always had. The more I think about them, the more interesting it seems to actually go through with it. I honestly just want these thoughts to stop. Everything is perfect and I hate it because at the end of the day I still wish to not wake up the next day. I exercise frequently, I eat healthily, but I do smoke cigarettes and drink. I do not know if that's a contributing factor, honestly it's been something that I've picked up in the last year and a half to help pass the time and help cope with the stresses of juggling relationships with friends and family, work, and college courses. 

In short I want to commit suicide as an escape from having suicidal thoughts rather than as an escape from living and I have never experienced this before. I do not know what to do. Maybe it's because I have too much free time now, maybe it'll go away for a little while when I go back to work, but I highly doubt it'll go away fully. 24 hours is a lot of time and I try to use it as to the best of my ability with reading, exercise, writing, Netflix, video games, school work, classes, hanging out with people, but no matter how I do I'm still left alone with these thoughts and I'm getting sick of it. It's as though I don't know how to be happy."
18wkp7,9,2013-02-20,Looking for some direction to make a tedious task at work more bearable. [Language suggestion],BokBox,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/18wkp7/looking_for_some_direction_to_make_a_tedious_task/,"I have a project I would like to do that will benefit me and my coworkers. There is not deadline. I have wanted to expand my coding knowledge for a while and I find learning easier when there is a real goal. I would like to learn Python but am open to any other language that would be easiest to accomplish this. The way I see it there are two distinct parts and I don’t know if one script would take care of both.

I work for an Engineering company and part of our work involves unavoidable copy and pasting of data into templates. Not that I think it matters, but they are check out documents used to verify completed work.  As of right now we have to copy the template, which is an excel sheet, and rename it the TAG NAME of the point we are going to check out. We now have a new excel file for each point we are going to checkout.  Next is referencing another sheet we usually receive from the client, which is typically another excel spreadsheet. Sometimes we have to dig into our program and pull the information out manually.  In this sheet it has the Tagname, Description, Controller#, Rack#, Channel#, Slot#, and so on. We then take each piece of data and copy it into the new copied template one by one where they belong. This takes quite a long time and has some potential for user error with so much copy and paste. This grunt work is often given to co-ops or interns who are not all that thrilled about it.

TL;DR 

Part one. Copy a single template file many times with names provided in a spread sheet or other document. 

Part two. Copy specific cells from one sheet in excel to another specific cell in each of the new documents. 

If someone could put me on the right path and tell me how feasible this is I would greatly appreciate it.

Thank you.

I've thought that one of the biggest things LoL lacked was a sandbox mode to test builds and matchups. I wanted to make one for quite a long time, but never had a good database to pull info from. Frustrated, I made my own (by scraping LoLWiki and the NA site itself). Not wanting to keep the goodies to myself, I exported the data into a handy API so that any other interested developers would be free to create as well. The system is easily patchable, so whatever you make with the data will always be up to date!

As of now, I've only had the time to make champ data for champions whos name starts with A (being a full time student at University, and all), but the data is to the point where it (probably) won't be changing anymore. I wanted to go ahead and post about it so that any other developers looking to use the API could provide feedback before it gets into too many hands. Now that I have the scripts written, getting the rest of the champ data in there won't be a big deal. ^(Oh, also, XML support is coming soon, so don't worry!)

The project is entirely open source. The code can be found at http://github.com/Xavdidtheshadow/lolapi and the live app (that doesn't do much (and isn't meant to, really; it's just for calling)) is at lolapi.herokuapp.com. 

Additionally, the sandbox is in that repo (battle.py). It's command line but quite easy to use. I'm actively working on it, so bugs'll disappear throughout the day. There are instructions to download and use it now, though a bit of programming experience is recommended (this'll be more accessible when it's done). 

Coincedentially, this is the centerpiece for my internship application at Riot, so any and all feedback is *greatly* appreciated.

Thanks much!

* **What I need:** Keyboard and mouse, optical drive (with Blu-ray capability preferably), fans (fans fans fans!), wireless card, upgrade-able to watercooling in the future, possible addition of a second monitor in the future (so probably a second GPU to go with), a sturdy-looking case (get that Phantom crap out of my face), some color coordination with the parts--though I don't really care to make it look like a nightclub in my room with a bunch of LEDs

18wckm,49,2013-02-20,Something is in my room.,GoldenCoin,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/18wckm/something_is_in_my_room/,"I have always been known for my creativity and my fantasy. When I was little, my fantasy used to spread around me at night or whenever I was bored. It was fun because I didn't have many friends to play with, but now it's killing my sanity. Sometimes when I look around I see dark spots or figures, I thought that it was because my eyes weren't clear any more so I shrugged this off.

Whenever I can't sleep I like to look around in my room or outside the window. I like how there's little to no light, but you can still make out the shapes and silhouettes of your possessions. How you can easily put a hand in front of your face and make that little bit of light ""Disappear"". Since some time I had some weird moments at night.

I would hear things fall from my desk. I first thought it was because of the fact that it was right under my bed, I sleep in a high sleeper, but I could never find what had fallen onto the ground. One time I heard one of my pencil jars fall, I got out of bed and turned on the light. There was nothing on the floor, my jar of pencils was sitting perfectly on my desk far away from the edge. I shrugged it off and went back to bed, it was too late to even deal with that. But now it started to get worse. My mom usually wakes me up in the weekends. I heard her once asking me kindly to get out of bed. I told her that I would be downstairs in a minute. I stayed in bed for a little longer before deciding to get out. I had a strange feeling that morning, but couldn't put my finger on it. On my way down my mother came up. ""Oh, you're awake, I was just about to wake you up!"" She smiled and went back down. She was planning on waking me, strange, she had just been in my room. That's when it hit me. I didn't hear her opening and closing my door. After breakfast I asked her if she had been in my room and was just messing with me on which she replied: ""No, I was here packing out the groceries."" I was confused and slightly disturbed, but shrugged it off anyway. This happened a few times more and then stopped.

Today it happened again. I woke up and checked the time. 5:40 AM. I turned around in my bed and before I could close my eyes again, I heard something. ""Are you coming?"" It was my sister's voice. I remembered that mom had asked her if she wanted to come with her to work, but that she had to wake up around 5:30 AM to do so. I turned around to tell her that I didn't had to wake up until an hour later, but there was nothing in my room. I heard my sister loud and clear as if she was standing just next to my bed, yet I was looking around in my room and nobody was there. 

I could make out the shapes of a chair with a pile of clothing, my small closet on which my aquarium stands, my fan and my desk chair. Again I got an eerie feeling, but went to bed anyway. I kept on thinking about it, when mom picked me up from the station I told her that I had heard my sister in my room around the time that she wakes up. Mom told me that my sister hadn't come with her since it was too early for her. 
At home my mom asked my sister who got confused. ""Could it be that I was sleepwalking?"" ""Well I turned and look in my room and-"" ""And? Was I standing there?"" ""No. There was nothing in my room."" My sister looked weird and confused, but we didn't talk about it any more and mom laughed it off telling me that I was just dreaming of my sister. I went back to my room and I probably wont be able to have a good night's rest. I am certain something was in my room. I know something was in my room. I know this, because I saw it. I don't know what it was, but I saw it and it probably saw me too. 

I was too sleepy to notice it at first, but I now know why it all felt so weird. I don't own an aquarium any longer. I got rid of it a few days ago. There is nothing on the spot where it used to be. But last night, something was sitting there. Something was watching. Something is in my room and it's watching me.

[UPDATE] Somebody has been in my room today. I came back from internship and found my desk chair in the middle of the room. It couldn't have been my father, he would've opened my curtains and complain about the mess in my room when he'd see me. My mother is also not possible, she would've told me so. There's only one person left, my sister, but she doesn't come into my room at all. She says my room is ""too cold to stand it for longer than a minute"" I actually don't notice my room being too cold. Maybe I am just losing my sanity.

[UPDATE] Why? Why did I have to double-check? I asked my mother if anybody as been in my room today. It turns out that nobody has been in my room. My mother and sister, who I freaked out a little bit, are saying that it was probably dad. He may have been on the level where I sleep, but I know my father well enough. I never open my curtains in the morning, if he had been in my room he would've opened them and left my door open. I just hope it was him, because I forgot to mention one big detail. (I thought it was useless) 

Now that night is almost here I really need this written down. The open little spot, that was created when my chair had been placed in the middle of my room, is actually right under the place where I have my head when I sleep. It's also right across from where my aquarium used to be. My chair was facing me when I came in, as if somebody could've been sitting there. Waiting for me. I don't know if I will get much sleep tonight.

[UPDATE] It may have left my room. I am not certain, but it could be running around the house. My mother said she heard somebody downstairs in the morning after I left yesterday. It was about 10 minutes after I left that she heard noises. She got up and checked downstairs, only to find nobody. If it had been me she should've seen me still closing all the doors on my way out."
18w4og,1,2013-02-20,Questions about my future.,doerings,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/18w4og/questions_about_my_future/,"Hello, 

I have a question about my ideal future plans and whether or not they are achievable. I am currently pursuing my business degree with a concentration in accounting at a university in South Carolina at a junior status. My plan is to get an internship before I graduate from my university. I would then like to move to Arizona and get into the ASU masters program while working out there; eventually getting my CPA license. My GPA coming out of my current university will be anywhere from 3.0 to 3.5, obviously I will try to get it as high as possible. Currently I am at a 3.0 both overall and accounting. I am nervous about this because I do not have any connections in Arizona and will have obviously made some here in South Carolina. My question is: is this goal achievable? Will I be able to make this transition, or is networking the only way to get a job? How exactly should I go about applying for jobs in Arizona? 

Thank you in advance for your advice. I can provide more information if needed. "

S.O. left me stranded after saying he wouldn't.,SuperAwkwardGirl,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18vyqy/just_venting_so_left_me_stranded_after_saying_he/,"This is a little bit of a rant.  I'm just so mad right now that I need to vent.  Hope it's okay to do it here.  

So: my husband and I share a car, which is not a big deal most of the time.  Usually when I need the car, he takes his bike and when he needs the car I bike or take the bus.  And usually when I need the car for going someplace too far to bike/not easily bus-able, it's there.

Well, this morning, I had to be at my internship at 8:30, and although it is technically bus-able, it's a ten-minute drive or else almost an hour by bus due to the fact that buses in a small city aren't always the best, and we had talked last night and agreed that I would have the car, like I do every time I go to this particular internship site (I go to different sites on different days).  Anyway, at 8:15, I go to get in the car and discover that it's not there. Because he took it to work.  After saying that I could have it for the morning, and me scheduling myself based on having the car.

Anyway, I probably should have just gone to my internship late, although it would have been about an hour and a half late by the time I arrived (stupid bus schedule) for a three-hour shift, so I just called out and will make up the time later.  Which is embarrassing, because I was upset and didn't have the presence of mind to say I was sick, so I said I had no ride, but it's not the end of the world or anything, just kind of embarrassing.

Anyway, I am just SO MAD at husband.  SO MAD.  I know it's kind of petty to still be so mad, but it's also my career, and we talked about it last night, so I feel really disregarded, and also I was up early for what turned out to be no reason.  I know that it's not *that* early for most folks, but it is for me, due to crazy schedule that has me burning the candle at both ends.

Anyway, thanks for reading.  I feel like I want to smash something.  I'm sure I'll get over it, but right now I feel so angry and disregarded and there isn't really anything I can do about it.  "

I want to work in Wealth Management for Private Clients, but have also been considering Financial Planning roles. So this week and next week I got about 6 interviews set up, some slightly more relevant than others.

On Monday I had a final interview for a Financial Planning assistant postion (A), and I found out yesterday I got it! Then on Tuesday I had a final interview with the Wealth Management company (B) I did my main internship with - I haven't heard that I got it yet but they told me I was pretty much a shoe in for the role, which was nice to hear. Tomorrow I have an interview with a firm (C) who are similar in size to A, and although I haven't heard much about them I looked them up and they are the 3rd highest rated company to work for in the UK (2012). 

I was going to cancel the interview tomorrow (and the ones next week), and then take the job from A if B reject me, or have the choice between the two if they don't - I'd probably pick B based on the role. The only thing is that B is a temporary role, and I'd have to interview again for a permanent position in 3 and 6 months time. This is worrying me quite a lot as I would really like some stability to look forward to. 

What should I do? My options are:

A) Cancel all further interviews including at C, wait to hear from B, make my decision.

B) Go to C tomorrow (I haven't prepped for the role at all yet), and potentially have to chose between 3 positions, even though I probably won't pick C if I have all 3 to chose from. If it was between A and C, maybe. 

C) Ring up B, tell them I have received an offer from A, ask what the status of my application is?


I know this seems a bit petty seeing as I've got some good options to pick from, but it is all happening very fast (both A and B would want me to start on Monday). I feel some very strong loyalty towards B as they had me in for my internship and have been very supportive, I'm only put off by the temporary status of the role. And the salary, I suspect it won't be as high as A.

I have hardly any debt. I've been learning how to program off and on for the last 8 months, what I'm able to do is growing more intricate slowly. I can trade pretty well in the markets, I've made a few thousand with the little amount of money I have, I can tell when things will move a lot of the time since I grew up watching it daily.

Life has given me a lot, but I'm at a loss of what to do right now. I guess I'm looking for different types of financial certifications that are hard to get, but require little work experience or really good graduate programs. I don't live or want to live an expensive life style, mine would run 25k at most per year, though that does depend on the area.

This firm has done about $25mil/yr in sales, I assumed they'd have enough money to pay an intern. The opportunities I've applied to at some banks and consulting companies have all been paid spots.

The other thing is that the company retains only 14% of their interns for jobs, and the full time staff is 100% commission-based.

Is that pretty normal for the industry? 

The way it was explained to me is that I'd get a chance to do the research, walkthroughs, valuations and watch the pitches and the possibly get offered a spot to come on and get my lisc with the firm.

First year associates should expect 40-50k and reach 100k by 2nd or 3rd year.

So: Career over Relationship?",loving_intern,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/18vol6/im_23m_about_to_decide_whether_or_not_im_going_to/,"So for finishing my Master's programma I (23, M) need to do an internship and I really want to do one abroad.

GF (23), needs to write her Master thesis and is pretty much flexible in her choice of residence. Half a year ago we decided we wanted to go to Berlin and live together. I'd do an internship there and she'd write her thesis.

No internship to be found in Berlin but still I need the internship to finish my education and I don't have the time to wait. Looking further, I got some connections with a University on the other side of the Ocean. It's not final yet, but it's looking really good. We discussed it and she encouraged me to look further because of the time. We would only go to Berlin if I was able to get an internship there.

I know this is a great opportunity for me to perform a 6-month internship over there (one of the top Universities in US) but I feel like I'm ruining my great relationship (1.5 years now, known each other almost 2 years, everything peachy). She has her doubts we can survive this, and so do I. I want to but I don't believe in fairy-tale situations. The realism is that 6 months (or maybe more) apart, with an ocean between us and hardly any possibilities for contact will be excruciating. I know I can have a great future with her and that's what I want but I don't want her to suffer through this.

So I'm conflicted to the point of whether I should take the internship or not and if I do, how do I keep my relationship intact... or should I even try?

Note: I love this girl really much. I can see us living together and being partners for years to come. I absolutely believe we have a good thing going on, solid and good.

Also, before you start about: ""6 months is nothing compared to other people in a LDR for years"". It might not be the end of the world but it's more than enough to question the survivability of a relationship (i think). Also, I think the maximum amount of times we can see each other in that period in 1 time only.

In addition: ""If you really want it, it can work"" is what I've been hearing around me. Doesn't help at all as of yet.

**TL;DR: Going to study abroad for 6 months instead of living together with GF. Decision might condemn my relationship to oblivion.**

I've been here for 2 weeks now and I have had at least 6 people walk up to me begging for some money (1EUR most of the time). Most of the time their excuse is that they feel sorry to beg but could really use a sandwich/hot coffee for the cold weather.

The first person that came up to me sort of caught me by surprise as I was running to catch the train so I gave him some change I had in my pocket.

The second person walked up to me last week and I just knew he was going to beg for money, he wanted a hot coffee. I was polite but I only had 20cents in my pocket so I gave him that, hey, better than nothing.

I got cursed out and all that bullshit. Just him making a scene in general.

Now I awkwardly walk away when I notice someone coming up to me but I don't feel like I should be adjusting my schedule just because of them.

I guess I will start with why I think that I'm depressed; I'm 22 and in my 4th year of college (on the 5 year plan) and the last year and a half have been full of new and exciting times in my life but at the same time I have never felt right about it. I originally went to community college for two years which was basically like high school as I was still living at home hanging out with the same people and doing most of the same stuff, but a year and a half ago I got to the breaking point to where I thought  I just had to get out of my situation. Keep in mind at this point my options were awesome, if I stayed in community college just one more year I would be able to transfer to some pretty nice schools such as UCSB, UCSD or UC Davis. I was just one year away but regrettably I opted out of the third year and transferred to where I am now (not going to say) but I transferred out of state and ended up going to literally one of the worst academically ranked colleges in the United States (I think it's 20-30 spots away from the worst school in the US.) I didn't know this at the time but had heard a lot of good things about the business school, and I am a sports fanatic and always wanted to go to a school with college football and basketball  which swayed my decision a little bit. Also, fuck it, I like to party every now and again. 

At this point you probably think I'm a complete retard, don't worry because I do too. I regret this decision everyday I wake up. I just think, what in the fuck am I doing here? Why the fuck am I so stupid? 

In CC I was a good student, I did all my work, studied everyday for hours, and ended up pulling a few semesters with 3.8+ and I believe I ended up with around a 3.4 or 3.5 before I left. Ever since I've been here there hasn't been a day where I can rekindle that kind of focus, hardly an hour of it much less a day. My first year my GPA fell to a lowly 2.7; I drank, I smoked, I did other kinds of drugs (I'll get into that part later.) Now school is a fucking nightmare. I almost failed my first class ever last semester, I can't grasp or memorize material like I used to (albeit upper division &gt; general ed shit but still) and I literally just feel stupid. I can't focus here, I can't crack down. I have no self control anymore no matter what kind of routine I try to get myself into. I constantly have shitty thought processes of dropping out of school and saying ""fuck this."" I used to be interested in school, I used to enjoy the process of studying. Now I fucking hate it, I hate everything about school but alas I grind away getting shitty grades that won't get me an internship anywhere. I realize my attitude sucks, I've changed a lot from where I used to be in a bad way. 

 I am also a member of a club athletic team who frankly, have never been a good team or had a good record. In high school I was a starter and I worked my ass off everyday to get there, and when  I came here playing this sport was one of my biggest passions I had and I worked my ass off to succeed in it. Long story short, I wasn't as good as I thought I could be, it just didn't happen. Two years in community college took a lot of mojo off my game despite being in the gym all the damn time in CC and practicing every weekend. Part of it I feel like has to do with the way the program is run but I can't say I've made every opportunity count either, I guess it just wasn't meant to be. I had a HUGE ego coming into the program because I felt prepared and ready to kick ass, unfortunately the coaches didn't think so and they slowly ruined my confidence by not playing me and other shit. I ended up starting for most of the season but by that point my head was so fucked with lack of confidence I was just never the same. Every little mistake I was reminded of, it was just too much for me to be perfect all the fucking time and kept thoughts trickling in the back of my head of doubt. I still play, and it's still the same old shit except I don't start anymore and I barely play at all. I'm only there to stay in shape and to hang out with my friends. The bull shit is even worse this year but luckily I have thick skin. (And before anyone mentions it, I've talked with all the staff face to face in a respectful manner countless times, but they say one thing and act in another way and it just pissed me off to no end.)


So that's why I think I'm depressed. I went from a life of doing well in school (even had a girlfriend for a little bit) and being good at sports to essentially feeling like the epitome of stupidity and un-athleticism. I also had a great group of friends (who would have split eventually) that was a bummer to leave behind. I made a decision to go to a school that I don't care for, in a city I have no fucking idea of why I would come here, living a life that had no merit or plan except for a decision on a whim. I fucked up and everyday being here I'm reminded of it, and it kills me inside every damn day. I think about just offing myself sometimes for putting myself in this situation, for being this stupid. 

On the flip side I feel like I could just be a fuck up plain and simple. I've casually smoked pot since I was 16, I don't feel like it had any negative bearing on me until I transferred from CC. I started smoking more and more, literally multiple times a day everyday. I had never done this before, I was going to class stoned off my ass sometimes, or just getting so high at night I wouldn't wake up the next day because I would be groggy as shit. (We have late practices from like 9-12am, so I would blaze after practice late at night) I think pot is a wonderful drug in moderation, things like social anxiety have gone almost completely away since I started using it, but I wasn't using it in moderation. Eventually the end of the semester comes and I find myself wanting to go hard in the paint after my last final is over. I end up getting offered some shrooms and I ate them (I did a hit of acid like a year before this but this was a much stronger amount of shrooms.) I swear to god I think these shrooms fucked my head up. During the trip there was a point where I was standing up and it felt like my brain exploded (ok not really) but my vision went black and I had to sit down immediately or risk passing out. After that I went home for summer vacation, and I stop doing any physical activity whatsoever. I started playing Diablo 3 for hours on hours everyday and developed a chewing tobacco addiction; I got fat and out of shape, smoked pot everyday, quit sports, did more shrooms, starting fucking around with cocaine and other pills (shrooms once, coke 2-3 times, and some nights drinking &amp; eating vicodins) By the end of summer I didn't want to go back to school, I sure as fuck didn't want to play sports anymore, I didn't want to work out or exercise or anything that I held as productive for a large period of my life. I just became content being my definition of a bum. 

I tried dedicating last fall to school, I put in a shit ton of effort compared to the year before. GPA still sucked, and now I feel like a retard for not being able to get a 3.0 at one of the worst ranked colleges in the US while riding the bench on a low-tier club sports team. My confidence is fucked, I haven't had a girlfriend in years and I'm lonely as shit, I just pretty much wonder how I can snap out of this funk of feeling like such a piece of shit and just forget about it and live my life. I can't love myself right now or accept what I've done, and I have no idea how. Maybe I'm just getting a reality check and not handling it well, maybe I'm being a pussy, or maybe it's something I don't know. My mom has depression and my brother THINKS he may be depressed to, we have alcoholism in the family and my mom's side definitely has some mental issues if that matters. Everyday since summer the things I used to do on a daily basis (study, go to the gym, getting things done and being organized and having DRIVE) are so much harder than it used to be. It takes so much effort to just get out of bed in the morning and go to class. Sometimes I won't even make food when I'm hungry. Everything is more difficult for me to find purpose in myself to actually accomplish. 

To anyone who actually read this, thank you and if you have anything to say don't hesitate, mean or nice.

18vejk,0,2013-02-20,Questions about building a design portfolio,[deleted],Design,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/18vejk/questions_about_building_a_design_portfolio/,"Hey r/design, I have some questions. I am currently a college student pursuing fine arts and art education. I realized late in my college career that I would like to focus more on design but design courses at my school could never fit into my schedule. I am going to be graduating soon and I'd like to start to build a design portfolio and possibly get into the design field as a future career. 

How is the best way to go about doing this? 

Would it be a waste of time/money to pursue an entire certificate in graphic design from an art school? Or possibly even a MFA in design? Or would you need a design related portfolio to even get accepted into an mfa program? 

Would taking some basic design courses at a community college be more feasible? 

Would a person who concentrated in fine arts be able to find an internship in design and get experience that way? 

Or should I just pick up some design related books and try to build a portfolio independently? If so what are some books that you recommend?

18vcvg,4,2013-02-20,Lost undergrad needing insight to software engineering career path,daayyvid,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/18vcvg/lost_undergrad_needing_insight_to_software/,"Long story short, I am lost as to how I should proceed in a CS or software engineering career.

Some back story:

I am a third-year undergraduate CS major at UCLA with ~3.6 GPA. I grew up teaching myself web development in PHP. While at UCLA, I’ve learned C++ and done many projects in C. I’ve dabbled with Python and a little of Ruby. In classes, we cover other languages and various theoretical CS topics as well, but I feel like I haven’t learned anything practical during my time here.

I’ve recently been trying to land an internship for the summer. With my peers already on their second internship, combined with the stress of the interview process, it is making me question whether I am fit for the CS field. I couldn’t land an internship last year, and have landed interviews but already received a few rejections this year. I have one interview left with another company. How do I get better at the interviewing process? Do I prepare for it like a test (I have Cracking the Coding Interview book), or am I expected to know these topics already? I think part of it has to do with my nerves and anxiousness (I need to relax), but the other part is probably not enough preparation for a lot of these interview questions.

In these interviews for big companies I’ve been having they mainly interview on core CS concepts, algorithms, data structures, etc. It gives me the impression that to be a software engineer I need to be a “super nerd” who is always engrossed in algorithms, etc, when really what I enjoy on a high level is making cool things, and understanding how things are built, which is probably why web development was appealing to me in the first place. Seems like sort of a disparity between CS and SE.

Lately I haven’t been doing much coding or side-projects on my own. What should I learn and what should I do as I am nearing graduation and will soon be in search of a job? As I’m already experienced in and enjoy web development, I could learn Python/Django or Ruby/RoR, or get into mobile development. The problem is that I don’t want to be stuck in this web development world forever. How is job market and pay for RoR developers right now?

I know there are a lot more cool things out there in CS. If I don’t keep going down this web dev road, how should I maximize my time left in college, and what should I learn? What other kinds of things do software engineers work on?

Is grad school an option? I don't really want another two years of school. Something like AppAcademy looks fun, though.

Hope this wasn’t too long or boring of a read! Looking for some advice and insight into the software engineering world. Just trying to figure out next steps as I will soon be approaching graduation and have yet to have any real-world experience in this field."

18vanm,2,2013-02-20,Should I move out?,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/18vanm/should_i_move_out/,"I'm in a tough situation at home now. My sister and I (I'm 19, she's 14) are always fighting at home, when I'm home. I haven't been home much because of work, school, and seeing my girlfriend, but when I am home, there's always something happening. My sister is always disrespectful to everyone in the house, doesn't listen, etc, and quite frankly I'm sick of it. My dad stays out of it unless it's absolutely necessary to get involved, and because of the relationship my mom has with her she doesn't do anything about it, and when she does my sister just ignores her. I try to keep out of, but it bothers me a lot when she does this and if I keep out long enough everything bottles up until I can't take it and I need to intervene. My sister shows no remorse for anything she does which doesn't help.

I already snapped on my sister once, essentially telling her how hard she makes it for me to enjoy living here and pretty much disowning her. Tonight I snapped again and said to her how surprised I was that her boyfriend hasn't dumped her with the attitude she has. That sent her over the edge, which in turn sent the rest of the house over the edge. My sister yelled and started cursing at me and my mom and my dad left the house for a bit to get away from everything. My mom came up to talk to me and pretty much said that if it were possible now she would want me to leave the house. 

My dad is leaving for a few days next week (pre planned trip) and my mom wants me out of the house completely while he is gone.

When my dad came back we all talked and my mom said she wants me out of the house. I said fine, just give me the money (this money is explained below). My dad said I need to at least finish my degree before I leave.

Here's where I'm at now. I'm a 2nd year Graphic Design major. My plans were to do community college, graduate, then transfer out to get a four year degree. My grandparents put away a substantial amount of money for me to go to college and after I'm done with my education any money left is mine to keep. I won't know for another month if I got accepted to the four year university, then I need to apply for housing too. I have a part time job as a web designer now, it's not big money, but it's enough for me to at least buy my own stuff while I live at home. I did some rough estimates in my head and if I budget myself correctly I could live for a year and a half on my own with that college money alone (nothing used from my paychecks). And this is assuming I stay part time at my job and keep my same pay rate. So here are the two options I have:

**Option One:**

Chances are high I'll get in to the four year university. So I get in, get a small loan, go there, and stay in the dorms. The loan will let me have some money left in the college fund to have when I get out. However I still need to come back home during breaks and such. But after I get out with my four year degree I won't know how much money will be left and I don't know how long I can live on my own for until I run out.

**Option Two:**

I get my degree after two years, take the money, and move out. On that money alone I can live for about a year and a half on my own just on that money. That is if I still work at the same place, for the same pay, and just part time. Obviously stuff like my job can change, so I didn't factor in my job effecting my money to live.

------------------

Either way my main concern when I move out is my job. I'm not too sure what's out there, if I can get a job to hold me over when the money runs dry. If I go with option two, who's going to hire me with only a two year degree? My portfolio isn't bad, but I feel like employers see a two year degree and will think less of it, and in turn go with someone who has more education. My current job doesn't really have room to advance in the company, it's more of a learning experience at the moment and I more than likely won't need to do an internship because of this job."

Smart as I am, I find so much of school painful because it just feels like work between me and a degree (ex: I took a Research Writing class centered on a paper three times before passing).  There's also a **huge** problem with focus - simple assignments can take hours because I aimlessly browse the internet, think about music, anxiously scrutinize social interactions, etc.  Unless I master it, this will become a problem when I (hopefully!) get some sort of job writing about entertainment.

I'm on depression medication that works but doesn't get me all the way ""there"".  There have been no traumatic events in my life, but I'm not a responsible adult, and can't help but wonder what's wrong.  I recognize laziness, focus, time management, and discipline as problems, but find it *almost impossible to learn them*.

I'm trying to be more optimistic, and this year I set out to actually change things: get back into learning Spanish, write regularly (even if it's a blog nobody else reads), joined [NoFap](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/), losing weight slowly but surely, put my Xbox away for good 1/2 weeks ago (can't remember lol), and have a real girlfriend for the first time. Despite this....she's younger than me, is raising a 1 y.o. daughter, and is an internship away from being a Pharmacy Tech (making me feel unsuccessful).  I'm going to have to repeat a freshman-level class at a less expensive university, and *have no idea how I'm going to survive an insane senior year when I go back*.

My father has a friend who's a retired hypnotherapist, and if he can successfully plant *just enough* drive, focus, or self-esteem, it'll be one of the best things I've ever done.  If not, I have no idea what to do."

It seems like the only way to get experience in a new/different field is to get an internship, but companies don't want an intern who isn't in school.

Someone once told me, ""Oh if you don't like your career now, you can always do something else later!""  But how is this possible? Every employer wants experience. If the only way to get experience for a different career is to intern, is this therefore a myth? I don't get it.

Thank you for reading.,support0nly,leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/18zdzt/hopefully_someone_can_help_me_out_thank_you_for/,"I'm going through a lot of issues right now in my personal life, and I know that the community has helped out a lot with struggling people, so I'm turning to this subreddit. I'm involved in a serious Academic Judicial Affairs situation right now and may have to take a year off from college. That being said, after reflecting on my life, I realized that I might not be ready for college. 

So, I have decided to take a gap year anyway, regardless of the result of the case. That being said, I'm going to need something to keep me busy and away from home for a year (home isn't going to be exactly great once this situation resolves itself). I saw that Riot has internships for the summer. But in the situation that I am in, I need something that lasts a little longer. 

That's where you guys can come in. If anyone is involved with eSports and may be able to point me in the direction of a full time employment job for a year, I would be extremely grateful. I guess the ideal job I would be looking for would  be an intern position in a gaming house, that way my living arrangements would be fulfilled, or with a corporation that may be able to provide housing. 

The reason that I am posting on here rather than sending this to Riot, is that I am so lost in terms of how to go about contacting these people. I'm hoping that a Rioter or someone involved with like Curse, CLG, TSM, Dig, (or any company) would be able to help me out in terms of contacting the proper sources. I really need this and it would be great if LoL and the community could help out a fellow summoner.

:--|:--
[1\) How did you get involved?  2\)How does it affect your family life/relationships back home?  3\) How often do you go back home?  4\) What type of money do you make? Enough to support yourself back home if you ever go back? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18vu4o/i_am_an_american_living_in_uganda_working_with_an/c8iidnx?context=5)|1) This was answered in a previous post, but the short of it is that we found this organization through my sister-in-law, who has adopted from Uganda twice now.
 |2) It's good and bad. Our families were SUPER supportive, and definitely supported us coming over here. It's tough to be apart, but with my wife living here with me, the blow is lessened.
 |3) We've only been here a few months, so never yet. Our plan (as of now) is to stay at least a year, and if we stay longer, we'll probably plan a short trip home around that time.
 |4) Honestly, we raised our own funding. We both had steady, stable jobs in the states, but traded that for uncertainty and craziness! Fortunately, we have enough saved from our prior jobs to reestablish life back in America when we go.
[I really really really want to get into volunteer work in Africa one day. So far, what are the best perks? The biggest obstacles? The worst aspects? The greatest feeling of ""yesss!"" ? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18vu4o/i_am_an_american_living_in_uganda_working_with_an/c8ijdlh?context=5)|Best perks - The pineapple.
 |Biggest obstacles - Everything that isn't pineapple.
 |Worst aspects - Seeing the heartbreak, pain, and suffering that surrounds you everyday.
 |Greatest feeling - So far, it's a little girl that I met at one of our facilities. She was an orphan, but not a prisoner... maybe no more than 2 years old. She had never spoken or smiled to ANY of us.
 |I brought a football one day to throw around with some of the older kids. I turned and offered it to her - she smiled, tossed it back, and then answered ""yes"" when I asked her if she liked football.
 |That moment hit me in the feels more than anything ever has.
[Anyway, have you met many other foreigners who are there doing NGO work? Is this a long-term plan for you? Where do you think you'll go next if you stay in Africa?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18vu4o/i_am_an_american_living_in_uganda_working_with_an/c8iilwz?context=5)|We have met quite a few doing NGO work. It's actually kinda funny sometimes, simply because there's always some kind of friction between NGO's in the area. Because the government officials like to have their pockets lined, if you DON'T pay them bribes (like us), you're at a perpetual disadvantage.  As far as long-term, it could be. We're open to staying for longer than a year, but we don't know if that will happen yet. If we do stay in Africa, I imagine we would stay in Uganda to continue the work here, unless we end up expanding beyond Uganda at some point.
[Just curious, why have you chosen to work in this area in another country rather than your own?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18vu4o/i_am_an_american_living_in_uganda_working_with_an/c8ifmkr?context=5)|Truthfully, because I feel the need for help is much greater here than it is in places like the US. There is more poverty, more disease, more despair... just more. I'm aware there are places of need in the states, but I was intentionally seeking an opportunity to serve people that were in the most terrible situations.
[If you are not african american do you feel  you are taking a job that a Ugandan or African American could be doing? Why does your NGO employer not train and pay Ugandans to do the work you and presumably others are doing? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18vu4o/i_am_an_american_living_in_uganda_working_with_an/c8ihea6?context=5)|Actually, it's a tricky balance.
 |The goal of the organization is to make this a sustainable, in-country thing, without the use of American intervention.
 |At the start of this organization, we actually hired a Ugandan man to be the director. He ended up blackmailing us, and the connections he had within the government threatened to derail the entire organization. We had to fire him, although his wife is still on staff as one of the nurses.
 |Anyway, we found very quickly that the sheer amount of corruption here makes it impossible to trust the organization entirely to Ugandans until we have a solid foundation in place. We are actually one of the few organizations here that refuses to pay bribes, so it makes the going tough. We employ Ugandans whenever/wherever possible, but I think it will be at least a few years before we can fully transition away from using Americans here.
[How bad is the homophobia in the region?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18vu4o/i_am_an_american_living_in_uganda_working_with_an/c8igptd?context=5)|Well, I'm sure you've heard about the ""Kill the Gays"" bill.
 |It's pretty bad. Here in Uganda, you can even get thrown in prison for several years for failing to report homosexuality.
 |It's sad how dark this place is sometimes. I mean, even the most advanced nations in the world struggle with how to approach homosexuality; this place, in many ways, feels like it is still stuck in the Dark Ages.
[I went to Uganda a few years ago and saw two men walking along holding hands. I thought they were incredibly brave. Then I found out that it is the norm for two male friends to hold hands, without any implication of homosexuality. Probably the oddest culture shock I had over there.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18vu4o/i_am_an_american_living_in_uganda_working_with_an/c8ijito?context=5)|Yep, for sure.
 |Our Ugandan counselor actually frequently holds my hand when we walk around the remand homes. Totally weird, and incredibly uncomfortable for an American with the understanding that two men holding hands is just, not a thing... unless you're doing it ironically.
 |But yea, it's interesting that it's culturally acceptable here with all the fear.
[In that kind of society, how would you even deal with a child ""coming out""? That's gotta be terrifying.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18vu4o/i_am_an_american_living_in_uganda_working_with_an/c8igzcp?context=5)|Truth be told, that child would most likely be completely kicked out of their home/village, and probably be reported for fear of being imprisoned yourself if anyone found out.
 |It's pretty common for the kids we work with to be completely shunned from their home villages; they won't even let them come back. We do a lot of work in resettlement, so in most cases, we can actually rebuild those bridges after some time and effort.
 |Unfortunately, however, I would say they'd probably be cast to the streets, if they aren't living there already.
[Last question, do you think there's a chance they'll change their attitude (or at least relaxed\)? Or is the fear so bad, any change is unthinkable?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18vu4o/i_am_an_american_living_in_uganda_working_with_an/c8ih85q?context=5)|Well, it's possible that things could change eventually. I imagine it's much like any misunderstood civil rights issue; we stay on the wrong side of it for way too long, figure out we need to do something, and then spend way too much time solving the problem.
 |The problem, I think, stems mostly from pressure from President Museveni. He has basically altered Ugandan constitution to make it impossible for him to get voted out of office, and essentially runs things as a dictatorship. Considering he is heavily in favor of the bill, and everyone here is afraid of getting thrown in jail for being ""The Opposition,"" its pretty much at a stand-still.
 |TL;DR - It can get better, but it probably won't for a long time.
[What do you teach the children? Are they in prison indefinitely, or do they know when they get to go ""home""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18vu4o/i_am_an_american_living_in_uganda_working_with_an/c8if8f5?context=5)|In most cases, the children we enroll in our program have been released from their sentences, and are placed into boarding school. Truth be told, this isn't an IDEAL setup, and something we are working to improve provided we have cooperation from the Ugandan government.
 |In theory, these children have sentences that are clearly defined. In actuality, they end up staying longer because no one bothers to check their files or follow up. It's very, very, sub-standard, and we are actually working alongside some law teams that come frequently to help revamp the justice system (as it pertains to juveniles) here in Uganda.
[Thanks for the reply.  I saw a TED talk (Can't find the link right now\) noting that one of the biggest missing links in the justice system of countries like Uganda is that there is a lack of representation from lawyers. Are there any efforts in place to educate even young children about the justice system and send students abroad with the intention of returning to Uganda to build a better representation system?  Sorry if this does not pertain to the work you do!  Possibly more relevant: what do you think is the most important thing to do to make sure that the victims of the injustice are able to lead productive lives after leaving prison?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18vu4o/i_am_an_american_living_in_uganda_working_with_an/c8ifd7s?context=5)|There is a huge lack of legal representation in all cases, but specifically for juveniles, they are usually not represented. Part of the work that the ""justice"" aspect of our organization does is to educate the Ugandan judiciary on how to approach this. As part of this program, they recently introduced plea bargaining as a concept here. Because the majority of these cases lack sufficient proof, evidence, or resources, the use of plea bargaining has helped us (since institution) have upwards of 90% of juveniles released prior to trial.  As far as leading productive lives; that part is tricky. While education is a huge determining factor in that, I would say counseling is probably more important early on. These children are usually orphaned, abandoned, or neglected. Combine that with being accused of and/or committing crimes, spending years of your early life in a place where you have no rights or freedom... it's really, really tough. We have had several kids graduate from our programs now, and they have all started successful business ventures here in Uganda.
[Dude, pyschosocial and lifeskills education has become the holy grail of developmental/aid work. Seriously, all this...stuff...isn't going to be fixed anywhere near our lifetimes so, for me, the kids here represent a better future, even if not necessarily and perfectly ""good""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18vu4o/i_am_an_american_living_in_uganda_working_with_an/c8ijqtw?context=5)|I know it's not going to get fixed, but it isn't going to stop me from helping any way I can.
 |There are lots of issues everywhere, and as long as people are working toward those, it's important.
 |Living in Africa gives some people a ""holier than thou"" approach to their lives. I'm not in that camp, because I'm not naive enough to believe that these are the only problems worth fighting for. I just had to find my passion and dive in!
 |Whatever your passion is, pursue that; regardless of where that is.
[There was a question below but I didn't know if your answer was sincere or not, so... *have* you actually caught Kony yet? And did the whole InvisibleChildren thing help at all?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18vu4o/i_am_an_american_living_in_uganda_working_with_an/c8ijd62?context=5)|Haha... sorry, I'm usually dripping in equal parts sarcasm and sweat.
 |Honestly, Kony and the LRA disappeared from Uganda (mostly) before that video even aired. From what I have heard now, he's probably in the Congo hiding out, and the forces have dwindled a ton.

How long will you be there? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18vu4o/i_am_an_american_living_in_uganda_working_with_an/c8igafp?context=5)|My sister-in-law has adopted from Uganda before, and got affiliated with this organization through connections she made then.
 |She invited us on a one week trip in June, and we decided during our time here that we wanted to pursue it full time.
 |We ended up raising donations for everything, and all told, had to raise about $600 a month in recurrent support and $5,000 in one time to cover airfare and other expenses. We've been here for a couple months, and are planning on being here at least a year!
[What are your plans after your year there is done? I can't imagine one spends a year working in such an eye-opening &amp; probably life changing environment and then just goes home to some desk job in an air conditioned office.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18vu4o/i_am_an_american_living_in_uganda_working_with_an/c8iipku?context=5)|Truthfully, no clue.
 |My wife is a pediatric ICU nurse by trade, so she'll probably just jump back into that. As for me, I'm an open book... I studied graphic design, and probably won't ever use that. I used to be in retail management, but don't see myself going back to that.

[How is the climate in Uganda? Let say I'm looking for a place to retire and help out the community when I no longer need money. Is it safe to have money or are there way too many desperate people atm?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18vu4o/i_am_an_american_living_in_uganda_working_with_an/c8iflrr?context=5)|Here in Kampala where we live, it's pretty much poverty contrasted by wealth in certain areas. Most places are broken down, abandoned, or in poor repair. Money isn't really the issue, just the distribution of it.
[Hello from another American currently living in Uganda. I love the weather here. I grew up in the Southern US so I'm used to humidity and the humidity isn't that bad here.

[Was there a specific reason you chose Uganda as the country you would work in or was it just assigned to you? Also how developed would you say Kampala is, I know it got completely destroyed after the war with Tanzania. Are there still any lingering scars from the war or has the country completely moved on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18vu4o/i_am_an_american_living_in_uganda_working_with_an/c8ihpoy?context=5)|Sorry, was at dinner.
 |We ended up here as a result of this being the only country that the organization currently works in. :)
 |As far as Kampala, it's modern in some pockets. There are a few areas that I would say are ""richer,"" but for the most part, it's pretty impoverished.
 |Most of Uganda is still feeling the results of the war with Tanzania, the after-effects of Kony and the LRA, and some parts of Northern Uganda were devastated by famine too. It's a long recovery on all fronts.
[Are you a Christian? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18vu4o/i_am_an_american_living_in_uganda_working_with_an/c8ij1xe?context=5)|Yes, although I know that's probably not the most popular thing to announce on Reddit.
 |It would be a bold-faced lie to say anything other than my faith motivated me to move here.
[Have you found Kony yet?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18vu4o/i_am_an_american_living_in_uganda_working_with_an/c8iixtc?context=5)|Yep!
 |Chased him to the DRC, wielding my #Kony2012 bumper sticker and a dull machete. I was about 20 feet away when I got blindsided by a mother hippo who was feeling extra protective that day.
 |I've typed all of these responses with my nose. You know, since the accident and all.
[Do you live in a village? If so, how is the culture? What was your favorite thing about their culture? What language do they speak?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18vu4o/i_am_an_american_living_in_uganda_working_with_an/c8ijuoq?context=5)|Favorite cultural thing would have to be how hospitable everyone is. They always greet you, always feed you, and always make sure you have a comfortable place to sit.
[Amazing do you plan on visiting other parks of the country?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18vu4o/i_am_an_american_living_in_uganda_working_with_an/c8ik1ni?context=5)|Just the other day we went white-water rafting down the Nile. It was pretty freakin' cool.
 |I'd like to travel a bit, but work makes things difficult. I'll try my best though!
[What are your thoughts on foreigners adopting in Uganda? Do you get the feeling that the Angelina Jolie/ Madonna inspired trend of adopting from abroad is good or bad?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18vu4o/i_am_an_american_living_in_uganda_working_with_an/c8iiqv2?context=5)|Honestly, I think foreign adoption should be further down the list of options.
 |Foreigners generally assume that getting the kids out of their current situation is the best option. While SOMETIMES that is the case, the majority of the time it is much better to resettle with existing family, or have the child be adopted in-country, by Ugandans.
 |I'm not against foreign adoption by any means, but I don't think it's the best solution in the majority of cases.
[Any advice for foreign adoptive parents? Do you think that maintaining a connection to the child's birth country is important?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18vu4o/i_am_an_american_living_in_uganda_working_with_an/c8iixmm?context=5)|I'm really not in a position to offer anything weighty in terms of adoption advice. I do, however, have ready access to my sister-in-law, who has adopted from Uganda twice. She has tons of great insight, and I'd be happy to send you some information from her when I can.
[What would be a normal menu for a day for an average Ugandan? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18vu4o/i_am_an_american_living_in_uganda_working_with_an/c8ir092?context=5)|Normal menu - rice, beans, and posho (a flour and water combo). Or some combination thereof.
[What's your favorite / least favorite food you have been exposed to there?  What are some cool traditions there that we may not have heard of?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18vu4o/i_am_an_american_living_in_uganda_working_with_an/c8ir092?context=5)|Traditions - I think the most interesting one I've met thus far is the concept of dowry before marriage. Essentially, you negotiate the worth of your wife with her home village. Something to the effect of, ""I think my wife is worth 10 cows, 14 goats, and 7 chickens."" Not sure how my wife would feel about the cow comparison.
[What do you think of the Prime Directive? =\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18vu4o/i_am_an_american_living_in_uganda_working_with_an/c8ir092?context=5)|Prime Directive - If I found the right thing via the Google machine, I never watched Star Trek. I brief glance leads me to believe that the situation I am currently in is in direct violation of the Prime Directive. In which case, I must not think much of it at all. :)
[Can you tell us about the kids you work with? Maybe the craziest story you've heard of how they got there? Thank you for what you do btw, I love hearing about the kindness of others!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18vu4o/i_am_an_american_living_in_uganda_working_with_an/c8iiocn?context=5)|The craziest story I've heard thus far is from one of our kids in the program. He's currently 25, just finished vocational training, and was part of the LRA in its heyday.
 |He was actually pretty high up, and ended up running away after he was forced to cut off the ears of his own mother. He ended up at one of the facilities we work in, and after his sentence, we put him in school where he did really well. Great kid, terrible story.
[Sentence? How long was his sentence for?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18vu4o/i_am_an_american_living_in_uganda_working_with_an/c8iiu6g?context=5)|It varies. He was actually sentenced for injuring his mother, even though it was as part of the LRA.
 |Sentences vary here, and I wasn't here when his sentence finished; but I would guess a year or two.
[Wow. That is insane! Just shows how brainwashing/manipulation can truly influence someone's actions. Do you think this type of organization would be able to continue if there weren't people such as yourself and your wife that are willing to give their time to operate them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18vu4o/i_am_an_american_living_in_uganda_working_with_an/c8iizog?context=5)|I like to think that there will always be people willing to accomplish this type of work.
[Is there any opportunities for people like me to come over and volunteer or work with the NGO? I am a therapist who works with abused children and would really like to get overseas to help out organizations.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18vu4o/i_am_an_american_living_in_uganda_working_with_an/c8iiaql?context=5)|There might be, actually.
 |Luckily enough, our president is here for the week. I'll talk to him and let you know what I hear!
[Are you ever afraid while you are located in Uganda?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18vu4o/i_am_an_american_living_in_uganda_working_with_an/c8ijdr1?context=5)|I've had a few scary moments. Part of what I do is buying supplies for kids in our program, which requires me to venture downtown on a regular basis. Keep in mind, pretty much EVERYWHERE downtown is discouraged for visitation by the US Embassy because of personal threat.
[How does one sign up to take part in this and what kind of qualifications do you need?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18vu4o/i_am_an_american_living_in_uganda_working_with_an/c8ijdr1?context=5)|I just hold my breath, charge in with a fistful of shillings, and run out with a pair of shoes and some toilet paper.
[How can you compare NGO to peace corps? and also, what is NGO? because i'm totally lost. I plan on joining the peace corps but the requirements are a little much for just getting out of high school but i'd love to do what they offer. is NGO similar and more open? and whats the the most unique thing that these people consider normal that americans could never adopt into a daily life style?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18vu4o/i_am_an_american_living_in_uganda_working_with_an/c8ik78m?context=5)|I've never really researched the peace corps, so I don't really know. NGO stands for Non-governmental organization. Since I don't have much information for you, I'd just suggest doing some research into different organizations that align themselves with the same types of things you'd like to do!
 |Most unique thing... probably the fact that most people (myself included) ride on the back of motorcycles driven by (usually) unlicensed strangers that have no formal training on how to drive a motorcycle.
 |That, and the fact that power goes out at least 3 times a day here, and running water is hit or miss, even in nice areas. 
[Do you have the opportunity to connect with Ugandans who are running charity/NGO operations? What kinds of development projects are Ugandans in your city prioritizing? Thanks for your work!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18vu4o/i_am_an_american_living_in_uganda_working_with_an/c8ikl3t?context=5)|We have some networking with Ugandans doing this kind of work, but because I'm essentially a step removed from that aspect of our work, I don't know most of the ins and outs there.
 |I know the major focuses here are on things like health care, preventable disease, and development; so mostly education.
[I am a college student looking to get into NGO work, how do you suggest that I or anyone else get into this kind of work? Does it always require money and do you need to self-support? How does that work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18vu4o/i_am_an_american_living_in_uganda_working_with_an/c8ik1at?context=5)|Honestly, I just fell into it through a pretty sweet set of circumstances. Pretty much who I knew, combined with who they knew.
 |There is tons of opportunity I'm sure, but you may have to be active in seeking that out. It doesn't ALWAYS require money, but I'd guess the majority expect you to fund quite a bit of your own expenses. That's just guessing, though.
[As a college student, would you recommend taking a year off to travel abroad and join an aid project in a developing country?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18vu4o/i_am_an_american_living_in_uganda_working_with_an/c8ijapn?context=5)|I think anything you can do to help out those less fortunate is worth investing your time in.
[What do you think are the most important resources in the area you're in? Better education, or access to education? Donations? Resources?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18vu4o/i_am_an_american_living_in_uganda_working_with_an/c8ijapn?context=5)|As far as the most important resources... I would say that better education is a start. But it's hard to say that makes a huge difference in a place where they still struggle with clean water, preventable disease, poverty and the like. It's a question that doesn't have an easy answer, because everything trickles down in ways that I don't think any of us can fully understand.
[So most people you work with are not career  NGO workers? They are volunteers that come for a set (or unset\) time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18vu4o/i_am_an_american_living_in_uganda_working_with_an/c8ik5t9?context=5)|All the Americans that have move to Uganda with our organization are here temporarily. You could, in theory, stay here longer (we're not forced to leave). But as it stands now, most of us are young to mid-20's, so there's a bit of desire to return back to America and figure our lives out at some point.
[So much of what I see on reddit seems to fall apart during the long term period of keeping up with things. Judging based on leadership that will remain after you leave, organizations in place, and social norms of the people; are you confident that what you are doing will last? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18vu4o/i_am_an_american_living_in_uganda_working_with_an/c8iiruo?context=5)|As long as there are people that believe in the cause, absolutely.
 |I think we are on the verge of accomplishing some really great things here, and we are still in our infancy as an organization. But I think there are enough good people out there who believe that the children of Africa are just as important as children anywhere else.
[Do you think that advertizing African development aid with pictures of poor and uneducated people hurts the continent because it prevents companies from inesting and expanding to Africa as a business?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18vu4o/i_am_an_american_living_in_uganda_working_with_an/c8iiq8e?context=5)|Honestly, not really. I've heard that east Africa is actually on the cusp of becoming the next great opportunity for business expansion. (Coming from an African native who lived in Missouri for 7 years and moved back for business opportunity.)
[What's the NGO's name.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18vu4o/i_am_an_american_living_in_uganda_working_with_an/c8iixeq?context=5)|1) SixtyFeet.
[There's a few people from Uganda in my city (they all have a very very distinct accent\). do you know why they emigrate?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18vu4o/i_am_an_american_living_in_uganda_working_with_an/c8iixeq?context=5)|2) No idea. Probably just trying to escape the craziness that is Kampala!
[So from what I've read here, are homophobe guys like the ""eat da poo poo"" preacher from youtube the norm over there? If so that's bad, but there's just as bad people here as well. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18vu4o/i_am_an_american_living_in_uganda_working_with_an/c8iixeq?context=5)|3) I don't really think that's the norm. It's more that it's something that isn't talked about too readily here. Everyone is afraid to say and/or do the wrong thing.
[Huh. Maybe I was just on a really concentrated plane. Thanks for the response!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18vu4o/i_am_an_american_living_in_uganda_working_with_an/c8ikno4?context=5)|Yea... in general, during the summer, that happens a lot. When people are out of school, they come to Africa for a week to hold babies. That's a huge generalization, but true for the most part.
[Any encounters with nodding disease?  That shit is scary.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18vu4o/i_am_an_american_living_in_uganda_working_with_an/c8iiszj?context=5)|I'm not familiar with it. What is that?
[It's a recent disease with most cases occurring near a river in Uganda.  I'm pretty sure nothing is known about causes or cures.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18vu4o/i_am_an_american_living_in_uganda_working_with_an/c8ijkdp?context=5)|Honestly, I have seen a lot of terrible illness here, but nothing thus far resembling that. Glad I haven't.
[What part of Uganda?  What is the local language there and have you had a chance to pick up any of it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18vu4o/i_am_an_american_living_in_uganda_working_with_an/c8ix6dq?context=5)|We are in Kampala. Most speak Luganda primarily, with English being very prevalent as well. There are a lot of scattered tribal languages if you grew up in a village elsewhere.
 |I know some words and phrases in Luganda, but because English is pretty much spoken everywhere, there hasn't been much necessity to learn the language. I'd love to, but it's hard with the amount of work that I find on my plate everyday!
[Do you dare ride a boda boda? ;\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18vu4o/i_am_an_american_living_in_uganda_working_with_an/c8ijpia?context=5)|Boda Boda's are actually my main form of transportation in Kampala. They're faster, cheaper than paying for gas in our vehicle, and it makes the days here seem MUCH less hot. Still need to invest in a helmet, though. 
[I spent a couple months over there, the drivers are CRAZY in Kampala!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18vu4o/i_am_an_american_living_in_uganda_working_with_an/c8ijpia?context=5)| 
[They're amazing, please invest in a helmet though, cause they are really dangerous! Its such a stunning place, if you have a little time you should head up north :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18vu4o/i_am_an_american_living_in_uganda_working_with_an/c8ikge4?context=5)|I thought about starting up a designer helmet line for bodas called SixtyFaces (a play off our name, SixtyFeet).
 |It would be pretty awesome to see Batman on the back of a motorcycle.
[Be careful, especially in your line of work. When I was in Kampala with Heifer International, a kiddo fell from a boda his mum was driving... didn't make it. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18vu4o/i_am_an_american_living_in_uganda_working_with_an/c8ixz92?context=5)|So sad... thankfully, no accidents or close-calls on bodas yet.
[1\) Do you feel at danger being an outsider living in a developing country, especially doing work that some people there might wish you wouldn't do?  2\) Not asking for specifics, but is there enough pay in the field to live a comfortable lifestyle? Everywhere I look to intern or work is pretty much volunteer work or pay to participate, and while I'm OK with that now I wonder if it is feasible for me to do after college with loan debts, etc.  3\) How did you get involved with your organization/where should I be looking/what should I be doing in order to find a good/meaningful job in the field?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18vu4o/i_am_an_american_living_in_uganda_working_with_an/c8ikgqn?context=5)|1) At first, yes. But once you start to understand the culture and the people, a lot of that goes away. I still watch myself wherever I go, but nothing crazy has happened to me.  2) I touched on this earlier, but I actually had to fund-raise to come. I'm working on a volunteer basis. The organization DOES offer paid positions in some situations, but that wasn't the case for me... yet? I don't know if that changes with other organizations, but I have heard that most places want you to raise at least some of your support.
 |3) This opportunity really presented itself to me through my sister-in-law. She invited us for a week in June (she was affiliated at the time), and we ended up coming full-time shortly thereafter. I didn't really look around for Africa; Africa found me.
[My wife and I actually went to Uganda last June to do the same thing! We worked at a school in the village of Toggo for a few weeks. We have friends there right now that recently experienced some pretty violent racism in Kampala directed at them (they're white\). Are you Caucasian? If so, have you had this experience?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18vu4o/i_am_an_american_living_in_uganda_working_with_an/c8iur54?context=5)|I am Caucasian, but no experience with violent racism. No racism directed my way at all, actually!
[How dependant is Uganda on foreign help and are there there plans to replace the positions held by NGOs with Ugandans in the future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18vu4o/i_am_an_american_living_in_uganda_working_with_an/c8ik8ih?context=5)|I spoke more about the transition to Ugandans from Americans/other foreigners in another part of the thread, but yes. We're trying to get there :)
 |Uganda gets quite a bit of foreign aid, although one of the things holding up the ""Kill the Gays"" bill is the fact that many countries threatened to withdraw all foreign aid unless the bill was dropped.
[What qualifications do you hold? Do you hold sufficient qualifications to do the same job in a developed country?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18vu4o/i_am_an_american_living_in_uganda_working_with_an/c8iqupp?context=5)|Honestly, probably not. I studied graphic design in college, a degree I probably won't ever use. As far as work experience, about 5 years of retail management.
 |It's a passion I just recently found, and was lucky enough to find an organization that was motivated to find help.
[I was in Uganda for about 10 months. I worked with an organization called Friends of Orphans up in Pader/Gulu/Kolongo area, then later Kampala. Which district are you in? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18vu4o/i_am_an_american_living_in_uganda_working_with_an/c8ijtsc?context=5)|Right now, our focus is in Kampala. We also have staff in Masindi, Gulu, and Fort Portal, but the majority of what we do is focused in Kampala.
 |We're hoping to expand after we figure out what we're doing... whenever that happens.
[Is that waragi banana liquor as good as they say it is? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18vu4o/i_am_an_american_living_in_uganda_working_with_an/c8it0p0?context=5)|Haven't tried it, but I've heard that Uganda is pretty good at consuming alcohol.

18zbbr,3,2013-02-21,My [23M] GF [22F] of 3.5 years initiated a break then slept with someone but says she eventually wants to get back together.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/18zbbr/my_23m_gf_22f_of_35_years_initiated_a_break_then/,"I'm not sure if this entirely belongs in r/relationships or r/breakups. It honestly seems to be something in-between.

My girlfriend and I have been in a LDR for the last 3 and a half years. It's had ups and downs, but generally I felt it was going as well as something like that would for people our age. We had lost our virginity together, and neither of us cheated on the other. She is a year behind me in school (I graduated college in May of last year), but that never really was a problem. During my senior year, I became very stressed about what I was going to do after school for money. My degree is in a very specific field, and that field is localized almost entirely in one city. My attempts at finding a job - even at the lowest level - met with no success and I became very pessimistic about my chances in the future. Regrettably, rather than sharing this with my GF, or anyone for that matter, I just kept telling myself I'd be fine without actually confronting my fears about reality. 

As a result, I became increasingly hostile to my girlfriend and my family because they were the people involved in advising me through this process. It got so bad that my GF and I paused our relationship for about a month during my senior spring. We kept it monogamous but we gave each other much more space. I admit I still didn't confront my issues but she felt more comfortable once I had landed an internship and an apartment. She moved in with me over the summer and things were very good and we were happy. In the fall, she went back to school and I started a second internship, which I did not like. I became increasingly depressed - things I used to enjoy bored me, I was grouchy all the time, and I hated just getting out of bed. 

Meanwhile, she had  nervous breakdown at school because of academics and troubled relations with her parents, specifically her father who emotionally abused her beginning at about age 12 by telling her she was ugly and stupid pretty much constantly. During our relationship, I had always tried to build her self-confidence, tell her she was valuable, and carry her through anxiety attacks relating to school because she was afraid she wasn't smart enough to do well (even though she made dean's list multiple times). So, during the fall our individual issues both peaked: I was miserable with where I was post-college, and she was breaking down about her own abilities. We spent all our time either fighting or me comforting her or her trying to comfort me while I denied that anything was wrong aside from that I hated my job.

I moved back home in the winter, and when she came back we had several large fights where I realized I actually hadn't been sharing my problems with her and my emotional unavailability had made her resent me. We talked about it at length, and proceeded to have an excellent month a half. I worked on telling her when and why I was upset and we just had a great time. She went back to school and I immediately fell back into a depression about returning to an old (non-paying) employer while I await grad school responses. Two weeks ago, we had a small spat which grew out of my not telling her I didn't want to wait up to tuck her in for bed over the phone (a staple of our LDR). Two days later (Saturday) *she tells me she wants a total break for us each to work on our own issues - my dissatisfaction with my place post-grad and her not feeling self-reliant - and then try our relationship again.* The following day she officially said we were no longer together, changed her relationship status and told me she considered herself single.

*Now I told you that story to tell you this one.* I did my best to focus on myself and not contact her, including asking some hard questions of myself. But of course we talk here and there during the following week. Last Thursday, she tells me that she realized that she has never felt loved by her parents and it has prevented her from ever preserving her self-esteem. She told me she realized this the day after we broke up (Monday) after getting very drunk and having a one-night stand in an attempt to feel better about herself. I was stunned, particularly because we had only ever had sex with one another. I tried to take this in stride, and since that discussion we talked openly with each other about when we felt scared, including my talking her through three anxiety attacks. 

Then this morning, after much prodding from me about why she had been vague about whether or not she was going to sleep with any more people, she told me she was planning on sleeping with her one-night-stand again in casual fashion because she wants someone to have sex with while we were apart. I went ballistic, telling her I felt used and she said is trying to learn how to be on her own but reiterated that she really wanted things to work out between her and me and said ""If I wanted to break up with you permanently I would have done it by now. I'm not trying to spring you along or give you false hope."" I now have no idea what to do. I care for this person very deeply and enjoyed our relationship a great deal. I don't know how to feel about this, aside from confused that she could move on (sexually) so quickly and confused about her telling me she does want us to be together in the future but feels fine about casually sleeping with another man until then.

**tl;dr - GF of 3.5y LDR asked for a break after a tense year b/c of communication issues, told me she wanted to us work to work individually on our individual issues so we could reunite, slept with someone and told me she wants to start having casual sex with him, all while reassuring me she most wants our relationship to work again somewhere down the line. I am bewildered and conflicted.**

I realize now I wrote a novel; my thanks to anyone who actually reads the whole thing. It barely scratches the surface, of course.

18zaw3,15,2013-02-21,"For those with anxiety about going to work.. (Long, but with a tldr;)",cocobabbs,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/18zaw3/for_those_with_anxiety_about_going_to_work_long/,"So, I've a had more jobs than I can count, but it's definitely beyond 15. Not because I'm an awful employee who gets fired, but because I had so much anxiety about going to or staying at work, that I'd break down and just stop showing up one day. 

But now, I don't have that issue; I *want* to go to work. I'd rather stay home and do fun things of course, but I actually enjoy work rather than feel anxious the entire time before, during, and after a shift. 5 hours used to seem like an unbearable eternity, but now 8 go by in a flash. 

I just started a new job when this happened so it made me curious about what it was that was different, why my anxiety was gone. This is what I figured out.

All of my old jobs were in the food industry, or the type of jobs you can get with only a high school degree. This new job, or internship actually, is in a professional setting. I've failed so many times in ""easy"" jobs, that I've always panicked thinking I'd never manage in one of them, let alone a ""real"" job. A professional one. 

So I believe that the difference is this: 

In those other jobs, people were mean. And not just the customers, co-workers, managers, anyone you come in contact with could be a total asshole and make you feel awful, stressed, or anxious. It wasn't just that either, you were expected to do ridiculous things. Manage to serve 6 tables at once along with doing your side work as you go, forfeit time with your family during the holidays when there are no request offs allowed..I could go on, but you know. 

In this more professional setting, people are polite. They're respectful, they don't yell at you, and they don't complain about how slow or stupid all of their employees are. They have a whole department devoted to making sure that you're a happy little worker with a comfortable chair and a reasonably flexible schedule. They even give you personal time off, paid sick days, and 2 weeks vacation a year. Interns don't get these benefits though, so it wasn't the time off. In fact, after working 8:30-5pm, it's straight to class till 9pm. I'm tired yeah, but not stressed and anxious. It's great. 

So my point is this, if you're having a lot of anxiety about work and you work in one of those awful underpaid and overworked jobs, there's something better out there. I just went so long being so afraid and feeling ashamed of being unable to keep a job and therefore always being broke because of this, and then one day it was gone. I didn't have anxiety, and I felt ""normal"", successful, and proud of myself. My outlook on my future, life, and myself has changed so much because of this and I had to share, just in case it could help somebody.

Sorry this was so long. 

**tldr;** Went through 15+ crappy jobs because of anxiety about work. Got an internship in professional setting, everyone treats everyone with respect, no more anxiety about work. Life changing. "

I'm Chintan, a freshman at Georgia Institute of Technology, and I'm looking for an amazing internship at 
a startup.


Ideally, I'm looking for a startup that's doing something really cool - I'd love to learn about machine learning, data analytics, etc. I've gotten a few offers already, but I don't think I'd fit very well at a big company - I'm looking for somewhere where I'll have actual responsibility and be able to shape the direction of the company.


I have a fair bit of experience in web development (I interned at a RoR firm back in Australia and I've been working in PHP for a few years), but I'd really love to expand my experiences and learn more about the backend. I've got a fair bit of experience in Agile environments and with using Git in a large team (git-flow anyone?).


I'm currently in the process of founding a startup which is based on an app to predict outfits, and I'd love experience in a startup environment. My previous internship was in a small (but awesome) RoR shop, and it was nothing short of amazing. It was very startup-esque and everyone was extremely down to earth and willing to teach. 


I'm currently taking my college's course on data structures and algorithms (which I'm having to teach myself - terrible professor), and it's extremely engaging. Even though I'm a freshman, I have no doubt that I can teach myself the necessary skills required to hustle with the juniors and seniors.

I just had a phone interview with a company that I am super impressed with and love that they cover so many different forms of media (print, web, video, etc). They told me they were very impressed with their work, but that they only usually do internships with students so they can have credit towards a class. 

They did say that I could still try to apply purely for the experience, but it would still be unpaid. After looking at the other design firms in the area, I'm seriously considering taking them up on their offer and just come in every other day or so just for the experience, but have a part time job (hopefully in the design field still). 

I'm considering emailing them in a few days asking if they would even consider having me for as little as minimum wage. The reason being that I would value the experience there and it would be a great resume builder, but I need something to survive on.

18yybc,14,2013-02-21,My advice to all ROTC cadets regarding college internships,bnpruitt2012,Military,https://www.reddit.com/r/Military/comments/18yybc/my_advice_to_all_rotc_cadets_regarding_college/,"Don't rely solely on the military while in ROTC. Let me explain that better:

I commissioned from AFROTC at NC State Univ last December and I will not go active (EAD) until late September because of federal budgeting. I am currently having a good time trying to find a job for the next 6 months and so far I've landed nothing. (Even after sending my resume out to everybody I know and applying for half a dozen things.)

As a student and cadet, I did not take opportunities with internships either within the AF or civilian world, but instead took summer classes to make my normal semesters lighter, which in turn helped my GPA out. Although it was pretty good for me then, I am currently regretting that decision because the only things I have on a resume are a little bit of ROTC work/management experience and my engineering senior design project.

In the unlikely event that the AF cuts me from developmental engineering - electrical, I would be out of a job with no college internship experience to lean back on. However unlikely that seems, given the dire need for developmental EEs, it is still a small possibility.

My advice to you is to apply for internships when you can and gain experience in your field of study, because you aren't guaranteed anything. I realized the gravity of this too late and I am thankful that I am going into such a ""crucial"" career field. Along with having the perks of some extra money, an internship or co-op will help you out in the long run.

TL;DR: Get an internship or co-op while in ROTC because it will help you out when resume building.

I live in a small city with a small web dev community.  There's a couple companies that are focused on specific apps and have ~50 employees, but in terms of 'clients can hire you to make their website', there's about 5-7 companies that have multiple developers and then about 10 'pro-level' one person operations.

If you look around, it feels like the same 30 people rotating between companies.  It can be really hard to break in at a company if you don't know anyone and most of the new hires trickle in via internships they did during school.

Does anyone else in the same sort of environment feel like you're behind in the industry?  Like, since there's only a handful of viable choices for a company to hire, there's less innovation because there's less competition.  When a company wants to hire local and only gets realistic quotes from 4 dev houses, those dev houses can afford to be less competitive.  Responsive design and other new trends are just slowly taking off here.

Another weird thing I've noticed being in a smaller city is that the arts and film community has really grabbed onto the web industry.  They feel like we're all in this together, being creative, but I don't really feel any camaraderie towards artists, if anything, I identify more with corporate drones coding tax software somewhere!

Here's what happened next.",robertgfthomas,stanford,https://www.reddit.com/r/stanford/comments/18yot0/hey_rstanford_i_dropped_out_of_stanford_heres/,"Hi, all. I dropped out in 2011, halfway through my junior year, and it's been an interesting ride since. I used to write columns for the Daily; my last was right before I dropped out, and since then I've wanted to write kind of a follow-up. It ended up being a little longer than expected and isn't 100% complimentary of Stanford, so the Daily probably won't publish it. So I'll just put it here if anyone's interested. Would love some feedback; happy to answer questions.

---

I dropped out of Stanford two years ago, and now I support myself running the small business I founded to sell the product I invented.

Living the dream, right? Back in high school I used to joke about my plan to get into Stanford, drop out after two years, and make a million dollars. And now here I am (with two out of the three so far).

Except nothing went the way it was supposed to. If it had, right now I'd be in the Marine Corps, a Lance Corporal or Corporal, pretty low on the totem pole, about to start my second year as a Combat Correspondent. I didn't drop out of Stanford to go do the start-up thing; I dropped out because I was absolutely miserable. I didn't leave to take some internship at Google or rub elbows with VCs; I left to do whatever felt as distant as possible from college and the Silicon Valley. But for some reason, while half my Stanford classmates wanted to be entrepreneurs, I'm the one who ended up starting a business.

This is the fifth time I've started this letter over from the beginning. I'm at a McDonald's in the Philadelphia Airport on a layover from my new home in DC to SFO. I've been invited out to the Bay Area for a week by another small business and they're conveniently located right across Sand Hill Road from the Stanford Mall. I know so many other people who felt depressed, alone, and most of all stuck at Stanford; I have a story to share about getting out, and now seems like a good time to tell it. But somehow it's hard to say ""I'm really, really happy and this is how it happened, and this is how you can do it too"" when all my advice boils down to ""be yourself"". ""Be yourself"" sounds profound when you hear it from a forty-something with years of experience behind them; i think it sounds stupid coming from a 23-year-old white boy who works by himself in a basement.

But I'm happy with my life. Really, really happy. At Stanford I met a lot of people who had one-in-a-million accomplishments, piles of money, beachfront houses, all kinds of skills and talents and the world at their feet. I met almost none who could honestly say they were happy.

The brand Stanford builds for itself is that you can expect Stanford to accomplish anything, and the branding worked on me because I showed up freshman year expecting everything. I expected Stanford to be the place I'd finally fit in, where everyone would be really smart yet also self-confident enough to be themselves and have fun, and there'd be awesome drunk 4 AM conversations in the dorm hallways about the physics and ethics of Batman. I expected to learn so much in class because ""class"" would finally mean more than lectures and reading texts and writing papers.

It turned out Stanford students are humans too, just like everyone else, except they have the added disadvantages of not knowing how to fail and knowing all too well that going to Stanford is a Great Opportunity and they have no right or reason to be anything other than happy all the time. It turned out Stanford's classes were great for some but not for most. There's a kind of person that learns really well from lectures and reading texts and writing papers, and for this kind of person Stanford is easily the best of all possible environments. I'm not one of those people. I always thought that the A-average I'd carried from kindergarten through my junior year at Stanford meant I learned really well in a classroom, but after taking a full course load every quarter and not being able to remember anything after a final exam, I realized that actually I'd just gotten really good at taking tests.

Protip Number One when you're having a slump in college is to branch out and try different activities. I joined Fleet Street, did Mock Trial, Gaieties, and Dance Marathon, went to Cape Town, took Improv and ballroom dance and Design and Spanish and lots of Urban Studies, saw a counselor at Vaden, wrote for the Daily, went steam tunneling, ran the Dish a few times a week, had an awesome bombshell girlfriend, a car on campus, and great dormmates. I did everything that was supposed to be making the most of my Stanford experience, and nowhere did I find the linchpin to make the experience everything it was supposed to be.

So I left. That was hard. It took two-and-a-half years and a whole lot of weekends spent alone in my dorm room watching Failblog, staying up all night putting off three hours of homework until one hour before it was due, not really looking forward to anything except the next meal in the dining hall. You get an opportunity that 99% of the world could only dream of, at the cost of some other kid somewhere getting a rejection letter, and you can't even appreciate it? What an ungrateful brat.

The reality is that college isn't right for everyone. Logically you know that nothing's right for everyone, but when you've spent 18 years being told again and again that college is the exception, staying objective isn't so easy.

So I switched my expectations over to the Marines. Classroom schooling hadn't been the answer to everything but maybe the opposite, the school of hard knocks, would be. The Marine Corps would be where I'd finally fit in -- where everyone would be self-confident enough to be themselves because they shared the same sense of honor and commitment and passion for justice.

Turns out Marines are humans too, like Stanford students. Two weeks after graduating Boot Camp I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, prescribed a double-dose of Prozac every day, and put on permanent suicide watch for three months while I waited to get discharged for being psychiatrically unfit -- officially an ""Erroneous Enlistment"" which is the military's way of saying they screwed up by not seeing the warning signs and letting me join up in the first place.

There are two nice things about feeling like you've hit bottom. First, it gives you some clarity about life because you don't really have anything to lose. Second, you get good at rolling with the punches. These combined give you a lot of freedom to live your life pretty much however you want.

Until that point I'd been expecting other things -- jobs, experiences, money, people -- to be the key to happiness. It meant not only a lot of putting my eggs in one basket but also a lot of trying to change myself to match what I thought was expected of me. If this wasn't achieving the desired outcome then logically the next step would be trying to not expect anything from anyone else, nor let anyone expect anything of me.

That meant that instead of going back to finish up a West Coast Ivy education I stayed at home in Cincinnati and looked at table-waiting jobs, because I thought waiting tables sounded fun, or at least like a good way to learn about people. When I was offered a short gig with a nonprofit in Washington, DC, I ended up redesigning half their HR systems and exponentially increasing organization-wide efficiency because it was FUN, even though it was pretty clearly outside my authority because I was brought on as a recruitment intern. When I came up with a cool little invention and was advised to get investors and try to pass myself off as a professional established business, I instead made it abundantly clear that my ""business"" was just a young friendly guy in a basement learning as he went.

And now here I am, paying myself to spend all day messing around on the Internet, learning how to make websites and file taxes and make cool stuff -- all of which I did already because I enjoy it. The more I do what feels natural, the more the world seems to reward me. 

What a neat trick! You grow up in a society of how-to books and ""ten steps to becoming an entrepreneur"" and it turns out all you have to do to be who you want to be is to be who you are. I don't think an entrepreneur is a person who comes up with great ideas; I think an entrepreneur is a person who lets themselves be so possessed by an idea that they'll naturally end up making it great without even meaning to. The idea doesn't have to be a product or a business; a stay-at-home mom who blogs honestly and openly about raising kids because she loves it is as much an entrepreneur as someone who invents a new computer. Entrepreneurship isn't a measure of accomplishments; it's a measure of self-commitment.

If you're happy at Stanford, stay. If you're not happy, leave. Either way, make it a deliberate decision -- you're choosing to stay or you're choosing to leave. You're no longer just following the rules in the expectation that some day they'll start granting you freedom. I think Stanford's quietly on the same page with me here judging by how easy they make it to take time off; you can defer your admission or take off up to two years as an undergrad and come back pretty much whenever you want with no sort of penalty.

Anyway, I'll be in the area for a week and would love to hear from you, whether you think I'm a moron or not. My e-mail's robin@thenoteboard.com (or robthom@stanford.edu); I compulsively check my e-mail every five minutes and usually respond within the next five."

What do you guys think about Nokia? I know they aren't exactly on the rise, but it seems like a good opportunity to learn and get some good experience. Also, Berlin (as a 19 year old) would be amazing, I think.

The only reservations I have are: Nokia is struggling a bit, and working at home this summer might be better (I live in San Francisco, where there are many startups). Would working at a startup/ continuing to look for internships be a better idea?

Thanks!"

So I applied to make him happy, what do you know I get the internship. Great. So they send me all the info with the drug test that I had to take. At that point I stopped to give myself enough time but that didn't work out. Fast forward to today I wake up walk into the kitchen and I notice my mom is in a bad mood. Okay nothing to unusual. Then she tells me to call my dad at work because he had something to tell me. I wait and eventually the home phone rings and the father is on the line. At this point I am already speculating what was coming at a fast paste at me. So he tells me I failed the drug test and that I am a complete utter disappointment to him. My mom in the background keeps telling me how much of a disgusting person I am and that I ruined everything. In my other ear I hear my dad keep telling me how disrespectful I am. 

Only ting is that that got me wondering is that why would the company tell my dad first and not me. Didn't even get a e-mail or anything. Also I am older than 21 so why do they disrespect my privacy like that. 
Anyways I tried tell my mom that I get good grades in school, I work out, I don't drink alcohol or drink coffee. I keep my body clean except for cannabis.

This is a long rant, but I had to vent a bit guys and I am frustrated with how this turned out it would. I knew I wasn't going to pass but still.

TL;DR: Dad made me apply to his company, had to take drug test, Failed, Dad found out the results before I did. Now I went from the boiling pot and into the fire..."

I don't really know where to start. I've been socially awkward as long as I can remember. I think it all started in high school with my marijuana consumption. Being high made me REALLY awkward, but we smoked on lunch break every day from grade 8 to graduation. At first I was only awkward when high, but it started while being sober too.

Fast forward to last year of high school, we have to pick a college. This is where I started to get really anxious. I did not want to go to a college where I would not know anybody, so I picked the college where my 2 best friends were going. Obviously our schedules didn't match so I started to skip class in order to not being alone between classes. I barely made any friends at this school. I dropped out on 2nd semester.

I then got my first job as a cashier in a convenience store. I worked nights to avoid as much people as possible. I was really depressed during this year. I don't think working nights helped much. I enrolled into another school for a 3-year programming degree.

First weeks were hard, but eventually I made friends. People had similar interests to me so it was easier. There was a girl in our classes, which eventually became my first girlfriend. My anxiety wasn't so bad during the first 2 years, except for oral presentations where I would not sleep for like a week before it.

Work was hard. I now worked 3-11pm shift and I hated it. I eventually had to quit on my 3rd year of my degree. I could not find another job so I got into debt. I had no job so I could not pay, banks and credit card companies started to calling me daily. (This made me dread talking on the phone. I get so anxious when the phone rings or I have to call somebody, it's not even funny. Most of the time, my mom has to call for me. I'm 25 years old for fucks sake. )

At the end of my degree, I found a job where one of my friends for school had an internship. It's alright, except sometimes I have to call people... in english. While my written english is pretty good, I speak like a spanish cow. It does not help my anxiety at all and I stutter all the time. Say what you want, but native english speakers get really agressive when they speak to a french native speaker, like I'm some kind of burden. 

My anxiety also affects my driving. Thanks god for google street view. I have to look everywhere I go on street view beforehand every time I go somewhere new. I would not be able to drive if it wasn't for street view. I also dread driving in the city. 

I have a good group of friends, and love going to play catan or poker with them. But if they all want go out to eat out at the restaurant with their girlfriends and some people I dont know I have an anxiety attack and can't leave the house. It's really frustrating because I'm not awkward with them, but as soon as somebody new is there no words come out of my mouth.

My anxiety is getting out of control. I want to be able to answer the phone. I want to be able to go eat out with my friends. My fear of the phone is so great that I contemplate suicide every morning before going to work. Also I don't know if this is related but I'm tired, like completely dead every day. On the week-end, I wake up at 11am, eat, go for a nap and wake up at 5pm. I'll be ready to sleep at 11pm. What is going on with me? I don't want to go to the doctor, it stresses me out. Do I really have to?"

So I'm a third year software engineering student (for a bachelor degree) doing an internship.
Now, before this internship started I hadn't even heard about GIS, and have spend the last week reading through a lot of sites about it. Which was kinda fascinating. I'm not quite sure if I understand it all though, which is why I'm here!

So for my internship I've been tasked with setting up a data product catalog. To be more specific; a data product catalog for data-products (like models, predictions etc.) on the area of marine and socioeconomic data. 
Besides that, it has to harvest metadata from different sources, supply external GIS systems with a layer through WMS/WFS protocol and display the metadata on a map.


So some external research had already been done before I started this internship. 3 Commercial packages had been researched which would do the job (results varied, ArcGIS came out on top though) along with one open source combination. This was a combination of GeoServer, GeoNetwork and OpenLayers. Since my assignment is to set this all up with open source software, this is what I concentrated on. I've tried to find other open source packages, but these seem to be pretty popular and stable.

The researcher clearly didn't know what she was talking about on some points, she didn't seem to realize that OpenLayers is already packaged with GeoServer, but the combination seems to be the right one.
I've listed the functionalities below along with the software package that provides that functionality. 


* Data Product Catalog -&gt; GeoNetwork
* Harvest data from different sources -&gt; GeoNetwork
* Let other GIS use the metadata as a layer through WMS/WFS -&gt; GeoServer
* Read the data -&gt; GeoServer
* Connect with database (which is MS SQL Server) -&gt; GeoServer
* Display the data on a map -&gt; OpenLayers

As for the webinterface itself, they work here with ASP.net, but they're letting me free to chose it myself. They wouldn't be adverse to PHP. I still have to check to see what I'm going to be using though, but that's not really a priority this soon in the internship (still have 18 weeks out of 20 to go).

So for my question, am I on the right track? I mean, I think that these packages will do what I need it to do, but I haven't had a chance to play with them yet and I understand it more clearly when I do.

I've been depressed for the last few years of my life and am having problems dealing with it. I've known of my 'condition' for a while and am having issues trying to cope. Let me start at the beginning...

I started college at my university very excited and willing to succeed. I was successful for the first couple years and enjoyed every bit of it. I started drinking in highschool and have loved it ever since. I am very anxious around groups of people and it helps me cope with my anxiety. When I am intoxicated, people find me very enjoyable, funny, lots of fun to be around. I also enjoy being around these same people while intoxicated as it removes the anxiety that I have and helps me 'be myself'.

Let's move on. Later on in my college career, I got a few different internships to make some money and make connections for possible later jobs. The first internship that I had went quite well. I mostly enjoyed it (it was a lot of menial work), but in general I had no complaints. Life was good, I was making good money and the good times were rolling.

So I went back to school and it came time to sign up for another internship. I chose a company that seemed very interesting to me and got hired! I loved working for this company. I got to do some interesting things, my boss was very lenient and I was paid very well. I loved it. I felt in control of my life. Things were awesome and I had nothing to complain about. The semester ended and I bid adieu to the company for the time being, as they said they intended to rehire me when I was up for another internship.

This is where things turned south. I started facing some issues that I had not had to deal with before. The main issue was money. I was lucky enough to have had a part time job chauffeuring around some affluent family friends that had usually been able to cover most of my expenses, giving me a very comfortable lifestyle. The extra money from my chauffeuring gig combined with my internship check was more than enough to cover my rent, bills and my very active nightlife. I'm talking going out every weekend (and some weekdays) to bars, clubs and restaurants. When I got back into school, I did not adjust my expenses to account for not having a paycheck every other week. I started running out of money.

I was paying rent late, my bills were getting to the point where sometimes I would lose electricity for a few days at a time and I was slowly losing my grip. How did I cope? By drinking. I had an ""image"" to keep up, and that image was as a party animal. Going out to clubs with friends, hooking up with chicks, etc...

My drinking got to the point that my family started asking me how I was doing. I was skipping every class, playing video games all night and sleeping through the days. The end of my school semester came and I found out that I had failed all of my classes. I should have been shocked, but I wasn't... I just didn't care. I used to be a very religious person, going to Mass every Sunday and in general keeping up with my spiritual life, as it was very important to me. I stopped all of that too. Missing sunday mass, which normally would have terrified me, didn't bother me at all.

My next internship came up and I signed up for it. The same company that I had worked for previously hired me and I was excited. I was excited that I would finally get my life back on track after the abysmal semester that I had had. I was going to start making some good money, get my life in shape, fix up my grades, blah blah blah...

That enthusiasm didn't last. My depression, that I was still unaware of, that had been haunting me was still there. This job that I loved a year ago bored me. I started showing up late, calling in sick multiple days at a time and browsing the internet when I should have been at work. Eventually I was let go via email during one of my week-long 'sicknesses'. This should have devastated me. It didn't, not at all. It didn't bother me one bit. I simply read the email, frowned and closed the tab.

This is where I currently am. I didn't register for school as I had no interest in it and didn't look for another job. I had to move out of my apartment and started living with my parents. They gladly accepted me, but I didn't exactly savor it. My parents went to bed early, didn't have internet access and I wasn't able to keep up my nightlife that I so dearly loved.

My father got me a job that was very demanding physically. I liked it at first as I got a very good workout, was losing weight and got decent paychecks. I was working very hard during the day and it wore me out. I spent most of my days after work hanging out with my friend who had internet access (I was gaming online as much as I could) and started to spend a couple of nights a week sleeping on his couch. This progressed to me sleeping every night on his couch, and being a good friend of mine, he didn't mind at all. 

I stopped showing up to work and calling in sick again. I wasn't sick, I just woke up most days when my alarm went off and just didn't feel like going to work. I simply didn't want to work and spent most of my days browsing reddit and playing video games at my buddy's house. I was let go from my job. I then began living at my friends house, sleeping on his couch and only eating when I was too hungry to put it off any longer. My friend tried to help me, getting me a job that I eventually got fired from for not showing up and trying to get me to work out. I lived on that same couch for an entire year. 

This is when my family and friends intervened. They had an meeting with me and asked me what was wrong. I started crying as I admitted that I was having regular thoughts of suicide. During that year on the couch, I would contemplate killing myself daily. I never went as far as thinking HOW I would kill myself, but the thought lingered in the back of my mind. Thoughts such as ""I could really just end this all pretty quickly"" and ""Wow, this would be so easy.""

So they started helping me. They introduced me to a therapist and I started meeting with him. I moved off of my buddies couch and back into my parents house. I got a part time job and am trying to get back into school. But my bad habits that I had formed still haunt me. I met with my therapist for multiple sessions. He gave me some great insight into myself. 

I have learned that I am a very negative thinker. I don't understand why people like me, despite the fact that my friends and family enjoy my company. I don't know how to accept compliments. My friends often say they love when I show up to events. I'm still convinced that they are mocking me. I don't understand why people enjoy my company. I don't believe anyone truly likes me. It feels like everyone is simply putting up with me. I know deep down that this isn't true, but I still feel have these feelings. I feel so alone.

And this is where I currently am. I have stopped seeing my therapist because everytime I set up an appointment, I don't bother to show up. He is probably tired of my unwillingness to change myself.

I just don't know what to do. I know that I want to better myself, but I'm just too indifferent to put forth the effort. Can you all give me some insight?

My résumé is solid, I don't have any gaps in my work history, I have a handful of internships relevant to my field and I always write a nice cover letter. I've been trying to figure out why I haven't been landing any interviews. 

I live in South Jersey and have been applying for entry level marketing jobs in New York City and Philadelphia (there is very seldom a marketing job open in my immediate area). I've had a lot of success finding openings in NYC that I meet all the requirements for but haven't gotten a single call. I've been working and saving up money anticipating having to relocate once I find a job.

I recently read an article describing how recruiters and HR personnel scan your résumé in under 20 seconds to easily exclude a good percentage of their applicants. One of the criteria they described is if you're applying for a job in a metropolitan area and you don't live there you're résumé may get tossed aside due to the high volume of applicants and the company not wanting to deal with someone who has to relocate.

While I would have no problem relocating (actually, looking forward to it) and I am not expecting any kind of relocation stipend for an entry level position, I have no way of communicating that if I'm not even being brought in for an interview. 

Can any HR people speak to the validity of this practice or can I hear from anyone who recently landed an entry level job where the fact that you had to relocate wasn't an issue for the company?"

What are some good books to continue my education? For the most part, I have a decent grasp on the concepts, but it's not yet second nature to me -- especially my vocabulary. 

Currently, I'm trying to get another job with a startup, to learn more about the business operations side before I go out on my own and seek funding. However, for a lot of these higher level non-engineering positions, most people are seeking really A list talent. Unfortunately, my experience doesn't go beyond management and business development, with a degree from an average university. While I do have the desire and drive to want to learn, and further educate myself, I feel like I just don't have the immediate skills everyone is looking for. 

Ideally I want to have a firm grasp on all concepts, end-to-end, so I can increase my appeal and competency. This way I can, hopefully, get into a small startup and learn how the inner workings in depth. I had this oppurtunity with my last startup I worked with, but unfortunately it grew way too fast, and restructured into a mess, before I was able to take advantage of the situation.

I've already read all the popular books, *Lean Startup*, *The are of Start*, and so on...

I've been told to try and go for an internship, but unfortunately I'm 25 and mommy and daddy put their checkbook away while ago. I much rather become highly educated and offer value that way.

Reddit, I need help. I'm graduating in May with a degree in journalism. I've had two successful internships, one of which turned into a weekend reporting job. I was editor-in-chief of my school newspaper last year and have worked there all four years of college. I have well over 100 published clips and a good GPA.

And now that I'm at the end of the road, I don't know if I even want to be a journalist at all. I'm burnt out on it.

What I SHOULD do is use my connections here in my home state to get a job in journalism as planned. 

Another possible option is Teach For America. I've made it to their final interview stage and I'll know in mid March if I made it. However, I'd have to decide if I want to commit by the end of March, which would likely be before I have job offers from other places. 

What I really WANT to do is move to Los Angeles and find some sort of job in media, and be with the guy I've been seeing on and off for six years (we can never get the timing right). I have a few connections out there, but I hear finding a job there in an field is really, really difficult.

Can someone help me reason this out? "

18xju0,8,2013-02-20,A man tries to complain to time,[deleted],fifthworldproblems,https://www.reddit.com/r/fifthworldproblems/comments/18xju0/a_man_tries_to_complain_to_time/,"The lobby of Time incorporated’s complaints department had been designed by a corporate tax lawyer as an exercise in creativity. Never intended for use, it had stayed in his drawer until he died of surprise one night upon discovering fun. Weeks later, a mid level bureaucrat found it while cleaning up after him, and realised it for the masterpiece of efficiency that it was. 

First, the chairs. Unforgiving, small and plastic, the kind Yohan had hoped never to sit in again after school. Then the receptionist. Years ago the business had outsourced all of their receptionist duties to Margaret Thatcher, a decision greeted with a mixture of horror and profound admiration for the simple audacity of the hire. Thatcher was capable of disposing of inane questions such as ‘‘will my spot stay booked if I just pop down the street to use the bathroom?’ simply by staring right through the person and into an orange metal placard, that said “NO BOOKINGS”. In a room with greys that could numb quicker and more efficiently than any benzoyl, the sign was the closest thing to entertainment. Yohan was unsure whether the font of the sign, Comic Sans, was a joke. If it was it bordered on the macabre.

But Yohan cared about none of this. Simply the fact that he was there served as a form of validation and source of happiness. Only minutes ago, he had sat in front of parliament house, delivering a speech in favour of complaining to Time.# It had been the culmination of his life’s work, first as an economist, then as a profoundly dedicated user of The Secret, as seen on Oprah. 

The problem with time, Yohan reasoned whilst drinking too much champagne one evening, was that it wasn’t money. Money, to economists, is moral, and more importantly, efficient. You work harder, you get more money. Reward and punishment, billions of people connected through their own selfishness, blissfully unaware that they are helping each other through the laws of supply and demand. Time however, was doled out with utter disregard for the logic of the free market. It was tantamount to communism, in theory delivering ‘to each according to their needs,’ in practice falling far short of the mark.

One of the effects of getting drunk on champagne is that the morning after, instead of forgetting about whatever terrible ideas one had the night before, you instead believe they were inspired. Something to do with bubbles and French people. Yohan’s determination to fix time grew steadily like a madman’s conspiracy theory about the president. It wasn’t until Yohan discovered The Secret however, that he was able to put his ideas into practice. 

Through the power of positive thinking, says the secret, one can achieve anything. The universe has wavelengths, and when we are irritable, we beget irritable wavelengths, and irritating things happen. When we are happy, happy things happen. When we wish for bikes, bike things happen. This is no simplification. If it was true (it was) then Yohan had found the perfect mechanism to reach Time (inc).

After a few days of campaigning at organic food shops and anti-vaccination protests Yohan was able to gain the support of the coveted scientifically illiterate token hippy demographic. He was speaking to parliament within weeks. This choice or organisation was fortuitous, if ever there were a group of people capable of grinning a suspiciously satisfied grin while swallowing copious amounts of bullshit and excreting it out into a more refined form, it was politicians. The bill to complain passed, and Yohan disappeared.

In the lobby, Yohan was waiting torturously. He simply didn’t know how to approach Thatcher, no matter how hard he used The Secret, she wouldn’t start the conversation with him, and he was far too afraid to start the conversation with her. He was saved by the entrance through a side door of an unassuming middle aged man with a plain face whose nametag read simply ‘Jesus’. ‘Hey Thatcher’ he asked ‘do you happen to know how to turn up the thermostat?’
‘I am a receptionist Jesus, not an electrician, and I would not presume to be one.’ Thatcher’s eyes were affixed to the computer while she glared at Jesus. Yohan however, saw his opportunity. ‘Hey I might be able to give you a hand there Jesus, if you could just take me to the complaints office?’ Jesus perked up immediately, happy to be able to procrastinate a while longer.# ‘Sure thing man’ he replied, ‘Just follow right on through.’

Several confusing and utterly uniform corridors later, they were, Jesus said ‘almost there dude’. The corridors were less blatantly malicious than the waiting room, more blue, designed by accountants rather than lawyers. A hint of brimstone tinged the air however. 

Around the final corner was an enormous padlocked gate, large enough for an elephant to fit through. Inside, the floor changed from felted carpet to poorly hewn rock. The cubicles inside were as humorless as one would expect. ‘Frank!’ Yelled Jesus, before turning to Yohan ‘we recently outsourced complaints to the Orcs of Mount Doom, they’re great guys but just keep a fair distance from the gate’. A foreboding scream emanated from one of the cubicles, out of it shambled an orc, ala lord of the rings but with a name tag that read “HI! MY NAME IS FRANK! I AM AN INTERN SO PLEASE BE PATIENT WITH ME” pinned to a short sleeve collared blue shirt. It stormed up to the gates and shook them hard enough to crack the concrete they were set in, howling all the while. Jesus waited patiently until it stopped. ‘Frank, Yohan here has a complaint to make. Remember your training. Go on Yohan.’ Suddenly finding his sense of purpose, Yohan smiled that ingratiating smile which only used car salesmen and dedicated believers of positive affirmation can summon.

Frank screamed as if he had just been force fed Yohan’s willy. The bars began to crack under his pounding fists. Yohan’s mistake had been the smile. All of Frank’s mates thought he was a really, really lovely guy. Just great. Orcs have a social system based wholly on strength and brutality however, so, unused to shoving down feelings of dissatisfaction with people’s plainly sycophantic behaviour Frank felt the uncontrollable urge to punch Yohan’s toadying face, thus asserting proper social structure.

Yohan looked to Jesus.
‘Huh.’ Said Jesus, seeming slightly perturbed
‘well what now? Asked Yohan. ‘Can we go somewhere else?’
‘Umm’ Said Jesus. ‘Not really.’ An embarrassing silence ensued. Yohan was close to tears.

 ‘Look I’ll tell you what man.’ Jesus consoled him. ‘I’m just middle management really, we’re having a family barbecue on the weekend though, if you write down your number I’ll invite you along. We can have a few beers yeah? Maybe you’ll meet someone there who can help you.’ 

Relieved to feel like he was doing something, Yohan grabbed the pen and paper Jesus had somehow procured (nothing mysterious, he’d just popped over to the newsagent like any normal guy. He bought a mars bar while he was there too), wrote his number down, and stumbled back to earth.

A few days later, after Jesus had been told how tall he was by the hundredth aunt, he remembered Yohan. Then he remembered cleaning his desk on Friday, like his boss always made him, and accidentally filing the number into the Grim Reaper’s folder. Regret passed over his face, but this sort of thing happened pretty often, someone else would probably fix it up. Either way, it was nothing an extra beer wouldn’t solve.

I’m trying to explore a couple of other fields: corporate finance at F500, PWM, commercial banking, and lastly asset management. I have little internship experience (only interned at an insurance firm doing admin work, and now I’m currently at a non-paid internship at start-up brokerage/advisory firm). I’m trying to figure out what the next best course of action is. My current firm is sponsoring me for the series 7 and series 66 and I’ll be taking those within a month.

So I have a few questions: 1) Should I start applying now to commercial banking, corporate finance, pwm entry roles or should I search for an internship at these sectors before applying for entry roles? 2) For entry roles at F500, are the offices usually in NYC? 3) Which roles in F500 corporate finance are the easiest to break into? 4) Any chance of getting into rotational programs at this point with my stats? Also, does Corp Fin F500 usually prefer finance majors or accounting majors? 5) Would it give me a tiny advantage having the 7/66 for a PWM entry role at a BB? 6) I understand commercial banking is more relevant to businesses, but what are the specific names of the roles in commercial banking? And does it help having series 7/66, what is the beginning salary?

Basically, given my stats, what would be the next course of action to take for 2-3 years until I go back to get a MBA?

I know this is a long post, but I really appreciate any of the help you guys can give me, I’m really desperate. Thanks in advance, for all the help. This website really helped me a lot, a ton of great info.

It only took me a few conversations to realize that everyone at this career fair were looking for primarily Microsoft track software developers. When I mention that I'd like to be doing systems or network engineering out of college, I get told these positions aren't entry level and I have to pretend like I'm interested in doing software development for this company for the rest of the conversation.

So now I'm in a weird spot, I'm the only systems engineer concentration at my entire school, but I'm not qualified for any systems engineering jobs.

It makes me feel better to check this subreddit a lot. Just thought I'd give an update to my situation. In my original [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1898di/year_long_relationship_ended_after_she_21f_broke/) I basically told you guys everything from start to finish with this girl. 

Anyways it'll be 3 weeks post breakup and maintaining NC this Saturday and sometimes I feel like I should break this NC because I want to know if there's a slight possibility of her missing me..Another part of me is saying that because she is also maintaining NC with me she is quite serious and it is over. A friend told me she doesn't think i should call her, but if i do i should simply small talk and try to pick up on her emotions and guide the conversation based on them. (whether she sounds annoyed to talk or she actually misses me) 

So yeah, some days I'm really strong on never breaking NC and others I'm not. I did everything that was recommended like hanging with friends, working out, picking up a new hobby but I just cant stop thinking about her. If i do call her and get an update, will it help me move on if shes the same? Will it hurt even more then it already does considering I'm already assuming that's what shes thinking? I'm pretty sure eventually she will contact me to see me again (Whether for closure or a change of heart) because during our breakup she promised me to think about it more and see me again when shes on break from her internship (Late march). Should I just wait untill then to talk? I realize it could be for closure. Just wondering what you guys think are some pros or cons for breaking NC this week. 

Thanks for being here, all of you."

18x6x9,1,2013-02-20,Need some advice,[deleted],gay,https://www.reddit.com/r/gay/comments/18x6x9/need_some_advice/,"Hello gentlemen! I've decided to post here well… cause I don’t know where else to post xD. (new to reddit and this is my first post!), of course I have a question that about guys too :), just needed some input and this place seems active more than what I had looked for a subreddit to ask this question.

Firstly, I want to ask anyone that has finished college with a BA, more importantly anyone here has a job as an accountant? I want to ask how was it when you got your first accounting job. Did you have good grades? I really doubt that I should stay in the accounting concentration, because honestly I’m not smart enough to get anything higher than a C in my accounting classes. No matter how much I study and practice it, it just doesn’t stick. For financial accounting got a C, for managerial accounting, I for the life of me don’t know how I even manage a C. And now I’m in Intermediate accounting I, my teacher said that companies would really only want graduates with gpa 3.0, and fall in love with 3.5 gpa. She also said that no one would really want to hire someone that got all C’s in there accounting course. I mean I could pass all the accounting classes but yeah all C’s. This is kind of deterring me away from the concentration. I more or less picked accounting as a concentration, because everyone needs one, I’ll always have a job, at least I thought. SO, getting to my question, yes I could get a degree in business with a concentration in accounting, but honestly I believe all my accounting classes will be C’s. And I’m worried that no one would really want to hire me because of it. I had planned to intern a crap load to gain experience and hopefully they’d overlook my grades a bit.

Lastly :o… I’ve been talking to a few guys online on adam4adam ( I know not the best place, but after lurking around seems like OKC is a better site :p). But I talk to them for one day, then I pretty much don’t talk to them again. I feel like.. if I message em that’d I be annoying them, so I usually wait till they message me. ): shy in person and online D:!! Also, half the time I don’t even know what to talk about. Wondering if you guys can give me some advice on conversations ):…  usually don’t talk to anyone unless I have a reason too, D: I try to leave comfort zone, but come back with my head down in disappointment lol.
Anyway I would like to thank you guys if you actually read it all ^^ thanks~

Tldr; recent college graduates in accounting or anyone working as an accountant, did you need good grades to land a job? Would gaining experience help me get a job even though I don’t have the desirable grades.?

Tldr2; I have trouble keeping up a conversations. When talking to other people what do you guys usually talk about? Been talking to a few guys online and it’s basically I talk to them one day seem like we hit it off, but then that’s it.

18x668,1,2013-02-20,Phone interview tips from a company abroad?,[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/18x668/phone_interview_tips_from_a_company_abroad/,"Not sure where else this question would go...

Well, I have a phone interview for an internship in the UK this Friday, and I'm in need of some advice. The interviewer is obviously *from* the UK, and so the call with be done international and with a 6 hour difference. 

The biggest issue I am worried about is the difference in accents. I am from the US, but my accent is a bit different than the typical American accent (whatever that may be) as I speak with a different tone and emphasize different words. I can't completely explain it, let's just say I got yelled at a lot by my public speaking teacher for not speaking ""correctly"". But, is there any other way I could try to speak more clearly besides slowing down? Also, how should I approach trying to understand her accent? Is it appropriate to ask her to slow down?

Also, any tips on what questions to prepare for? I have of course gone through the interview process previously, although I am unaware of what questions I might be asked from someone abroad. It was suggested that I should prepare to answer questions that may revolve around ""Why are you trying to get a job over here?"" although I'm not sure if that really is reasonable question to prepare for.

Any other advice is welcome, thanks!"

My story: Economics major and Russian minor from Colgate University, GPA 3.5 . I realized that I wanted to go into investment finance around my junior year, but since I live in the middle of no where, I could only get an short summer internship in my town with a Personal Wealth Manager at Community Bank. I took a Wall Street Prep course and learned some basic modeling, but that is basically the extent of it. I realized after graduating that for me to do a financial representative gig now  with no network is doomed to fail, and I'd prefer something with a more cerebral challenge. I was thinking equities research.

What I'm finding that going to a non/semi?-target school with only one non-glamorous internship and a decent GPA in a related field isn't getting me anywhere. Is it hopeless?

I do have 5 months of admin experience in healthcare, and I wouldn't mind doing something unrelated if it helped me transfer/learn the business.

I apologize if some of the language seems weird, I had it formatted differently and it looked terrible so I smashed a bunch of info together.

Here are some job qualities or attributes that I think fit well with me. Pick and choose. Job idea that fits the most wins!!

* Analytical Problem Solving, Creative Problem Solving

* Work you can take pride in

* Importance on Design Process, QFD, Creative Solutions

* Decent level of social interaction

* Decent level of non-office work, variety

* Bonus for Entrepreneurial, or at least some feeling of it

* Bonus for spending some time outside

* Bonus for a hands-on aspect

Some History

* Already have BS in Civil, will have BS in Mechanical by the end of summer

* Worked professionally in sustainable buildings for a few years - Worked in Mechanical &amp; Civil engineering, Architecture, Interior Design, &amp; Construction Management



* Did a fair bit in Automotive Engineering, within the scope of Formula SAE for a pretty good US team - My design work was mainly in structural packaging/FEA and powertrain, but I’ve been around it long enough to have a solid grasp of suspension too. I’ve volunteered for the FSAE US comps for a couple years. Right now, working on a joint Industrial design &amp; engineering school project for one of the “Big Three”

* Had a bunch of part time jobs, summer jobs and internships - Manufacturing process engineering, DOT construction inspection, Ag &amp; Construction equipment operator, Laborer, Pipefitter, Oil field roughneck, Welder, Concrete research assistant, and Formula Atlantic Racecar mechanic

* Ran my own lawn care business during high school and into college, Led to a lot of other contract work, Ag, Construction &amp; Rando

* Grew up on a farm and naturally developed into a very mechanically inclined and hands-on person with an affinity for working outdoors. Did what most of what you might imagine, drove equipment, broke equipment, fixed equipment, built equipment from scratch, threw hay, and kept livestock. Learned some conservation and Ag management practices. Tons of redneck projects – trucks, jeeps, lawnmowers etc

Some possibilities I’ve been thinking of.

* Return to Building engineering with a focus on energy &amp; commissioning

* Manufacturing engineering, I do feel like this is a more limited long term career option.

* Forensic Engineering, maybe automotive emphasis

* Automotive Design/Engineering outright

* Anything I could eventually turn into my own business, not sure what that is yet."

So I was admitted into the UCDC Program.  However, I also plan on going into the International Relations Honors Seminar, which begins next quarter.  

I've been advised by students who have gone through the Seminar that I should stay on campus and do research (plus get a few classes out of the way), instead of taking time to do an internship plus whatever class I take for the UCDC program.  

Has anyone had experience with either the Honors Seminar or UCDC Program? I'm putting my priority with the Seminar, because I'd like to go to a nice graduate school; however, the UCDC program is something I don't want to pass up unless it's worth it.

My family and I (Fiance', 2 Step-Children here a week and at their mothers a week and a 3 year old English Bulldog) decided to rescue/adopt a puppy back in November of last year. His name is [Rowdy](http://i.imgur.com/fbVwY), now a 1 year old Bull Terrier/Jack Russell mix, 35lb, neutered and crate trained red-headed creature that lives up to his name.

A little background: Herky, the Bulldog, is a very gregarious dog. He loves people, he is a typical lazy, chill/relax and watch TV type of dog. We all were aware of the energy level of a terrier and thought it would be great for Herky (he needs to loose a few pounds). 

We wanted a dog to play with Herky because he is so social. Herky went to training but is still very much Bull-headed. But, we got the basics down. 

I have had dogs/animals my entire life and have read/done a lot of training. I used to work with horses and now Intern at a local zoo. I do my research and reading. My fiance' expects my new dog to be a 'Herky' as he likes to say. And trust me, I have explained to him that's not going to happen for a while. He's not a real patient man... take that as you will.

Now to Rowdy, the GOOD: He's a sweetie. He's incredibly smart. He has started to understand the concepts of basic obedience. He sits, lays and shakes for now. We are working on loose leash, stay and come. Come is getting better. His stay is really bad. He seems very ADD, but, I chalk that up to 'puppy'. He has attached himself to me. Likes everyone else but really loves me.

The issues: I have seen a VAST improvement in the walking department but we still have problems. We use a prong collar. I have used these collars on my Rottie (no longer with us) ++SEE NOTE++ and other larger dogs growing up. Now, I know I'm going to get heat for this but it is the ONLY thing that works. He does not do well with the easy leader, the easy walker and a regular harness. Trust me, I've tried them. And bought all of them. He had literally drug me across a football field one time. I tried the standing still, the waiting, the treats/clicker. NOTHING is working. He pulls like a sled dog. He jumps at dogs walking by. He actually jumped towards a dog and flipped over and landed on his back/head really hard the other day. His hair stands up when dogs bark at him or if he sees another dog. However, this doesn't happen at the dog park for some reason. He's very social at the dog park. He gets hump-y but other than that we have a great time there.

HE'S WHY WE CAN'T HAVE NICE THINGS! (Just Kidding, but not really.) This dog is destroying every thing we have and whatever he can get in his mouth. The list includes: the comforter on my bed, an ottoman, various area rugs, PILLOWS, shoes and a chlorinator from our pool (with chlorine in it, didn't eat it, crunched on the tablets though). He's destroyed my landscaping outback, ate a bush completely and enjoys the water from the birdbath on a regular basis.

He has toys, chewies, ropes rawhide's, balls and of course, my other dog to play with. Its almost like a game. He stops when we either: A) squirt him with a squirt bottle B) Yell C) command 'drop it'/'leave it' (which works wonders now).

Family: My family is very upset with things getting chewed on. My house is a MESS ALL THE TIME! We do put stuff up but he finds a way. My fiance gave me the 'its me or the dog' speech. I talked him into another 60-90 days so I'm kind-of desperate. Its not that I'd choose the dog or anything but I think he deserves a chance. He can be a good dog, we just need to teach him. That's my normal speech to the family.

He's on Heartguard and he gets 3 Zyrtec for allergies in the AM and PM. It usually helps with the hyper-ness (unintentional, I promise!)

I want to help him and I want to be better for him but I'm loosing my mind. I don't think we were ready for this... BIG regrets. I know its probably us. I know I'm doing something really wrong. Or we are.

I had been on another forum and got my butt chewed for the prong collar so I've ordered a martingale collar. I've also ordered a 30ft lounge rope, flirt stick (my fiance is making it) and a easy leader muzzle harness. We have a 'Behaviorist' coming out on Saturday (tomorrow) to see if its something he could help figure out.

Sorry for rambling... I'm distraught. I didn't rescue him for nothing. I don't want to give up but I don't want to loose my family because of a dog.

Plus, good luck finding an actual matched suit in there.

Every suit I've tried on that would be appropriate courtroom or office attire is either badly-fitted or comically large. My biggest problem is the jackets being too large around the shoulders and saggy on the sides under the armpits. I've tried the petite's section to no avail. Any suggestions?"

I had gotten to the final round of interviews and was up against one other person and lost the position to him/her. 

My GPA is .03 below the curve at my law school. I have a couple applications/interviews in the works but losing this position has just hit me so hard because there were 3 rounds of interviews and I just feel like I've been thinking about this job--pining for it really--since the beginning of this semester.

I don't know if it is the rejection talking - but I feel like that position was the only way I was going to get my foot in the door of the legal world. I don't have any connections and even though I'm attending law school tuition-free, it just feels like someone blew out the light at the end of the tunnel. I should have known that my low gpa would make getting the position tough but knowing you're not qualified and hoping for a miracle aren't mutually exclusive. The legal job market is scary out there, but so is the general job market. I feel completely holed-in and don't understand what my next move should be.

I find myself in a bit of an awkward situation with internships. I would like to use an internship on my résumé along with a portfolio to get into a school of an appropriate caliber but I'm from what's called the Lehigh valley in PA. I'm currently in comm college here. The closest biggest town is Allentown which I doubt most of you have hear of save that billy Joel song or whatever. I'm about 50 miles from Philly, and I assume that would be the best place to actually look.. it's just a hell of a commute. So my question is.. should I try and transfer to a less prestigious school In an area that would Actualy have intern opportunities? Or should I just stay put and devote my time to making a killer portfolio to get into a good school? My high school grades aren't great, and my first year of college is hurting my GPA so I need to set myself apart in any way possible. but is searching for internships 50+ miles away really gonna help me as much as it's going to complicate my life?

[Any chance of some more vlogs in the future? Made in Korea was hilarious!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fu7rz?context=5)|Not vlogs specifically but I want to do more on camera stuff starting this summer once I move into a bigger place. I have a dream of doing a nightly 1 hour on camera stream in the style of a late night talk show, but one with a hugely unprofessional public access vibe. We'll see where things go in a couple of months but, yes, I think on camera stuff is definitely a big part of the future of this kind of content (not just facecam horror videos) and I don't want to miss the boat. 
[Where does the name ""Northernlion"" come from? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fucoc?context=5)|I was 13, lived in Canada (northern) and my name rhymes with lion. Thank god I didn't go with like xXxMOHSNIPER69.
[You spoke about eventually ending the ""Isaac"" series before starting the cheat engine runs. Now you are at episode #410(?\). Some could say that that Isaac is getting stale and it could be replased with fresh content. Have you thought how long you are planning to continue the BOI series.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fua9m?context=5)|The thing with Isaac is that there's a lot of people who think its run its course, but there's also a lot of people who still really like it and consider it part of their routine like a morning radio show or Regis and Kelly or something. I still enjoy playing the game and the metrics show that there's still a large chunk of my audience that enjoys watching it, so I'm going to keep doing it for the time being.
 |The thing to keep in mind is that Isaac videos never take away from the other content I produce, they're just in addition to it. I've never skipped over a game for a Let's Look At or something because I've felt an obligation to dedicate a 'timeslot' to Isaac instead. 
[How much is your steam library worth?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fu7nw?context=5)|Damn, this is a good question. According to Steam I have 400 games, but most of those are indie titles usually in the $5-$15 range. Factoring in AAA titles that I've received or bought myself, you're probably looking at maybe $5,000? That's kind of a staggering number to me, so guys that have been doing this a lot longer (TotalBiscuit, for example) must have libraries worth as much as a new car. 
[If this is your business, shouldn't you kind of know these numbers? Even for tax purposes.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fvrlu?context=5)|95% of these games come direct from the publisher or developer, so I don't need to write them off as a business expense. 
[Bored of Isaac yet? I'm not, I adore the game myself, but I suspect you've played an awful lot more than me!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fu8k6?context=5)|Challenge runs have gone a long way towards stemming the boredom! 
[On that note, do you plan to do any more themed runs, like the current TF2 challenges?  Which boss do you consider most annoying? Mask of infamy can be damn near impossible sometimes, but then there's also the headless horseman occasionally showing up on the first floor...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fvt0x?context=5)|Headless Horseman or The Fallen early in the game can ruin you, but it's a rare occurrence. Mask of Infamy is a huge pain if you lack piercing shots, but champion versions of The Bloat are the most consistently rage-inducing for me.
[What game in your opinion, is the most underrated? Also, what is the most overrated?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fubtb?context=5)|This is a tough question so I'm gonna answer in recent terms as opposed to ""all-time"" context. I think Skulls of the Shogun is super underrated right now. It's a fun strategy game that seems to be getting no attention due to its weird distribution strategy/obligation.
[Fan since SMB, you're easily one of the best LPers on YT, dat voice.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fubtb?context=5)|Most overrated, recently? I think *DmC* is a decent game but I don't think it's ""85 on Metacritic"" good. *Borderlands 2* didn't hook me at all, either. 
[What introduced you to doing videos, was it watching others doing it too?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fu7yz?context=5)|Yep, I was primarily influenced by guys like AVGN, Spoony, and Angry Joe (who I had the pleasure of meeting at Paradox Con a couple of weeks ago) . I started out doing reviews in a similar vein to them but branched into more unscripted content once I found that I sound like a robot when I'm reading off of a page. 
[When was your biggest, ""Holy crap! People actually like my videos,"" moment? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fu9oa?context=5)|I try to stay pretty humble and self-deprecating so I get these moments all the time. Just yesterday Edmund McMillen tweeted and blogged about my ""Top 10 Items in The Binding of Isaac"" video and that made me a bit giddy. 
[Dude, you got Edmund McMillen in one of your videos! Retweet is nothing after that!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fvfa0?context=5)|True! We're going to probably do another collaboration in the future if I can get my shit together. He's really good about stuff like that but I'm terrible at setting it up.
[What's involved in managing your youtube channel? For example, what are your usual daily activities? How many hours do you typically work?  Edit: You're a pretty cool guy.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fuacf?context=5)|An hour or so shooting emails to devs/publishers, few hours recording, few hours playing games to get acclimated enough to record them later, maybe a half hour writing meta data and making thumbnails. Thanks!
[Oh yeah, onother thing. I really want to see one of your livestreams but I live in Europe, so fuck me, right? :D Totally screwed! Btw, will you do a Let´s play of the Day Z standalone game? Because you played the mod.. and it was nice! ;D.  So how about a season 2 on Day Z? :33.  And do you know the gamescom in cologne, germany? Will you be there someday? :DD THAT WOULD BE AWESOME! love you &lt;3.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fuizs?context=5)|Planning on playing Day Z standalone, yep. Not sure if I'll LP it, but at least a Let's Look At.
[Proof?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fu83e?context=5)|Just tweeted verification [on my account](http://twitter.com/NorthernlionLP).
[My question is, how did you network and advertise your content to gain your subscriber and following base?  (I am a small YouTuber, mostly LoL content with 700,000 views and 1400 subs\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fufqa?context=5)|It's mostly search traffic. I haven't done much network or many collaborations. The landscape is more competetive now, though.
[Yeah, I use to make content (on a separate account\) way back in 2008 and you would get 1000-4000 views on it if it was a popular topic... and now it is like 10-20... :\ oh well...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fv119?context=5)|YouTube is a pretty harsh mistress. You can have a decent following but if you stop posting videos and lose momentum, people will just go elsewhere since there's no shortage of channels doing similar types of content. 
[What Isaac items do you have little or no knowledge of? (Crystal Ball, Dead Dove, etc\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fui69?context=5)|Acording to commenters: all of them.
[How did you deal with the transitional phase from smaller channel to a medium sized channel? This is something I'm currently going through, and I'll be entirely honest here, it's extremely stressful at times. Knowing you need to focus all your efforts onto the channel to encourage growth leaves little time for anything else. This means income can be a problem. So, how did you deal with that period in your channels life?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fubx7?context=5)|Luckily for me I was in a financial place where I could kind of risk it. When my contract teaching ESL in Korea expired in Nov. 2011, I had a decent amount of money saved up so even though my channel wasn't making me too much income, I could afford to dedicate a few months towards growing it without breaking the bank. Ended up being a good decision!
 |The big change for me from a content perspective was producing a lot more videos. I went from doing around 1/day to 3/day as I started to realize that there were people out there who relied (for lack of a better word) on my videos for entertainment. So from my perspective, that transition wasn't necessarily about hitting X number of subscribers, but rather a philosophical change from being ""that dude whose videos you watch now and then"" to ""that outlet where you can get a ton of gaming content every day"".
 |Hope that helps, and good luck! 
[How exactly do you make your money? Do you just strictly enter gaming competitions that award cash to the winner? Or do you have some sort of partnership with youtube? How can you support yourself by just playing video games?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fugpm?context=5)|It's entertainment, not competitive gaming. Basically, I have a partnership with a network. The network runs ads on my videos, and I get paid a small amount for each ad viewed.
[How does one obtain a partnership with a network?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fxl5r?context=5)|Basically just exist, make content, and have a reasonably sized audience. There are a ton of networks that will sign channels basically sight unseen but your best bet is to work your way up a bit until you qualify for a major and reputable network.
[Ey Ryan, watched literally all your videos and I´m addicted to you. :( Congratz! Greetings from germany...  Has your voice always been like this? Have you trained it somehow? Because i love it! :D.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fu9gr?context=5)|Just lucky I guess! Puberty hit me like a ton of bricks. Thanks for the support!
[What games, if any, are you playing outside of your usual Isaac and Let's Look At routine? Is there any time left to play games just for fun, without doing anything for the channel?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fvfv9?context=5)|I play a ton of games but usually it's for limited durations. I drop in, play a few hours (or if it's for review, beat the whole thing), make my content, and move on. The line between fun and work is blurry but I like it that way.
 |I played a lot of recreational XCOM:EU and, although I know it's blasphemy, spent a decent amount of time in BLOPS 2 online as well. 
[Are you getting tired of Isaac?  How many hours do you have played according to Steam?  Also, it's time for a reset.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fu90t?context=5)|I was getting tired of it for a while but after a short break I always find myself wanting to return. Challenge runs have also helped mix things up for me. I have almost 300 hours in the game according to Steam and I'm super excited for Rebirth to be here in the winter. 
[Was Roll Fizzlebeef responsible for moving that asteroid just out of impact range using telepathy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fucva?context=5)|All I'll say is that I have Roll in a cryosleep chamber in my basement ready to be thawed when the Earth needs him the most.
[Do you ever feel like following your degree in Biology might've been better for you/more interesting?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fugvx?context=5)|It's a touchy subject since what I'm doing now has literally zero relation to my degree (not that I'm necessarily complaining). I make myself feel better by thinking that the four years I spent in university made me a little more confident and a little funnier, which are probably skills that have contributed to my modest success so far.
[1\) When is the next Saving Progress podcast going to be uploaded on YouTube? It seems like it has been forever.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fuc3a?context=5)|We've having some problems on the SP front. We live in different timezones and Josh and Mike both work full-time jobs. When they're off of work it's only like 3PM my time and I feel obligated to complete my solo stuff before I do collaborations. On top of that, Fox had problems with his ISP and had no internet for 3 weeks, and then I was in Iceland/recovering from jetlag for a couple Wednesdays as well. SP will return and collaborations will become more frequent, but it's an adjustment period right now.  I'm kind of ashamed to admit I don't read much. I mostly listen to podcasts like Dan Carlin's excellent Hardcore History.
[Have you met any other youtubers before, and if so who impressed you the most?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fyaj7?context=5)|Not really. I met AngryJoe and RageGaming at PDX Con a couple of weeks ago and they all seem like nice people.  
[Have you gone to conventions before and was it strange interacting with your fans?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fyaj7?context=5)|I got recognized at PAX a couple of times last summer. Not strange necessarily, but surreal.  
[Do you feel like youtube is over-saturated in video game youtubers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fyaj7?context=5)|Yeah, definitely.  
[What do you feel like separates yourself (i.e. competitive advantage\) from other video game youtubers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fyaj7?context=5)|I started doing it earlier and I think I have a more mature angle than a lot of people are. I hope so, anyway.  
[Have you ever seen a lion before?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fyaj7?context=5)|Yes, at the zoo.
[Are you at liberty to comment on your payment/fee structure with YouTube?  How does this go from being a hobby to YouTube saying ""we'll pay you?""  Understandable if you want to refrain to avoid divulging 'trade secrets,' for the sake of my/our curiosity...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fvth3?context=5)|I'm not allowed to talk financial specifics, but the process is pretty standardized by now. You start your channel, eventually you grow to the point where a ""network"" takes notice of you and offers you a partnership whereby they serve ads on your videos, take a cut of the revenue, and give you the rest. You can monetize directly with YouTube as well, but networks provide some secondary benefits like promotion (sometimes) and protection from publishers/takedown notices (sometimes).
 |The landscape is changing though. Networks are going through major restructuring and it'll be interesting to see how things look a year from now.
[How do you find such terrible games for poison mushroom?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fubvl?context=5)|Metacritic and sort by lowest score in the past 5 years or something. Lots of gold to be mined there. 
[When are you publishing ""The Northernlion Story""?  PS: Loved your X-Com playthrough.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fubmb?context=5)|Thanks! I loved the XCOM series too. Fizzlebeef for life.
[What is, in your opinion, the worst game you have ever played ? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fuk45?context=5)|There's been a lot of games that are just broken, and by that metric I think Action 52 is definitely the worst. For me, though, I at least find those games interesting because they're such spectacular failures. The worst times I've had with games have been games that are bland in their badness, so for that I usually mention *Drug Wars* and *Tunnel Rats 1968*.
[Which ""series"" made you more famous ? (I know you since you posted videos about Super Meat Boy, but i wonder if you have statistics on that\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fu99h?context=5)|Super Meat Boy, Isaac, and Scribblenauts Unlimited have been the big ones in terms of bringing in a new audience. Terraria was pretty big as well when I was much smaller, and I think Spelunky and FTL helped out a lot on a smaller scale as well. One thing is for sure, without Isaac I wouldn't be as big as I am today, but without Super Meat Boy I probably wouldn't even be in the same ballpark.
[Wha tis your current stand in pixel art graphics in games these days? Its getting used more and more frequently but I kinda like that :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fvoo4?context=5)|It doesn't bother me at all. I think there's a backlash to it because some people think it's the developers jumping on a retro/nostalgia bandwagon, but the reality is that pixel art is relatively easy and cheap to do, which makes it a nice choice for small teams or programmers who have no/limited art skills.
 |As nice as it would be for every indie game to have its own unified and unique art style, it's just not practical for most of these studios in their current states. 
[I've been a big fan from near the beginning of your Youtubing adventure (not trying to be a hipster or anything...\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fvt7c?context=5)|There's obviously a lot of perks to my job. I work from home, set my own hours, can take sick days or vacations whenever I want (like today, as I have laryngitis), and perhaps most importantly from a grown-up perspective, even if I don't 'go to work' I still make money, which is awesome. The 14-year old in me loves getting big games a week before they release to the public as well.
[What is your favourite/least favourite part about doing what you do full time? I'm guessing favourite is quite easy to answer, doing what you love doing but for a living, but anything else? Certain perks that keep you trundling along?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fvt7c?context=5)|The worst part is definitely internet commenters. I've grown better at ignoring trolls but people often levy personal attacks at you based on your content/voice/appearance and it adds up sometimes. It's easy to say that you should just let it roll off your back and ignore it, but it's harder to do in reality. Also, when I genuinely make a mistake, I feel like Peter in Office Space, because I have one person who clues me in, followed by dozens/hundreds/thousands of people telling me exactly the same thing.
[Also, you should get a catchphrase. ""This game is great, and I ain't Lion"" could be a good one... ...okay, I just really wanted to make that joke and had to force it in somehow.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fvt7c?context=5)|Overall, this is obviously an awesome job and ignoring a few trolls is a small price to pay.
[Hey Northernlion, just wanted to ask what you think attributed to your success as a YouTuber. I'm a fan and love your commentary to be sure, but there are so many fairly entertaining channels out there that get completely ignored. This isn't a question about how to get famous on YouTube, but what you consider maybe turning points in the channel's popularity? Moments of success?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fuiyr?context=5)|My marketing strategy is basically just to make the best content I can and then make it as easy as possible for people to find it.

I think it's cool that it's come out, but I have no experience with the game and I'm not sure my comments on it are relevant given I've never played it before.

Do you want to just keep using YouTube to distribute or do you want to make the leap to TV?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fvcaf?context=5)|I think it's going to go the opposite way, really, where personalities/shows on TV are going to be making the leap to the internet. Right now, YouTube is the leading online distribution platform so I'm going to stick with that. Things change fast on the internet so it's hard for me to predict where things will be in 6 months, much less well beyond that. 
[If you directed a game, what would it be like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fubrc?context=5)|I'm smart enough to know that if I directed a game, it would be garbage as I have no experience in the field.

That combined with the general...unpleasantness of playing shitty games week in week out makes it a drag sometimes production-wise, although I like how the videos turn out.  
[What do you think makes a good gaming YouTuber?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fx0bx?context=5)|Authenticity and doing their own thing as opposed to just hopping onto bandwagons. There's a thin line between playing something popular and bandwagoning, but as a former supreme court justice formerly said about pornography, ""I may not be able to describe it, but I know it when I see it"".

It's a complicated decision and streaming on Twitch doesn't make financial sense for me, but I want to produce high quality content and that's very difficult for me to do on YT Live.
[One thing about Twitch is that it has a fairly strong network of casters and viewers as well as, I have heard, good support.  Not to mention it is a very popular streaming platform right now, which means more traffic.  Also, straying from Youtube and bringing in new people to your content.   ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fwoqd?context=5)|It's a bit of a complicated situation but Twitch is definitely the immediate future if YT Live doesn't get its act together. 
[Hey there!  I'm now in a process of creating a silly game about Youtube Letsplaying. Now, in your streams you said that you won't mind to be used as a character in such stuff and you probably won't play it. Is that right? Also, can I hope to get a retweet in the unlikely case it ever gets finished?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fvrwn?context=5)|Sure, feel free to use/pervert my image in whatever way you see fit. That goes for anybody who wants to use my video footage as well. As long as you're creating an original work and not simply reuploading my content as your own, I'm cool with it.

We might set something up over emulator I guess (shh) but our schedules so rarely synchronize these days (Mike and myself) that it's probably unlikely.
[Why is your voice so great?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fw0w9?context=5)|Just lucky I guess!

[Tad bit late(as usual when it comes to Iamas\) but I've got a couple questions.  Since you have a huge amount of Isaac videos, when the remake/rebirth comes out, do you think that you will focus a lot of attention on that, or stick with 'classic' Issac.  Which gaming media outlets do you read/watch and do their review opinions ever sway you when it comes to purchasing a game?  When will the SP Podcast return, and do you think there will ever be guests?  Has there ever been a game that you really wanted to do a series on, but got shot down by the publisher, other than the Assassin's Creed LP?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fvcw6?context=5)|To be honest, I get most of the games I'm interested in direct from publishers nowadays, but when I purchase a game my decision usually boils down to whether or not I'm personally interested in it and whether or not it will make noteworthy/interesting content. As such, I shelled out $50 for Aliens:CM even though I was confident it was going to be garbage, just because I wanted to make a video of my thoughts on the game. I do read a lot of sites though, to keep abreast of news and developments, or just to see how their opinions of games line up with my own. I love *Polygon* and I think they have wonderful writers, and I'm a big *Rock Paper Shotgun* fan as well even though they turned me down for an internship position a couple of years ago! Also, big Giant Bomb fan.
 |It will return! There miiight be guests eventually, but let's just start with the training wheels of getting them out consistently before we dream too big.
[Northernlion, What music do you listen to when working?

Tom Waits, Pavement, Boards of Canada, Nas, GZA. I really dug the new Japandroids album this year, and the Frank Ocean album as well, but I'm way out of the loop unfortunately.

[Have you ever considered screencasting for any of the more e-sports centric games?  You would make one hell of a LoL season championship announcer.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fusdx?context=5)|I casted a bit at PDX Con for The Showdown Effect and War of the Roses and learned that it's not as easy as it looks. Maybe if I'd stuck with Dota instead of quitting cold turkey I could be half-decent at it now, but I'm woefully unqualified to do this, as much as I'd love to.
[Are you ever going to do Poison Mushroom again? It was my favorite series.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fw7fi?context=5)|It's possible but it's a little up in the air for a few reasons. I wouldn't rule it out!

Would you ever do a video with Nerdcubed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fwmqr?context=5)|I'd love to if he were open to it, but I respect his right to decline. It's annoying when you get inundated with tweets like, ""Hey X person wants to do a video with you!"" and you have no idea who X person is.
[I completely understand. I just thought it would be super cool considering you guys are my two favorite youtubers and you were communicating on Twitter.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fwozb?context=5)|Right! I mean, I know he knows of me but that isn't necessarily all you need to do a collaboration. I'm really lazy when it comes to dual commentaries and I prefer working at my own speed on my own, so while I'd love to get something done between the two of us, I understand if he's not into it because I'm in that position all the time.
[Found your channel during just after you finished your Dark Souls Let's Play and I've now seen all your videos, much respect for taking the time to make so much great content.

I guess by default it would have to be Super Mario World. It's my favorite game of all time but I am hesitant to post videos as it's one of the most overdone games on YouTube.

So a long while ago a bunch of fellow interns and I set up games of Risk Online using [Warlight](http://warlight.net/).

I apologize if some of the language seems weird, I had it formatted differently and it looked terrible so I smashed a bunch of info together.

Here are some job qualities or attributes that I think fit well with me. Pick and choose. Job idea that fits the most wins!!

* Analytical Problem Solving, Creative Problem Solving

* Work you can take pride in

* Importance on Design Process, QFD, Creative Solutions

* Decent level of social interaction

* Decent level of non-office work, variety

* Bonus for Entrepreneurial, or at least some feeling of it

* Bonus for spending some time outside

* Bonus for a hands-on aspect

Some History

* Already have BS in Civil, will have BS in Mechanical by the end of summer

* Worked professionally in sustainable buildings for a few years - Worked in Mechanical &amp; Civil engineering, Architecture, Interior Design, &amp; Construction Management



* Did a fair bit in Automotive Engineering, within the scope of Formula SAE for a pretty good US team - My design work was mainly in structural packaging/FEA and powertrain, but I’ve been around it long enough to have a solid grasp of suspension too. I’ve volunteered for the FSAE US comps for a couple years. Right now, working on a joint Industrial design &amp; engineering school project for one of the “Big Three”

* Had a bunch of part time jobs, summer jobs and internships - Manufacturing process engineering, DOT construction inspection, Ag &amp; Construction equipment operator, Laborer, Pipefitter, Oil field roughneck, Welder, Concrete research assistant, and Formula Atlantic Racecar mechanic

* Ran my own lawn care business during high school and into college, Led to a lot of other contract work, Ag, Construction &amp; Rando

* Grew up on a farm and naturally developed into a very mechanically inclined and hands-on person with an affinity for working outdoors. Did what most of what you might imagine, drove equipment, broke equipment, fixed equipment, built equipment from scratch, threw hay, and kept livestock. Learned some conservation and Ag management practices. Tons of redneck projects – trucks, jeeps, lawnmowers etc

Some possibilities I’ve been thinking of.

* Return to Building engineering with a focus on energy &amp; commissioning

* Manufacturing engineering, I do feel like this is a more limited long term career option.

* Forensic Engineering, maybe automotive emphasis

* Automotive Design/Engineering outright

* Anything I could eventually turn into my own business, not sure what that is yet."

Update: Just to clear a few things. I'm interning at a big4 that's not in the US.

I plan on returning to the states so I'm not sure how this will work out, we'll see.   

As for time working, I would say 17 hours were pure work. Was I highly efficient/effective in all those hours, obviously not. My brain stops working after 10pm :P. I spent a standard 10 hours at a client's location after which I got a call that help is needed for a different project which I worked briefly for in the past.

In september I completed an internship with a mobile marketing agency. My role was digital marketing, something I remain passionate about, however during my internship many of my responsibilities turned to event marketing and initiating projects for the various events our agency was to attend. While i enjoyed the experience, I did not LEARN anything vital to my growth as a digital marketer. Yes I consumed a great deal of information about mobile and digital marketing, but my superiors gave me no opportunities and responsibilities provided ZERO measurable successes in digital marketing practices.

In September my internship was completed and they let me go to get a new intern who could work for free. I now realize this company is not interested in helping individuals to grow, nor do the managers have any aptitude for mentorship and career development. 

But none the less, after 6 months of job hunting I find I can no longer even get an interview for an internship. I feel it is as if "" Oh he already had an internship and didn't get hired there, why?"".

I send out 6-13 applications a week, each with a customized resume and cover letter. My network says my resume is right, with the correct language and with the skill sets appropriate for the positions I am applying. Yet I get nothing. I feel doomed and that there will always be 200 better applicants than me. Someone with a university degree or mba, so why hire a college grad right?

Ugh.

Any words to keep me motivated? Any advice on how to reframe my application process?

Most importantly,

can you digital/creative/SEO marketers provide some appropriate skills I should be honing in on and developing?"

You lost sleep over your friend and I had to stop you from thinking she got in a car accident while doing cocaine, when in reality she was talking on the phone and didn't want her mother to hear.

I'm worried about you, I can't tell you anything in the worry that you might get anxious. I feel like my opinions or worries don't matter, or you turn all the outcomes to the dark side, stop me from talking, and make me feel as if my voice is a waste of space. 

I'm just as stressed as you, maybe a little more. I'm up all night working on portfolios for internships, major projects for class, weekly essays, making my mother happy, applying for jobs left and right with no responses, feeling as if my voice doesn't matter at all, AND listening to you and making sure you're okay. You have no idea how many times I've cried in the empty computer lab, just because it was safe to cry there.

I'm worried about you. I'm sick of this dark cloud that overhangs over your head constantly. I'm worried that you might have an anxiety disorder, and I don't want you to get run over by snowball effect that looms over your head. Quite frankly, if I say anything positive, the negitive snowball just engulfs it.

I'm sick of the negitivity, and I know this is something that can't be changed overnight. But please, please, I'm sick of every conversation turning into a depressing nightmare. I know that life if not all sunshine and rainbows, BUT PLEASE, if I listen to you 24/7 then you have to give me a chance and listen to me for once."

190w1e,12,2013-02-22,Constant daydreaming and imagining,[deleted],Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/190w1e/constant_daydreaming_and_imagining/,"I've been like this for as long as I can remember and its frustrating. As a kid I would spend hours daydreaming and even though I don't do it to the same degree it is still a problem.

I can't focus or feel the moment at all. I totally withdraw from reality. It seems I'm always daydreaming or imagining. Because of this I don't feel in touch with the real world. I feel better when I'm daydreaming. I can conjure up worlds where I'm confident and happy. I feel like I'm missing out on life. I feel I can't function because all I do is daydream.

I'm at University and I find myself leaving lectures having learnt next to nothing because I get distracted by my own thoughts. Its the same in social situations, I miss out on conversations because I'm in my own little world. It seems no matter how hard I try to focus it doesn't make a difference. I could be sat down in a lecture hall and I will tell myself ""FOCUS, FOCUS!"", but thirty seconds later I will find myself thinking about something totally irrelevant and being totally immersed in these thoughts or daydreams. Sometimes I'm trying to focus so hard that I'll get onto a train of thoughts about the actual concept of focusing. Its like I'll have one thought which will lead onto something else and something else etc, as if I'm travelling through a chain of thought.

It just seems uncontrollable. I do find myself worrying quite a lot, although I've recently been trying to rationalise my worries by writing them down and it is helpful. But when I daydream its not always negative; it can be about anything. I'll notice something or someone will say something and it will set my brain off and before I know I'm daydreaming. Sometimes I go over things that have happened in the past, or I imagine things that could happen or conversations people could be having. For some reason I even imagine past conversations or situations and imagine what if I had done something different (often negative or embarrassing alternatives).

I realise its probably a form of escapism/avoidance. I feel comfortable in my own thoughts but often very uncomfortable and anxious in the real world. But even in non-stressful situations I just daydream. I really just want to be able to focus because I feel I may have derealization. I don't really think I feel much emotion and I don't feel connected to other people. I kind of feel like an island. But I want to do things in my life. I'm at University and I want to get good grades. I've also got a possible internship in Germany. I want to do these things but I'm just scared if I don't get my daydreaming and thoughts under control then I won't be able to get anywhere or do anything.

Mainly this is just to get it off my chest but any help would be really appreciated. And sorry in advance if I've waffled or come across as unhelpful. 

EDIT: I forgot to mention something I think I probably should.

I often imagine myself being famous or popular or successful or whatever. Like if I'm listening to music I imagine I'm a famous musician and sometimes I imagine I'm a famous writer and things that happen in my day or I think about are all going in a book. I know its sounds pathetic. I know its stupid and I shouldn't wish for silly things like that and how improbable it is. I should be focusing on the things that matter in life like getting a job and meeting someone and all that, but for some reason I'm so fixated on being a successful famous person. I think maybe its because I crave the confidence, power and stability and most of all happiness I believe I'd have if I was like that. I spend so much time dreaming I'm like that, and then I feel shitty when I'm not daydreaming. I think need to realise what matters in life and that by desiring something like that I'm missing out on everything I do have. "

(x-post from /r/UCDavis) ,ucdavisthrowaway,Veterinary,https://www.reddit.com/r/Veterinary/comments/190npm/does_anybody_here_attend_uc_davis_i_could_use/,"Hi, I'm Dave and I'm currently a 3rd year NPB student at UC Davis.
Edit* NPB stands for Neurobiology, Physiology, and Behavior. It is considered the general ""pre-med"" major for undergrads at UCD.

I originally chose this major because I was planning on going into the medical field, but after partaking in the volunteer program at Davis Medical Center as well as after going to a number of animal science interest programs as well as enrolling in classes, I find myself fairly committed to a career in the veterinary field.

If it's at all possible, I would love to be able to attend the vet school here at Davis, and I would like to know what undergrad courses and experiences I am expected to take/have while studying here. This is the resource that I am primarily using as of now:
http://www.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/students/dvm_program/admissions/required_prevet_courses.cfm

Quick summary of courses on that page:
CHE 2ABC, 8AB

PHY 1AB

BIS 2ABC, 101

ABI 102

NPB 101

STA 13 or 100

as well as 12 units each of English and Humanities

So I guess I have a few (maybe more than a few) questions:

Am I not expected to take the CHE118 series, and can just take the 8 series instead? This surprised me because I had often heard that the required courses for vet school were similar to as of those for med school, and apparently the 118 series is required for UCD Med?

Are the requirements for UCD Vet fairly similar to those of other vet schools? For example, I don't want to take the CHE 8 series instead of the 118 and find myself being rejected from other schools because they had expected me to take the 118.

Are there any courses that are not required but are highly recommended/expected for me to take?

Are there any particular internships or volunteer services that I should be applying for or be keeping an eye on?

Is my NPB major okay for my future plans or should I change it? There are a few reasons why I felt that I was okay keeping it:

I've already started taking upper div NPB courses (such as NPB 101L) and I feel that it would be wasteful to not put them towards a degree, as well as the fact that I would have to take additional courses for other majors.

The subject matter of the major seems relevant enough to the veterinary sciences to continue studying it.

From what I hear, animal science majors are required to submit a thesis/undergrad project at the end of their 3rd yr. It seems that because of this it is too late now for me to switch to an animal science major, as well as the additional courses that I would have to take.

Not a question, but any general opinions about the veterinary field as well as information such as job outlook, personal experiences, and job satisfaction would be greatly appreciated. One of the reasons I was dissuaded from medicine was because of a trusted mentor of mine (a general surgeon) telling me frankly that he feels the medical field as it is now is not worth it, and although he does not regret working to get where he is, if he had to do it again there is no way that he would. Honest opinions such as these are extremely welcome.

Thank you SO SO much for taking the time to read through this and help me. I know that I really should talk to a counselor about this manner, but I'm working two jobs to pay for school and I really just have not been able to schedule a time that works for them (within regular day hours). Also, if there are any volunteer programs or internships that are incredibly worth it, I would not mind quitting a job and taking out more private loans to be able to work towards my goal, as I'm passionate about working with animals and getting some more hands-on experience.

I hope this was comprehensible. I apologize for any unclear statements as well as any errors in grammar or format, as I'm not the best at submitting posts and it's kind of late.

Thank you!

Go Aggies!

Ask me Anything!",LucoBuck,IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/190j4z/iama_dutch_pharmacy_student_currently_doing_his/,"So, I'll preface this by saying It's an awefully slow day at my current internship. So, I've got time to kill, go for it!

I'll explain the Dutch Pharmacy programme first. Basically it's a 6 year programme:

* Year 1: Could be seen as an extra year of High School. You get a lot of cellular biology, chemistry and statistics. I would say I spent about 30% of this year in the lab doing practicums.
* Year 2: In this year we go even deeper into cellular processes, physiology and pharmacology and analytical lab methods. Also, we get our first courses actually aimed at medicine (Cardiovascular, respiratory) and courses on the theory behind compounding. 60% is practicum
* Year 3: More courses on the actual medicines (Neurology [pain], Digestive system, hormonal), together with even more labs on analysis. We get to finish 3rd year with a relatively small research project (10 weeks). After finishing this year we get a **Bachelors degree (BSc)**

* Year 4: So this is the year we actually get involved with the pharmacy. We have our first internship (5 weeks, 3 days a week) combined with courses on communication and ethics. We also have compounding (10 weeks), Big scale production (Lab, 8 weeks) and Farmacotherapy (in which we have to learn basically almost everything a GP would ever prescribe, together with the basics from the hospital in about 8 weeks). Farmacotherapy is tested with an oral exam in which a pharmacist will give you a prescription, with an overview of the patients current medication and ask you to tell him everything you notice on it. Indications, interactions, contra-indications etc.
* Year 5: This is called our Research year. We get the choice of doing either 30 or 45 ECTS (20 or 30 weeks of 1FTE) of research at a research lab. The remainder of ECTS is to be filled with elective courses. This is basically the only opportunity to study abroad, so I decided to see where I could go to. I managed to go to the University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia to do my research project over there.
* Year 6: This is basically **the** internship year. We get 6 weeks in a public pharmacy, 8 weeks in a hospital, 8 weeks  in either a public of hospital pharmacy where we are expected to perform a project. The remainder of weeks is filled up with courses on ethics, communication, the current market and if you want another 10 week project at an industry based setting.
* Graduation: No big exams or anything, Pass year 6, go for a small talk about your portfolio and get your **Master degree (MSc)**

That is basically the drill. I'm in my 6th year right now and plan on graduating in November. Ask me anything!

190irc,1,2013-02-22,What does it take to get hired?,Jamoker,IndustrialDesign,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndustrialDesign/comments/190irc/what_does_it_take_to_get_hired/,"Hello everyone, I've been checking out this subreddit and finding it to be full of very helpful and informed people.

The question I have is on some advice on how to get hired by an industrial design firm as an engineer. I am a mechanical engineer in the process of applying for my first real job. While I am applying for the standard jobs mechanical engineers apply to, I am also looking at working as an engineer for a design company. I have always had a passion for design and creating things that people would be in constant interaction with, but I know that I am neither the most creative nor artistically gifted person, so I chose engineering as a ""safe"" major during school, but never really enjoyed it. I guess currently I am stuck with seeing that I might do something I don't care that much about for the rest of my life, so I am seeing if I can get into something I care about much more. 

A kind of job I would be really interested in is something like: http://www.coroflot.com/jobs/45203/Junior-Mechanical-Engineer

Some things going for me would be that I took all the CAD courses that were available to me, so I consider myself fairly competent at using the software that was used at school (SolidWorks). I also have a minor in Architecture, which I chose after taking some courses for a communication design minor. The school I went to had a much more stronger Architecture program which is why I switched, and also the courses seemed to deal much more with the interaction between the resultant product and the user, instead of focusing purely on aesthetics. Therefore I can say that I know a bit about the interaction process between designers when working on something together and have somewhat of a design education background. I had to learn quick as I was taking classes with senior/grad level students and had to discuss with the professor and students about my opinions on the finer details of architecture. I also have some experience from my engineering design courses and my Formula SAE team with designing something in CAD and handling the challenges of fabricating those designs into a physical model for use.

In a position where I would be working together with designers consulting and working on CAD models, I think I would do very well. I am a bit lost on how to show it however. I do not have experience with a company in terms of internships that would demonstrate my ability to do so. I do not consider myself having the strongest portfolio, as I just have my engineering CAD projects to show. However, I do think that if asked to work on or create something, I would not have difficulty making anything.

What do you guys think I can do to increase my chances of getting noticed and possibly hired?

Thank you very much."

* Analytical Problem Solving, Creative Problem Solving

* Work you can take pride in

* Importance on Design Process, QFD, Creative Solutions

* Decent level of social interaction

* Decent level of non-office work, variety

Some History

* Already have BS in Civil, will have BS in Mechanical by the end of summer

* Worked professionally in sustainable buildings for a few years - Worked in Mechanical &amp; Civil engineering, Architecture, Interior Design, &amp; Construction Management



* Did a fair bit in Automotive Engineering, within the scope of Formula SAE for a pretty good US team - My design work was mainly in structural packaging/FEA and powertrain, but I’ve been around it long enough to have a solid grasp of suspension too. I’ve volunteered for the FSAE US comps for a couple years. Right now, working on a joint Industrial design &amp; engineering school project for one of the “Big Three”

* Had a bunch of part time jobs, summer jobs and internships - Manufacturing process engineering, DOT construction inspection, Ag &amp; Construction equipment operator, Laborer, Pipefitter, Oil field roughneck, Welder, Concrete research assistant, and Formula Atlantic Racecar mechanic

* Ran my own lawn care business during high school and into college, Led to a lot of other contract work, Ag, Construction &amp; Rando

* Grew up on a farm and naturally developed into a very mechanically inclined and hands-on person with an affinity for working outdoors. Did what most of what you might imagine, drove equipment, broke equipment, fixed equipment, built equipment from scratch, threw hay, and kept livestock. Learned some conservation and Ag management practices. Tons of redneck projects – trucks, jeeps, lawnmowers etc

Some possibilities I’ve been thinking of.

* Return to Building engineering with a focus on energy &amp; commissioning

* Manufacturing engineering, I do feel like this is a more limited long term career option.

* Forensic Engineering, maybe automotive emphasis

* Automotive Design/Engineering outright

* Anything I could eventually turn into my own business, not sure what that is yet.

Here are some job qualities or attributes that I think fit well with me. Pick and choose. Job idea that fits the most wins!!



•	Analytical Problem Solving, Creative Problem Solving

•	Work you can take pride in

•	Importance on Design Process, QFD, Creative Solutions

•	Decent level of social interaction

•	Decent level of non-office work, variety

•	Bonus for Entrepreneurial, or at least some feeling of it

•	Bonus for spending some time outside

•	Bonus for a hands-on aspect



Some History



•	Already have BS in Civil, will have BS in Mechanical by the end of summer

•	Worked professionally in sustainable buildings for a few years

o      Worked in Mechanical &amp; Civil engineering, Architecture, Interior Design, &amp; Construction Management

o	Positives – Generally interesting projects with decent variety and the industry as a whole is more social than other engineering fields

o	Negatives – There are so many companies in the industry that nothing is standardized (Processes, Software, Communication) and is highly inefficient and redundant



•	Did a fair bit in Automotive Engineering, within the scope of Formula SAE for a pretty good US team

o	My design work was mainly in structural packaging/FEA and powertrain, but I’ve been around it long enough to have a solid grasp of suspension too

o	I’ve volunteered for the FSAE US comps for a couple years

o	Right now, working on a joint Industrial design &amp; engineering school project for one of the “Big Three”




•	Had a bunch of part time jobs, summer jobs and internships

o	Manufacturing process engineering, DOT construction inspection, Ag &amp; Construction equipment operator, Laborer, Pipefitter, Oil field roughneck, Welder, Concrete research assistant, and Formula Atlantic Racecar  mechanic



•	Ran my own lawn care business during high school and into college

o	Led to a lot of other contract work, Ag, Construction &amp; Rando 



•	Grew up on a farm and naturally developed into a very mechanically inclined and hands-on person with an affinity for working outdoors

o	Did what most of what you might imagine, drove equipment, broke equipment, fixed equipment, built equipment from scratch, threw hay, and kept livestock

o	Learned some conservation and Ag management practices

o	Tons of redneck projects – trucks, jeeps, lawnmowers etc



Some possibilities I’ve been thinking of.



•	Return to Building engineering with a focus on energy &amp; commissioning 

•	Manufacturing engineering, I do feel like this is a more limited long term career option.

•	Forensic Engineering, maybe automotive emphasis

•	Automotive Design/Engineering outright

•	Anything I could eventually turn into my own business, not sure what that is yet.

190bmo,5,2013-02-22,"Graduating in May, feeling way under-qualified, terrified just thinking about looking for entry-level software jobs",wackyratt,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/190bmo/graduating_in_may_feeling_way_underqualified/,"I need some advice or a kick in the pants, Redditors. I'm your standard scared, naive college senior who loves coding and wants to do it as a career, but can't imagine getting from point A to point B. Some things that concern me are:

-1) **I am not a CS major; I'm an astronomy major/CS minor.** I discovered my deep love for CS in my 2nd semester sophomore year, but decided to finish my astronomy major even though I didn't like it any more, because switching majors didn't seem feasible at the time. I regret it now, because advanced physics courses made me miserable and CS makes me happy.

-2) **I have never done any internships**, or even research. The only ""experience"" I have is my CS courses and being an intro CS/data structures T.A.

-3) **The only language I know is Java** (and to a lesser extent ActionScript). I know Java pretty well, have implemented data structures and lots of simple applications in Java, but haven't used all the features--never done anything with databases, for example. I can do the same things in ActionScript that I can do with Java, but again, haven't used all of the features.

-4) **The projects I have done have all been for school**, and they're not impressive. I am working my butt off to complete my weekly CS coursework and extracurricular obligations as well as work on my job search--I don't feel I have time to start up a personal project and learn some new technologies which would look more attractive to employers.

-5) **I am emotionally fragile** at this time in my life. I suffered a pretty bad bout of depression my sophomore year (which is part of why I never had an internship) and had a really hard time coping last semester (long story about trying &amp; failing to do an independent project for astrophysics that I hated). I also know that I suffer from big-time Impostor Syndrome, but I don't really believe it... ~~What I really believe is that I am a stupid, lousy, awkward, worthless poseur who could never hope to work in the field I want.~~ Sorry, that just slipped out.

-6) I've collected a lot of information about entry-level software jobs that use Java and don't expect me to know a lot of languages/tools I have no experience with... but **the thought of writing even one application is making me panicky.**

I think that summarizes my not-so-woeful tale of woe. Now this is what I have going for me:

+1) **I have a 3.9 GPA** and my school is a good one, but not super-prestigious. In computer science I have a 4.0 GPA (we'll see how well I do in Intro to Computing Systems this semester, though--I'm expecting a B+). I am a very good student, but I feel like school is all I've ever done and all I can do.

+2) **My CS coursework is relevant, though I haven't had a chance to take everything.** I studied abroad last year and took a software engineering methodology course, learning about stuff like version control systems, test-driven development, design patterns, agile/Scrum development, etc. I'm currently taking a 300-level web programming course where I'm working on a team of 4 to build a web app in JavaScript using node.js and Express. Once we finish it, it'll look nice on my resume and I'll have a bit of experience with stuff I've never done before--MySQL, jQuery, etc., plus I'll have *used* git instead of just *learning about* version control systems. Unfortunately I can't put this on my resume for another 3 months.

+2.5) **I do have one non-school project** I'm proud of, probably unjustifiably: a game I developed in ActionScript in 24 hours for [Global GameJam](http://globalgamejam.org/) this year. It's a pretty crappy game, but hey, I worked on a great team with 2 other people, I learned how to use an ActionScript physics engine, and we finished a prototype in 24 hours. Gotta count for something.

+3) **I think I would make a good software developer eventually.** I write good code, I'm a fast learner, and I'm excited about problem solving and learning new stuff about CS. I'm passionate about all aspects of programming, and even love documentation and unit testing. I love working on a team or with a partner while programming, and can contribute intelligently to solving problems (though whenever I imagine myself doing this in a workplace and not in school, I become paralyzed with fear). I could probably do okay in an interview that asks about data structures and implementing/fixing basic algorithms, and could answer questions about how Java works (if I don't crap my pants). I've learned a lot of stuff, I just feel like it's not enough practical knowledge yet.

+4) I am from Silicon Valley (but go to school at a small liberal arts college in Massachusetts). If I can't find a job before graduation and just move back home, at least I'll be living in a place with lots and lots of tech companies.

What do you think? Am I unemployable in the software development field right now? Should I be trying to get an internship after I graduate to try to ease into the field, or keep looking for full-time entry level positions? Who would possibly want someone with my qualifications, or lack thereof? Should I not even bother applying anywhere until after I graduate, when I'll have a nice finished project to put on my resume and the time to work on more projects?


**TL;DR** Scared college senior, love coding but feel like I have few applicable skills for a software job after graduation, seeking advice on whether I'm barking up the wrong tree (i.e. do I need to learn more CS/do more outside projects/do an internship before even thinking about looking for a full-time software development job after graduation), or whether I just haven't found the jobs I'm qualified for yet (but they're out there). Any input is appreciated."
1909d1,2,2013-02-22,Mphil or Msc in Physics for an econ undergrad?,harry921103,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/1909d1/mphil_or_msc_in_physics_for_an_econ_undergrad/,"Hey everyone.

So here is who I am to begin with.

School: McGill University
Major: Economics with Minor in Mathematics
GPA: Really low right now think 2.5 ish but if I pull myself together, should grad with 3.1~ ish
GRE: 660/800 
Experiences: RA at McGill, Accenture Internship, PwC Internship, A Conglomerate Internship.



Story.
I've always wanted to study physics. Honors physics back in high school was my favorite class by far and I would stay up all night reading Emilio Segre's books. Now, I am supposed to take over my dad's company later in life and thought economics should be a decent subject area for that but well I really want to study physics.

I have considered a minor in physics or a 2nd bachelor's or even a transfer bu well given my gpa in economics, i really don't think that's possible.


If I graduate with 3.0~3.1 ish and I already have a pretty decent GRE score, what graduate schools can I look at with masters in physics and is there anything I can do to maximize my chances?



I do realize that I don't have any university level physics education other than AP physics courses couple of years back. Would I have to take some physics courses at my university? (I have about 6 credits of electives left until graduation)


Hep is much appreciated!

I'm a sophomore student interested in consulting. I picked my comparative advantage of social impact business (from years of running a non-profit, advocating social capital, and running another socially-focused organization where we provide student-powered consulting to social enterprises).

I'm charting a career, and I'd love to get into consulting through this route (moreso because I'm interested in the fascinating challenges.) 

Do you:

a) Have any experience in this;

b) Have any advice about this, specifically about working through internships in this field, or building the right experience to move into this field;

c) Know of any consulting groups that would afford me the chance to work on problems in this sector (something like McKinsey's social sector practice)?

Much appreciated! This is one of my favourite subreddits to read, because it's a peek into an industry that is usually very inaccessible to undergrads.


Edit: Not very interested in non-profit/charity-specific consulting, more interested in problems involving business models generating a social impact."

My parents cannot afford to support me for much longer and my loan repayments are going to start pretty soon.

I've applied to retail jobs but even then I won't be hired due to lack of experience in a retail environment. I've applied to internships but my grades disqualify me. I've contacted temp agencies and even they are blunt enough to tell me that no one wants to hire a fresh graduate. Even restaurants won't take me. I feel like I'm stuck here, especially when I read about people with loads of experience being unemployed for 6+ months on this subreddit.

To top it all off, I don't even know what kind of work I am looking for. I've been applying to human resources, customer service, sales, administrative/exec assistant type positions and ignoring the more technical jobs.

(The following is my general cover letter)

I have an Associate of Arts degree from Kirkwood Community College, a Bachelor’s degree, and a certificate in Museum Studies, both from the University of Iowa. I will earn my Volunteer Management Certification in April 2013. I have over eight years working experience and three years working in varying aspects of the arts and academic museums. From 2010 through 2011 I worked in the UI School of Art. In 2011 I interned at the National Czech and Slovak Museum and Library in marketing where I collected, researched, and analyzed attendance data and presented it in both a quantified and qualitative presentation. From 2011 through 2012 I worked in education at the UI Museum of Natural History. In January of 2012 I interned at the UI Pentacrest Museums in Development, and within a month of starting the internship, I began another in marketing and media relations. In June I was promoted to development, marketing and media relations specialist of the University of Iowa Pentacrest Museums, comprised of the Old Capitol Museum and the Museum of Natural History. 

These museums serve approximately 30,000 visitors a year and work closely with University of Iowa department relations in the undergraduate department, museum studies program, VPR, and the dean of students. The museums provide general tours, student and special group tours, temporary and permanent exhibits, educational programming, special events, and rental facilities all of which I have had firsthand experience in working with and promoting the UI Pentacrest Museums. I authored the Pentacrest Museums’ first development plan and continue to work with the UI Foundation on donor relations. I recently executed a development campaign for an annual event and increased our gross sponsorship by 185% over last year’s numbers. 

As a student of the arts and museum studies, I have experience handling a variety of tasks. I have always worked while in college, and I learned early the value of focused creativity and aspirations. My experience at the museums has been challenging and rewarding. I have been given the chance to test my skills, and by moving up several times in the last year I have earned the abilities and success that I have today. Working in a fast-paced, detail oriented, and Big 10 university environment has primed me for a career in which I will be an amenable asset. "

She makes like $19 an hour at her internship (10-15 hours a week) and has a full scholarship, but she's on some really expensive meds her insurance doesn't cover. She can't afford food, rent, and her meds all together.

Which is mostly fine. I'm really well off, so I just stopped charging her rent and making her chip in for food and stuff like that.

The thing is though, I'm afraid she's going to grow dependent. I feel like I'm hurting her by not letting her support herself. But I'll feel bad if I stop.

How do I stop spoiling her?"

I was thinking of getting a degree in mass communication after this, seeing that I wouldn't want to work as a programmer (which my uni actively encourage fanatically) and would rather be a journalist or writer or something in that field. Hell, everyone says I'd be damn good at it, even my teachers and mentors tough so. But that thing is I'm already 23 and that's it's gonna be a waste of time and money when I could just get a job. (My internship ain't so bad, if repetitive work. Plus, the folks are footing the bill). That, and the folks says I should do a masters degree. I feel its a weird combo, and thought if any of you guys have weird combos and made it out alright.

I'm looking for the the following groups of recent graduates for a short 20 minute interview: Those who are unable to get a job in their field; those who have substantial debt; those who are taking unpaid internships full time while waiting tables at the side; and those who are forsaking their interests for a job that makes money.

This is about the death of the '90s dream and the lack of opportunity for the new generation. A degree has never been more expensive, but yet more common and worthless. The job-seeker-to-jobs ratio has never been higher. 

Those groups aren't set in stone; if you fit that bill in any other way at all, e.g. worked your ass off and got your present job after numerous rejections, forced to work in Nunavut because that was the only place hiring and etc., I would love to hear from you too.

You don't actually have to be born in the 1990s. As long as you are anything between 20 to 30, that's cool.

Please PM me if you're interested. I'll be swift and painless, I promise.

18zxd1,5,2013-02-21,"Story time, story time. Read about why my life sucks",canond08,stories,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/18zxd1/story_time_story_time_read_about_why_my_life_sucks/,"So I had an exam today. Nothing major, just Politics. I had stayed up pretty late cramming for it and seeing as I never, and I mean never ever, see the cute girl in one of my classes on Tues/Thurs, I just kinda fell out of bed and put on whatever doesn't smell of death and methane. Now, I live life with no regrets; my only regret thus far was not making a reaction video to 2 girls 1 cup, but this, this decision not to dress to impress beats even that out.

11:45 AM, 21-2-2013 I walk out of the building my class was in and see a booth for the Engineering Student Council. Crap. I know she is involved with them. I decide to walk the long way around to my friend's dorm since we usually eat lunch on these days, and going this longer way would help me to avoid the booth. I stare at the booth for a good 15 seconds scanning the faces before I conclude that this cute girl, let's call her A, isn't there. Good. I'm safe. I then hear a familiar voice getting closer. I turn and look up at another booth, this one is advertising an Energy Expo and as luck would have it, A is running the show and staring right at me. ""fuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuck"" I mutter as I change course to take yet another detour. I hope to myself that she doesn't see me, but I was right smack dab in the middle of the courtyard. Everyone can see me. I decide I'd rather lurk than go eat, so I find a comfy spot in a study lounge and hunker down. At least I don't have to endure that trauma for the rest of today.

12:05 PM, 21-2-2013 I get an invite on Facebook to the aforementioned Energy Expo. But the strange thing is, it's from A. Not directly, but through another organization she's an officer for. Using her moderator powers, she invites me through this account. I decide I'll decline. You know, always keep them wanting more, amiright? Upon further reading, I realize this is a field I am more than interested in, and a chance to meet potential employers so I take it under consideration. ""Spots are limited"", the page says. ""Deadline to RSVP is 2/24/2013."" I decide to make an executive decision by the end of the day to determine whether or not I attend. How will I decide?

1:15 PM, 21-2-2013 I feel the rumbles in my stomach, so I grab some food and move on to a new place with a power outlet. I then get an email from a professor asking me to meet him in his office later that day to discuss a group project. 

1:25 PM, 21-2-2013 I make plans to visit my professor in the Engineering building. I know of a lazy classmate who trawls the halls of the 2nd floor around this time so I come up with a plan to avoid him. Seeing as the 2nd floor is the easiest way into the building and my professor's office is on the 3rd floor, I decide to enter through the service tunnel which leads to the 1st floor entrance, and from there, take the elevator up to the 3rd floor, eliminating the 2nd floor from the equation altogether. It's risky business because the organization room where A spends a lot of free time is right across the hall from the elevators, but since I had seen her at the Energy Expo booth, I deduce that I'll be safe. What could go wrong?

1:45 PM, 21-2-2013 I successfully navigate my way through the service tunnels and arrive at the entrance to the EB. Before I go in, I take a quick glance to make sure there is no movement. Seeing no signs of life, I venture forward. This is the point of no return. I approach the elevator and hit the ""Up"" arrow. Both elevators are on the 3rd floor, and holding. As I'm waiting, I see something out of the corner of my eye. It's A and her red-headed friend, let's call her K, walking right towards me. I let out an audible ""fuck!"" followed by a facepalm. There's no way they couldn't see that. I still look like shit, I'm sweaty from the poor circulation in the service tunnel and I realize my shoe is untied as well. I do, however, have a couple things going for me. I'm a solid 8/10 and very quick on my feet when it comes to making conversation. But on this day, my greatest assets fail me. A whispers something to K upon turning the corner of the staircase, and K walks up to me and hands me a flyer for none other than the Energy Expo. I can feel A staring at us, K and I, and K is talking up the Expo, informing me of free lunch and internship opportunities. It all sounds so good, and then it gets even better/worse when K assures me both her and A will be going. I, still feeling A watching me, freeze up. The only thing that passes my lips is ""cool."" A and K return to the Org room. Had I arrived seconds earlier or seconds later, I could have avoided this embarrassment entirely. How could this possibly get any worse?

1:48 PM, 21-2-2013 I arrive at my professor's office only to find my group mates already in the room. They're complaining that I assign too much work to them and not enough to myself. I explain that I do a lot of the computations and that whenever they bring me anything, it's usually incorrect and I have to fix it or redo it entirely. My professor then yells at me and says I need to be more of a team player or let someone else lead the team. I leave in a state of disarray. I return home, a defeated man. No songs are sung."

Before I knew it it had been a month and I had retreated so far into myself it had become routine.

Fast forward three months and I still haven't been able to find a job. The constant rejection and weight of what I was doing left me numb and lethargic. I finally admitted what was going on to my boyfriend and now I think I've lost him forever. I can't bear the thought of not having him but at the same time I don't have any other means of making rent or paying my loans right now. The way he looked at me made me feel worse than I've ever felt in my life and I've felt sick to my stomach ever since. I know he'll never be able to look at me the same way again and I just don't know what to do. He said he needed time and I respect that but I'm scared that him living a half hour away means it will be easier for him to just say ""fuck it"" and move on. Regardless of whether he comes back or not, telling someone made the reality of the situation - the reality that I had been suppressing - all too apparent. It lit a fire under my ass to find a job - any job - so that I can get away. My boyfriend thinks that my boss, whom I had listed as a reference, was purposely giving me bad reviews in order to keep me dependent. I don't know if I buy it, but having had over 13 interviews and no offers maybe he's right. Regardless, I'm not going to list him anymore and we'll see what happens.  I guess I'm not really looking for advice or anything, I just needed to tell someone.




edit: I had my roommate call him and pretend she was from a temp agency. My boyfriend was right. Before she even asked him any questions he started to badmouth me (which was sort of good, since we didn't really know what to ask). ""She listed ME as a reference? I wasn't even aware. If she had asked me I would have told her I can't in **good conscience** give her a good review and she should find someone else. I guess there was no one else.""

Good conscience? 

*Good conscience?*

Motherfucker, do you even HAVE a conscience?


I want to confront him about this but at the same time I just want to curl up in a ball and die. "

I need some perspective, guys.",MKandtheforce,Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon/comments/18zrl6/discussion_youd_think_id_be_happy_right_now_but/,"Today, I was offered a job at the farm.

Anyone who's seen me around here knows that working on a farm is a dream for me. I dream of being able to wake up in the morning, take care of my livestock, and then spend the day working in the fields and growing food, and being able to not rely on anyone else to function. Seeing as I've had no experience farming before, I needed to ease myself in. That's why I decided to become an apprentice on a farm, work there for a season, and decide whether or not farming is truly what I want. So I went to a farm I was really interested in today. I helped out around the barn, took a tour, met the family, and I felt so strongly that *this was it*. I was offered a job and told to email her back with a sort of confirmation, saying that I understood the commitment and agreed to try it out for three months. She even told me that is was possible for me to ""have"" a cow after a month-- she could arrange it so that I could borrow one, which is the ideal situation for someone who's as eager as me to learn about dairy.

Anyway, I came home and told my parents that she'd like me to start on April 1st. Contrary to what I was hoping, neither one was happy for me. They told me I should just volunteer on a farm instead, even though I want experience as a day-to-day farmer instead of just a whenever-I-can sort of one. I tried that last year, and I worked on the farm a total of two times. I told Mom that I didn't want to just be a volunteer-- I need to *live* it. They especially weren't happy that I'd only earn $200 a month, even though it includes room, board, and food. I do have a lot of bills (car insurance, school, credit cards), but I see myself being able to use it. Sure, I won't be able to spend money on myself as much, but why would I need to? It's a different experience to be out in the boonies, farming hard every day instead of working in a place where all people do is shop. I wouldn't be tempted to buy sushi from the grocery store every day, and I wouldn't even be on the computer as much to buy things online. I plan only on using the internet for blogging purposes. They still don't think it's enough, though. They know I'm bad with money. I suggested the idea of sending them my whole paycheck and having them take care of expenses, and request money when I need it, but it didn't seem to make an impression on them.

It's so important for me to have their support in this. I've always been the type to *need* her mother's approval. It's even one of the major sources of depressive episodes when I suspect that I don't have or wouldn't have her approval. But I need to be able to farm. I do earn more as a cashier (about $200/week versus $50/week), but I wouldn't be spending frivolously on the farm, which is something I do now as a cashier. I'd be gaining experience I need, which will ultimately help me own a farm one day, since there's an FDA-sponsored loan that requires three years' experience and no necessary down payment. I'd finally figure out if full-time farming is right for me. My mom told me that the apprenticeship situation sounds like slave labor, since I get paid so little-- but isn't it the same sort of deal as an unpaid internship?! I see it as something beautiful, whereas my parents think it's a scam or something I shouldn't focus on.

A lot of times, I feel like she thinks I'm not even interested in farming, and that it's another manic pipedream. I've wanted this for well over a year. I don't think I can take another summer of not being able to live the simplistic, industrious life on a homestead. I don't want to sit at home, eating pasta while my family enjoys factory-farmed chicken, getting fat while watching HGTV, and wanting to cry every time someone yells at me at the checkout. I want to live life that's full and vibrant and colorful, not fake and empty like how I've been living for the past few years.

I don't know what to do, guys. If you were so kind as to read this whole thing, what should I do? If I plunge into this without my mom's blessing, I'm worried I'll lose my sanity. If I stay home, I can only see myself staying miserable for another year. I'm not ranting, nor am I just trying to blow off steam. I legitimately just want a new perspective on this. What do I do, guys?! D:"

I guess I'm a little behind because I do not have a resume yet, but I've always been daunted about what skills/experience I actually have to write on one. At this stage, I'd be writing one solely for internship applications. 

My academics are solid, I think (3.45 cum GPA, 3.7 CS GPA, 3.9 Business GPA, two semesters on Dean's List) and I have a solid understanding of Java, C, OOP, and am proficient at HTML/CSS (but I know that's not necessarily connected). Every sample resume on this subreddit seems to have a dozen different languages on it, do I really have enough for a skills section of a resume?

My other question is about the idea of ""projects"". I don't know what level of project/assignment really constitutes as resume worthy. In my classes I've done some basic GUI things and implemented (in c/java) (and understand) a decent number of data structures (linked-lists, heaps, stacks, queues, etc.). I'm currently doing some assembly language work in MIPS (obviously the language itself would not end up on a resume), and there have been assorted projects of roughly the difficulty of the above description throughout the last two years. In addition I have a few small personal projects, but nothing extensive or enough to write home about.

Sorry for the novel, but does it seem like I have anything worth putting on a resume for an internship application? what can I be doing to make more of an impression on hiring managers? I just really have no experience doing this so far. Thanks for the help!

When I first got my license, I took my savings and bought a [1999 Ford Taurus](http://i.imgur.com/NqJgu6w.jpg) for $1700 I think it was. this was back in 2010. I loved the car. It was quick and strong, not too many troubles. Bad alternator once and a few minor fixes here and there. not too bad. I wish I still had it now actually.


Then of course, [This](http://i.imgur.com/C6UNmcK.jpg) would happen to me. Some lady pulls out in front of me while i'm going 60mph. Worst thing to happen to me. I was devastated. Physically I was fine. but I lost my first car.
It held up like a champ though.
[album of the accident](http://imgur.com/a/jks9n)

So after the accident, in about 3-4 days I had purchased a new car for about $5,000 with all of the insurance money they gave me. which is what i am currently driving now. [2002 Mazda Millenia](http://imgur.com/a/Qa7sV), This car is alright. It's quick, looks beautiful whatever. It has an assload of problems though. The list goes on, I have spent almost $4,500 in repairs. It really is a junker and it needs to go soon.


So now you know my back story, here is what is happening currently.

The chance of me getting a good internship at **unspoken power plant** over the summer and following Fall semester is pretty good. So I will hopefully make bank. I am looking for a new car obviously. And this is where you will come in. I need help deciding what to get.

I am looking really new. I don't want anything older than 2010, and that's pushing it. I need something that will last me through college and until I have a really steady job and life. I think $20,000 is a spending cap, obviously the cheaper the better though. 

So what do you think?

I apologize if some of the language seems weird, I had it formatted differently and it looked terrible so I smashed a bunch of info together.

Here are some job qualities or attributes that I think fit well with me. Pick and choose. Job idea that fits the most wins!!

* Analytical Problem Solving, Creative Problem Solving

* Work you can take pride in

* Importance on Design Process, QFD, Creative Solutions

* Decent level of social interaction

* Decent level of non-office work, variety

* Bonus for Entrepreneurial, or at least some feeling of it

* Bonus for spending some time outside

* Bonus for a hands-on aspect

Some History

* Already have BS in Civil, will have BS in Mechanical by the end of summer

* Worked professionally in sustainable buildings for a few years - Worked in Mechanical &amp; Civil engineering, Architecture, Interior Design, &amp; Construction Management



* Did a fair bit in Automotive Engineering, within the scope of Formula SAE for a pretty good US team - My design work was mainly in structural packaging/FEA and powertrain, but I’ve been around it long enough to have a solid grasp of suspension too. I’ve volunteered for the FSAE US comps for a couple years. Right now, working on a joint Industrial design &amp; engineering school project for one of the “Big Three”

* Had a bunch of part time jobs, summer jobs and internships - Manufacturing process engineering, DOT construction inspection, Ag &amp; Construction equipment operator, Laborer, Pipefitter, Oil field roughneck, Welder, Concrete research assistant, and Formula Atlantic Racecar mechanic

* Ran my own lawn care business during high school and into college, Led to a lot of other contract work, Ag, Construction &amp; Rando

* Grew up on a farm and naturally developed into a very mechanically inclined and hands-on person with an affinity for working outdoors. Did what most of what you might imagine, drove equipment, broke equipment, fixed equipment, built equipment from scratch, threw hay, and kept livestock. Learned some conservation and Ag management practices. Tons of redneck projects – trucks, jeeps, lawnmowers etc

Some possibilities I’ve been thinking of.

* Return to Building engineering with a focus on energy &amp; commissioning

* Manufacturing engineering, I do feel like this is a more limited long term career option.

* Forensic Engineering, maybe automotive emphasis

* Automotive Design/Engineering outright

* Anything I could eventually turn into my own business, not sure what that is yet."

Every four to five months you get a final evaluation and you get placed to another class/school in order for students to become familiar with all ages and different kinds of schools/methods.
In the last and fourth year you have to choose a minor(half a year) and do a LIO-internship which is the other half of the year, where you get your ""own"" class(you are supervised, but minimally) and this is full-time.

Her #1 concern was the fact that I've got PTSD and memory loss from abuse from my two fathers + male classmates (mostly my fathers). Except her ""concern"" was that there was no way I could function in the world given my rampant hate of men. She felt like I ""shouldn't hate men based on what a few of them did to me"" (even though it was A LOT more than a few). She feels like I've only got emotional reasons to hate men and no rational ones. She completely disregarded me mentioning cultural misogyny with ""No no, that's only the douchebag ones"". She feels like I just so happen to spend time around douchebags (even though I basically never go outside and spend most of my time talking to friends on the internet because of transition related social anxiety) and if I would just open my life up to more welcoming mature males my life would be a ton better.

Later on in the conversation she admitted that she feels like I only want to transition because of my [100% male related] trauma and that if I just forgave them and got over that trauma I wouldn't want to transition. When she said this she completely ignored the fact that as of transition I'm not depressed / suicidal anymore, and focused completely on the fact that males in my personal space give me PTSD attacks (ex. hearing the voices of my suitemates, since my school isn't progressive enough to give me female suitemates).

I kept telling her that my life has nothing at all to do with males, and that this was the longest conversation I had about them in years. She countered with saying that she feels like my life does / will have everything to do with males, so I have to get over this before I can live a happy fulfilling life. 

Except I do have a happy fulfilling life: Hot lesbian girlfriend. STEM major. 3.2 GPA. Intern at NASA. Not depressed anymore. Some pretty great friends.

Sorry for the long lead up, but I wanted to post this here (ie. SRSWomen as opposed to AskTransgender) because while on the one hand my aunt is the person in my family who I've talked to the most in my life (moreso than my mother), I feel like her entire argument is filled with internalized misogyny and tainted with the patriarchy. Like, seriously. All of it. While I do feel like I need to work on toning down my PTSD reactions and be more comfortable with my gender, I feel like the way to do both those things has NOTHING AT ALL to do with men. Nothing. 0. I feel perfectly justified in my misandry.

Lets cut to the chase. Devry teaches you a lot of basics, but very rarely are you going to be in a class that teaches you current up-to-date real world methodologies. I recently completed a Java Class in which majority of the class was spent writing programs in the console. We didn't learn about web services or really any advanced topics.

I have a friend that is going for a similar degree at Baylor University and has spent time at a community college learning how to write Java. Although his degree was cheaper, we basically learned the same amount of information. The biggest difference was that in one of his classes he got to write a game which I thought was pretty fun, but it was console based and still basic.

The point I want to make is this: For anyone who has been sucked into Devry University and think because they graduated that you will never get a job in your career field, I want you to stop and realize it's not the degree that will get you the job, it's yourself. The most important thing you can do to grow as a developer is involving yourself on projects outside of school and reading books. Hell, grab an internship if you can! 

Yes, a degree can help you get in the door, but I have interviewed many people who have degrees from all over and if their skillset doesn't match the job they are expected to perform, their degree does not save them. I know there are many companies who throw degrees away from Devry, but a good company with decent recruiters know that for development it's not the degree, it's the portfolio. 

Oh and yes I work at a job where people look down at Devry. When I told them they are working wtih someone who graduated from Devry, they were quite shocked. The majority that can make it look bad, but trust me - individually you don't have to be a statistic :)"

The job is within commuting distance of the town were we both attend uni.

Anyway told my girlfriend about it yesterday and she was less than amused, she wants me to come and live with her at her parents place again (she lives an 18 hour trainride away) I've already been there two summers in a row now, doing a job I hate. Her family is ok, but I'm having a hard time coping with them over longer periods of time. Also I know no one but her family at her hometown which sucks. But I should mention that it would be similar where I'm right now since most my student friends go home over the summer.

Anyway, right now she's pressing me to apply for the same job she has already secured (driving a forklift in a paper mill), well-payed, but long and stupid hours and monotonous. She's doesn't love her job either, but as I said the money is good (~7500$ for one summer). But if we don't get placed on the same shift we'll never see each other either way. She (and her family) knows a bunch of people there so I have a good chance of getting this job as well.

Anyway she thinks I'm rather selfish, and that I should consider what's best for us and not just me. And I'm kind of at a loss and don't know what to do really, so any input on the matter would be really helpful. How would you approach the issue (from both perspectives)?

tl;dr. Gf wants me with her for summer doing a shitty (alas well-paid) job rather than do an internship."

I'm about to go to university in a few months and really interested in biology, mathematics and IT, also somewhat interested in chemistry. Thus it's no miracle that studying bioinformatics sounds tempting. Also, I'm currently doing an internship in a lab and find it really interesting.

I'm still not sure whether it's the right thing for me though. 

First of all, there's this fear that the whole bioinformatics thing is just going to be a huge bubble of false expectations of the scientific world. I don't want to study this a few years of my life just to be unemployed because nobody needs me anymore. This fear is especially fuelled by the infamous [""farewell to bioinformatics""](http://madhadron.com/a-farewell-to-bioinformatics) by Fred Ross. I've already talked to my boss at the lab about this, and he told me that he thinks it's going to play a very important role in the future, and that the criticism would be justified if we were talking about it's role a few years ago, but that things are changing quickly in favor of this field of science. But yeah.. what do you guys think about it?

To play the devils advocate, if bioinformatics should really be doomed one day, would I be able to switch into some other job, especially something IT related? Probably with some re-training, but would I have an advantage with my previously attained bioinformatics knowledge (as in not having to re-learn everything)?

Also, I have doubts about multitude of subjects you're supposed to familiarize yourself with. I would go for a B.Sc. in bioinformatics at a reputable university in my country. Do you think it's a good idea to dive into the different subjects required for bioinformatics simultaneously or should I first pursue a general CS B.Sc. and then specialize myself?

Also, how do I find out which universities are 'good' for this subject? Are there any (trustworthy!) rankings out there?

Gee, this is such a hard decision. I'd love to work in some bio-ish research with the help of computers, as I'm not really fond of the idea of working on some corporate project I have virtually no interest in. But my only alternatives are studying either biology, CS or mathematics, none of which sound quite as good as bioinformatics.

Please help me :C

The situation:

I have recently graduated as a Multimedia Design student, focused towards filmmaking. I've done some video work for a large corporation, some personal work but nothing really major yet. Before I'm going to look for a job here in The Netherlands, I want to do something useful abroad, preferably the US. This has been a goal of mine since a few years back, I have tried to form it into an internship but that did not work out well so I went for something in my home country.

Now, I feel like this is a chance I have to take. I don't ask for much: all I need is someone or an organization that needs video work done. From basic (web) shorts to something documentary oriented, just as an opportunity for me to learn and for them to receive something useful in return. I have my own video and editing equipment.

The perfect scenario from my point of view would be that I receive very basic housing, a small amount of money to spend while I'm there, and a challenging project.

I've looked online for possible projects, and there seems to be quite some work available for videographer-volunteers. I've learned over the past few years to never work for free, but the thing is: these organisations are usually financed by donations so I probably won't receive anything if I choose to go volunteering.

The questions:

* I'm motivated to deliver video work and I don't ask for much. Is this volunteering approach the right approach?
* Should I stay away from those that can't even afford to pay a basic payment for the work that I will deliver?
* Are there any other ways for me to do a small-scaled video project anywhere in the US, as a European on a 3 month holiday Visa?

Feel free to recommend other things that might be of value in this situation, it would be great if you could help me out.

192q4c,6,2013-02-23,My brother [17] has friends over often and the noise is driving my crazy because they are loud and right above my [f26] room (I'm living at home). Its driving me crazy,ShittyLifeThrowAway,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/192q4c/my_brother_17_has_friends_over_often_and_the/,"**TL;DR: is it appropriate for teenage brother and his friends to hang out often at home (xbox; right above my room) and be loud/obnoxious? or am I just crazy that it's driving me nuts? what should I do?** *extremely sorry for wall of text*

**Why my ass is at home:** I am in a tight financial situation where I had to take on an unpaid internship-like position, and I was invited by my very enthusiastic parents (and brother) to live with them while I finish this internship. Actually, I took the position *because* they said they'd let me live at home. Sometimes though, I feel like a burden and don't know when to say if something is bothering me and when to not. I also have some anger issues, so sometimes I question my annoyance and wonder if its reasonable. 

**For the sake of context,** because we're an Indian family, it is more of a norm that I'm living with my parents than it is in a western context and I don't think that my parents think of me as a burden. In fact, if I told my family how I feel they would most likely be offended. My mom always kept my room the way it was, even though they moved a couple of times (they would set up my room on their own); she refused to make it a guest room or something, even though I said that she could since I didn't live there any more (in the past). According to them it's their duty and pleasure to help me out, and despite the financial set back, I am on a good carrer path so it's not like I am a no-good loser with no prospect of ever moving out.

**The issue**: the problem is that I have a 17 yo brother with an xbox in a room directly above mine (minimal noise barrier) and he has just made a bunch of friends. They all have those annoying deep voices that you can't cancel out with ear plugs, and they all howl at the game or whatever it is they're doing up there like you can imagine any group of young men would do. Let's just say, they're not a quiet bunch - it is essentially a party when his buddies come over. *Context for brother:* we're not a normal sibling pair; I am almost a decade older than him and I almost co-raised him with my parents. So he looks up to me and we barely fight. If my parents need to have any talks with him, they usually try to do it through me, since he listens to me.

**I said no to everyday parties**: since his birthday sleep-over weekend (yes, it lasted the entire weekend) recently, it seemed like he brought home friends from school every day for another week or so before I got tired of it and told him that he can't have a party everyday - it is unreasonable. I told him it would be okay to do once a week or so, but that I can't tolerate the noise every day. I suggested that he and his friends can go to a mall, or to another friend's house or something as well, instead of always just coming home here and being incredibly loud right above my room.

**I mentioned it to my mom,** and she seemed a little uncomfortable about it. I asked her if I was being unreasonable and she gave me a not-very-convining response along the lines of ""don't worry about it, you are his big sister, you can tell him to stop making noise"". But it could be that she just didn't want to tell me off - my parents usually take my side as I am usually the more reasonable sibling, and also because I am the older one. Also, my parent's room is on the other side of the house, down on the main floor so I don't think she realizes just how much noise comes to my room. I think my dad would understand - he's the loner, loves his quiet, which is where I get it form, but he's not here for a month or so, so I don't really know who to turn to to in/validate my concenrs.

**What drove me crazy tonight:** It was okay for a while, but it has started happening again. Right now for instance: today, it's Friday night and at around 1:30AM there were at least 3 grown boys stomping around and being loud in the attic above me. This had been going on since after school, then they went to watch a movie so I had some peace for about 3 hours, and now they're back. While it really grated me, I put my ear plugs on and dealt with it during the day (for a full 3pm-9pm) - because it was Friday evening, and it was fair enough. But I just couldn't take it anymore. I almost wanted to cry and I could feel my anger rising with each noise. I just wanted it to stop, I also wanted to sleep soon and there are no signs of calming down from above. My brother's attitude was basically: *its Friday night, deal with it* (we had a slightly heated phone convo). And while he did quiet down out of respect (which I realize is a big deal) I could still hear them - it's impossible in the quiet night not to. So I just left the house - I am at my bf's house ATM (he's away but left me a key in case I ever wanted to come over).

**My question**: I keep thinking, I am living in their home for free. Do I have a right to say anything? But, they invited me to live there and promised me a place to stay, so shouldn't that also mean peace and quiet? Is it normal to have noisy teenagers spend hours and hours at someone's place; I mean, I don't think they even recognize the concept of inside voices. I am just confused because it is so incredibly annoying for me, but my brother doesn't seem to get it, and neither does my mom I don't think - which leads me to think maybe I'm just being unreasonable. Maybe I should get a personal loan and just move out. But then I'll just look like a drama queen: ""shut up or I'm leaving"". I can't decide how to deal with this problem. Halp."

Let me provide a little background about myself:

* Graduated in June of 2009 with a degree in Economics.

* Wanted to work in finance, but had horrible grades and zero internships coming out of college (I messed up horribly here, I know) so my opportunities were very low. 

* Didn't find work until mid-2010; it was temporary work, so I was out of work again in 4 months.

* It turned 2011 and I was struggling to find work again. So I decided to go back to school and learn something instead of just sitting around looking for jobs.

* Took an accounting course at a community college and really enjoyed it. Did some research and decided that this might be a field I would like to work in. 

* Continued to take accounting classes so that I can be eligible for the CPA Exam.

* While I am taking classes, I have also been looking for opportunities to work in accounting (i.e. A/P, A/R, Accounting Clerk, Accounting Assistant positions). I have attended several interviews, but nothing past the 2nd stage.

* Continued to send out resumes, but it was leading nowhere. I became really depressed at this point and just stopped. Before you say anything, I have been looking for accounting opportunities for close to a year and a half at this point. So I was out of work for close to 2 years. 

* Signed up with a couple of temp agencies, but they've just been bouncing me between their other branches for about 3 months now. I've passed all the tests they've given me with near 100%, but no assignments have been found for me yet. 

* I found out about a program called VITA (Volunteer Income Tax Assistance) last year and I have been volunteering there since the start of January 2013 with hopes that this can help make my resume stand out more.


I'm not sure what to do at this point. I feel like I went backwards with my life (4-year University back to Community College and unemployed). I know that I am capable of doing the work if given a chance, but it seems like that chance is becoming increasingly difficult to come by each passing day. I'm in the bay area of California so the opportunities are definitely there. I don't really care which area of accounting I get into - I just want to work in accounting; public for the potential exit opportunities and private for the work/life balance. I found several positions that I would like to apply to recently (Accounting Clerk/Assistant positions), and have updated my resume. It would be greatly appreciated if /r/Accounting could take a look and give it some critique before I send it out.

He offered me an ""internship"" as a software developer, but here is there deal:

1. He doesn't code. In fact, no one in the company does. I would not have any guidance for projects should I get stuck.

2. Unpaid. Would be developing for iOS and Android, and depending on success of a product, I would get reimbursed(probably like 25%)

3. No office. I would have to work from home on projects. Not sure if this would be a set back? I would hence not be working in a team environment.

The guy has awesome ideas for applications he wants to make, and I would actually have a choice for what I work on (and would probably be excited for it).  We discussed some projects and I feel like I wouldn't be taking on anything bigger than I could chew?  

Basically what I want to know is:

1. Does this sound legitimate to put on a resume? The most important thing is saying that I got experience and a possible recommendation from the business, right?

2. Is it a good/bad option for someone to intern at a start-up company that isn't a big name?

3. Is working at home a bad idea?

4. Is not having guidence a huge issue? I'm pretty good at programming and could always look up ways to do things (like integrate to facebook) online, right?"

Main example: I have a friend in the same major/department as me and she chose to recommend me for a summer internship opportunity that I definitely wouldn't get otherwise- my grades aren't good right now but I'm really turning things around this semester and getting my life on track. 

I never approached this friend about recommending me because I *know* I don't deserve it, but she offered to do so and obviously I wasn't going to say no. I told my advisor about it because I was so excited, and he went back to my friend and asked if I ""had been holding a gun to her head"" when she made the offer and asked her to recommend another student (of his choosing). I heard this secondhand from another student, but I have very good reason to believe it's true. I've also heard that I've been the subject of some discussions/joking (gossip) about my personal life with my advisor and other students. 

I'm mad, but mostly I'm just really really hurt. I personally think that's really immature and unprofessional behavior for someone in his position. Believe me, any criticism he could come up with I am well aware of and ten times harder on myself about. Prior to this, I *really* liked my advisor- he's been very easy to talk to and I've never had any reason not to trust him. The last year and a half has been rough school-wise- I can totally see where I wouldn't be his first choice recommendation. But it's really shitty that he'd discuss me/my faults with other students before coming to me about it.  


Even if it wasn't intended, I'm very hurt by those comments, especially when I'm trying to remove that kind of negativity in my life and move forward. I don't feel like I can trust him. I could change advisors pretty easily, but I feel like I would owe him some sort of explanation and I don't know how to confront a superior about this sort of issue. I don't want to be perceived as oversensitive, dramatic, or overreacting but I think he at least deserves a chance to defend himself if this is just a huge misunderstanding. Am I overreacting by wanting to change advisors? How the hell do I approach all of this? "

Sorry in advance - I'm halfway through writing this now and its already huge!

Some context - I'm 23, she will be 23 next month. I'm in the final year of a Masters degree, with good job prospects on graduation and she is already working in a good job. We began dating in December 2010. For the past 11 or so months, there have been about 200 miles between us (across water) so a plane journey apart (she had to move to get a job, but I always said I would follow her).

So we met online, everything was great - I totally fell for her from very early on, but she was my first REAL girlfriend that I had real feelings for, and it was (still is!) a learning process for me.
From fairly early on (I would guess from maybe 1 year in) she would fairly regularly try to bring up ""our future"" in the conversation - getting engaged and stuff. At the start, I told her right off the bat that I was pretty uncomfortable with it, and would rather she didn't, because I wasn't planning it any time soon (in my mind's eye - I could see myself getting engaged around 27, married a year or 2 after).

She reluctantly (disappointinly, not angrily) accepted that and wouldn't bring it up as much after that.

Last summer (2012) I got the opportunity to work abroad for the summer. It was still only 200 or so miles between us (but in the opposite direction) but I didn't think it would be any different than before, though I did know it would be great for my resume. So I went, and was staying with a very large (25+) group of other interns, because I was always either working or hanging out / partying with those guys, I really didn't have time to miss her so much, but I know she missed me like crazy. I was away for 3 months, and I guess after 2 months, I told her that I think we should take a break.

This was due to a number of things. Firstly, I just didn't feel the same about her after being away for so long and also that every time we went on a trip somewhere for a few days, we would always have a blazing row - and it was always over absolutely nothing, but no one would back down. I'm sure you guys have been there. We were usually as stubborn as each other, but to be fair I think I was worse. I also said to her (please don't hate me!) that she had put on a fair amount of weight since we started dating, which was true - and I have always kept myself in decent shape but it was having an impact on how I saw her so I told her.

Breaking up was incredibly hard for me, at the time, she was visiting me and we were in a museum. I had been thinking about this and I told myself I would tell her today, and I actually started crying in front of her in the museum thinking about it. I then totally cried my eyes out as we talked about it later on in my hotel room - as did she. She didn't want to do it, but I paid for an early ticket home for her and she left and I wouldn't let her change my mind despite the fact I was absolutely heartbroken myself and I did it!

So within a fortnight, we were talking again, and I was telling her not that I had made a mistake, but that I saw this as a chance for us BOTH to work on our flaws or things that caused friction in the relationship. She even went and joined a gym for me and took up some hobbies (because I said she relied on me too much to do stuff and she didn't really have any hobbies of her own which I feel was also true) like baking and some craft things. We talked every day and eventually agreed that when I returned home, we would go away together for a few days and try to fix us.

We went away and it was fantastic, we got on so well and it was like we were closer than ever at the end. That brings us up to around 5 months ago.

I'm back home again, she's still working away and I'm now started back at uni. I know she is still missing me but god damn even though I know she wants to talk, I just can't bring myself to talk to her on the phone - I really want to talk to her, but its like I can't be bothered if it isnt in person. It's so hard to explain, I didn't do it anywhere near as often as I should have, and I didn't put enough money aside to spend on visiting her.

This kept going on right through Christmas and up until last week. We hadn't talked in like 3 weeks because of another stupid argument where we wouldn't back down. Eventually she said she needed a break and couldn't do the long distance thing anymore. I asked her was there more to it than she was telling me (ie. had she met someone else who was making her feel like this) - she told me no, but that if someone (though she hadn't anyone in mind) asked her out on a date, she might say yes.

OK so you are up to date. I should add that since before Christmas, the way I have felt about her has changed. I don't know why, but I suddenly stopped being afraid of commitment to her, and I KNEW that I wanted to marry this girl.

It's so hard to understand why I can feel like this yet not take the time to Skype or call her or whatever, but honestly, I can't imagine my life without her now. She means everything to me and I go to bed every night thinking about her. I even told her this a while back - that I knew I used to not like talking about this stuff, but now I can, because I knew she was the one for me.

So yea, that's where we stand - we are currently broken up, but I want her to realise that I am completely committed to making things work with her, and that I love her more than anything. She is fairly adamant that I can't change her mind, but I'm hoping I can. Also worth noting is that since we went away after I came back from abroad, we only saw eachother less than 10 times, for no more than maybe 4 or 5 days at a time, usually less.

I wish I could have moved over to her sooner, but I had already committed to an extra year on my degree when she accepted (and I was completely behind her) her job across the water, because I was planning to go there with her after.

TL;DR

Was with my ex over 2 years, just over 1 year in we had to start long distance because of lack of work at home - only saw eachother every 4-6 weeks or less for a couple of days. Been like that ever since and I really didn't pull my weight during that time.

After a ""break"", we then spent some time away to try and ""rekindle"" our relationship and it was amazing. We became closer than ever until she had to leave again.

After that I went back to my old ways of not putting in the effort, but at the same time, I realised that this was the girl I wanted to spend my life with and I wanted to change.

I started trying to put more effort in, but it wasn't enough and eventually she told me that she couldn't do the long distance anymore because my lack of effort almost made it like she wasn't in a relationship anymore.
I had always been planning to move to her when I finish University in about 4 months time.

Please help me get her back!! :("

______________________________________________________________________________________

Do you ever lay awake in bed to just think about the past year? Think about all the shit that went down, all the embarrassing shit you've pulled and all the moments you wish would last a lifetime.


I don't. At least, not until two months ago. When all was fine and we were just a normal healthy family. 


Haide was my younger sister but for some reason I've always been the one to look up to *her*. In fact, I even beleve my mom and dad looked up to her. And I think that's because, in a way, she made us feel like we would do anything and be anything she needs. It's amazing, really. Without trying, she could make anyone like her. Although some people were weirdly jealous of her. But not in a way that they would make orrible comments about her or try to bully her at school. No, no. It's much.. worse than that. They would simply befriend her, try to make their way into her heart and then take away all things that make her happy.


Esther was her best friend, they could barely stay apart from each other for one day. Cute, right? Nuh-uh. I knew what she was doing. She would convince Haide to stop practicing ballet, because she didn't have the right figure. She would tell her that no, she shouldn't try to get into Harvard. Because really, you could only get into Harvard in you have a shitload of money. Maybe that's true, I don't know, but Esther did whatever she could to prevent Haide from even trying. To make a long story short, Haide started feeling worse and worse about herself. She indeed stopped practicing ballet and stopped looking at colleges to go to. My and my parents watched her slip away but we felt there was nothing we could do. She wouldn't listen to us when we suggested that maybe she should stop seeing Esther so much.


After a few weeks of watching Haide feel like crap, my mother decided to step in. ''Finally.'' I thought. ''Thank god, now she will get the help she needs.'' Ha, were we wrong.


Haide started seeing a therapist in the town nearest by. My father felt skeptical about this. ''All they're gonna do is shove antidepressants down her throat and convince her it will all be fine, that it's just her age. Please Ellen, stop this at once.'' But my mother refused and convinced my father that we should at least try. After her second appointment with the therapist Haide told me and my mother that Dr. Harman indeed suggested that she should take some very light antidepressants. Sertraline. I remember the name oh so damn well. I could see that this startled my mother, but she tried to maintain a pokerface. After talking about it with me and Haide, we all agreed that she should indeed take the antidepressants, but not tell our father. ''He will just freak out over nothing.'' My mom assured us. So yeah, that was the plan. The next day Haide went to the pharmacy to pick up the pills and for the following two weeks, everything went back to normal. That is until Haide started telling me about horrible side effects. She said that the worst was the feeling in her legs. She just couldn't keep them still. She would lie awake at night, every night, constantly kicking and moving her legs around, til the point where she would start to cry and eventually cry herself to sleep. I told her to call Dr. Harman about it, but apparently he was on his once-a-year vacation. After that I told her not to worry about it, that it just takes some time getting used to the pills. I could tell by her face that she felt horrible, and I offered her to sleep in my bed tonight, maybe it would help her sleep. She agreed.


That night after we got ready for bed she whispered at me: ''Marit, it's really bad.'' With her lips pressed together and her eyes watery, I could tell she was about to cry. I fucking hate myself for doing this.. I just gently slapped her back and told her not to make such a big deal out of it. I'm such an idiot. A few minutes later we crawled in my bed. I fell asleep almost instantly, feeling extremely tired from my internship. It was about 1:30 when I woke up to the soft crying next to me. I turned around and sighed, feeling irritated. ''It's really bad, Marit. It's really bad. Is there nothing we can do? It feels like my legs aren't even mine anymore, I can't control how they lay, everything about them feels wrong.'' She would whisper. ''It's okay, I'm here.'' I said, cuddling her. I could feel her legs kicking around and I could hear her grinding her teeth. I should've know, I should've fucking known. I could feel myself drifting away, back to the dream I came from. I'm a horrible sister.


I dont know how much later it was, but I suddenly woke up to the most terrifying screaming I have ever heard. I could feel my body get numb in cold swear and extreme fear. When I got to my senses I realised it was Haide, my dear sister, who was screaming as if she was slowly getting tortured. I jumped out of bed and switched my light on, revealing something I will never ever be able to unsee again. Everytime I close my eyes, it's not the inside of my eyelids I see, but it's my sister. Covered in deep red blood. She was still screaming at the top of my lungs and my father rushed in, pushing me aside. He jumped on my bed and yelled at her ''what did you do, Haide? Baby, what did you do?'' I just stood there, frozen in place. My mother called 911, but by the time they got there, she was gone. My sister, my only sister, a part of me, was gone. 


She had taken my snowglobe, the one my grandmother gave me when she came back from Paris. She smashed in onto the frame of my bed and started stabbing her legs with the broken glass. There was so much blood, so much blood. They counted a total of 41 stabbing wounds in her legs. We should've listened to her, made her quit those antidepressants when she told us about the side effects she was experiencing. 


A few days later my father would tell me that when he rushed into my room, jumped on the bed and held Haide, all she would whisper was ''they're not mine, they're not my legs, get them off. Get them off.''

Think twice before taking antidepressants called Sertraline."

Came to work at 9 am and check company mail and then do mind numbing money processing and record on excel. That was the job. Left at 3 pm and thats it. No reward, I felt like shit at the end of the day. 

I goto community College and My major is Business Admin, into my sophomore year. I got 2-3 semesters left and then associates. I am thinking of doing a 180° turn and start something I actually have interest in. Geology. 

I cant see myself be a business man and work a 9 to 5 job. Hell I even developed a full on gut from lack of exercise. I want to work out side. I wont mind if its 50% outside and other 50 inside. 

Heres my other problem. Its Almost March, too late to change my classes or my major this semester. I am currently applying to colleges in central America, currently in NJ. Should I just drop out this semester or keep going. My community college doesnt have a geology course so I'm lost on what to do. Also incase it helps my age is 20, birthday in november. Is it too late to make a change?

Any Help on what to do next would be amazing.

I've had an up and down couple few years.  I was doing really good about 12 months ago.  I had been working out and eating well.  Down to about 170 and building some solid muscle.  Got caught up with school, internships, and then I was unemployed for a while without access to a gym.  Then the stress of moving and starting a new job.  Anyway, I'm trying to get back on the right track.  

Plan is basically to count calories ~ 1800 a day during workout days, 1600 on off days.  I may do some keto, but probably not strictly since it's hard to plan ahead for work sometimes. Try to get to the small but decent gym and work 3 days a week and start riding my bike to commute when it gets warmer ~5 miles each way if I dont take the train part way.

Desired weight goal by May 19 is 180 lbs for about 2 lbs per week.  I have a halfway goal of 15 lbs lost by the end of March and an interim goal of looking sexy for my friends wedding in late April.  Long term goal is about 165-175 with additional muscle mass.

My main challenge is that I am not a morning person and have to leave the house by 7:15 to get to work on time.  I hate going to the gym when I'm tired, but I'm hoping springtime and eating better will help.  

My motivation is to look and feel healthier.  I'm not sure how stable my job situation is and I want to be able to put my best foot forward every day no matter what happens."

My original focus was on many of the EE countries. Ukrainian isn't too far away from Russia, Bulgarian, Belorussian, and I'd be able to pick up some words in other slavic languages. 

My problem is I can't find a job in any of these regions to save my life. I am still in college so I am mainly looking for internships but I don't see squat anywhere in EE.

I want to turn my attention to German, mainly because I have this odd infatuation with the country of Switzerland and Austria (Germany too to some extent). I like to think of Switzerland and Austria as two potential places to work and live in ( I am from U.S.).

I've heard there are great difficulties learning German, I am sure it cannot be worse than Ukrainian, however.

I know you get this question a lot. But where is the VERY FIRST place to go if you know zilch about German. I would be starting from scratch. 

Another reason why I want to make the switch is because of the accessibility to learning materials. There is rarely Ukrainian children's books or websites that cater to this language.

Lastly, I know it all depends on your learning speed, but how long would it be before I be at an intermediate level of German ONLY being self-taught?"

I have no web experience, and with all of the big employers in my area posting their listings for paid summer internships, it might be a little too late to teach myself coding and such to build a decent portfolio site.

I still plan on building my own site, but with working 40-ish (I'm a designer at a university-ran print and design shop) hours a week while finishing up my bachelors, time to work on my own projects is scarce.

I have a physical portfolio, but a lot of the internships I'm applying to are standardized for non-creative positions at the company and have no features for uploading examples of work.

Now in one week she'll fly to Ecuador for six months for an internship with the [UN Refugee Agency](http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49e492b66.html) there. I'd like to visit her for the summer and do a vagabonding trip in South America for maybe two months or so before meeting her in Ecuador by the end of her internship (and then maybe travelling together for a few more weeks). My main concern is getting there though.

Flights seem to be over 1000€ one-way which is more than what I currently live on per month here in Berlin—so I was asking myself if there may be a cheaper way to get there. Maybe by ship somehow? Any ideas?"
194zhk,1,2013-02-24,Why is it so hard to do what is in your best interest?,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/194zhk/why_is_it_so_hard_to_do_what_is_in_your_best/,"So I (18 F) am seeing this guy (20) long distance for about 2 months now. We met at a party in December during winter break and were inseparable until he left to go back to college. For the first couple of weeks things were going ok (long distance isn't fun but it was bearable because we would Skype and talk regularly). 

But lately he's been so busy with his classes and his internship and just his life in general. It doesn't bother me that he's busy it bothers me that he will often forget to text me or when we agree to Skype he usually forgets and goes to bed. I figured I could put up with this because he promised he'd drive up to see me for a weekend but when he found out he had to go to an event for his job and couldn't come see me he didn't tell me, he waited for me to ask what was going on which I had a really big problem with because we agreed that communication was super important. I got over it until he did it again when I asked him when he'd be home for his spring break because we made plans for it but he told me ""his parents cancelled his flight"" (sounds really stupid to me). 

I feel like it's just disappointment after disappointment anymore. I definitely deserve someone who will be there for me and who will be honest with me and not always ignore me. I know, logically, that I can and should have a better relationship than this; that this is torture if it leads me to feeling like I have to be constantly smoking just to be able to deal with the stress. I don’t want to give him up but he’s hurting me a lot and the fucked up thing is I can see that so easily but I keep telling myself that it’s deeper, there’s more to this than what it seems. He tells me his feelings never changed, but how can I feel that if he never bothers to follow through on things he tells me? 

This is really hard. I'm trying to talk to him to see how we can deal with this problem but he never has any time I don't really know what to do, I don't want to just let this amazing person walk right out of my life but I'm beginning to feel like I have no choice. Any thoughts would be appreciated, thank you anyone who read this I'm sorry it's long!

I would like to know what is the process of looking for a civil engineering internship and what specifics that might entail. I have started to research internships, however, most requirements are for bachelors and above. Paid internships are non-essential for me since I would like to simply gain working exposure to my field of study.

After sending out CV's to numerous job boards, and asking friends for references, I was surprised to be offered an interview via a social networking service. I took up the invitation and appeared (well dressed) for an interview. The interview lasted only about 10 minutes. Even though I had had professional experience (at least 12 months in a graphic design role) I was offered an internship (that paid $158 per month!). Seeing no other options I decided to grab this ""opportunity"". I spent 3 months working my ass off creating flash animations, banners, and whatever other junk an ad campaign requires. Against all odds, I ended up being hired and given the tidy sum of $790 a month (for full-time work).I spent the next 6 months working at times intensivley at other times not at all do to a lack of work. On a Friday morning, my boss (just 6 years my senior) and head of the entire department) told me that he had to force my resignation. I was given a month to find a new job, and to make matters even better, he told me that my last 3 weeks would be off-site so that I'd be able to look for my next gig. So that was a few days ago, and now I'm sending out CV's contacting friends, and updating my Linkedin profile. The problem is I start worrying about how similar this feels to my initial job search which lasted from June 2009 until I found this job. I'm trying to stay positive, but I'm worried that with the current economic environment and my lack of a powerful portfolio I'm just going to end up going back to some day-to-day job to make ends meet. 

What should I do?

TLDR; Finished an expensive college of design, moved to a foreign country, taught English for 3 years while looking for work, finally found a job in my field, got forced to resign after working just 9 months.

Fun fact:
I was forced to resign mostly because I had not worked for a major ad agency, nor done much of anything using design software since college. I had been hired as an intern in order to learn something, and instead was simply fed projects like every other ""well-paid"" employee.

194o34,109,2013-02-24,My company and every venture I've done has failed and I'm feeling hopeless and lost. I'm begging for help.,Daretochange,web_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/194o34/my_company_and_every_venture_ive_done_has_failed/,"Here's my story, hopefully I can get a little help or a snippet of advice.

I didn't know what to do with my life, was out of high school for a few years bouncing around jobs. I got the idea of going into a consoler at my local college. After asking a few questions (like 3 minutes) he tossed me into an all purpose new media design course. I was excited. I liked designing things and have always excelled in design and computer classes in school.

Problem was, the class was full, but he told me I could take half the course online, and do the other half when it opened up. So that's what I did. The online courses had the basics of HTML (pre 5) and CSS, but the instructors didn't explain or teach very well. The resources were limited and I found myself just learning from youtube videos. First problem with this is my coding is incomplete and broken. I only learned how to structure websites in tables and Tetrising the whole thing together in precisely measured blocks, that much I taught myself. My code looks neat and tidy, but it's fundamentally flawed and disjointed, it doesn't scale correctly even if I try.

Fast Forward, I get the little piece of paper that says I got a pat on the head, then I get accepted right into the in class courses. I get no information on what exactly is to happen in these courses. I got a course list, a 9-3 class I was to attend everyday, but there were month long sessions of classes that I'd already completed. I go in to talk to the instructors and they want me to stay in the class while everyone else does the work I've already done. ""Everyone would be upset and wondering why you get to go home early."" It was a farce, there wasn't much extra to learn anyway, just a few course they were phasing out to replace with more up to date classes. Advanced Flash and advanced HTML (pre 5) stuff.

So BAM. I'm abruptly out in the world and I have this piece of paper. I want to find an internship or entry level position so I might be able to learn something. Put together a rough porfolio of the crap I learned in school and apply to every web design firm in town.

They all ask the same thing. They want relevant experience and previous work. My portfolio isn't good enough. Most said they don't even hire interns and if they do it's from out of province.

I should probably state here that I live in a prairie province in Canada, the equivalent of a flyover state in the US. Middle of nowhere province with little to no tech or design business. All agriculture and mineral industries.

After months of not finding anything in the bounty of jobs that the school promised would be available, I began asking everyone I knew how I could better myself so I might be able to find a job. All the advice was disjointed, however; Learn PHP. Don't learn PHP it's crap, focus on Javascript that's the future. No way go find a way into app development, no one's hiring web designers. Web apps are the way to go, etc etc... So I looked into those. I have an eye for code and I think in logical terms. I enjoy coding! I began looking into all sorts of languages and got the fundamentals of each down, but I was too afraid to dive into any specific one. If a job popped up with a relevant language requirement, it was far out of my reach. I needed 5+ years of experience to even think about handing them my scruffy resume.

I had a mentor who was meant to give me some work and guide me along. Really easy going guy who seemed super excited to see me do well. But because of the backwater cellphone towers we had at the time, my phone service kept cutting in and out and a text message wasn't recieved(single text just one) He irrationally flipped out on me. He said I disrespected him, I wasn't taking him seriously, I was unprofessional and severely disappointed him. I haven't talked to him since except for a letter of apology and inquest into why he reacted so poorly over a missed text message. I think he was just having a bad day, but I haven't been enlightened to the contrary, for better or worse. It's been 2 years since we've spoken and I have suspicions that he's dissuaded some work from coming my way.

In the meantime, I ran into an old friend who said he was taking the same course. He was due to finish it in a few months. A lightbulb went off and I thought ""Why don't we just start our own company and go off eachother!"" So we did, we did a logo, 3 site revisions and spread out business cards all over the city. No one called. We tried to do it legitimately with the government and ended up owing them 2k+. My partner always seemed disinterested and I ended up doing most of the legwork. A month ago we cut our losses and dissolved the company.

I managed to find work, but not from help with the company. Businesses connected to the family threw me bones and had me do a few static websites, the only thing I knew how to do. They loved the stuff I made them, it was crap, and it paid crap, but it was work and it was practice.

I'm spinning my tires, I'm running around in circles. I'm now trying to get the fundamentals of python down so I can work on web apps, but my design knowledge has fallen behind. I try to make nice websites, but they always come up way short of all the wonderful portfolio designs I see kicking around.

I never told anyone this, but I got extremely depressed over this whole ordeal. It was the catalyst of all the stress in my life coming together. Life then seemed meaningless and I was thinking about suicide constantly. I went and I got help. I went through the channels and met with a psychologist for a few sessions. She ended up dismissing me to minor protests because she couldn't pinpoint a clinical problem with me. I learned a little bit about myself, and I felt more optimistic about the future if only for a short time.

I just feel lost. I've tried getting those around me to help, but every attempt has erupted into flames and burned itself into the ground. Most recently I've begged some of the design firms in town to let me sit in on some designs, just quietly in a corner and observe and learn. Everything is silent. I even applied for a call support position in hopes to break into a company, but they didn't even get back to me for that.

I know I'd be lucky if even one person reads this, it was nice to write it out and get stuff off my chest. It would be astronomical to even get one sentence of advice. I see so many success stories of web designers on the internet who do freelance, I want to learn from them and better myself, but in the end I don't really even know what I'm looking for.

TL;DR: I've failed in every endeavor in an attempt to break into the industry. It's been 3 years and I feel like I'm going backwards. I'm lost and I need help.

EDIT: I go to sleep and I come back to something amazing. I've been getting tonnes of PMs and great advice. I've gotten some positive feedback and some negative feedback, all of them good, and I appreciate all of it! I'm going to spend time going over the thread to clear some things up and get some more concise advice if people continue to be as helpful and wonderful as they have been. I'm not in an insomnia-addled state anymore so I'll have a little more clarity in responses!

But my god, thank you, so much. It's already helped reading through everything."

The thing is I'm too afraid to ask him out or anything since (1) I've never asked a guy out before and (2) I'm not actually sure if he's interested and I'm afraid of rejection.

I met him through my internship. We don't actually work together this semester but we've been passing post-it notes to each other with drawings (he started it) since he's usually in in the morning and I come use the same computer in the afternoon. He was in one of my classes last semester and is in one class again this semester (same major). I never really noticed him last semester until around December when I started talking to him in class... I don't really know why but all of a sudden I'm really attracted to him.

So I've known him since last September, but I feel like if he was interested I would at least have his number by now. We're facebook friends and he likes a bunch of my statuses and will talk to me on there but I haven't texted him at all since I don't have his number. We talk during/after class sometimes but I don't know if it will actually go anywhere. I don't think he's really the shy type and wouldn't have trouble talking to a girl but maybe I'm wrong. Also, there's the fact that valentine's day was a week ago and if he was interested he could've let me know then.

My ex (the only boyfriend I've had so I'm a little inexperienced) was really obvious about flirting with me and was flirting since the first time I met him. He was also more physical (putting arms around me etc). so maybe that's why I'm so confused.

Should I try to be more direct with him? Or wait for him to make a move (if he even likes me)? Help me out, reddit! (I hope he doesn't find this since he reddits too...)"
194c09,70,2013-02-24,How my grandmother and I became fuck buddies,incest_confessions,incest,https://www.reddit.com/r/incest/comments/194c09/how_my_grandmother_and_i_became_fuck_buddies/,"Just over seven years ago, my mom passed from an aneurysm. My father left when I was a kid (I'm an only child), and neither my mother or I heard from him since. Since I was 16 at the time of my mother's passing, my choices were to go into foster care, or find my next of kin. Luckily, my grandmother (Corinne) was aware of the situation, and she took me in. At that time, Corinne was 55. Prior to the day she took me in, I barely knew of her.

My mother and Corinne didn't have much of a relationship. Corinne gave up my mother for adoption at the age of 17. From what I've been told, she took a year off of school to avoid embarrassing her family, and was forced to give up my mom. My mom was supposed to become ancient history until she started seeking Corinne out in her teens.

Long story short, when my mother found Corinne, she never received any replies. She did get in touch with my grandfather, though, which is how I know any of this. Although Corinne never responded, my mom kept her in the loop with holiday cards. She never gave up on her. I guess Corinne felt a sense of obligation to me, since my mother was always reaching out to her.

I was junior in High School when Corinne took me in. She was rarely home. She worked full-time as a VP at some regional ad agency. I mostly kept to myself, too. I had my own car—brand new. There was money left over from my mom's life insurance pay out, as well money from the sale of her condo. Although I had quite a bit of cash at such a young age, I stayed pretty responsible.

So, before going to college, I lived with Corinne for about a year and a half. During that time, there was nothing sexual. In fact, we rarely talked. I'm pretty confident, in that time before college, we never cooked a single meal or ate together. We had our own lives, and we merely lived together; we were like roommates. And, like roommates, we brought home partners. Neither of us said anything about that.

While I was away at college is when Corinne and I started getting close. Although she was in her late 50s, she was very tech savvy because of the industry she worked in, and we emailed pretty regularly. Later on, we started texting. We talked mostly about my school, and without really realizing it, she became my long-distance mentor. I was a marketing undergrad, and, really, her mentoring was invaluable.

In my third year of college, Corinne invited me back to her place for a week for the holidays. That was the first time we really celebrated anything. Previous holidays, I always stayed in the dorms. I never had too much trouble finding dates, so not really having a home to go back to was never an issue. But I was happy that Corinne invited me. I was applying for some internship positions, and I wanted to discuss them with her.

The first night I was at Corinne's, we had dinner together for the first time ever. She actually cooked. She made seared ahi tuna with mango chutney, a kale salad, and some sweet potato dish. It was amazing. She also served me white wine, as I had just turned 21 few months prior (that puts her at 60).

We were getting a little buzzed, but we kept it pretty professional. Our relationship was more like good coworkers, than any sort of family. She was vastly superior at drinking than I was, and I knew I wasn't going to keep at the pace she was going, so I thanked her for a fun night, and I headed to bed.

In the middle of the night, I woke to up to pee. As I sat in the dark of the hallway bathroom, I heard sounds coming from down the hall—likely Corinne's room. I didn't recall what time it was, and I was still a little drunk, but I listened and realized she had a partner over. I had seen men walk out of the house some mornings when I lived with her, but I had never actually caught her in the act (not that I ever cared to). Once I finished in the bathroom, my curiosity got the best of me, and I wanted to see if I could catch a glimpse of anything.

I crept down the hall, stumbling a little, but the noises of sex became louder with each step. Corinne's door was open a crack, and the lights were on. And, what I saw was amazing. She was riding reverse cowgirl on some guy on the bed who I couldn't really see. I watched, fascinated. Never had I really seen her as an object of desire, but I had to admit, at the age of 60, she looked pretty good. It was obvious she got some work done, since there was no way a 60 year old could look as tight as she did.

I'm not sure how long I stood there, but I suddenly noticed that she was looking at me, or at least in my direction. I quickly escaped back into my room. Watching Corinne fuck some guy was extremely arousing. I fapped and went to bed.

The next morning I woke up to sounds in the kitchen. Corinne and, I assume, the guy from last night were having coffee and poached eggs. I ended up joining them for breakfast.

Corinne introduced me as a college student she was giving room and board. I went along with the story. Later, it turns out, no one knew she ever had a daughter, let alone a grandson, so I guess she wanted to keep that part of her life hidden. The guy she was fucking was a coworker, looked to be in his late twenties, maybe early thirties. They talked about work, and we talked about what I was studying in college. The casual nature of the entire thing was strangely comfortable. I liked it.

As the week wore on, neither Corinne and I talked about me seeing her fuck that guy. It hadn't done anything to our relationship, but each night I fapped to that image of her. On Christmas Eve, she and I drank into early Christmas morning. She noticed the time, and she plainly asked if I wanted my gift. I had no idea I was getting one, and I apologized for not getting her one. She laughed and said that she wasn't going to get me one either, but she went out and got it the other night.

I opened it. It was the newest iPhone to replace my previous generation one. I thanked her, and she said that since we're texting regularly, I should have the latest tech. I thanked her again, and then, out of nowhere, she brought up the night I saw her having sex. Asked me why I watched for so long. I sat there, suddenly sober, and after what felt like an eternity, I said that I couldn't pull away. I told her I didn't mean any disrespect, and that I was still a little drunk. She laughed, and said she didn't care. She admitted that she accidentally saw me once, too, years ago when I was a senior in high school. I'm pretty sure I turned every shade of red. She laughed again.

I was pretty out of my element, but I guess I didn't know Corinne well enough to see that she was testing the waters with me. Also, she was pretty drunk. She started asking me about my sexual adventures in college, and we essentially swapped stories about our experiences. Clearly she was winning in terms of crazy sex stories.

Following that, she said she was going to call over that guy again, if I didn't mind, and I told her to go for it. I excused myself to go to the bathroom. When I came back to say goodnight, she said the guy couldn't make it out tonight. She had a few other people she could call, but some of them were either out of town, or too far away. I'm not sure what possessed me to say this, but I said, “I'm here.”

To which she replied, “Alright.”

She grabbed my arm and took me into the hallway. Without warning, she pushed me up against the wall, and we were making out. Honestly, at this point in my life, I was in my early 20s, and I was pretty much hungry for sex all the time, but I was taken aback by how carnal her sexual desire was; she had a need, and she was going to get it.

We groped each other and kissed in the hall for a bit before getting to her room. She started to undress, and I followed suit. Underneath her white blouse and pinstripe pencil skirt, she was wearing a matching set of black bra and boy shorts. She was breath taking. She unclasped her bra, and her breasts barely gave into gravity; they clearly weren't real, but they still seemed pretty natural.

She pushed me back onto her bed. I had stripped down to my underwear. She tore them off of me and started to give me a blow job. I had to focus extremely hard not to cum right into her mouth. After a while, she told me to lay down in the middle of her gigantic bed. She pulled off her boy shorts, and threw her leg over me. She hovered over my cock and pointed at the lube on the side of her bed. I handed it to her, and she opened it and let it drip onto my cock. It was the warming kind, and she rubbed it on. Her long, white nails grazed my skin, and I laid there in ecstasy.

After a few seconds, she tossed the lube container aside, and she used the remaining lube on her hand to wet herself. She grabbed my cock and slowly lowered herself onto it. All of this was effortless for her. I watched my dick get swallowed up by her surprisingly tight pussy. She moaned loudly, as if she finally got was she was needing all night. She kept a slow and steady speed, eyes closed, breathing heavily.

As I laid there, I immediately knew this was the best sex I had ever had, and maybe could ever have. I've had many partners over the past several years, but most lay motionless like a starfish, and others were simply not as good as Corinne—my biological grandmother.

She was picking up the pace. I followed her rhythm, and I thrust, too. I could tell she was really enjoying it, and I knew that I wouldn't last much longer. I announced that I was going to cum soon, and she all she did was grind even harder. I held out as long as I could until I just completely let go. At this point, she was screaming, but I could barely hear anything. I was literally cumming the hardest and most I had ever cum in my entire life. I probably shot 3 or 4 huge loads, but I felt my cock contract many times after that. Corinne had slowed down to a stop, with her head back. I couldn't see her face, but she had one hand on my abdomen, and one on my knee. She let out a long, deep sigh, and looked down at me. She told me it was great, and asked if I wanted to sleep next to her. I said okay.

I woke up around noon, naked in her Corinne's bed. She was gone. I put on my underwear, and I headed out. I could hear her in the kitchen. I came out to greet her, and she was cooking breakfast. I proceeded to tell her that last night was one of the best nights of my life. She flashed a smile while plating me up some bacon and fruit. We didn't talk too much while we ate, but I think that's because we really needed those calories.

After clearing the dishes, she told me to go take a shower in her shower, and I did. A minute in, she joined me, said, without any hesitation, “I want to fuck again. And I don't want to wait.” She grabbed my cock, and started to rub it slowly. It was a little sensitive from the night before, but I was hard in no time. She had a pretty big shower, and she leaned over and grabbed a rail. She put her hand between her legs, and used her fingers to spread her pussy. I stuck the head of my dick into her pussy, and I slowly rocked my way back and forth deeper and deeper into her. She still had some of my cum from the night before, and I didn't have trouble getting in.

The steam from the shower hung thick as I fucked Corinne from behind. This time we were sober, and I felt like I had a lot more control. She had even more energy than the night before, and I swear she was pounding back into me harder than I was slamming into her. I watched her has she held onto that rail, and her body kept a steady beat.

Since I wasn't as drunk this time, I was able to see her body more clearly, although this time from the back. She was fit. The only sign of aging that was apparent was her spine, where her bones were clearly defined. Her ass was tight, but I'm sure she's probably had a lift. Her skin wasn't youthful, but it was nowhere near elderly. Her arms were strong, and it's pretty clear that she works out reguarly.

It wasn't long before she I could feel her pussy start to tighten around me. She was breathing heavy, and grabbed my hand that was on her waist, and put it on her tit. She told me to pinch her nipples as hard as I could. I was hunched over her like a dog, squeezing and pulling her nipples as we collided into each other. The sudden demands were unbelievably hot, and I knew I was going to cum soon. I could tell she was just around the corner, too. She started screaming first, and I grunted a few times as I built up to my orgasm. I came hard as her pussy squeezed my cock over and over again.

We separated. She immediately knelt down before me. She took my softening cock into her mouth, and cleaned it up. I stood there as she gently pulled back her head, careful not to overstimulate my sensitive dick. She looked up at me with this satisfied look in her eyes. Without saying a word, she started to clean me, and then I returned the favor.

Before I left back to school, we fucked many, many more times. She always took the lead, but she wasn't a selfish lover. Since that amazing week, she's flew me out every other week to fuck and talk about my career, until I graduated. By then, she had gotten me a job at her agency, and I moved back in with her. We kind of went back to our old routine of little contact, as we focused on our jobs, and we still kept other partners. However, at least once a week, we fucked like animals, and many times, we've fucked at the office after hours.

I know Corinne's my grandmother, but I don't see her that way. I mostly see her as my mentor, and my sex life, outside of her, has improved because of her. But, I have to admit, no one has come close to beating her at sex."

The only requirement is that they have something to do with serving food in Hawaii.

I'd love your advice on what I should do with my finances.  (I hope this isn't a repost, I've kept my eyes open but not seen any posts that fit my situation)

I'm currently a single 21 year old junior in college and I'm on track to graduate in May 2014.  I'm so grateful to have an academic scholarship that covers most of my living/tuition/book/fees expenses and generous parents that control a college fund for my food, healthcare, and remaining learning expenses.  Overall, I am only spending money on entertainment, some food, and incidental expenses (like gifts, clothing, and personal care items).

I have 3 majors and I'm very involved on campus so I'm only able to work part-time.  My income is not always reliable, but I usually make about $100 biweekly.  I shop very frugally.

I am unsure about where I will be this summer, but I am hoping to work full-time at some sort of paid internship or student job.  I have applied several places but cannot really predict what my cash inflow will be from May-August.

Currently, I have:

* one college credit card (1200 unsecured limit, I only have ever spent up to 300/month), paid off in full every month with no problem
* 1300 between checking and savings (both give essentially 0.00% interest so I am unhappy with this)
* no student debt or debt of any kind, and no real anticipated debt

I'm considering:

* How much money should I set aside as an investment/savings?
* Should I consider a Certificate of Deposit?  Rates seem to be pretty low at the moment, but the security is attractive.
* What about an IRA?  I've considered starting a Roth IRA but am worried about the liquidity of the investment, possible risks that would be involved, and high minimums.  I may need access to my funds for expenses this summer.
* Is Vanguard the best way to go for Roth IRAs?  Seems to be the preference around here.
* Should I wait until next school year to start or try to begin saving now?

I study business so I have a general understanding of investment and business transactions.  I'm just in need of a little guidance.

Thanks so much for your help!"

Last fall she got an internship with a fancy IT company in North Carolina (We live in Mass). She is there right now and will be until the end of April, so we are doing a lost distance relationship. The past few months we have been fighting more. It is attributed to the distance and her working the opposite shift that I do (her nights, me mornings). She visited home a week ago, surprised me, did the romantic V-Day/Anniversary dinner on Saturday and it was a mostly good 4 day visit, she went back to NC on Tuesday. We fought the night before she left because I mentioned a thought (not an actual plan or decided motion) that was going through my head and she freaked out over it. NC is roughly 800 miles away, and her job had asked her earlier if she wanted to come back. This is a huge opportunity and not many of these comes during a student's college years, so I would never dream of holding her back from it. I've always been supportive and never said a negative word about this subject. She, however, is being extremely negative toward my THOUGHT. My aunt lives in Alaska and works dispatch for a VERY quiet little town, makes roughly 20 something an hour and works a couple other jobs. She is quitting some time in the summer and they will need someone. I was thinking about maybe going up there for the time that my girlfriend would be in NC is they decided to employ her down there. I was thinking that it would be more money, very temporary and I could save some extra dollars to get a nifty new place. Sounds reasonable to me, considering we are already doing a long distance relationship and don't see each except Skype and the occasional visit. She does not think so. She told me that she doesn't think she can do that and be together. She said she would ""wait"" for me until I got back but I'm an all in or nothing kind of girl. You're either with me entirely or not at all, I don't share or take breaks. I think she is being entirely unreasonable for acting this way. I've never told her I was going to ""check out"" while she was in NC, I'm supportive of her choices because I know this is important to her success, her well-being and her happiness. That was the first of our problems this week. We talk maybe once a day if even that and don't skype that often during the week, due to the opposite shifts. Today she sent me a text message that said she feels emotionally disconnected and I need to give her time and space to figure it out. When we talked on skype she said it was a disconnect from everything, not just me. She doesn't have a lot of friends because she keeps to herself and she doesn't really open up to her parents about a lot. I asked her how I was supposed to give her more space considering we barely talk, are 800 miles away and have seen each other face to face once in 2 months. She said no contact for maybe a week so she could get her head wrapped around what she is feeling. I've been crying to hours and have finally been able to stop so I could ask advice. I've done this song and dance before and it usually leads to us breaking up. Another dig that hurts me is that she said she felt like this weeks before seeing me and didn't tell me because she thought it would go away. But the night before she surprised me we had a serious talk about how she needs to express herself to me, she promised to do so. It feels like she broke that promise before she even made it. Ladies what do I do? I feel heart-broken and lost. I want to be supportive but I feel like isolating herself from the few people who she has left isn't going to help. :("

I have no reason to believe that anything has recently changed. 

My boyfriend and I have been dating for about 4 years, and when I graduate this spring, I want to move in with him. My parents are very against this, and it seems to be pretty irrational. The past two summers I've gotten internships close to where my university is and wanted to live with my boyfriend, but when I brought it up, my parents immediately shut it down. When I asked for a reason, it was basically like ""We don't want you to,"" or ""We're not comfortable with it,"" or ""What will people think."" I have a feeling that my parents don't have a real reason against it, and it's just a gut reaction, or them being old-fashioned. 

The weird thing is that my parents wanted me to pay for my own housing during the summer - so I don't see why I couldn't pay for whatever housing I wanted (eg with my boyfriend). I didn't want to press the issue too much those times, since my parents are paying for my tuition. Those two summers I ended up living with my boyfriend anyway without my parent's knowledge and paying for additional housing - obviously not an ideal situation. 

I'm graduating this spring and getting an internship in the area for the summer, then starting grad school at the same school I currently go to. I will be paying my own housing and tuition for grad school. My boyfriend lives in the area in a condo that he owns and he works full time. 

How can I convince my parents to be okay with me living with him? It's my money - I feel like I should be able to spend it however I want. And if they want me to live somewhere else, I'm just going to live with him anyway and the other place will be empty - which doesn't make any sense. I feel like my reasons are completely rational - how can I get them to see it my way?

**TL;DR** I'll be paying for my own housing and grad school starting this summer. I want to move in with my boyfriend and my parents aren't okay with it - how can I convince them to let me spend my money how I want? I like them and want to remain on good terms with them. "

(More details provided in post) ",alkscdn,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/193vsr/3_weeks_after_my_ex_and_i22m_broke_up_i_asked_a/,"**Because of the time-sensitive nature of my question, I would really appreciate any replies within 24 hours. The TL;DR of my very, very long post is at the bottom.** If you’re someone who prefers more background details before giving out advice, or can skim and absorb a lot of info quickly, please be my guest (I would be more than happy if you were able to pick out relevant details I may have overlooked). Be warned that it is quite long, though. Anyway, here goes…

I go to a small, private, liberal-arts college on the West Coast (obviously a throwaway account). Three weeks ago, my girlfriend and I broke up, but I've already successfully asked out someone (I'll call her Rachel) who I've had a big crush on for a long time. Rachel and I are both from the New York area, we met here in college about two years ago. We were involved in the same organization on campus, and though we were perfectly cordial to one another, we weren't all that close. Ironically, we started getting closer after both of us left the organization we were involved in, once: a) I got an internship in Bangkok last summer, where she used to live, and I asked her for advice via Facebook about living there, and b) we ran into each other at the start of the school year and found out that we were both from New York. Then, over winter break this year, she contacted me out of the blue to come hang out with her at an art exhibit in the city, and contacted me again after school started this semester to ask me out to lunch. I've really enjoyed hanging out with her and getting to know her; she's a really interesting person (in a very good way), we have quite a lot of common interests, and we've always had really good conversations. She's also gorgeous, which made her a natural choice for the Next Girl To Ask Out. 

So after taking two weeks of respite to get over my breakup, I texted her to see if she wanted to grab some lunch, the ulterior motive being that I wanted to meet with her face-to-face to ask her out. During our lunch, we had another really good conversation, and as we were walking out, I asked her out, and she said yes. 

The thing is, though, is that while she said yes, it came with a curious twist. I think it's worth it to replay the whole exchange as close to word-for-word as I can:

Marcus: So (name of ex-girlfriend) and I broke up three weeks ago.

Rachel: Aw, I'm sorry to hear that. 

Marcus: Anyway, the think I wanted to ask you is whether you would like to go out some time.

Rachel: Yeah, sure! Just let me know whenever you want to grab a drink or something!

Marcus: Great! What are you doing this weekend?

Rachel: I'm sorry, I'm busy this weekend, but I'm definitely free next weekend!

Marcus: Awesome, I'll text you before next weekend then.

Now, before you jump to conclusions, there are some things I should point out. 

*1) It’s very possible that her excuse that she isn't free this weekend is completely legitimate. She's a photographer that does a lot of really complicated work in a studio requiring a lot of time and planning. She's also pledging a sorority this semester, and is very involved in an entrepreneurship group on campus. 

*2) I realize that she may have felt pressured to say yes simply because I told her I broke up with my girlfriend, and especially because I prefaced how I actually asked her out with that info. I could be wrong, however. Regardless, I probably should have found a way to work it into the conversation during our lunch earlier, but I couldn't/didn't. (Sorry for going on a bit of a tangent there.) 

*3) When she told me that she is busy this “weekend,” I think it’s safe to assume that she meant Friday night and Saturday, and not Sunday, right? (This question will turn out to be important for the reasons given below). 

So, my question is: should I invite her to come watch the Oscars with me tomorrow night? Now, normally, I would just ask without a second's hesitation; I'm looking for a long-term relationship, and if another girl I had asked out wasn't game for something like this, then I'd have a pretty good indication that she wasn't quite relationship material. But here's the thing: I’ve grown to really like this girl and I think we would be great together. I don't want to make her feel rushed, since she seems to have more casual expectations for what dating between us is going to look like (the ""grab a drink"" suggestion she gave me when I asked her out took me by surprise), and especially since we haven't actually been on a first date yet. 

**TL;DR: Last week, three weeks after my now ex-girlfriend and I broke up, I ask out someone who I've developed a big crush on in the last year or so, and she says yes. But when I ask her what she is doing this weekend (by which I assume she understood as Friday night and Saturday), she tells me she is busy, but that she is free next weekend. Should I ask her to come watch the Oscars with me tomorrow (Sunday) night, even though we haven’t been on a proper first date yet? Or should I avoid making her feel rushed and give her some space?**

Again, I would greatly appreciate any replies within 24 hours. "

So I've been married for 2 years, dated before that for 3, with a guy that I'm just now realizing isn't the kind of man I'm into.  I use man pretty loosely, since at most I think people would consider him a boy... he's 29 and has no real goals in life except playing video games and not finding a job beyond his no-salary internship.  And on top of that, he has a ton of insecurities, anything from how short he is to how fat he's getting to how lousy he is in bed...

It's gotten to the point now where I'm actually looking a real man, and I know that sounds so cliche, but just to be with someone who knows how to take charge and own a relationship.  I've spoken to him about how much he's disappointed me and given him a million ways to make it up (tried exercising with him - he gave up; applied to a bunch of jobs for him - he never went to the interviews).

So now I'm ready to think about moving on, but to be honest, he's played the victim so often it's sort of got me thinking about seeing a new man even while I'm married to him.  I've become really into the idea of him either suspecting or knowing that a real man is in my life, taking over and owning what used to be his.  I know it sounds hurtful and what not and I know if I were any other person I'd look at my ad and think it was horrible, but this is where I am and I'm looking for someone who could help me with this.

I'm 5'4, of Asian descent, black hair and black eyes and keep in shape.  I guess you'd say I'm beautiful, but I only really blossomed until after college, which is why I dated my now (sorta loser) husband."

I was genuinely interested in both audit and tax and didn't have the opportunity to complete an internship in public accounting since I wanted to study abroad for a portion of the summer before my senior year. Luckily, I found a real estate management firm offering an in-house accounting job that let me work whatever days I could outside of traveling. While it looked good on a resume, it didn't help me get any closer to a decision between audit and tax. 

Now, I understand that an internship in public accounting is (supposed to be) designed to shed some light on a prospective career path, but how can students possibly know that an alternative path isn't better for them in the long run? It seems unrealistic to expect college students to know what they want to spend several years (or more) of their lives doing. 

The firm I've been working for since graduation has a program that I think more should offer. We allow employees to spend 3-6 months in one of our other departments (we're split between audit, tax, and systems) if they elect to. The number of open spots is obviously limited each year and only certain employees (generally staff and some seniors) are eligible since client needs come first, but it's still a unique opportunity to offer. 

I don't really have a question or anything, just wanted to start some discussion since I feel like this is issue is so entrenched in the public accounting profession. "

I feel like the best way to advertise the programming skills I have and make my resume look desirable is to show the best/most complex projects I've done, even if they were school assignments. As an example, here is one project I thought I might add:

*Huffman Tree Text Compressor - herpderp.edu/link-to-applet.html*

* Implemented in Java SE 6 and tested in JUnit

* Compresses text files by assigning new bit encodings to characters according to frequency

* Re-expands text files that have been compressed with Huffman encoding

**Should I bother putting something like that on my resume?** If I do, should I indicate on the resume that I did it for a course, or just explain if I'm asked about it?

Even though I would be cleaning up the code of any school project and adding to it substantially, in accordance with my school's honor code **I cannot put the source code in a public place.** Therefore I would be providing a link to a webpage with an embedded applet.

Is it worth doing this, or is it a good idea to mention projects on a resume only if I can link directly to a source code repository?

Background: Recent graduate from a State University with Bachelors in  International Business and Business Management. Did volunteer mentorship with a non-profit organization through my school(SIFE, now ENACTUS), was apart of honor society that required networking groups and leadership training in the form of videos and broadcasts, and I did a foreign internship/mentorship in Nicaragua at an Electronics firm for a requisite to graduate with my International Business Degree. I am conversational level bilingual and throughout college I worked Desktop Support/Helpdesk for 2.7 yrs - 20 hrs a week. 

Now my questions are:

1. How do I properly place my dual majors (essentially two degrees) without it looking awkward, but still highlighting that I have two separate degree?

2. What is a better way of putting my foreign experience? I think ""foreign mentorship"" is more descriptive than internship.
It was a month-long foreign living expereince where I shadowed relatives that own an electronics distribution company with distribution centers, warehouses, and retail stores. Should I create a new entry under my education to highlight it? Or should I create a really well-structured one liner to describe it as a facet of my undergrad? 

3. Maybe should I elaborate more on my organizations I was apart of? 

4. Would this resume be something someone hiring for entry level management or related fields consider? Is it too much IT and not enough management experience/background? Thoughts?

Any pointers, grammar, or any type of criticism is greatly appreciated. Thanks.

And it does say my school (St. Louis) and when I graduate on my resume (May 2013). I also said ""I'm Hanna X, a Senior in Graphic Design, at My school in St. Louis..."" in the first line of my cover. Also my address in resume is my St. Louis address. 

It's for a design internship. And I've encountered a lot of designers who don't read resumes or coverletters at all (they just look at the work in the portfolio). I don't want to say something like ""Well, as mentioned in my resume, ...etc."" because I'm afraid it'll kind of alienate them. Also, I'm afraid it looks like I can't follow the rules. 

Not a huge deal, but I've gotten quite a number interviews that went, ""Wait, you're still in school... ?"" Even though it's clearly stated in my resume and coverletter. While I enjoy talking to the recruiter/designer/marketing director/hr, getting their contact information, and getting some interview practice in I also don't want to look like I'm misleading them. "

I'm studying CS at a school that doesn't really have a lot of connections to companies looking for interns, and I've never really talked to anyone about what an internship in CS would entail. I'm putting together my Resume at the moment to start sending it out, and I'm pretty unsure of how to sell myself without the full skill set you would expect of a graduate seeking a job. 

Secondly, I'd like to know if anyone has input on what I should look for in an internship, and what to avoid."

I understand that the VAST majority of employers need to see professional experience, even for junior designers. I've recently completed a 3 month unpaid intern-ship in which I learnt a lot and thoroughly enjoyed, and leaving it really sucked. I'm now unemployed and job hunting, but I'm not getting very far. I've been taking on free work for friends and family in order to keep myself busy and to add to my portfolio. However, I'm becoming quite unmotivated, and it's partly because I'm broke and I feel there is no end in sight. 

The company where I interned offered me an apprenticeship, however that would mean another year working for less than the minimum wage (and I have a child to support) but on the plus side I'd be guaranteed a job at the end of it, and it's a fantastic working environment with lots of interesting projects. Basically, how can I stop this feeling of resentment that's arising from being poor? I love designing but my financial situation is effecting my motivation to work. Is it worth it in the end? What are some rewards I can give myself for completing short term-goals that don't cost anything? Thanks."
197cee,1,2013-02-25,Should I avoid internships if I want to go straight into grad school?,iamcarlgauss,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/197cee/should_i_avoid_internships_if_i_want_to_go/,"I saw a video a few weeks ago where Michio Kaku was talking about how over 50% of the PhD candidates in America aren't Americans.  I had always toyed with the idea of going for a PhD, but I was so disgusted with that statistic (upset with Americans, not the foreigners getting PhDs here), that I think I've decided I want to work towards one myself.

The reasons behind my decision aside, I was looking for some perspective about what I should focus on during my undergraduate years.  Seems like the norm in engineering programs is a very loud recommendation that students get internships.  REUs seem to be considered much less beneficial for us.

But if a student, like myself, plans to go to graduate school rather than straight into industry, should I focus more of my attention on REUs?  Should I still apply for internships?

Thanks - Any input is welcome."
197a0r,1,2013-02-25,Should I take a co-op at Oracle?,timtamboy63,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/197a0r/should_i_take_a_coop_at_oracle/,"Background: I'm a freshman at Georgia Tech, CS Major from Perth, Australia.

The company is a startup that was recently acquired by Oracle in Atlanta (Vitrue) I *really* wanted to work at a startup this summer because I'm really into that whole scene. So while this company is Oracle on paper, it doesn't look like there's much bureaucracy, and Oracle doesn't really interfere with their operations.

However, I've still got some interviews with startups in the SF area, and I'm fairly sure one of them will offer me an internship soon. I'd also prefer not being tied down to a co-op.

I've also got another opportunity in Perth with a Rails shop that I interned with previously, and they're offering me significantly more money than Oracle.

However, I'm sure Oracle would look pretty awesome on my resume, especially considering I'm a freshman.  

What would be the best course of action right now? I've still got interviews with Tumblr, Khan Academy and a few other startups, so I'll definitely ask for some time to decide."

[rant],[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/196yfu/im_too_fat_for_my_clothes_rant/,"This morning I woke up, excited for my first interview for an internship in a long time. I haven't worn my professional clothes in maybe a year (being a univ. student affords the luxury of dressing is jeans and a t-shirt everyday), but I figured I'd just grab a pair of slacks and a collared shirt. *Wrong.* Everything I tried on was tight and some of them didn't even button anymore. I knew I had gained some weight, but maybe I was in denial of just how much since I started college nearly three years ago. I panicked. I tried on every single piece that could be considered business attire and spiraled further into self-pity and frustration as each one continued to not fit. *I am too fat for my clothes.* My stomach spills over. My love-handles have muffined out. My shirts squeeze my boobs in too tight. My dresses struggle to fold over my hips. I sat in the corner of my closet and cried for much longer than I'm proud of. With my makeup redone, I sat and watched the rolls form from the fat encasing my stomach and wondered just when I had gotten so bad. I pulled on the least tight pair of slacks and a used-to-be-loose-and-flowy shirt that now hugs my body, and tried not to cry again. But my sanity and self-esteem have plummeted; I hate my fat body. I don't know what to do. I don't eat a ton and I try to exercise when I'm not too tired or busy. I can't afford a different wardrobe, and even then, buying bigger clothes would feel like defeat and I'm not sure I can handle that. I want to fix it. I have to fix it. And I know this mentality is not healthy - my education has taught me that and more. But it doesn't stop me from thinking it. *Knowing better* doesn't help me *feel better.*

Sorry for the rant, but I am losing it and needed to put this somewhere. 

EDIT: Thank you all those who offered encouraging words, advice, and even a motivational kick in the butt! It means so much that so many of you were willing to share your own experiences - its such a huge inspiration! It retrospect, I had a bit of a dramatic, blubbering meltdown this morning, but it has given me all the motivation I need to do something about it (without forgetting that I should accept my body for what it is, not what it isn't) And also, the interview went great! :D"

So, at what point should/do you turn business down and for what reason? Too small budget from client? Boring projects? Project may be too big for us to handle? Short projects vs long projects etc?

I recently graduate from my school and I’m currently living in Beijing. It’s gonna sound a little cliche but I came back to china for my girlfriend to give it a try. 

I came back just before the spring festival and from January to February I tried to apply to as many jobs as I could. 
My background is system and network administration. I am a recently graduated guy so my experience is not top notch yet, I have only 2 years of experience I gathered in internships. 

I see many talks about English teaching jobs but never about IT, so far I didn’t get many positive response and it seems like companies are only looking for super mega expert with 7 years of experience. I guess I can also look for an internship to extend my knowledge but it seems that this area is limited to Chinese. Maybe I’m looking at the wrong place ? 

I used several website such as : 51Jobs, Zhaoping, indeedcn but only big companies are listed.
 To the IT guys working in China, any advice to get a job/internship in China ?

[Is there anything you've seen that would make you stop eating peanut butter?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/195t2j/i_work_at_a_peanut_butter_factory_amaa/c8l1rp3?context=5)|Absolutely not. It is a very clean environment. Water isn't allowed out on the floor for risk of bacteria. I can't wear my work boots outside of the plant. I have to wear a lab coat and a hair net. The operators wear a uniform that stays at the plant and is washed by an employee. They also wear a hair net and gloves. The peanuts that have not been roasted yet stay in the ""raw room"" which has no contact with any product that has already been roasted so that salmonella is at a lesser risk.
[Brilliant! I can continue with my peanut butter obsession.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/195t2j/i_work_at_a_peanut_butter_factory_amaa/c8l1uj8?context=5)|Eat on! Since working there I love peanut butter even more. Plus, I get it free.

[What would you recommend for someone who is allergic to bananas?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/195t2j/i_work_at_a_peanut_butter_factory_amaa/c8l4qqx?context=5)|Okay...this is great. I have Oral allergy syndrome and am allergic to raw fruits/veggies. If this is your case, I heat mine in the oven when my allergies are acting up and sprinkle it with cinnamon. BUT, peanut butter and apples is great. And burgers..
[Does peanut butter ever get stuck to the roof of the building?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/195t2j/i_work_at_a_peanut_butter_factory_amaa/c8l2pxi?context=5)|Once that I know of. When they tested the pigging system. (See the question about crazy stories.)

When they first tested it, it shot out of the line and peanut butter went everywhere. Sadly, I wasn't working there at the time but we will be testing again here soon! :D.

Personally, I can't tell the difference between certain brands. The main difference in peanut butter recipes are the sweeteners. Whether it is powdered sugar, honey, or chemical sweeteners. But each recipe is made with great care. Many tests are run to make sure that color, consistency, taste, and health standards are all up to the standards that the customer sets.
[Do you make any that's just lightly salted?  I think sweet pb taste gross.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/195t2j/i_work_at_a_peanut_butter_factory_amaa/c8l33ml?context=5)|We do have some natural peanut butter that has little added ingredients.

Bonus fact: Crunchy peanut butter is made by just adding in chunks of peanuts to already made smooth peanut butter. My boyfriend always thought that it was just peanut butter that had been ground up less.

[In reference to the title, what could we possibly not ask you about peanut butter? What secrets are you hiding?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/195t2j/i_work_at_a_peanut_butter_factory_amaa/c8l4m1j?context=5)|Location, details that could identify me or my employer.

But, if the peanut has already come in and has been roasted, the laser sorter will kick it out if it doesn't look anything like a peanut. I'll try to get a better answer for you at work tomorrow if you'd like.
[What happens to the rejected peanuts?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/195t2j/i_work_at_a_peanut_butter_factory_amaa/c8l3i72?context=5)|They get put into a tank that is taken to a company that turns it into animal feed.

I went to Puerto Rico on vacation and there was a peanut butter burger at the restaurant we ate at and it was phenomenal. Sweet relish on one side of the bun, peanut butter on the other, and burger in between.
[How exactly is Peanut butter made? I literally just had some Apple with Peanut butter and sat pondering the whole time.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/195t2j/i_work_at_a_peanut_butter_factory_amaa/c8l210o?context=5)|Unroasted peanuts come in through the door and are then sent through the roaster machine.  They are then laser sorted to kick out anything that isn't a peanut. They then go through pumps and put into large bags. Some of the large bags are for the crunchy part and some are to be made into smooth peanut butter. They then go through machines that grind the peanuts into butter. It is then mixed with the proper amount of sweeteners and preservatives for it's formula. After that, it is pumped into the filler that fills jars. The jars then go through a metal detector, then are capped, labeled, heat sealed, tray packed, shrink wrapped, and then stretch wrapped onto a pallet. Raw peanuts in, yummy peanut butter out.
[Wait...so you check for peanuts *after* roasting?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/195t2j/i_work_at_a_peanut_butter_factory_amaa/c8l3bwy?context=5)|A laser sorter shoots out the shells or anything that isn't a peanut.
[Dear god I thought it would be far more ""plastic"" than that with a bunch of stuff added in.  Hearing that it is literally kinda just peanuts churned up makes me love it even more. Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/195t2j/i_work_at_a_peanut_butter_factory_amaa/c8l26sq?context=5)|No problem! I can't guarantee that all plants operate the same way but if you're eating US big brand peanut butter then it is likely produced in this fashion. :)

[What exactly do you do on a day at work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/195t2j/i_work_at_a_peanut_butter_factory_amaa/c8l2ct3?context=5)|Well, I am an Industrial engineering intern. So in the past few weeks I have watched specific machines on our A line to find out how to make them more efficient and decrease downtime. Right now I am beginning to design a piece of equipment that can help align a skid of empty jars before they go into the depalletizer to be sent down the line and filled.

Time studies, work sampling. One thing was easy: Jars were getting backed up and getting stuck because the filler was running too fast for the capper. Solution? Speed up the capper.

A vacuum system sends the peanuts to where they need to go. The peanuts basically go through a machine that grinds them since that is all that it takes to turn peanuts into peanut butter. Additional ingredients such as sweeteners and preservatives are added after the grinding process. We have a filler that fills the jars, one line has a 32 head filler and the other is currently a 10 head filler. But it will soon be replaced with a 28 head filler.

It has probably culminated in mild depression, but that's not what Im here to talk about I guess.

Seriously, I'm just a really shitty person. As a bit of background to all of this, I come from a relatively wealthy family and suburb in midwestern America, and have been handed pretty much everything in life. I'm white, male, at least marginally intelligent and come from a loving and supportive family that saved enough money to send me to a very prestigious midwestern engineering school. I was able to get into this program because I excelled in a special program at my high school, and I got into that program because I was in another set of smaller, focused programs in middle school, which I got into because...the cycle repeats all the way down to 1st grade. I was in small classes with great teachers who probably coddled us a bit. I have had two internships at a great engineering firm because a family member knows the owner. I worked as a caddy at a country club for 7 years, and got preferential treatment for many of them because my dad worked for the same caddymaster when he was a teenager. I have had to work for almost nothing in my life. My family isn't super rich and I'm not blaming them for this at all, nor am I begrudging the opportunities themselves. I just fucking hate how I have dealt with and pissed away everything I have been given. [Very first-world-problem, I know, I know. If already want to punch myself in the face on a near-constant basis, I can't imagine how much somebody from a less-privileged background than I would despise me]

Anyway, I'm just going to tear into the reasons why I suck.

**Laziness:** This is a huge one. I didn't work nearly as hard before I came to college as I should have, in school or with my personal appearance/health/fitness. There isn't much else to say about this one, laziness is just self-explanatory. It seeps into everything I do. 

**Shitty Attitude Toward Work:** I have had a couple of jobs in my life, and I have been woefully ineffective in both. As a caddy, I was overweight, didn't hustle much, and really didnt like the job. I didn't want to head out onto the course and work, I didn't like the people I was working for, and hated one of my bosses. In my internships with the company I dont deserve to work for anyway, I constantly showed up late to work and took 15 extra minutes on my lunch breaks (though I made sure to work the full 8 hours everyday), didn't talk to many people, slacked off, didn't learn much of anything, and decided I really did not want to work as that type of engineer for a living. I understand everyone probably doesn't like their job, but I have an extreme aversion to it. **IMPORTANT THING/REASON FOR POST** I have, inexplicably, been invited back to that internship for a third year, and I'm actually weighing the option of NOT WORKING for an entire summer instead of working there again because it made me so unhappy. Who the fuck actually turns that type of thing down? What the fuck is wrong with me that I'd actually think ""yeah, I don't need to make roughly $6k this summer""? Again, my family isn't rich. Well-off, but not rich, and $6k would make a huge impact on my student loan payments/rent. I go to school with a very intelligent girl who would run me over with her bike for this job, and here I am, not wanting to take the offer because I hated last summer (other note, while I didn't enjoy caddying, I didn't look back on a summer of caddying negatively. I look back at last summer as one of the more horrible times in my life).

**Shitty Attitude Towards Others:** As I alluded to above, I was kind of gifted as a student, and grew up in an echo chamber where all everyone ever told me is that I was some sort of genius. I got a bit of an ego about me at a very young age, and sported a cocky, douchy, piece-of-shit attitude everywhere I went before college. I was a horribly offensive human being, and I don't know how I made friends at all. (I do, however, understand why I lost so many best friends). I still have moments where I am an arrogant asshole. What has remained most though is my overall cynical and angry attitude towards people and life in general. I get annoyed with people for no reason all the time. This has been coupled with a shyness borne out of being a fat kid and bullied in middle school to leave one hell of a terrible conversationalist who has trouble meeting new people and hates everything. (it is totally possible to be a huge piece of shit and shy and bullied all at once)

**Wasted Opportunities:** This is more specific than anything else, but I have wasted virtually every great opportunity presented to me. When I was young, I played baseball. I was pretty good, and threw the ball very hard at a very young age. Parents payed for lessons, and the biggest thing the guy stressed was that I needed to lose some weight. I completely ignored him, threw away the pamphlet he gave me to give to my mom, and never lost that weight. Ended up never getting better at the game and destroying my elbow. I never would've been great at baseball, but I loved it so dearly and yet refused to help myself get better...My junior year of high school, I was in great position to lose weight, and actually lost 15 pounds in my first month of trying to do so. And for whatever reason, I stopped. I think it was because of some mean remarks from people in the school weight room that scared me off, but I can't be sure. And here I am so much later and still having gained so much more weight, and now have a bad knee preventing me from doing too much at once...Also my junior year, a girl who is a thousand times more intelligent, kind, and pretty than anyone I could ever go up and talk to crushed hard on me. I basically ignored her out of fear I wasn't understanding her correctly/afraid she'd hate me the more we talked. I treated her like shit in our senior year and I will never forgive myself for it...Also in my senior year, I was contacted by a friend about opening for local band that had made it *huge* (no seriously, if you search the first couple of letters in their name on YouTube, all of the suggestions are related to them and they have like 5 videos with over 12 million views. I'd tell you exactly who they were or it'd be way too easy to figure out who I am.) for a benefit concert at the school. I said ""no, we havent really practiced in a month or so."" My friends/bandmates eventually found out and two of them don't talk to me anymore because of it. We wouldn't have become huge because of it, but who turns down the chance to play in front of 3,000 people? THIS asshole, apparently. I was/am terrified of failure and am easily scared away by really pushing hard for something. Which brings me to... 

**I have been a complete failure in college:** I actually technically ""settled"" on the school I'm at right now. I got into Northwestern, Notre Dame, Michigan, and a few other big name schools, but went where I went because I was worried about what those schools might cost. And I must have come into school with a ""settling"" mentality, cause I slumped out of the gates. I chose a private dorm rather than a dorm where I'd branch out more because I was afraid all the party people would hate me. I don't go to office hours because Im ashamed of my appearance and I am afraid that the professors hate me. I have failed a core class in a subject that I came to the school to major in, and that was the cumulative product of half-assing everything I did before that class. I now probably need to change my specialty to something less interesting that also lowers my earning potential by tens of thousands of dollars at higher levels. I don't really have the passion needed to succeed in the major I have chosen, and it is far too late to change majors or get back on the right track for this major. My GPA is mostly shit and I don't have enough credit hours left to bring it back up to something respectable.

**Zero Direction in Life:** All of this has left me mostly without close friends, no passion or interest in any future job, and lying around in a general malaise that I cannot shake. I am a bum, for lack of a better term. And everything I look back on in my life is just one major embarrassment or failure.

I really wish I'd stop hearing from the people around me that I am such a smart kid/that I have worked so hard to achieve what I have. It's fucking bullshit and it just feels like they're mocking me at this point. Because I really am a shitty excuse for a human being - overweight, lazy, cynical, and rotten. So that concludes my offmychest post. I'm a piece of shit and I wish more people understood that. Good late night writing, lol"
196ksy,1,2013-02-25,Pescaterian in need of diet and exercise critique,[deleted],Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/196ksy/pescaterian_in_need_of_diet_and_exercise_critique/,"Hey fittit, so I'm a 20 year old guy who is 5 ft 8 in and weighs 140 lbs. My goals are to lose fat, gain muscle, and prepare for active internship in summer. I have sort of a short and stocky body type and I'm trying to look slimmer but still keep the muscle. I am also a pescaterian, which means the only meat I eat is fish. I only occasionally eat milk products and don't eat eggs. I have read the FAQ as well as used the search bar but I still find myself confused since I am seeing no results lately. 

Background:

So about a year ago I weighed around 160 pounds and lived a lazy sedentary lifestyle. I ate horribly, overate on a regular basis, and started gaining too much fat/weight. I decided about 9 months ago that I wanted to change that completely. I had not yet discovered fittit and I didn't really know what I was doing. Basically I did a lot of cardio, lost a bunch of fat, lost 20 pounds, but lost a lot of muscle too and was ""skinny fat"". I did not lose any more weight after I hit 140.

Current situation:

I am still stuck at 140 lbs and my body has looked the same for a while now. I discovered fittit about a month ago and 3 weeks ago I started lifting weights. As of now a regular week for me is M,W,F cardio for an hour. T,Th,Sat I hit the weight room. On weight lifting days, I do Squats,deadlifts, Curls, push ups, and pull ups. I also do ab work everyday after my workout. My upper body became bigger and more defined despite the fact that I don't do much upper body. 

Diet: Here's a typical day for me.

Breakfast 
Steel cut Oats w/cinnamon and blueberries,
Greek Yogurt,
Carrots,
Almond butter,
Coffee

Lunch 
Sardines and crackers, 
Kale cooked with olive oil,
Apple 

Workout 

Postworkout Snack  
Hemp protein powder mixed in almond milk,
Banana,
Almonds

Dinner
Tofu cooked with olive oil, 
Sweet potato, 
Broccoli,
Beans,
Tea

So that's around 2000 calories a day minus 400 calories from workout which puts me at 1600 calories a day. 

My diet has been similar to this for a few months now. I drink lots of water and occasionally do cheat with the calories due to going out to eat and such. I get lots of sleep as well. 

Questions:

Is my diet okay? Am I missing crucial vitamins since I am a pescaterian? Should I eat less? Why do I feel so hungry even though I am meeting my calorie requirements (especially late night). What can I do about that?

How is my weight lifting routine? Too much leg work and should work upper body more? 

Should I take a multivitamin or other supplements? Is hemp protein powder okay? 

Is my weekly plan of switching up cardio and weight lifting everyday okay for my goals? 

Edit: shortened. "

I've been interested in law for a couple years now.  Last summer I worked as an intern (doing more legal aide type things reading depos, looking for discrepanices, being given specific tasks. i.e. not getting coffee) and I really enjoyed it.

I'm a junior at one of the top 10 universities in the US.  Pretty good GPA, pretty confident I can crush the LSAT with a lot of studying, and overall pretty sure I can get into one of the T14 law schools if all goes as planned.  (i don't at all mean that in a cocky way, it's just a goal I really have my heart set on and think I can accomplish).

But, everything I've seen lately is ""don't go to law school, don't go, don't go, you're not gonna get a job no matter what.""  And yeah, I understand the complete oversaturation of the law field at the moment.  It's making me want to rethink my decision rather than plunging myself into debt.  I'm currently at one of the best undergrad schools in the world, but on full scholarship/financial aid.

But is it true that even if I go to a T14 school that I'll have a slim chance of getting a job?  Are there any specializations I could do to change this?  What would you recommend to someone in my position?

My major is psychology and anthropology, so deciding to not go to law school at this point would be a huge crisis for me since I don't really want to go into psychology, and there's not really jobs out there for anthropology.

I realize there's r/lawschool but what I'm looking for is advice from real attorneys on what I can do to make the best out of my situation since I feel like I'm already stuck with the decision of law school for better or worse.  Any advice, observations, or anything would be appreciated.

edit: i just wanted to apologize in advance as this is extremely hastily written and just kind of poured out of me since I'm feeling very ""damned if i do damned if i don't"" at the moment"

I apologize if some of the language seems weird, I had it formatted differently and it looked terrible so I smashed a bunch of info together.

Here are some job qualities or attributes that I think fit well with me. Pick and choose. Job idea that fits the most wins!!

* Analytical Problem Solving, Creative Problem Solving

* Work you can take pride in

* Importance on Design Process, QFD, Creative Solutions

* Decent level of social interaction

* Decent level of non-office work, variety

* Bonus for Entrepreneurial, or at least some feeling of it

* Bonus for spending some time outside

* Bonus for a hands-on aspect

Some History

* Already have BS in Civil, will have BS in Mechanical by the end of summer

* Worked professionally in sustainable buildings for a few years - Worked in Mechanical &amp; Civil engineering, Architecture, Interior Design, &amp; Construction Management



* Did a fair bit in Automotive Engineering, within the scope of Formula SAE for a pretty good US team - My design work was mainly in structural packaging/FEA and powertrain, but I’ve been around it long enough to have a solid grasp of suspension too. I’ve volunteered for the FSAE US comps for a couple years. Right now, working on a joint Industrial design &amp; engineering school project for one of the “Big Three”

* Had a bunch of part time jobs, summer jobs and internships - Manufacturing process engineering, DOT construction inspection, Ag &amp; Construction equipment operator, Laborer, Pipefitter, Oil field roughneck, Welder, Concrete research assistant, and Formula Atlantic Racecar mechanic

* Ran my own lawn care business during high school and into college, Led to a lot of other contract work, Ag, Construction &amp; Rando

* Grew up on a farm and naturally developed into a very mechanically inclined and hands-on person with an affinity for working outdoors. Did what most of what you might imagine, drove equipment, broke equipment, fixed equipment, built equipment from scratch, threw hay, and kept livestock. Learned some conservation and Ag management practices. Tons of redneck projects – trucks, jeeps, lawnmowers etc

Some possibilities I’ve been thinking of.

* Return to Building engineering with a focus on energy &amp; commissioning

* Manufacturing engineering, I do feel like this is a more limited long term career option.

* Forensic Engineering, maybe automotive emphasis

* Automotive Design/Engineering outright

* Anything I could eventually turn into my own business, not sure what that is yet."

What's the only way out of that vicious cycle? More education. Therefore, the college education system has kind of a monopoly on getting a job with livable wages.


If there were no minimum wage, kids could gain experience through low-paying jobs (sort of an internship or apprenticeship) while they cover their living expenses with savings or loans that would have otherwise been used on tuition.


This system is already in place to some degree, of course. But, minimum wage restricts the number of people that this is a reasonable option for, overburdening the college system, and raising costs for everyone.


There will be people caught in a job with unlivable wages, but they'll be no worse off that someone who couldn't handle college and drops out (due to difficulty with the material or with not living in the real world and partying too much).

me=28/f  him=28/m
I hate feeling like I wasn't being truthful with myself, that I should have bailed long ago when I wasn't getting what I NEEDED from him, that I made excuses as to why he wasn't more attentive. We never did anything cruel to each other until the end (including a facebook post by me that could have been taken MANY different ways that he over reacted to, followed by a morning text message break up from him, followed by a nasty telephone conversation). A 6 month relationship, in reality, was only a close friendship. I some times pushed for more because I wanted to make sure I wasn't wasting time. I may have pushed the girlfriend/boyfriend deal...but he wanted to take me to his family's houses (the parents are divorced) for Thanksgiving, for Christmas...in my mind you don't do that unless you are serious about some one. I needed and wanted to know there was going to be more. You don't want to get close to MORE people just to have them ripped away, too. 

There was no intimacy. When there was it was awkward. Hell, even cuddling was awkward. It was all so strange. And I don't say this to make myself feel better...but I some times wonder if he is gay, and hasn't admitted it to himself yet (i won't bore you with all the details and reasoning). I even asked him, not once, but twice. Once was a ""no."" the other was ""if only it were that easy."" a very strange answer that all my friends yelled ""WHAT?"" at the answer, because it made no sense. I blamed everything on how busy school and his 50/week internship kept him. But honestly, there is something not quite right, something he is keeping from me and maybe himself...i don't know. He  would talk of future plans together. But in the end, he claimed he never had deep feelings for me. He waited, but it never happened. But not a week before this, he said that 2 things kept the hypothetical pill bottle on the night stand full, and one of them was me.


But we had times of being an excellent support system for each other, more on my side than him for me. I was never in love with him, but I cared about him. I kept waiting to feel more too. MY last kiss with him was numb. He liked it, but I felt nothing. UGH! I just hate thinking about this crap still. It has only been 4 days. The last thing I said to him before hanging up on him was ""you're a piece of sh*t."" I feel horrible, but I hate him for that crap he pulled with the insensitive break up move but STILL wanted to be friends. 

I feel empty. Numb. Completely winded. I know this all happened. But at the same time, it feels like a dream...the whole 6 months. Like I just imagined it and he doesn't really exist. It saddens me that my mind is doing this...like my brain is on autopilot trying to erase him, but my heart still aches. So I sit here and hurt, but don't know why. 

DOES THIS MAKE SENSE?? I have never felt this way. Please...any words of advice?"

The best plan of action I've thought of is taking a shitty job for a couple years, going to grad school, and using that to network and find a job more suited to my interests. So my main worry is finding work in Harrisburg, while I'm living in the DC area, until I get my CPA.

For those of you that have been in similar situations:

- How much did networking play into you getting a job? The only connection I have is a regional manager of Rite Aid (corporate offices around my area), and I'm not really sure how much he could help me.

- How often did you have to make the trip for interviews? What is the process of finding and acquiring the job like, exactly? 

- Any other general tips?

Little background info - ETA is about six months, I am planning on taking night classes while working (probably going for master's or MBA) and getting the CPA as fast as I can, my GPA is pretty low at a 3.1 (probably 3.2 after this final semester), and my resume includes accounting and investment/financial advising internships, both at small/medium sized companies, proposal work under a regional VP at a prestigious engineering company, and treasurer of a local political campaign.

I went through all the fucking steps, got a computer science degree and had two fucking internships, in which both supervisors told me they really liked my work and were impressed... Yeah, guess you didn't tell HR that you recommended me for that job, eh...

But yeah, then I went back to get a masters... Because you know I thought that maybe that would open up more prospects.

Yeah, now instead of that I dont have enough experience, all anyone tells me is that I am ""overqualified"". Fuck that.

Our company, Endemic, INC currently operates [Nerdy With Children](http://nerdywithchildren.com/) and we have plans to launch a new site in the next few months.  We're looking for a Digital Content Editor to join our [team](http://nerdywithchildren.com/about).

What We Need:

We're looking for a person who can help us build Endemic, INC into the superior powerhouse that we know it can become. Currently, we are a team of two co-founders, a couple interns, and a handful of freelance writers. We launched Nerdy With Children in August 2012 and are now planning to launch Nerdy With Pets. The co-founders are not editors and we need someone to step into this role and take the reins of our editorial dept with a long term commitment in mind. As we’re located in the U.S., this position is only open to U.S. and Canadian residents for timezone reasons because you will be working remotely.   

Responsibilities:
Managing our team of freelance writers.
Editing, writing, publishing quality content that our audience will fall in love with. 
Curating products and developing story ideas that will be featured.
Assisting us in content strategization.
Managing Editorial Interns 
Helping us come up with awesome ideas. 


What You Should Have:

Step 1: A degree from a University in Journalism or Communications.

Step 2: At least three to five years experience in an editing position. Preferably in the online publishing industry. 

Step 3: You're a passionate nerdy-geeky person who would love to write about kids and pets. If you dream of attending ToyFair, making quilts, meeting Nathan Fillion, or searching Etsy for cute dog sweaters then we want to talk to you. (Our next website will focus on pet products)

Step 4:  You have some knowledge of Wordpress, HTML, basic CSS, social media and a fundamental understanding of SEO. Basic graphic design skills are a big plus, but not required.


Compensation:
As a bootstrapped startup we are looking for a person who is willing to take on this responsibility in exchange for equity (negotiable) rather than salary. Monetary compensation in addition to equity is absolutely possible once things progress, but for now we are doing this without outside investment and are therefore looking for someone who is interested in owning a piece of the business in exchange for their involvement.

If you are qualified and interested, let’s have a conversation- feel free to reach out to us via our [contact form](http://nerdywithchildren.com/contact) and we’ll connect."

First I am an electrical engineering student at an Ok university (University of Oklahoma). My main goal is to one day work for a tech company, such as Intel, IBM, Nvidia etc... I am confused on what I should do to get there though. 
My first question is what classes should I make my electives? I can choose from a variety of topics and will list some. There is different areas with classes under each:

Signals and Systems:
Digital Signal processing,
Random Signals ,
etc

Solid State:
IC Fabrication,
Solid State electronics, 
etc

Electronics and Optics:
Electronics,
Optical Engineering,
etc

Radar(I am not listing this since I assume it wouldn't apply)

Communications:
Wireless Comm,
Comm,
Comm theory,
etc

Controls:
Control Theory,
Linear Systems,
Etc

Power Systems: Analysis of Electrical Transmission, Analysis of Faulted Power System

Digital Systems: Computer Architecture, Computer hardware Design, VLSI, etc

Software: Basically any software course I wish to take.

Now I can't be specific about what it is I want to do, but I do know I love computers and so far have loved my classes. If you aren't sure what the classes would be for but know some key words I should look for that would be great.

Also for internships: I know(well assume) that big tech companies like Intel, Nvidia, Google etc are extremely hard to get an internship at. If I can't get one there is there anywhere else I could look that might help with experience?

As for the minor question. What is a good minor for my goals? I was thinking computer science would help.

For my last question: When I first started college I picked the wrong major(I graduated high school early and none of my family went to college) and I found myself miserable which led to poor grades. At the end of this semester I will be looking at an Overall GPA of 3.0-3.11. How does this fare for me to get internships? My major GPA is probably about 3.8 as my grades have gotten much better after I changed my major and found my passion for what I want to do. Is there any advice for what I can do to make myself look better? 

I appreciate any information you all give me, thank you in advance for the help!"

I have a few questions already about changes I have thought about making:
* I think I have pretty good internship experience, should I list that ahead of education? Or perhaps my skills summary first?
* Is my first sentence in my skills summary before my bullets just a waste of space?
* For my programming languages listed, what is a good way to differentiate between the ones I am highly proficient at versus the ones I am only relatively familiar with?
* I went to a highly recognizable high school in my state- should I keep that information there still?
* Can I list classes I am currently taking this semester under relevant coursework or what is a good way to show they are still in progress?
* Should I include knowledge of version control (Subversion and Git) under my skills section, or is that something employers assume you know or is not that important?

I'm pretty close to the end, but lately I've been feeling so down and disappointed and it's making me doubt what I want to do. 

For example, I did pretty badly on an exam today.  I studied thoroughly and did a lot of practice problems, and was pretty confident that I knew the material.  But after the exam I realized I made so many small mistakes here and there that probably cost me a good score. I'm so disappointed right now. 

In my next class today I was sitting there thinking about how terrible I feel for doing badly on the exam. Even though I do well overall, I've had a lot of these moments throughout my years in engineering, and it always causes me to feel terrible. And I asked myself, do you really want to do this? 

All of my internships have required walking into a cubicle every day for several hours, staring at a computer. I ask myself: Is that the end goal? Do I really want to feel terrible every time I do poorly on an exam, when the end goal is probably just sitting in a cubicle all day?

But on the other hand, for the most part, I DO do well. And for the most part, I really enjoy learning about engineering. But the times where I get stressed I just really wonder if the end is going to be worth it all. 

So I just wanted to hear, what keeps you going? What makes you want to be an engineer? "

My question is this: what are some things I can do with my free time now that will make me a better candidate for a full time position in the future?

From when I was a toddler until I was 12, I had the greatest confidence in the world. I was bullied from the ages of 12 - 18. I wrote a note that just said ""I want to die"" over two hundred times on a piece of paper on a bad day when I was 13 because the bullying was so bad. My parents found it and were very concerned. I always pretended I didn't care about the bullying but it really affected me. My confidence was down, and I couldn't talk to girls. I attended the #1 High School in America, and graduated with a 4.2. I barely tried in my Junior and Senior years of high school. However, knowing I was good at school and got great grades with little effort made me content with myself.

I don't know what's wrong with me. I think I might go get mental help. I'm in my second year in an in-state public university, one of the best in the nation. But I'm having a hard time in some of my classes. I switched majors to econ from biochemistry at the beginning of my second year, even though I had won awards for malaria research in high school and had worked at many prestigious cancer labs around the world until my first year of college. I just couldn't stand the boredom of being in the lab for so long, and the material wasn't interesting enough for me to stay in the major. Now I've switched majors, am hoping to get into commerce, but had my grade destroyed by the high level chem courses I took first year. The material in the econ major is interesting, but I'm not doing brilliantly at it. All I had going for me was my grades. And now I don't even have that. I have a 3.2 gpa, which means I might not find an internship, and might not find a job in this market.

I don't have a lot going for me. ""Friends"" are rude and use me. 3.2 gpa. Kinda fat (6 feet in height but 210 pounds). Absolutely no interaction with girls other than in a formal/ professional/ academic setting. Don't know where life is taking me. If I switch majors again my parents will wonder if I'm wasting their time and money. Only thing going for me is I'm in a lot of clubs and activities, and in leadership roles in those.

Lately I've had trouble finding motivation to do anything. I feel worthless. I feel like writing a note like I did when I was younger, but now making it more detailed and actually following through on killing myself. I'm a waste of space. I'm sitting in one of the uni's dining halls now, and even though it is packed I feel alone. I'm eating and studying by myself right now. I wonder how many people would actually miss me if I died. I'd much rather have a truck hit me or get shot by someone than have to kill myself. I know my family would miss me, but I've rarely shown them my suicidal tendencies. I think it would make more sense to my family if I was killed, and even though I would be gone at least they wouldn't have to wonder why I died.

In June 2012, I had to visit an urgent care center when I came down with a lung infection. I have insurance carried through my father, although he is estranged from the family and we have not been in communication for years (insuring his children with my biological mother was a stipulation of the divorce agreement). I never received a bill from the Urgent Care center or any statement.

Quite frankly, I forgot about it. I assumed insurance may have covered it in full, or the bill was a nominal amount that he covered for me out of kindness (Stupid move on my part, I know). Fast forward to this week, when I received a threatening message from a collections agency. Eventually, traced it back to the hospital visit. Apparently, the Urgent Care center billed my father (insurance holder) for $262 for the visit. He did not tell me about it, and also neglected to pay the bill. 

I immediately contacted the hospital today and arranged to have the bill paid in full this Friday. That clears up my debts with the hospital, but the bill was sent to collections... so what happens? what does that mean? Is my credit score negatively impacted? Does my situation warrant an explanation? I'm ignorant on what will happen next, so I was hoping to turn to r/personalfinance for some advice!"

So yesterday I was at the bus stop, after classes ready to go to my internship job. A cute ginger girl sits besides me. I immediately start to freak out inside my head, part of me gathering reasons to talk to her, part creating excuses to keep quiet on my spot, like I always did. 

Eventually I noticed the way she was sitting (countorcing her body in a way to avoid the hot 4pm sun), and thought ""I have to say this"". I did. She laughed. We exchange briefly where each one is heading, then her bus arrives and she runs. Now thinking about it, I obviously should have asked her number anyway, but at the moment I was so shocked I got to break from my staleness that I had no reaction.

So yeah, still a victory but a small one, with plenty of room to improve. I noticed today that I'm still afraid of STOPING girls, so that should be my next goal. Anyway, I should thank everyone that posts on this sub for the inspiration and knowledge. Keep going everyone."

I've wanted to be a programmer in the game development field for a long time.  I had attempted to learn C++ a few times before, but never really stuck with it. This time I have and I've made your standard Pong, Breakout and a Plants vs. Zombies type clone (with a friend) in C++ with SFML2.0.

What I'm looking for is someone in GameDev who could use an intern-ish coder.  I'm happy to work for/with someone for 20+ hours/week at no charge.  The only problem with me (as a perspective intern) is that my knowledge base is fairly small and I'm severely lacking experience, i.e I'm a bit of a noob.  I do however consider myself a fast learner and a relatively smart guy.

Instead of being paid, I would rather have access to someone who knows a decent amount about GameDev so I can ask questions and learn from them.  If I'm able to do it (skill wise), I'd like to help you on your project with anything I can, in exchange for a bit of your knowledge.  I may need a bit of guidance when working on something I've never done before, but you won't have to hold my hand if it's within my ability.

I also wouldn't mind maybe a couple hours a week watching you code on TeamViewer (screen share program)/Skype as I found doing that with a friend to be fun and full of chances to learn.

If you have any questions feel free to ask.  It may be too early for me to be trying to work with others, but I think there may be someone out there who could use someone like me, although it's a pretty niche situation.  General advice is also welcome!"
199ycd,45,2013-02-26,"Crosspost success story, referred by TwoX",[deleted],LadiesofScience,https://www.reddit.com/r/LadiesofScience/comments/199ycd/crosspost_success_story_referred_by_twox/,"After graduating in 2005 from a math-and-science-oriented residential high school, I started a baccalaureate program for chemical engineering.  Unfortunately I was unable to complete it due to my mother's drug problems.  Having been addicted to cocaine for my entire life, it was not unusual for her to go on weeks-long binges but I never expected for her to quite literally go missing.

After my mom had been AWOL for more than six months, as well as during tax/FAFSA renewal time, I was unable to get financial aid assistance for school and certainly couldn't pay for my private institution's tuition.  I completed two semesters and then was forced to leave school because of these financial and family hardships.

From that point, I worked constantly.  I usually held two jobs, occasionally three, to be able to support myself (albeit meagerly).  As it turned out, my mother had indeed been on a drug relapse but this time had delved into crack.  She spent a year and a half in a Tennessee jail and another eight months in a South Carolina jail, during which time we had no contact.  

For a few years it seemed like I would never be able to go back to school due to financial reasons.  Since my dad, who I first met when I was 11, refused to have anything to do with me and my grandparents were (and still are) supported by governmental assistance, I had exactly no family support during this time.  My only hope was to wait it  out until I turned 24 so as to be considered ""financially independent"" by the Department of Education before I could return to school.

I reached age 24 in December of 2010 and planned to resume undergraduate core classes at a two-year school the following spring semester.  Unfortunately, that plan was precluded by extremely coincidental tragedy.  In mid-January 2011 I flew to South Carolina to visit my grandparents who I hadn't seen in three years.  Since my mother had recently gotten out of jail and was living in the same town, I told my grandparents not to tell her I was coming to visit; I wanted as little drama as possible.  My mom had still not contacted me since her disappearance in 2005, and there was no way I could bite my tongue and act as if the last six years of working dead-end minimum wage jobs because of her irresponsibility had somehow not happened.

The day after I secretly arrived in my grandparents' hometown, my mother committed suicide in a crack-induced panic, the week before her 42nd birthday.  She did not know I was in town, of that much I am sure, but it was incredibly, almost fatefully, timed.  As I mentioned before, my grandparents live on Medicaid and Medicare, and my mother survived on disability welfare which does not cover death by suicide.  Having just received a tax refund, naturally I was the one responsible for putting her remains to rest.  I could not afford a funeral or a casket, but I was able to buy a small grave marker, have her cremated and the urn buried in a small plot.  As you can maybe imagine, this was an especially difficult time for me.

The loss of my mother further postponed my return to school and for a brief time caused me to have suicidal thoughts when I contemplated my seemingly perpetual pond-scum socioeconomic status.  However, I pushed myself out of the mire and got up the gumption to start school in the fall of 2011.  

Since then I have been taking more than full time courseloads each semester and have changed my focus to both physics and computer science.  I will complete my AS of computer science this May and will transfer to a university in the fall to finish my undergraduate degrees.  I have been doing extremely well in school and have become very ambitious, so much that I have been applying to dozens of ""longshot"" programs.  Among the ""longshots"" were the springtime Texas Aerospace Scholars program at Johnson Space Center, and a summer internship with the Department of ~~Education~~ Energy (blah, typos) at Fermi National Laboratory.  

My applications for both of those programs were accepted -- this means that I am able to submit my Mars rover concepts to NASA and (I'm shaking in excitement) I AM GOING TO WORK AT FERMILAB for the whole summer!  The US Department of Energy is going to PAY me to have job experience at one of the most prestigious labs in the world.

Despite having a ton of bad luck in the past, I feel like the luckiest girl in the world right now.  Even more than that, though, I feel the rewarding effects of tenacity, ambition, and dreams.  I'm sorry this was so long, but I felt the need to put my exuberance into perspective.  Thanks for reading!


**TL;DR**: Forced to quit college at age 19 because of mom's coke addiction; finally able to go back to school at 24 but further delayed due to mom's suicide; eventually went back to school and just found out I got both a NASA program spot and an internship at FermiLab.

199wj3,165,2013-02-26,[26/m] My [25/f] girlfriend of 6 years has a crushing amount of student loan debt.  ,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/199wj3/26m_my_25f_girlfriend_of_6_years_has_a_crushing/,"I'm 26/m, graduated from college and several years into my career.  I work in electrical engineering and make an decent salary, but far from amazing.  I've been dating my SO for 6 years, for the last two years super long distance across the country.  She's attending law school on the east coast, while I've been working in LA.  We see each other about once a month, when I fly out to visit.    

Between undergrad and law school (both at private universities), my girlfriend is looking to graduate with over $300,000 in student loan debt, most of which is at 6.8%, some parts as high as 10%.   I went to a community college and a state school, mostly on scholarships and working full time as an intern during my junior/senior years, graduating with savings instead of debt.  Everything I've read shows that the legal job market is collapsing; unemployment is skyrocketing and wages are plummeting.  Worst yet, she wants to go into family law, which is one of the worst hit markets.  Best case scenario she pays off her debt over 25 years, having sunk the price of an average home in LA into her education.  Starting salaries aren't great, and they don't get much better as you gain experience.

I'm kind of at a loss.  I don't want to see my girlfriend as a shackle of debt.  As I start to think about marriage, I worry that I'll never be able to afford a nice home if we're shouldering a $2500 monthly loan payment for the next 25 years.  

Every option I've considered seems like a horrible choice.  Do I stay with her, and keep our finances separate, dooming her to spend 50% of her income on loan payments? Do I stay with her and help her repay her loans, putting at risk potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars of my own money that can't simply be returned if the marriage ended less than spectacularly?  Do I leave the girlfriend that I love, that I've sunk 6 of my best years into?  Do I try to convince her to change course and go into something more lucrative that she may not love?

I don't want to feel selfish, but I can't help but feel like I could find a different woman who was a strong career earner like me, and enjoy an extremely high standard of living.  I love my girlfriend but I just feel like this isn't the life I wanted.  I know money isn't everything, but it certainly gives you freedom in this country; the power to make choices and not be railroaded into one option. I want to live in a nice house, raise a bunch of kids, send them to private school, drive a convertible, have a dog, the american dream you know?  I don't want to be living in a 1BR apartment and eating cheerios for the next 25 years.  I also don't want to end up single again when I'm past my prime.  "

Here's the run down. I've been working professionally in the Des Moines (Iowa) area for about a year now (3 years if you count my internship), and I would say I have medium to high job security. I graduated school here and love the town. My fiancee and I will be living together when she graduates college this Spring. My apartment lease is up June 1st, but I can also extend it on a month to month basis if I need to. She wants to rent a place, while I think buying is the better option. My reasoning:

-Another year of renting would be like dumping about $12k down the drain. 
-No one ever got rich or gained equity from renting
-I really don't want to move now, then move in a year when we get a house together
-The costs seem to be relatively similar for the two (of course houses are expensive to maintain but at least I'd be spending it on my own house)
-I'm 99.9% positive I want to stay in this town for a very long time. 

The ""rent versus buy"" calculator says that after 1.5 years, buying would be the better option, and since I plan on staying here, it seems like the better choice.

Any advice would be very much appreciated! Thanks.

**tldr; - Moving in with fiancee, don't know if I should rent or buy. Don't want to make a rash decision but don't want to waste money either**"

My question to you, fine Redditors, is what sort of information would make this a compelling educational experience for you? Please note that this is for the Public Library Association, and though I want to hear from you even if you don't work for a public library, keep in mind that's the framework I'm in.

If you're curious, I wouldn't be opposed to a co-presenter for this. I work as a public library manager and, at the ripe age of 26, am about 30 years younger than all of my peers. And about 20 years younger than those I supervise. A co-presenter would need to be in a similar situation, or perhaps be a seasoned staff member who has a much younger supervisor."

I used to read the newspaper in the morning growing up with the **real** vintage Cinnamon Toast Crunch. After all I was the Devourer of Books, consuming 500-page tomes in a single day!

The editorial page was one of my favorites once i realized most of the comics were syndicated garbage. (To be fair, editorial comics suck too.) I liked the page's attempt to represent a diversity of opinions on issues. But one thing bugged me: anything pertaining to racial or gender issues always featured a columnist with a black\* or female headshot. Nowadays, I can add Latino and a rare Asian—but they are still shiny Pokémon rare. Still awaiting word on participation from Indians, natives, and Antartica's Penguin Pope.

At first, I appreciated their inclusion as a way to balance out their minority status and the volume their opinion has in society. But over time, I realized all they offered was a minority's viewpoint: crucial, but not enough to be deemed arbiter of what is Right in complex issues. There is never a counterpoint ""majority"" viewpoint unlike other discussed issues, so I felt it was their responsibility to bring more objective journalism rather than advocating a personal viewpoint. 

But nope. It was always about the issues they faced—generally legitimate—but without any attempts to look at the other side of things. They purported to represent their entire race or gender, when it was obvious to anyone but the willfully ignorant minorities are not monolithic. 

*But the worst transgression for me* was that these columnists did not demonstrate expertise in these issues—they were **token quota-fillers**.

### 9pm, Editorial Board Office. ###

A new young *coloured* intern has been summoned. A chance to break into the hallowed halls of journalism and write an article! A chance to follow in the footsteps of his journalism idols, exposing corruption in the government and writing front pagers!

&gt; We need some racial commentary, but a white man can't do it because that's *racist*. Since your skin pigmentation is visibly darker, you can write the column, since that's so *not racist*. We'll just need to take a headshot to prove your innate competency in racial issues.

This phenomenon is pervasive throughout all mainstream media such as magazines and TV. I don't know where I'm going with this, but it just bugs me. What are your thoughts, r/TiA?

\* Ok, grey, because who prints the editorial page in color?"

I’m a 22 year old female. 6 weeks ago I decided to embark on a new weight loss journey. Stress from school and work really ruined my health. In the summer I had an internship in a different city and took 22 credits of engineering in the fall. I was pretty unhealthy and inactive, and gained a lot of weight. Since graduating, I decided I wanted to get healthy.I cut out white breads,pasta,rice, juice, cookies, pizza, crackers etc. I decided to do a lower carb, low calorie diet. I focus on lots of high protein foods, watch the fat, count calories, and eat many veggies a day.  I also drink over 8 glasses a day, take fish oils, vitamin d, multi, and vitamin b. I get at least 7 hours of sleep a night.

Having had previous success losing 40 pounds before, I know it’s not diet alone. The first week I did purely a diet. The second week I added in 60-80 minute walks 4 times. The third week, I added 4 days of cardio at the gym with 40 minutes-60 minutes. The fourth week I added a trainer twice a week along with my own 4 day individual 45 minute to an hour cardio sessions. I live in a college town and walk a lot on my days off.

That being said, I’m 6 weeks into eating healthier,  5 weeks into cardio, and 3 weeks into adding a trainer, and I just weighed myself and I gained 1.5 lbs in this time.  I’m 5’4” and 191.5 pounds, never been so heavy in my life. I usually allow myself one cheat meal a week on the weekends but try and not make it too crazy, I do drink on the weekends with my friends. But I am drinking a lot less and have gone from sedentary to active and changed my diet completely. But I just don’t understand why I’m not losing weight? Could it be muscle? Or maybe the fact I was on prednisone last week?  I really count my calories and watch what I eat, so I’m so distraught.

As the title says, I'm looking to rent a room (or a 1 bedroom/studio, if the price is right) beginning April 1 or March 15 at the earliest. I will be in town beginning on March 12 to look at places so if you're looking to fill a room, please let me know and possibly we can set up a time for me to come see it. Now I know how competitive or particular people can be in the process of finding a roommate so I wrote a little about me below:

I'm a 26 year old stand-up comedian and comedy writer originally from Chicago, IL. As a writer, I've written for ""Late Night with Jimmy Fallon"" in NYC and helped relaunch ""The Onion News Network"" in its new location in Chicago. Currently, I write remotely for a brand new interactive toy called ""Ubooly"". (Here's a commercial I wrote for that: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYj7trLBfh4.) As a stand-up comedian, I currently work with a lot of big comedians such as Joel McHale and Bo Burnham, who I regularly open for on tour. I'm always busy doing something in comedy so that's where most of my income comes from. I'm financially stable and more than willing to prove that by giving you first month's rent and security deposit immediately if we find I'm a good fit for your space.

I'm moving back to LA for staffing season to write for more television. I actually lived in LA (Burbank, to be specific) back in early 2011 for a few months when I was the script intern at ""Conan"" so I'm somewhat familiar with most areas of the city. 

My other hobbies include movies, reading, and basketball. I'm pretty low key but social when around good company. I'm usually never opposed to roommates having friends over as we're all adults and think we can do so without being assholes to one another. I'll also be out most nights doing shows or working late if I land another TV gig so you probably won't be a bother to me at all, anyways. 

As a roommate, I'm very clean and considerate of others. I've lived with my girlfriend and many roommates in the past few years so that demanded me to be sort of a clean-freak. Also, I graduated college back in 2010 so I'm far removed from the messy college dorm/frat house phase of my life. I do my dishes immediately after using them or else it haunts my brain until I do.

If you're interested in having me as a roommate, I'd love to discuss further. Let me know if there's anything else about the apartment I might need to know like if there are pets (I'm allergic to cats and EDIT: most dogs), how the neighborhood is, and/or details about yourself as a roommate etc. Also, pics of the place would be great too.

For more about me, you can visit my Facebook, Twitter, and/or at www.cjtoledano.com where most of my professional life is described in detail. Feel free to contact and ask me any questions by emailing me at cjtoledano@gmail.com. 

Thanks and looking forward to hearing from you!

I discovered porn in the form of playboy when I was very young (~12yo), and when my family got a computer I found my time divided between games and fapping. Never really had many friends which only strengthened these negative habits. After starting high school I was soon okay, I made a couple good friends, learned I play guitar with them, etc. Sophomore year I started dating my first girlfriend, but even with all the porn I had watched I was too nervous and had too much anxiety to make a move and have sex with her. She dumped me after 6 months and it hit me hard. I spiraled down into a pit of depression contained within me playing world of Warcraft and fapping several times a day. My grades were slipping, and soon enough I found my newest vice, weed. During this time I did find another girl to date, however any attempts at sex were shot down because she was scared/unsure/wanted to wait, who knows. It hardly bothered me though because all I would do was fap anyway. The fact that one girl out there recognized my existence and cared about me was great, but it didn't solve my problem. In fact it only worsened when I went to college. She was a year behind me, so while I was away we tried long distance, and I used to excuse that I didn't want to be that guy who cheated on his girl in order to justify my continued fapping. More time by myself in my dorm in the dark, smoking weed, playing WoW and fapping, sometimes fapping to WoW. She dumped me as well right before the summer, but halfway through the summer I met yet another girl who seemed like the real deal. For the next year and a half our relationship is great and I don't fap nearly as much, that is until she cheated on me almost a year ago. I fell back into depression where all I did was sit in my room and cry while begging her to give us another chance, but I wound up driving her farther away. I finally said enough is enough and stopped myself from caring the only way I knew how - numbing myself with weed and fapping. It never truly stops. I have hardly ever gone to class, and skate by with shitty grades by weaving intricate lies to hide who I really am. I have no social skills, I have trouble making eye contact, and unless I'm with the really close group of guy friends I have here at school, one would think I was mute. I had a good internship that I lost because i turned into a hermit and hardly ever when in. It has taken so much away from me. I turned 22 last week, and for whatever reason that event seemed to launch me into the process of facing my demons.

I'm graduating with a degree in Computer Science in May. I have 8 years of experience as a Linux Systems Administrator (Intern).

I only speak English (though I'm willing to learn another language), so I'm thinking (in order): The Netherlands, Germany, Great Britain, or Ireland. I'm also considering Israel or anywhere else willing to sponsor my work visa that I can get by with just English in the first ~6 months.

So far I've mostly just been using [leavethe.us](http://www.leavethe.us) to apply for ""linux"" jobs, which uses the Indeed.com API for multi-country searches. Many companies said I already needed a work Visa. And a lot of companies said they needed work sooner than 4 months from now.

Friends have suggested that I contact companies directly. How can I find a list of tech companies that employ linux admins for a given city? Is there any website or tool for this?

Are there any other tools/search engines that I should try? Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated!"

This year, I got into college for General Arts, was doing pretty well, was pretty confident this time. And you know what? NOPE.

I knew deep down in my heart I would get rejected again. Was it my grades? No, it was my ""Lack of film experience"" seriously? fucking seriously? THAT'S WHY I'M TRYING TO GET IN.

""Oh we don't need a portfolio from you, but you can submit one if you want."" That's what you guys said, ""WE DON'T NEED A PORTFOLIO"" But you know who got in? The kids who had the portfolio. 

Listen Film Program, not everyone who wants to be in film has had the opportunities to volunteer at production companies, or TV stations. I've TRIED to volunteer at those places only to have them not take my calls or emails.

Not everyone who wants to be in film has made short movies. Not everyone owns a camera, not everyone HAS THE FINANCIAL MEANS like myself. I don't have the money for ANY OF THAT CRAP. Does that mean my application is worthless? Does that mean my passion for film means NOTHING?

You know what they offered me? The Media Foundation Certificate. You know what that is? A 1 year program that ""Helps"" you get in for film. Yet...ITS STILL NOT A GUARANTEE you'll get in.

Figures. A sympathy prize. You know what that certificate means to me? It's like going in for a job at a corporation. You've graduated with decent grades in business, you've worked at a retail job for years to pay for school so you've had the work experience and yet they don't take you because you've never worked at a corporation before. Instead, they offer you a position as a janitor.

Honestly that's what I feel like they're doing to me.

You know what Film Program? Fine, you win. I'll take the course because I literally HAVE NO CHOICE.

You wanna know what else? I got a internship at a big FUCKING STUDIO this coming summer, and I'm writing a FUCKING BOOK. Will THAT BE ENOUGH FOR YOU GUYS? Is that enough EXPERIENCE?"

I know that this is a long shot but has anyone done any cost savings research on the Power systems and ""Process Polling""?




A little background.... I just started as a intern a few months back and my boss has assigned this task to me. I'm not really familiar with AIX environment yet and how you get licences charged.      




So we just got new Power7s, It's a 770. We are currently moving over older LPAR's from our old 595's over to the new 770's. My boss wants to see how much we would save if we implemented ""Processor Pooling"". We are only looking at DB2 and WebSphere. I know you have to look at the PVU count on the server then see how much that cost per server but I don't know where to start or anything.



I know this is a long shot but does anyone have any information they could send my way? It would be a life saver! 



If you need any more information (I know my deception was vague) I can provide more."

After graduating in 2005 from a math-and-science-oriented residential high school, I started a baccalaureate program for chemical engineering.  Unfortunately I was unable to complete it due to my mother's drug problems.  Having been addicted to cocaine for my entire life, it was not unusual for her to go on weeks-long binges but I never expected for her to quite literally go missing.

After my mom had been AWOL for more than six months, as well as during tax/FAFSA renewal time, I was unable to get financial aid assistance for school and certainly couldn't pay for my private institution's tuition.  I completed two semesters and then was forced to leave school because of these financial and family hardships.

From that point, I worked constantly.  I usually held two jobs, occasionally three, to be able to support myself (albeit meagerly).  As it turned out, my mother had indeed been on a drug relapse but this time had delved into crack.  She spent a year and a half in a Tennessee jail and another eight months in a South Carolina jail, during which time we had no contact.  

For a few years it seemed like I would never be able to go back to school due to financial reasons.  Since my dad, who I first met when I was 11, refused to have anything to do with me and my grandparents were (and still are) supported by governmental assistance, I had exactly no family support during this time.  My only hope was to wait it  out until I turned 24 so as to be considered ""financially independent"" by the Department of Education before I could return to school.

I reached age 24 in December of 2010 and planned to resume undergraduate core classes at a two-year school the following spring semester.  Unfortunately, that plan was precluded by extremely coincidental tragedy.  In mid-January 2011 I flew to South Carolina to visit my grandparents who I hadn't seen in three years.  Since my mother had recently gotten out of jail and was living in the same town, I told my grandparents not to tell her I was coming to visit; I wanted as little drama as possible.  My mom had still not contacted me since her disappearance in 2005, and there was no way I could bite my tongue and act as if the last six years of working dead-end minimum wage jobs because of her irresponsibility had somehow not happened.

The day after I secretly arrived in my grandparents' hometown, my mother committed suicide in a crack-induced panic, the week before her 42nd birthday.  She did not know I was in town, of that much I am sure, but it was incredibly, almost fatefully, timed.  As I mentioned before, my grandparents live on Medicaid and Medicare, and my mother survived on disability welfare which does not cover death by suicide.  Having just received a tax refund, naturally I was the one responsible for putting her remains to rest.  I could not afford a funeral or a casket, but I was able to buy a small grave marker, have her cremated and the urn buried in a small plot.  As you can maybe imagine, this was an especially difficult time for me.

The loss of my mother further postponed my return to school and for a brief time caused me to have suicidal thoughts when I contemplated my seemingly perpetual pond-scum socioeconomic status.  However, I pushed myself out of the mire and got up the gumption to start school in the fall of 2011.  

Since then I have been taking more than full time courseloads each semester and have changed my focus to both physics and computer science.  I will complete my AS of computer science this May and will transfer to a university in the fall to finish my undergraduate degrees.  I have been doing extremely well in school and have become very ambitious, so much that I have been applying to dozens of ""longshot"" programs.  Among the ""longshots"" were the springtime Texas Aerospace Scholars program at Johnson Space Center, and a summer internship with the Department of ~~Education~~ Energy (blah, typos) at Fermi National Laboratory.  

My applications for both of those programs were accepted -- this means that I am able to submit my Mars rover concepts to NASA and (I'm shaking in excitement) I AM GOING TO WORK AT FERMILAB for the whole summer!  The US Department of Energy is going to PAY me to have job experience at one of the most prestigious labs in the world.

Despite having a ton of bad luck in the past, I feel like the luckiest girl in the world right now.  Even more than that, though, I feel the rewarding effects of tenacity, ambition, and dreams.  I'm sorry this was so long, but I felt the need to put my exuberance into perspective.  Thanks for reading!


**TL;DR**: Forced to quit college at age 19 because of mom's coke addiction; finally able to go back to school at 24 but further delayed due to mom's suicide; eventually went back to school and just found out I got both a NASA program spot and an internship at FermiLab.

So I have a few questions:

1. What courses should I have under my belt before I should really start looking for an internship?

2. My first 2 years I slacked in my gen ed classes and therefore am sitting on a 2.67 GPA and combined with the fact I am not in a top 20 CS school (although top 100) how can I make up for the hinderence?

3. I just started diving into Ruby on Rails and find it quite fascinating. Would RoR side projects help my resume?

And last question and a little unrelated to internships,

4. I don't like C programming mainly because I don't like console applications, I'd rather create a website. Does programming get better than C?"

Recently, when I went to McDonald's I saw on the menu that you could have an order of 6, 9 or 12 Chicken McNuggets.

I asked for a half dozen nuggets.

'We don't have half dozen nuggets,' said the teenager at the counter.

'You don't?' I replied.

'We only have six, nine, or twelve,' was the reply.

'So I can't order a half dozen nuggets, but I can order six?'


'That's right.'

So I shook my head and ordered six McNuggets

I was checking out at the local Wal-Mart with just a few items and the lady behind me put her things on the belt close to mine. I picked up one of those 'dividers' that they keep by the cash register and placed it between our things so they wouldn't get mixed.

After the girl had scanned all of my items, she picked up the 'divider', looking it all over for the bar code so she could scan it.

Not finding the bar code, she said to me, 'Do you know how much this is?'

I said to her 'I've changed my mind; I don't think I'll buy that today.'

She said 'OK,' and I paid her for the things and left.

She had no clue to what had just happened.

'Hmmm, I don't know. Do you have an alarm, too?' I asked.

'No, just this remote thingy,' she answered, handing it and the car keys to me. As I took the key and manually unlocked the door, I replied, 'Why don't you drive over there and check about the batteries. It's a long walk....'

The question I have is on some advice on how to get hired by an industrial design firm as an engineer. I am a mechanical engineer in the process of applying for my first real job. While I am applying for the standard jobs mechanical engineers apply to, I am also looking at working as an engineer for a design company. I have always had a passion for design and creating things that people would be in constant interaction with, but I know that I am neither the most creative nor artistically gifted person, so I chose engineering as a ""safe"" major during school, but never really enjoyed it. I guess currently I am stuck with seeing that I might do something I don't care that much about for the rest of my life, so I am seeing if I can get into something I care about much more. 

A kind of job I would be really interested in is something like: http://www.coroflot.com/jobs/45203/Junior-Mechanical-Engineer

Some things going for me would be that I took all the CAD courses that were available to me, so I consider myself fairly competent at using the software that was used at school (SolidWorks). I also have a minor in Architecture, which I chose after taking some courses for a communication design minor. The school I went to had a much more stronger Architecture program which is why I switched, and also the courses seemed to deal much more with the interaction between the resultant product and the user, instead of focusing purely on aesthetics. Therefore I can say that I know a bit about the interaction process between designers when working on something together and have somewhat of a design education background. I had to learn quick as I was taking classes with senior/grad level students and had to discuss with the professor and students about my opinions on the finer details of architecture. I also have some experience from my engineering design courses and my Formula SAE team with designing something in CAD and handling the challenges of fabricating those designs into a physical model for use.

In a position where I would be working together with designers consulting and working on CAD models, I think I would do very well. I am a bit lost on how to show it however. I do not have experience with a company in terms of internships that would demonstrate my ability to do so. I do not consider myself having the strongest portfolio, as I just have my engineering CAD projects to show. However, I do think that if asked to work on or create something, I would not have difficulty making anything.

What do you guys think I can do to increase my chances of getting noticed and possibly hired?

Thank you very much."

* I haven't graduated college yet, so aside from an internship this will be my first job

* I don't have any other offers right now

* cost of living is %124 compared to the national average. SF is %160 from the same source

*  I don't have any significant qualifications for the job - I am confident in my general abilities and I think I interviewed well, but nothing that specifically matches the job/industry.

* The offer is 72k + insurance and 401k, sick and vacation time. The extras seem to be good.

* The company seems really great, definitely somewhere I want to work. The culture seems awesome, everyone was nice and the recruiting process went well.

So basically, from what I've read a counter-offer generally seems to be a good idea, 5 minutes for potentially a few thousand dollars is a no brainer right? I just don't feel like I have much to negotiate with, and the current offer is pretty good in my opinion. Also, I really don't want to risk them revoking the offer.

Technically, this isn’t my realization, this is the realization of some of my friends, but they’re absolutely right.  I don’t know when it happened, but somewhere, at some point, I was happier. I was a happy person, and now I’m angry. I treat those who are close to me like shit. I’m a straight up asshole, and I really need to atone for what I’ve done. I need to make right. I need to find ways to be more constructive. Two things are for sure: I need to write more often, and run without headphones. Writing, like I’m doing right now, always seems to alleviate some of the stress. It flows through the lungs that won’t stop going, into the fingertips, and out onto paper. Or, I suppose, the keyboard. Headphones are the bane of my run. They cheapen the experience. Every time I run without headphones, I am imbued with life, with the livelihood of the environment I am surrounded by. I live in a beautiful place, but to experience it to its fullest, I need to ensure that every sense is alert, including my hearing. I love running, but  There’s a third thing I need to fix; I’m on the computer too much. I’m not even doing homework. I need to stop procrastinating, and do things without a computer.

Why am I this way? I’d argue it’s lack of sleep, but it honestly makes me sleep less, so if it’s that, well, it’s cyclical. If I don’t sleep, I’m angry. If I’m angry, I don’t sleep. That sucks.

But, in addition to that, I’m lonely. When my friends told me the other day that I’ve been an asshole recently (they said it jokingly, but every joke has a kernel of truth), they theorized that it’s “because I need to get my dick wet.” As obnoxious, immature, and chauvinistic as that sounds, its true to an extent. The fact is, in high school, I had girlfriends, and I was happy enough. But, ever since twelfth grade, I’ve hardly tried. I definitely haven’t attempted even trying to go after a girl in at least a year. It has been 2 and a half years since I’ve even kissed a girl. And while I’ve done more than kiss, I never lost my virginity. As juvenile a complaint as that sounds, it’s getting to me. The only girl I’ve ever loved is happily in a relationship (and I’m happy FOR her), lost her virginity to the guy she dated in between him and me (a guy who was my friend, but a total asshat to her), and I almost feel like I’m behind somewhere here. I should be way ahead. College was supposed to be a blossoming period for me, girls were supposed to be crawling everywhere. A couple days ago, my housemate (who doesn’t know I’m a virgin) said to my roommate “yaknow, you either lose your virginity before your twenty one, or its not happening for awhile.” My 21st birthday is coming up (woooo), and I don’t think he realized how much that comment got to me. It really cut deep. But it’s not just the virginity thing.
I need a teammate. Someone who is on my side, who I can confide in. That’s how I’m lonely. I have friends, but I feel like I have very few friends who I can truly get personal with. And, perhaps because I spend so much time with my fraternity, I feel like I have no female friends, with the exception of a few girls from high school who I hardly talk to anymore. Honestly, there is a huge difference between girls and guys, and sometimes its nice to have close friends who are girls.

I’m also wasting my potential. I have no idea what I’m doing with my life. I want to write or teach, but I’m majoring in government, which I find fascinating enough, but I’m not engaging myself in my classes. I don’t have any special relationships with my professors (the one professor I thought I was going to ask to be my advisor, I found out tonight, can’t advise). I hardly do the work. My grades are extraordinarily lackluster (not terrible, but not what I want). I’m being pressured into applying for internships, something I’m not really trying to hard to do. I’m just not interested. The phrase “think tank” means nothing to me, and I don’t see how it will help me in my life to do this, but I feel like I’m wasting my summer if all I do is work at the movie theater again, while my peers are in DC doing fancy things with their lives. I’m really passionate about film and writing, but I don’t see anyway I can do anything about that because I’m so fucking behind. I don’t know how to make a movie, I don’t even own a camera, nor do I know how to use one. As for writing, I’m taking a class in playwriting, but I’m such a fucking procrastinator that every time something is due, I end up hastily writing it the night before, sacrificing sleep and quality, and my professor sends me back mark ups that are full of disappointment. 

I’m thinking, instead of an internship, I’ll keep the movie job. I need the money. But making 8 bucks an hour won’t do for a summer. I want to make a movie, buy a camera, final cut pro, etc., but I’m worried I don’t know anyone who will be willing to go along with my idea and star in the movie. And even if I did, I probably wouldn’t be able to energize them to help me out.

If not that, maybe I’ll go learn a foreign language at the school near my house. I need to increase my worldliness, and, on that note, I want to study abroad. However, I feel like I just want to study abroad for the sake of studying abroad. I don’t care where, or if its relevant to what I’m studying. I just want to go, but I might not even have good enough grades for that. 

Damn.

Sorry for the length of this. I couldn’t sleep and had to get these things off my chest, and there’s no one I feel I can tell most of them to.

199026,1,2013-02-26,Computer Engineering College Senior with Career Fair this week- Please help critique my resume!,doubledecker73,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/199026/computer_engineering_college_senior_with_career/,"My resume is located here: http://i.imgur.com/krdVqMB.png?1

Any critique you can give would be greatly appreciated!
I also have some questions already about changes I have thought about making:

* I think I have pretty good internship experience, should I list that ahead of education?  Or perhaps my skills summary first?
* Is my first sentence in my skills summary before my bullets just a waste of space?
* For my programming languages listed, what is a good way to differentiate between the ones I am highly proficient at versus the ones I am only relatively familiar with?
* I went to a highly recognizable high school in my state- should I keep that information there still? 
* Can I list classes I am currently taking this semester under relevant coursework or what is a good way to show they are still in progress?
* (EDIT) Should I include knowledge of version control (Subversion and Git) under my skills section, or is that something employers assume you know or is not that important?

Thanks so much for the help!  This resume has landed me a few interviews already but I feel like it still needs some fine tuning and tweaking.  Thanks!

I'm applying to my first CS internship, and I'm a bit nervous, considering that I have a mediocre GPA and I'm still blooming as a programmer (i.e., I only have experience with HTML, Python, and C++).

My question is pretty simple. I have a LOT of experience outside the classroom. For example, I served as the vice-president of the student government. Or last summer I did an internship where I worked with juvenile delinquents in a restorative justice program. 

Basically, to those of you who have hiring experience, are these sorts of things something you'd want to see in a resume or hear about in an interview? Or do you just want to see a kick-ass GPA and a ridiculous amount of programming experience . . . neither of which I have. 

Thank you for any answers and for reading this!

198wzh,1,2013-02-26,"Website with sloppy coding dropped in my lap, any suggestions?",Mike312,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/198wzh/website_with_sloppy_coding_dropped_in_my_lap_any/,"I've been working with this client for a little while now, it started out as a quick fix to their style sheets and some HTML updates.  Then they mentioned that they fired their web developer because of incompetence and over time the project basically balled into me rebuilding their website from scratch.  They've actually been really great clients, not even mad at them.

The developer they fired though...that's the issue here.  When they assembled the database they apparently didn't enable auto-increment for their table keys.  So I've got a bunch of tables that look like:

tag_id  |  user_id  |  tag_text

0         |  1234     | Blah blah blah

0         |  1234     | Blah blah blah

0         |  1237     | Blah blah blah

0         |  1237     | Blah blah blah

0         |  1238     | Blah blah blah


I'm sure that was 'fine' when the site was created, but as time has gone on a bunch of things (there's several tables with this same pattern going on) have remained, even though the users they referenced have long since disappeared.  So now the tables are left with tons of empty tags, categories, links, pictures, etc. that were never deleted when the user was removed.  For example, if I were to query uh... ""Sandwich Restaurants"", it shows up as a viable autocomplete option to search for because the tag exists, but upon running the search there's no users that match the query.

What command could I run that would select these ones that no longer exist?  I'm thinking something like:

""DELETE FROM tags INNER JOIN users ON tags.user_id = users.user_id WHERE users.user_id != tags.user_id""

But I'm like, 99% sure that will either error out and not run the query, or if it does run it would clear my whole table out.

And secondly, what could I do to re-populate the table keys with ids, because I'd like to give my client the ability to add/remove things based on the tag_id rather than searching the table for user_id and tag_text to delete lines (it just feels...sloppy).

As much as I don't want to do it, the only option I can think of for that is running something to select every row in the table (now approaching 25,000) and then manually UPDATE.  Like:

""SELECT user_id, tag_text FROM users WHERE tag_id = 0 LIMIT 1""

and then use the user_id and tag_text to do:

""UPDATE users SET tag_id = $counterVariable WHERE user_id = $user_id AND tag_text = $tag_text""

And just set it to loop like a billion times.

This just feels so janky, but it's better than sitting my intern down, giving her a venti coffee, and wishing her good luck for the rest of the week.

So any suggestions?

---------

EDIT: No, this is not on a live site, I've got a testing environment with a ~1 month old copy of the database I've been developing around.  I'm not that crazy.  Whatever ends up working I'm going to run once or twice on more up-to-date copies of the DB just to make sure there's no errors.  I'm just glad the tables with 45k + rows do end up having IDs.  It's mostly the ones tracking the users information; the 'current' (according to my DB) is around 1200 current users, but there's 2600 users worth of information floating around in this thing, hence why I really want to clean this thing up.  I've already got the website page load time from ~1.2s/page to 400ms/page, but my goal is low 300ms.  That and the business wants to grow (don't they all) and thus want the server to be able to handle two-to-three times the current volume of visitors.

EDIT 2: Also, I had one idea come to me as I was passing out last night; add a column, we'll call it ""active"", and then ""UPDATE users SET users.active = 1 INNER JOIN tags ON users.user_id = tags.user_id"" or some such nonsense...but basically, ideally that would give me a binary to say ""hey, this tag has an active user, this one doesn't"" and then just go through and ""DELETE from users WHERE active = 0"" and hopefully that'll clear out my blank rows...but I've gotta mess around with it more."

Unfortunately I was unable to complete it due to my mother's drug problems.  Having been addicted to cocaine for my entire life, it was not unusual for her to go on weeks-long binges but I never expected for her to quite literally go missing.

After my mom had been AWOL for more than six months, as well as during tax/FAFSA renewal time, I was unable to get financial aid assistance for school and certainly couldn't pay for my private institution's tuition.  I completed two semesters and then was forced to leave school because of these financial and family hardships.

From that point, I worked constantly.  I usually held two jobs, occasionally three, to be able to support myself (albeit meagerly).  As it turned out, my mother had indeed been on a drug relapse but this time had delved into crack.  She spent a year and a half in a Tennessee jail and another eight months in a South Carolina jail, during which time we had no contact.  

For a few years it seemed like I would never be able to go back to school due to financial reasons.  Since my dad, who I first met when I was 11, refused to have anything to do with me and my grandparents were (and still are) supported by governmental assistance, I had exactly no family support during this time.  My only hope was to wait it  out until I turned 24 so as to be considered ""financially independent"" by the Department of Education before I could return to school.

I reached age 24 in December of 2010 and planned to resume undergraduate core classes at a two-year school the following spring semester.  Unfortunately, that plan was precluded by extremely coincidental tragedy.  In mid-January 2011 I flew to South Carolina to visit my grandparents who I hadn't seen in three years.  Since my mother had recently gotten out of jail and was living in the same town, I told my grandparents not to tell her I was coming to visit; I wanted as little drama as possible.  My mom had still not contacted me since her disappearance in 2005, and there was no way I could bite my tongue and act as if the last six years of working dead-end minimum wage jobs because of her irresponsibility had somehow not happened.

The day after I secretly arrived in my grandparents' hometown, my mother committed suicide in a crack-induced panic, the week before her 42nd birthday.  She did not know I was in town, of that much I am sure, but it was incredibly, almost fatefully, timed.  As I mentioned before, my grandparents live on Medicaid and Medicare, and my mother survived on disability welfare which does not cover death by suicide.  Having just received a tax refund, naturally I was the one responsible for putting her remains to rest.  I could not afford a funeral or a casket, but I was able to buy a small grave marker, have her cremated and the urn buried in a small plot.  As you can maybe imagine, this was an especially difficult time for me.

The loss of my mother further postponed my return to school and for a brief time caused me to have suicidal thoughts when I contemplated my seemingly perpetual pond-scum socioeconomic status.  However, I pushed myself out of the mire and got up the gumption to start school in the fall of 2011.  

Since then I have been taking more than full time courseloads each semester and have changed my focus to both physics and computer science.  I will complete my AS of computer science this May and will transfer to a university in the fall to finish my undergraduate degrees.  I have been doing extremely well in school and have become very ambitious, so much that I have been applying to dozens of ""longshot"" programs.  Among the ""longshots"" were the springtime Texas Aerospace Scholars program at Johnson Space Center, and a summer internship with the Department of Education at Fermi National Laboratory.  

My applications for both of those programs were accepted -- this means that I am able to submit my Mars rover concepts to NASA and (I'm shaking in excitement) I AM GOING TO WORK AT FERMILAB for the whole summer!  The US Department of Energy is going to PAY me to have job experience at one of the most prestigious labs in the world.

Despite having a ton of bad luck in the past, I feel like the luckiest girl in the world right now.  Even more than that, though, I feel the rewarding effects of tenacity, ambition, and dreams.  I'm sorry this was so long, but I felt the need to put my exuberance into perspective.  Thanks for reading!


**TL;DR**: Forced to quit college at age 19 because of mom's coke addiction; finally able to go back to school at 24 but further delayed due to mom's suicide; eventually went back to school and just found out I got both a NASA program spot and an internship at FermiLab.

I'm currently in my third year of college, planning to graduate early in December. I'm double-majoring and constantly working unpaid internships. A higher power has blessed me with my parents, who support everything I do in the interest of my future career.

Anyway - I have about 500 dollars to my name. My parents pay my bills to live and eat. Sometimes I save the excess money they give me for food.

So here's my question: what can I be doing with my money? ...is there money magic? How can I make interest on my meager amount?

Any general life suggestions? All I can ever think about is how I have no money and how I'm not earning any money. I love my parents and am starting to feel guilty.

Thanks for any help!"

Don't want to say I'm ""over-weight"" but I feel there is definitely room for improvement!

I want to feel good again; mentally, emotionally, and most importantly, physically. I want to be able to walk with confidence in a city where looks mean a lot. I'm not dissing my body, I love my curves, and my boobs especially. I just need a pick me up; a new challenge to get me going. I want to surprise everyone when I come back from my internship with how much I've changed. 

I plan to start with cardio every day in the form of walking and running then slowly move up to lifting (scary thought for me). I have signed up for a yoga class for mental and I guess physical focus (thanks groupon!) As for diet, I eat pretty well (lots of chicken and veggies), however the main items I will be cutting out are carbs (more specifically bread and pasta, 2 of my main staples), diet soda (my guilty pleasure), and hot chocolate. 

Wish me luck, as well as every one else who enters. Here's to bettering our lives and ourselves!"
198c55,5,2013-02-25,How do I get involved with conservation in developing countries?,[deleted],conservation,https://www.reddit.com/r/conservation/comments/198c55/how_do_i_get_involved_with_conservation_in/,"Warning: Wall of text! Sorry! :(

I am graduating with a degree in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology in May from an American university and plan on taking a gap year to work and gain some experience. I plan on getting a Master's degree at a European University (perhaps through an Erasmus Mundus program) after that, as I am an EU citizen. Before I went to university in the United States, I grew up in Nigeria, from the age of 8 months to 18 years (this is relevant).

I’m very interested in the intersection of conservation science and society in developing countries. I’m fascinated by situations where conservation cannot be efficiently, correctly, or even morally implemented by NGOs or other organizations who come in from the “outside” in an effort to “fix” or “save” an ecosystem or community at the expense of a human population. My growing up in Nigeria has given me a unique perspective and, the more I think about it, the more I see my life taking me back to Africa in some way as a bridge between conservation science and implementation, and between conservationists and local, marginalized groups. My interest in urban ecology would be fulfilled in Africa, too, as cities continue to grow at unprecedented rates and as conservationists begin to implement schemes beyond protected areas. I firmly believe that this can be done in a non-imperialist (""pro-poor"") fashion that empowers developing countries and does not occur at any other country's ""expense.

My only problem is, how do I go about this? My ignorance exists at several levels. I began by reading textbook “Conservation Biology for All,” edited by Navjot S. Sodhi and Paul Ehrlich and now I am working my way through all the papers they reference in the sections of interest. However, any other sources are appreciated! Are there any books/articles you recommend I follow up on, any people you recommend I contact? 

In addition, is there any way I can begin to take action? So far, I have looked at opportunities with WWF and Rare, but they either offer unpaid internships or high-ranking jobs (regional managers and such). I’m excited to get started on something ASAP (i.e. gap year, if possible) and I really need more creative ideas. 

Thank you very much for taking the time to read this long post! Cheers, /r/conservation!

198a1v,1,2013-02-25,My crappy friend and my own darkening depression.,Bristol_Larkin,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/198a1v/my_crappy_friend_and_my_own_darkening_depression/,"I'm going to preface by saying that I haven't exactly planned out exactly what I'm going to say, so I'm sorry if I ramble. I will try and edit along the way to make this as understandable and readable as possible, but you have my apologies if I don't fully succeed in doing so. It will also probably be long. I wouldn't be surprised, I always find more to say.

I was considering writing this in a journal or word document, because mostly I'm looking for the catharsis of writing it down, but I figured OffMyChest would be a good place to go due to the possibility of feedback and creating a dialogue. I'm not really expecting any, but I think that allowing the possibility of it is better than no response at all. 

So, with all that out of the way, I'll get to the meat of everything.

I have a friend, and I use that term loosely, and I haven't spoken to him in over a year. Sometime I like some statuses on Facebook, but that's about it. I'm not entirely sure why I just didn't defriend him after we fell out, maybe because I didn't want to be the side that fully wrote off the other side, but I'm not entirely sure.

The rest of this will make sense if I explain exactly why we fell out. I've known this guy for about four or five years since taking a year off college. I moved back in with my parents in southern Delaware and got a retail job nearby. This guy probably wasn't someone I'd normally associate with, but people in my age group (I was 19 at the time) that had roughly the same interests as me was pretty hard to come guy. Southern Delaware is predominantly older and with middle aged couples with kids. We formed a pretty fast and close friendship. Cut to about 3 years later, I was taking the long route through college at the University of Pittsburgh with internships. Electrical Engineering isn't exactly a cake walk to begin with anyway.

Anyway, taking a longer time to get through school, a lot of friends had begun to move away and I was getting a little depressed. My fiancee had moved in after getting a job as a teacher in the area, and that was awesome, but it's still upsetting to have a steady stream of friends move away. At any rate, this friend of mine I had made in Delaware was looking to move to Pittsburgh to start college. He had gotten tired of the retail life and southern Delaware. We had a two bedroom apartment, and he asked if he could move in with us for a year to get his name on the lease and start working towards in state residency to get in state rates and in the meantime, do community college.

My fiancee and I made a pros and cons list as we heard bad things about letting friends be roommates. Our list was basically break even, with biggest con being we'd lose our own place and privacy, which we were enjoying. On the pro, the help with rent would allow us to contribute more to our wedding, which my in-laws said they would cover, despite struggling financially. At first we said no but tried to convince him to move out to Pittsburgh and find his own place.

Looking back on it, he basically guilted us into it by saying the school year was starting soon and he didn't have time to find a place. I, in my infinite wisdom thought, well, with all my friends moving away, it would be nice to have a friend move here. We would beat the odds by making a roommate agreement. He and his girlfriend were moving into our place so they'd have to play by our rules. Through the year, as far being good roommates and doing what was expected, there were no issues. In fact, things were going well. And it was around this time that I was debating back and forth between my cousin or this guy being my best man. It was a real dead heat. My cousin lived no where close, and this guy was living in the apartment with me! He'd be seeing the current status of my relationship and we'd be able to do buddy-buddy things, so he became my best man.

As the year progressed however, his true colors really came out. He moved his girlfriend away from her home in Maryland to Pittsburgh, away from her friends, and then left her after 4 months because she became depressed from being so quickly and suddenly removed from her safety net, friends, family, job, and the place she had lived all her life. He would condescend my fiancee and bury me with backhanded compliments. We came to head many many times, but always seemed to fix things. Looking back on it, he charmed and manipulated me into fixing things. He's a Grade A salesman. If there is any one thing he is good at, it is being a pitchman. I'll also give credit to say he's a phenomenal musician and lyricist, but it ends there.

So anyway, things finally blew up when I realized he had failed at every duty I needed him to do as a best man, and every time, my cousin would swoop in to save the day. He'd complain about money or scheduling, but it was just always a result of poor planning. And every time, my cousin would save the day. When my cousin finally managed to pull out a last minute bachelor party with only a week, maybe two, of planning it became pretty apparent who my best man needed to be, and I did just that. This guy got pretty pissed, and we had a very long and angry grudge match before I finally said ""you know what. Fuck you, this is my wedding.""

That might seem somewhat petty, but the real under lying feeling to this is that we opened our home to him. In return, he couldn't get his act together to be my best man. I certainly made my own missteps and mistakes with him along the way, I can not claim to be 100% innocent. However, the fact that in return for us allowing him to move in he could not be responsible for the duties of being best man hurt, and really came across to me as sense on not caring and to an extent, betrayal.

Now, this is far from over and I realize this has already very long. Longer than I intended, but that background was necessary. If you've stuck around this long, you're a pretty amazing person. If you stick around till the end, you're probably a saint.

So, we will cut forward to present. This guy who I watched for a year burn everyone around him, his ex, his co-workers, his roommates and new friends he made in Pittsburgh and simply got 'tired of' has suddenly found himself with a life that someone who has been so shitty to everyone doesn't deserve, and confuses the ever living fuck out of me. I'm entirely aware I'm going to come off bitter here, and I will address it shortly. So, anyway, this guy has become engaged to a very, very smart and successful electrical engineer from the number one engineer school in the country and now working on their PhD in Pittsburgh. And this guy has found himself to soon be a father. And I'm just sitting wondering how, in a world that is supposed to balance itself out, something like this could happen. I know he had a really crummy life growing up, but this woman just seems to so far out of his or anyone's league, and I just don't *get* it.

So, I know this makes me sound bitter, and part of it is because I'm projecting myself into this. He is living the life that I worked hard to achieve and have somehow missed it, and all he's ever really done is be an ass, yet he's traveling around to exciting places and meeting new people. I have always tried to do the right thing. I'm certainly no saint, I've stepped on a few toes, and there are some things I wish I could go back and redo, but I don't think I've ever deliberately gone out of my way to screw people over or put myself first just to get ahead. 

Strangely, I want to be happy for him, and hope he has changed, but at the same time, I feel like he is some continuing to burn by getting what I had wanted. At the same time, I'm also legitimately afraid that he will just get tired of her at some point and burn her, and then leave her with a kid and become an absent father. I actually don't want that to happen, but I'm afraid it could. At the same time, I feel like if it did, then he wouldn't be living the life I worked for and all would be even and square again. Thinking that though makes me feel like a real jerk and I know that it is wrong. A kid's life is now concerned and that's what more important than me feeling cheated.

Currently, my wife is getting her PhD in Philadelphia, so we moved from Pittsburgh. It is a 7 year program and she is one year in. I supported this decision and will continue to do so as I would never do anything to compromise her ambition and dreams, but I **hate** it here. I miss the ever loving fuck out of Pittsburgh. I have friends that moved back to the area and made friends in my last year of school that are still there. Where I'm at now, I just haven't really met people that I feel I can connect with. I live just beyond the suburbs of Philly, my wife takes a train into Philly and I drive to my work outside of Reading. I'm into electronics, video games, Doctor Who, European tabletop gaming and weight lifting and the majority of the people I've met are into hunting, working on their cars and the like. I'm a Grade A nerd stereotype who is most at home with other nerds and the people that I've so far met around me are decidedly not.

Compounding the problem is my job. When I first started, I had lots of varied and interesting work. I was actively making use of my electrical engineering degree, to the extent I was still consulting my text book and notes. It was challenging and exciting, and I was able to do some domestic traveling. Unfortunately, they have an overly complex management systems which keeps the company's cost extremely high and they are currently non competitive in the power market, which is where my interests lie. Lots of jobs have been pulled and they are losing lots of bids and it is a day to day struggle to have enough work and I've become quickly disenchanted with the work I do have. My interests lie in relay coordination, grid communications, power storage and power generation. The work I have is none of the above, it is not engaging and is not satisfying. I'm not looking to change the world, but I would like to have work that gets me out from behind a desk, away from the cubicle farm and makes a difference.

I wish I could say I was looking, but I am on the graduate development leadership team and have made my commitment to that. That position ends in June, and then I will probably begin to look. Being in this leadership position offers me the opportunity to go to senior management meetings, though I myself am not, and hear their business development plans. It legitimately sounds very interesting what they are trying to bring in, and I'm almost tempted to stay, but I don't think they are structured effectively to be competitive to do so, and they don't market themselves well enough to be visible to this new work.

The past few months with work near zero has made me considering going back to school. With my wife already in a PhD program, I have no idea how we'd afford if I return to school. We signed a two year lease to keep rent locked at its current rate. I know I want to get my masters, but I go back and forth if I want to get my PhD. I'm really interested in smart grid technologies and grid power storage, but most of this is still in research, and I'm not interested in a life in academia, I'm interested in design, application and instrumentation. Basically, I want to have my cake and eat it, too. I don't know what to do about that. Also, with my wife in her PhD, I'm limited to the schools I can apply to. I don't really think I can ask her to try and do a long distance marriage just become I feel bad. Furthermore, I think I'd fall apart without her. She's my absolute best friend.

Meanwhile, I see this guy who has always been an ass living the life I hoped I was going to have while I tried to always do things the right way. I've taken my risks, and they haven't panned out the way I hoped they would.

So, that's my wrap up. Sorry it ended up being so anti-climactic. If felt really good to get this all out there. Also, my apologies for this being so long, and any edits or typos I may have missed. I think it at least flows and is understandable. If you made it this far, you're pretty fucking cool, and if you leave something to say, then you're a better person than I could probably ever hope to be.

Edit 1: Found some typos and fixed them. Sorry

Edit 2: Also, I know you're not supposed to compare your life to someone's Facebook highlights. I certainly have my own hobbies and accomplishments, but given the past history, it just really irks me for some reason."

We've been dating for a little less than a year, and things have been going well. We are on the same page about nearly everything, sex life is great, no serious arguments, etc. Personality-wise, I feel like he's my other half. I've never felt more comfortable with anyone else as I do with him.


When I first met him, he had been in college for five years and not had a resume. I had to give him my resume format so he could have one. He filled it with three pages of pointless fluff like ""worked as a movie extra"" ""worked on the set of this TV show"" ""worked at a bakery in Korea"" etc. when his major and the jobs he's applying for has nothing to do with baking or television. I told him it was common knowledge that a resume should be a page long and should contain only relevant experiences, but we actually had an argument over this because he wanted to keep his irrelevant work experiences since they were ""cool"". He's not active in any sort of school organizations and has worked as a bus boy for more than 6 years instead of looking for relevant work experiences because he it's easy and he ""gets paid to eat"". I had several arguments with him over this because I was so frustrated that he had spent his college career doing nothing that would have helped better his future. As a fifth year college student he didn't even know that three pages for a resume is too long by any standard. Now he's starting to get nervous and is looking for jobs but has not heard back from any about a job offer. I'm waiting on him to sign a lease because he wants to move to the same city as me and get a job here. However, I feel like we have different goals for the future. For me, I want to be successful in my career and have been working hard since starting college to secure internships and relevant work experiences to help me in the future. He hasn't taken much initiative to market himself as a qualified candidate for jobs that he's interested in.



I told him before that if our positions were reversed, I couldn't reciprocate what he's doing to be with me (moving to the same city and getting a job here). But he is still keen on moving to the same city as me to be with me. I don't think this is fair to him so I've been seriously considering breaking up (which we have done so in the past for a few days, but got back together). He thinks that it's stupid to break up when we have no serious disagreements or irreconcilable differences. I just have this feeling that while I have a great time being with him, and I do love him, our differences will eventually become too apparent and it wouldn't work out.



Is this a justifiable reason to end a relationship? I've told him in the past that I felt that in a relationship, both parties should help motivate each other. With our relationship, I feel like I'm the one who feels like I have to keep pushing him forward. I thought that dating someone several years older than me would mean dating someone who was mature and could be someone I could look up to, to have a shoulder to lean on.



I told my friend about my feelings and he told me that as someone who comes from an Asian background, we're ""hardwired"" to be more concerned about jobs and our future, and white people are more laid back. However, I know plenty of white people who are doing internships and job fairs! I'm not trying to secure a future so I can have money and status (which he has accused me of...saying that I am just looking for someone who is successful/rich). I'm genuinely passionate about my area of study (which does not guarantee a high salary at all) and I want a significant other who has passion and drive as well.




Right now, I feel like I'm at a crossroad. I really care about him and I love being with him. I don't think I'll ever find anyone more compatible or similar to me. However, it's difficult to see us working out in the long run. I just don't know what I should do right now. This is my first serious relationship so I'm a bit clueless and may have been a little incoherent with what I wrote. Sorry about that, and thank you for your help in advance.



tl;dr: I feel like my bf and I are on completely different pages when it comes to our future and goals in life. Should I/is this a justifiable reason to break up?

19cvme,1,2013-02-27,"Another unemployed, depressed artist.",[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/19cvme/another_unemployed_depressed_artist/,"I’m really, infinitely sorry for posting this, but I’ve been reading other people’s problems and frustrations and everyone seems to feel better, even if just a little bit, after posting, and I just want to not feel like I’m going crazy anymore. I’m afraid of posting this because, on another internet forum of which I am a member, I asked for related advice and was attacked. I am ashamed to say I am a person who gets offended at words on the internet, and I know how dumb I am. Am I stupid for saying that? 
Ok onto the bullshit: 

Graduated in ’07 with a BFA, wanted to make video games more than anything else in the world. 
I knew it would be hard to get a job, and I didn’t even really believe in myself skill-wise, but I thought I could do it if I just worked as hard as I possibly could. 
School was too expensive, couldn’t seem to get any grants or scholarships, so I had to attend a community college my first year, but it was ok! I was filled with so much hope, and I worked very hard with my studies, got top grades in all of my classes, all while drawing like crazy on the side.
Finally got to art school, signed my name onto $80k worth of private loans, but repeating in my mind what my admissions advisor said to me: “You are guarenteed a job!”  I was an 18 year old kid with no concept of money: no one in my family went to college, parents didn’t want me to get a “useless” art degree anyway, blah blah blah I know I’m a fucking idiot for signing my name on that line but its in the past and I can’t change it. 
Couldn’t afford to not have a full-time job to pay for rent, food, gas, very little else. Lived off of ramen and got pretty ill after a while because of it, funny story related to this tidbit I will tell at a later time. 
Due to working a 35-40 hour a week job, my homework suffered a little. I could have been much worse with it, but because of my dedication I always received A+ grades, I just knew in my heart that I could have definitely done a lot better if I only had more time to try. One example of this is when I started to learn 3d: the place I worked was shutting down and so I spent more freetime than I wanted on finding something else, including going to my career services and asking for an internship but being denied because… nope, I don’t have any idea. I think the woman there just didn’t like me, I know it sounds like a bullshit excuse but I have no idea why a persistant, capable student was denied an internship. Maybe I just came off as a shithead and she didn’t want to waste anyone’s time, who knows. 
Anyway, I was better than most of my peers at 3d, but I definitely wasn’t the best, unlike my 2d skills where I was easily the best if not one of the best in all of my classes. (Not bragging or trying to sound confident here, there were/are a lot of people who go to “Video Game School” who have never drawn in their life, and since I started at 14 I had a bit of a head start)

I got better and better, and to date I’d say I’m a good artist (not great, excellent, amazing, etc.) and with fresh degree in hand, I landed an interview. 
It actually went amazingly well, but I did not get the job. I think I failed the art test because it was in 3d and not 2d where I am most strong, and there must have simply been a stronger candidate. 
Had to move home due to lack of funding (quit my job the last four months of school to focus on portfolio work) and back in with my mom in Indiana. 
Depression set in halfway through my BFA, and I hesitated to type this because I can still hear my mother saying “Depression isn’t a real illness” in the back of my mind, but it’s definitely real and it’s so, so awful. My relationships were strained, and luckily that was the only thing that suffered while in college, but after I got out and failed at getting the job I had worked so hard for, it took away everything. 
Because of strained relationships in college, I have limited contacts. In this industry I have heard a million times that it’s not about how good you are, but who you know. Fucked myself over pretty big I guess. 
I finally got a job doing something administrative, just to pay the bills. 
Sallie Mae calls and informs me of my impending $1100/month student loan payments. My job at the time paid around minimum wage, I made about $1000 a month. 
Keep applying, but notice that drawing becomes more and more difficult. 
Some life drama happens including all friends from college dropping off the face of the earth, my 14 year old dog died, a sinus infection with no health insurance, bf becomes distant, some other things too etc. 
Stop drawing altogether. 


2009: Move to Oregon with $1000 in my pocket, get an admin job, start drawing again. 
Admin job is at a call center, “hostile work environment”, too exhausted to work at night, but am able to create some things. 
Had my boyfriend of ten years fuck me over, long story short: I was working to support the both of us while he found a job in his industry of study, he was supposed to do the same for me. Once he landed a job (after 2.5 years of virtual unemployment) I quit my job to take a risky position as an artist at a start-up company. He couldn’t support us because he was shitty with money, we end up breaking up after he tells me he hasn’t loved me for years anyway. The start-up company tells me not to come back via email due to lack of work on their end. 
Extreme depression. 
Crawl back to my call center job after a month of desperately seeking employment. 

Start to feel myself again slowly but surely. 
An internet guy I was extremely close to in college (but the ex hated that I talked to) comes back into my life. He tells me he believes in me, and gets me to believe again, too. 
I start creating more. 
Internet guy visits and eventually moves here to upgrade into boyfriend status. We are finally happy! 
With something in my life going correctly, I start becoming more and more productive. 
Do some 3d freelance on the side, it exhausts me working so much, and 3d is infinitely frustrating since I’m not great at it, but I feel I am finally using my degree! One of my clients is a small company that sells ideas to Adidas. Most of my projects involve Adidas things, so when I later saw Adidas hiring an on-site, 3d Artist, I put together my portfolio and applied. Denial email less than 24 hours later. Accept that I must be just “passable” at 3d and definitely not “good” but I should simply work harder if I want to be employed doing it. 
Stop doing freelance after this setback, but started doing projects that involve 2d things I enjoy much more.  

Left crappy, emotionally manipulative call center job for a much more relaxing, higher paying job. Take on crazy projects. 
Currently: 
- indie game project where I am the only artist, it’s slow and challenging work but I am learning so much and will be delighted to complete!
-illustrating a children’s book
-getting ready to release my webcomic

Find out last month that my new job is not going to hire me on full time as I intially thought, and instead they’re letting me go in July all due to budget constraints.
Was planning on relocating to Seattle due to less saturation in creative industries there. Overall more job opportunities, too. 
Not enough funds to move. 
Start looking for some kind of art job that I can apply to right now, something that I could definitely get hired for, but find nothing. 
Start looking for admin jobs. 
Nothing except considerable paycuts and more stress. 
Depression creeping back in.

What the fuck do I do with my stupid life? 

I'm sick of working administrative jobs where, it's childish to say, but I'm kind of always disrespected because it's a peon job or whatever. 
I am capable of working very hard and I accept that I must not be at a hirable skill level, but deciding what path to take is apparently my downfall. 
I can’t get hired because I lack experience, and I’m working for free on all these other projects hoping they will make me look good to employers, but I’m not sure if it will work.  

There seem to be more 3d jobs avaiable in general, in cities that I wouldn’t mind living, but I need to practice a hell of a lot more. I wouldn’t mind dropping everything and dedicating all of my free time into getting better at 3d, but if I stop doing 2d only to have all of my hard work not pay off again… I’m not sure if I could handle the disappointment. 
I love doing 2d, I’m best at it, but I’m finding a 9-5 decent paying (ie: not poverty level) job does not exist. I can do other things, I can use many different programs, but it seems like all of the jobs I’m seeing that are hiring require some other skill that I can’t even lie about having (ie: ability to code or program)
 I’m not sure we live in an economy that can support artists, or maybe I just haven’t worked hard enough. 
PS: I typed in a lot of incomplete sentences and I’m very sorry if it’s painful to read because of this, I was just trying to get it all out as quickly as possible. 
Tl;dr: I am a useless, talentless hack who cannot get a job.  If anyone has any specific advice I would be greatly thankful.

I'm looking for great places around Europe to travel on long weekends throughout the summer. Priorities for me include: cultural immersion, active lifestyle (running/hiking/climbing/backpacking), natural beauty (photography is a main hobby of mine). I ~~don't mind~~ enjoy adventuring/roughing it

I guess I'm really looking to hear about your favorite places that are a little lesser known that offer a unique experience around Europe.

First, background information:

* I graduate in 2014.

* Major: Aerospace/Mechanical Engineering

* Minor: Computer Science

So, I have an internship offer for the summer I have already accepted for a large defense contractor named Raytheon (software engineering). I am also currently in the middle of talking with a couple of very interested people at Lockheed Martin (another defense contractor, software engineering).

In addition, I got accepted to [appacademy.io](http://www.appacademy.io/#p-home) as well.

So, I am kind of torn between working these two options (I am a student, so I am only free for the summer). I do not mind working for a defense contractor at all. I find software fun to program as well as doing web development. But, I am not sure which way to pick.


I am thinking of this... Tell App Academy to hold my admission for some time. Then, take the defense contractor internship and if I don't like it, attend App Academy.

Can I please have your opinions? Thank you for your times!"

Our company, Endemic, INC currently operates [Nerdy With Children](http://nerdywithchildren.com/) and we have plans to launch a new site in the next few months.  We're looking for a Digital Content Editor to join our [team](http://nerdywithchildren.com/about).

What We Need:

We're looking for a person who can help us build Endemic, INC into the superior powerhouse that we know it can become. Currently, we are a team of two co-founders, a couple interns, and a handful of freelance writers. We launched Nerdy With Children in August 2012 and are now planning to launch Nerdy With Pets. The co-founders are not editors and we need someone to step into this role and take the reins of our editorial dept with a long term commitment in mind. As we’re located in the U.S., this position is only open to U.S. and Canadian residents for timezone reasons because you will be working remotely.   

Responsibilities:
Managing our team of freelance writers.
Editing, writing, publishing quality content that our audience will fall in love with. 
Curating products and developing story ideas that will be featured.
Assisting us in content strategization.
Managing Editorial Interns 
Helping us come up with awesome ideas. 


What You Should Have:

Step 1: A degree from a University in Journalism or Communications.

Step 2: At least three to five years experience in an editing position. Preferably in the online publishing industry. 

Step 3: You're a passionate nerdy-geeky person who would love to write about kids and pets. If you dream of attending ToyFair, making quilts, meeting Nathan Fillion, or searching Etsy for cute dog sweaters then we want to talk to you. (Our next website will focus on pet products)

Step 4:  You have some knowledge of Wordpress, HTML, basic CSS, social media and a fundamental understanding of SEO. Basic graphic design skills are a big plus, but not required.


Compensation:
As a bootstrapped startup we are looking for a person who is willing to take on this responsibility in exchange for equity (negotiable) with minimal monetary compensation. Salary in addition to equity is absolutely possible once things progress, but for now we are doing this without outside investment and are therefore looking for someone who is interested in owning a piece of the business in exchange for their involvement.

If you are qualified and interested, let’s have a conversation- feel free to reach out to us via our [contact form](http://nerdywithchildren.com/) and we’ll connect."

But is it really true? Will having just a good idea win over the CD? I Have been contacting a some amount of CDs to review my portfolio via email and everyone of them seems to want something different. Some tell you that the idea is there but production and execution is not enough. And that you should show your graphic design and typography skills. Some tell you that it doesn't matter about execution just bring out big ideas. Some suggest to be more conservative with the brand image. Some tell you to dont' be so tame with the brand image/story and be adventurous and break the rules of what the current brand image may mean and show us that you can think beyond what is out there. Because a student book is not about being conservative, student books are the only place where you don't have rules.

So what do they actually want to see? I am so confused with the contradicting responses that I have gotten. Anyone who has recently got a job or internship with a student book, care to share what you put in your portfolio to land you that position? I am looking to become an art director btw."

I'm Bipolar II, and I'm currently in my 2nd year of getting my MSW and I have an internship as part of the program.

I've missed a few meetings (the internship is online) and I hate coming up with ""lame"" excuses.

I'm afraid to tell ""the truth"" because I don't want to be seen as unable to perform well enough for this job.

Any thoughts or advice? How have you handled this? 

UPDATE: Talked to my supervisor, and she said that she is glad to know more of the ""context"" of why I've been missing meetings. She said that in the future to call ahead rather than apologize and ask for forgiveness after teh fact. So, it helped and made me feel better about it. She appreciated the disclosure and acknowledged that there is a stigma with it, but it does help (sometimes) to know what it going on rather than making up excuses. 
So, even though it may not be best for everyone, it seems to have worked out for me. Thanks for all of your help, and I hope this can help some of you :) "

Did you miss out on opportunities that would've made your life easier?

In college you always hear about how you're supposed to network and do all these extra activities like frats/soroties and clubs. And you meet those few choice students who do amazing side projects on their own and develop the new facebook or instagram or whatnot.

However I'm a 4th year Computer Engineering student and have never done any of this aside from my Society of Computer Engineers club membership (but even then I only go there to sit and study between classes). My classmates are out there creating amazing side projects and going to job fairs and amassing internships and I just don't have the urge to do any of this.

I take the minimum amount of units to be full-time and I work part-time and I feel like just that is enough to keep me busy at all times (and then add in familial obligations as I still live at home). Though when I see my classmates who have jobs lined up for the future and who all seem to have much more marketable skills than I do (usually from pre-existing knowledge before college which I never had) it makes me feel like I am very much behind the 8 ball in the industry. 

So redditors who took the same path that I am currently on, please share your stories. Are my fears justified? Any advice you can offer?

19cfzc,6,2013-02-27,"I [f22] work as a graphic designer. My little sister [f20] works for a company with no real job description, but is apparently 'designing' their website.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/19cfzc/i_f22_work_as_a_graphic_designer_my_little_sister/,"Note: I tried to be as clear as I could in that title. I'm a bit frustrated and I didn't know how to word my frustrations.

Backstory:

I went to college right out of school to get my degree in Visual Communications (Graphic Design). Once I completed college, I picked up an internship, which then turned into a full time job. I have been with this company for nearly two years. Though, I'm not paid very well - The company is fairly busy but because of a choice client refusing to pay his bill we have fallen in rough times until the case is taken to collections. Anyway...

My little sister has no education, other than highschool. She's been in the workforce since she graduated. First she worked for a children's hair salon (hair stylist, still uneducated). She then left when she fell ill and had to go live with my parents. (The house they were renting was riddled with mould and made her very sick. Her and her fiance lived in my parents basement for about half a year.) 

While she was recuperating, she took up an office job at a trailer manufacturing company. While there, she approached me and the company I work for for a website. We met, quoted it out, and never heard from them again.

She eventually quit this job, despite the incredible pay and how good the company was to her. She bought a house with her fiance, and went back to the children's hair salon. After about 6 months there, she's back at the trailer manufacturing company. (Wow, I didn't realise how back-and-forth she's been).

I actually picked up a part time job on weekends at said hair salon because I'm having money issues.

To be fair, I'm fairly resentful of her job. She gets paid a LOT more than me. She doesn't realise how fortunate she is to have this opportunity. She was hired on initially to do their safety program, and work on the floor doing something to do with safety. I don't know exactly, but she kind of had this handed to her on a shiny silver platter.

Yeah, I've always had resentment for my sister. Likely relevant.

The problem: 
Once my sister got her job back at the trailer place, I asked her if there was any chance to revisit us designing/building their website. She told me the owners decided to go with 'some girl' instead.

Which, happens to be her! And this kind of really PISSED me off! I only found out because my mom mentioned something about it last night. She's also been emailing me these last few days asking about templates, design, and 'back office'.

I told her that if she intends to change the design, she'd need to know HTML and CSS, and I don't know what a back office is because we build our stuff custom from the ground up - no templates or the like.

When it finally clicked I became enraged. I've kept most of it bottled up inside me but I am wondering how I should go forward with this.

I feel like she's pissing on my career choice. I went to school for this. I do my job, and I do my job well. It's my livelihood. We have a programmer, who does his job well. She lied to me about who was doing their website, and she's asking me for help. She is going to do a hacky shitty job (other than hair styling, she has no creative talent), and she's obviously aiding in taking away work from our company.

I don't know what to do. I want to call her out on it. In fact, I may have already emailed her about it. Just asking if she was designing the website, but I don't know what to say once she responds.

Side note: I'm supposed to meet with her this week to work on designing her wedding invites, but the childish mad side of me wants me to tell her to go design her own invites seeing as she thinks she's capable.

And rereading all that I feel like a childish brat. So feel free to call me out on it if you see fit. I just don't know how I should act about this. I know what I WANT to say, but I also know that won't go over well. I do want to make her aware of how this is effecting me. How, with the current financial issue I'm in, it's become even more frustrating. We get clients like this all the time, who take their work to 'someone else aka their nephew who knows dreamweaver' or something, but when it happens with my own family it's a bit more personal.

**TL;DR Little sister, always having thing handed to her on a nice shiny platter, knowingly takes away design work from the design company big sister works for to do it 'herself', which spells disaster. Bit about education, big sister works her ass off to get where she is, while little sister just floats through life. Obviously resulting in angry big sister, but unsure how to approach the little sister to talk about it. Like adults. Hopefully.**


EDIT: Ah, a short-lived drama, flaired by my rash temper. I appreciate all the helpful advice given. I guess morning when I realised what was going on, and not hearing the full story directly from her kind of pushed me over the edge. I'm glad I wrote here before I confronted her because I can guarantee things wouldn't end well.

I haven't heard from her, but I did email her and say that I was bothered by what happened. It was a piss on my career. I didn't feel good about it. I didn't like that she lied about it to me, and that I found out through someone else. I also said I realised that it wasn't her decision where the site was made, and I can't blame her for that. I told her that she can't ask me for advice. I won't give it away freely. I worked hard to get where I am and I'm not going to spend my time trying to help her when I've taken the time to figure out these things for myself.

And I said I'll see her tomorrow. So, if I haven't enraged her too much, this means I can still do her wedding invites for her.

So the last times I posted on here I was fighting a manic episode while in a mixed episode.

I'm happy to say that two weeks on an antipsychotic...or either just time itself...brought me back to level.

It also caused me to gain 10 lbs.  A dear friend, trying to help, told me ""The medicine didn't make you gain weight, your eating did.""...Right.  Okay.  Let me rephrase that.

The damn medicine made me constantly hungry where no food could satisfy it and if I didn't eat when I was hungry I'd be sick.

Hows that?

Anyway that's off topic.

Yesterday I was getting dressed for my internship and...my clothes didn't fit.  I'm already self-conscious about my weight because I AM overweight and guys...I've been trying to lose weight.  I've been trying to stick to this diet that I was on a few years ago that actually helped me lose weight.  I've been doing yoga every morning and building up to the cardio..I can only do a little at a time.  

And those damn clothes.

The clothes didn't start this...depression?  I hate even calling it depression, I want to call it senioritis because..I'm not sad.  I just don't give a...damn.  

When the doctor put me on the antipsychotic he upped my antidepressant and told me that he understood that I didn't want a different one, but if this one wasn't working that I would have to.

I want to will this medicine to work.

But especially since yesterday I just...I feel like a fat little blob that has absolutely no will power to do anything.

I didn't even GO to my internship today.  I called in 'sick.'

I stopped taking the antipsychotic, with doctor's...half..permission.  He told me to cut it in half and if in a week I didn't feel better to stop.  He didn't understand how shitty that medicine made me feel.  It wasn't just the weight gain..I felt drugged, all the time.  I couldn't think straight, was lethargic..which didn't help with the losing weight.

At this point I'm not exactly sure what to do.  I see my doctor again next Thursday.  I have to be better by then.

And this *pokes fat belly*  THIS has to go.  I don't know how besides diet and exercise..I don't know what else to do or what I'm doing wrong or if it was because of the antipsychotic.  I'm to the point though where I'm almost willing to do anything to make it go away..and that's not good."

That meant I had trouble finding an internship my junior year since I had little experience in the field at the time. I ended up spending summer self-studying a bunch of programming languages and programming in general so that by senior year I felt like I was on top of things. The problem is, senior year is coming to an end now and I have not been able to find a internship in development since they prefer to hire on juniors or even sophomores. I ended up taking an internship in IT from my university just so I could have some sort of tech experience on my resume. I recently started my job search and speaking with recruiters, but many of them keep asking if I'd like a job in networking or systems due to my internship, but I'd really prefer development. I'm wondering if I should just cave in and do systems/IT work cause if nothing comes along in development, I might regret passing those up. Any advice? I live in the Chicago-land area if that matters.

I know I could do a lot better, but with my 18hour semester, research thesis, and pending publication in progress, I don't have time to study for the MCAT.  Next time I could take it would be like Julyish, meaning I would submit my applications anyway with the 28, then send in my new (hopefully better) score.

3.53 gpa overall, 3.3 sgpa.  (I know, not best, that's why I was hoping for a good MCAT score.)
Currently doing paid autism research.
Two medical internships in Germany, 6 weeks total.
Currently working on translating old letters from the last 150 years from German (this is the article I am working on for publication).
Outside of the internship, I have probably 100+ hours of volunteering or shadowing in a hospital.

I am really pushing for the ""well rounded"" student part of my application, also planning on a semester abroad in Spain to boost that.

I come from an undergrad in Electronics Engineering and I'm currently doing an MS in Comp. Engg. at the U of Florida. I'm having a hard time securing an internship interview. I have some questions about what to put on my resume (already searched /r/cscareerquestions but couldn't find anything relevant):

* **objective section on resume**: yay or nay? I've read one post where they said it's better to put a summary of yourself than a generic objective. The internet has divided opinions on the subject (but Google didn't show up anything specifically for Comp. Science, which is why I'm asking here). My objective currently reads as ""looking for a software development internship."" too bland?

* **list individual courses**: is this a good idea or is it a waste of space? I did this because I figured it would offset my lack of undergrad CS exposure. but after having been to the career fair this semester, i saw that most people just skimmed through that section. *edit: Also, I'm worried that this is eating up space that I could better use to provide more details on my projects.*

* **work experience**: I have work experience (4 years after my undergrad) in VLSI testing and design. not sure if i should include it. there are some transferable skills like mentoring and there was a bit of C coding involved. most of it was VHDL, RTL simulation though, which is not relevant to software development.

**TL;DR**: current Masters in Comp. Sci with unrelated undergrad degree needs advice on internship resumes."

I'm looking for full-time work for the summer (May). My focus is startups and small and medium sized companies. I am making it clear that I can start early May/end of April. My career choice is product management as it's something I'm doing now and have developed a well rounded resume into it over the last few years.

If you knew me in person you could attest  to the fact I'm a positive, enthusiastic, energetic guy who loves to pitch. I'm very well rounded both on the business side of things and technical stuff as well (a few co-ops having done development). With regard to interviewing skills: I'm 2nd to none and in fact I even help my friends with their interviewing. I have no issues with my resume as I get tons of interviews as it's very well balanced and properly executed (can you tell the business speak ;)). I'm also working part-time as a product manager for an emerging startup (TechCrunch participant and award winner) because I love the people on the team.

Frustration points: 
- ""Amazing experience and personality, you got a crap load of potential""
- ""you'll do well in this space. you're going in the right direction""
- ""love your energy""
- ""Unique and great background. You're a bright dude""

Are some of the positive things I'm being told by multiple interviewers. At the same time, some waterloo based startups here are telling me I don't have enough experience even though (because of life circumstances I couldn't control but I took advantage of shitty situation) i've been able to amass 5 years of experience in product management, project management, business analysis, mobile development, etc with my co-ops

Questions: 

1. How do I break through that glassdoor? I am sure most of the recent and ex-UW grads have gone through this situation where it was hard to crack through to get that first job
2. Is it worth settling for a low-end type of job to pay the bills and put something on your full-time resume while looking for a great opportunity? Or is it worth hustling it and keep at it
3. I realized i'm competing for certain product management positions against some pretty old guys (sorry to offend but guys with like 10-20 years of experience). Yet, i'm still fighting them off and getting to final round interviews. Should I settle for a business analyst role and somehow work my way up again or my co-op and internship experience will have some value?
4. How early do you start looking for a may job? I had feedback that companies are looking for NOW rather then 2 months from now. Is there truth in that?
5. Does the Jobmine for New grads actually work? I've been told by my friends they rarely get any feedback by using that route and these are high quality candidates

I hope this thread provides value to other peeps in my position! Sorry for the ""rant"" style approach! "

For the last few months I've been going as hard as I could with civil service tests, visiting non-profits, trying to have those in the positions that I want share as much as they could with me, and spending time with the department of labor applying to jobs and even trying to do the work for free a couple times a week in an internship or just basic volunteering. And, I've gotten nothing. The advertised volunteer opportunities would not give me the skills and experience that I need to be considered for the work that I'm interested, and I don't see the deli work being valued.

So, my options are to either fully commit myself to the deli until I'm thru with my masters, or to continue doing 30-40 hrs at a lower pay and keep pushing and hoping for either related volunteer work or an actual job.

Greatly appreciate any advice or shared experience."

I'm doing a term abroad at Oxford right now and assuming I get an internship I don't start work until june.  I'll have All of may and some of April to do anything that I want to train or whatever else.  My goal  is currently cutting while maintaining size and strength for summer, but secondary I want to be generally fit but I don't really care how that is.  I have access to a gym (classes included), a river, kayaks, row boats, beaches, camping  gear, I can drive 2 hours and be at a mountain, and all the food a southern Momma can cook so fuel won't be a problem.  I thought about doing 2 a days at the gym but after getting advice from a number of my buddies who trained for sports in high school and college I think I'd burn out  too fast.  I'm going to do a form of starting strength for the first week to break back into lifting and bring the weight up fast (taking a month off everything but body weight due to a travel break) then I'm looking at either continuing the Texas Method or switching to PHAT since I have the time.

However that only takes up  3-5 days a week and only an hour or two a day.  I've been a sedentary person for the past 19 years of my life and this is my first time that I actually care about being active.  Fittit, design me a week guide!  I'm interested in everything, yoga, sprints, agility training, rock climbing, balance, gymnastics (if I can find a place), hoops, pretty much you name it I want to get good at it and I have the time to put in and I need ideas.  I know someone is going to say get a life, but none of my friends are back until mid-late May and I want to make the most of my free time.  I'll be spending 1-3 hours a day studying for the LSAT but that has a lot stronger diminishing returns than general fitness.

One caveat is that I have bicep tendinitis that has plagued me for the last 4 months so anything that's heavy on that might have to be once a week at most.

After the internship, we stay in contact either through being in different (U.S.) states. However, a day destroyed this when he express love for me. I could not express similar feeling other than a close friendship (me being a heterosexual male). Then, he did not take it well. The last real conservation we had was full of insults, slurs, and sowing doubt of my heterosexuality. I felt terrible by the insults, and by breaking his heart. 

The result was my destruction of my self-worth and confidence. I am constantly paranoid of being a bad friend or a burden to them. I am paranoid he would go around telling our mutual friends that I am a bad person. Since then too, I notice that I have developed depression/anti-social behavior and usually lack confidence on a daily bases. The low self-worth has destroyed any confidence in finding girlfriends

And you know you will fail"". I dropped my degree in Meteorology and I'm doing a new one in another area now. I can't get a job, neither an internship. I'm getting tired of emailing resumes.

The worst part of it all, is that I know that I'm sabotaging myself. I should just go to sleep around midnight, but I won't. I'll game 'till 4am. And this little conscious part of me talks with me while I'm doing the wrong thing: "" Why are you doing this?"" I mean, this REALLY happens. I actually tell myself that in my head  ( sometimes even outloud). Why can't I listen to that voice and take action? It's like this invisible ( almost liquid) force heats my brain, shuts it all down and fills me up. I thought I was doing great last week. I knew I was still feeling a little under the weather ( read unhappy). But now the moment is gone. It was a good week. A week where I may have thought of suicide just 1 oe 2 times. Not actually doing it, but just thinking of it gave me some peace of mind.

Everyday that goes by, I get older, I feel more and more like I should just give up. What's the point in trying something if I'm not gonna be able to finish it anyway? Why can't I pull myself out of it? Do I deserve this? Will this ever gonna change? Where is my fucking power to do something about this? I'm tired of being me. Of this life I'm living. THIS situation I'm in it's my fault, and this gets me. Every little change, every little action doesn't help. Little things are like doing drugs; a good momentary spark of relief. They give me a sense of hope and faith in my future, ""maybe there is a chance for me; I could make this work"". But it never lasts.

I feel pathetic for feeling this way. And this feeling fills me up again, to tell me there's no way out anyway, "" you're gonna fail"".

19btev,1,2013-02-27,Student internship interview,thewidowaustero,nursing,https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/19btev/student_internship_interview/,"Hi /r/nursing! I'm a junior BSN nursing student. I have an interview coming up for a summer internship. As far as interview basics (eye contact, etc) I'm fine, but I would really appreciate some advice specific to a nursing interview. I know it's especially important to ask questions, but I'm having trouble coming up with good ones. So far my ideas are: ask about infection control practices at the hospital, ongoing education for RNs, skills I would be able to perform as an intern, and the general hospital culture.

Does anyone have any other input? Additionally, if I don't get this internship (I didn't pay attention to requirements and only got one recommendation, so wasn't able to apply to internships that required two) what would you suggest I do outside of school for some experience?"
19bqra,7,2013-02-27,Advice for getting into architecture master's program as a liberal arts undergrad?,cartdfn,architecture,https://www.reddit.com/r/architecture/comments/19bqra/advice_for_getting_into_architecture_masters/,"I'm living in NYC right now am a few months out of college and am strongly considering a ""career pivot"" into architecture. (And yes, I know I sound like I'm going through an early midlife crisis and I've got plenty more research and soul searching before deciding this is the path for me).

The problem is that I've got next to no professional or academic experience related to architecture (I was an English major and media studies minor in college, ran the daily school newspaper, have internship experience in PR and marketing, and currently work for a PR firm.)

I imagine that for a master's program, I need rec letters and a portfolio, first and foremost. I doubt any of my current sources of rec letters (PR professionals, Lit. profs, etc.) would have much relevance to an architecture school admissions officer.

Are there night/weekend design couses or intensive summer programs or something similar that would give me instruction to build an impressive portfolio and provide me with connections to get rec. letters?

Any other suggestions?

Thanks!"
19bpqe,10,2013-02-27,"Need a car for the summer, small savings - buy or rent?",intirb,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/19bpqe/need_a_car_for_the_summer_small_savings_buy_or/,"Hello PF!  I've been reading this sub for a while now - you guys always give great advice, so I was hoping a few of you could check my thought process here.

I'm a grad student, living with my SO.  Together we take home about 3.6k a month.  We currently live in a city and don't need or want a car.  However, I have a mandatory (paid) internship for the summer in a part of the country where, sadly, a car will be necessary.  We would want the car for driving across the country to the internship, daily commuting, and driving back.  After that, we have no more use for the car.

Since I started grad school in the fall, we've managed to save up about 5k.  This amount constitutes the entirety of our savings/emergency fund.  The internship is paid, and our take-home pay will be about the same per month (possibly a little higher).

As I see it, my options are either:

- Buy a car, and then sell it (possibly for a small loss) at the end of the summer.  OKish looking used cars sell in my area for about 3-4k with 150k miles on them.  The benefit of this strategy is that over the long-term I wouldn't pay too much, since I could sell the car at the end of summer.  The drawback is that it would cut significantly into our pretty meager savings, and if something goes wrong (like the engine fails), we'd be out 3-4k and have no car.

- Rent a car for 3 months.  I've called a few places up, and it looks like this would cost about 1700-2200 dollars for the entire summer, split over 3 months.  Since this is roughly equivalent to what we've been saving per month, we could definitely afford this kind of a monthly payment without even cutting into our savings, though we'd stop contributing for the summer.

Advice?  My current thought is that option 1 would technically be the overall better option for someone with a little more in savings, but for us it would be too risky.  I don't really know a lot about cars or how likely they are to fail, though, so maybe I'm overestimating that risk?  

I'm happy to provide other information, if it's relevant.  Thanks a bunch for your thoughts!"
19bokr,6,2013-02-27,Long Life Rant,TheRanter1,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/19bokr/long_life_rant/,"Hello reader. First off, I am depressed, sad, ambivalent, and slightly intoxicated with self-pity, maybe a pinch of self-loathing. I have no interest or comment on my physical well-being, needless to say I can play a good game of ultimate on weekends and work-out when my friend badgers me long enough to get me motivated. I am studying to go into the wide field of nanotechnology (bachelor's level currently, but on the engineering side). I'm slightly above average in terms of class grades in a top 30 uni in US. Yes, that will be the extent of my narcissism and good characteristics so take away your pitchforks, I'm here seeking help not hubris.

I'm not here looking for pity so absorb the following diatribe against my life analytically. It may seem like I'm looking for pity, or at least self-pity, but ignore it and do not feel sad or mad. Do not try to portray yourself or people you know as characters it'll cloud your judgement. My first memory as a child was being taken into this quiet room with a little window at the top out of which you could see the top of a tree. This room was full of toys and games and books. But it also had a lady who was hell-bent on getting this little boy to memorize the english alphabet. There was a slap and a punch and a kick awaiting his failure to memorize that the r sounds like ""are"" and goes after the q. The boy didn't feel angry or sad, he just felt fear and hopelessness. Moving on, the boy was a quiet one, a shy kid. Yet, he was never lonely in terms of friends. But the boy was alone at the end of the day when all the kids left the daycare until a babysitter came to pick him up and take care of him in her house. And there he would reside until he fell asleep and his parents came to pick him up. His only birthday wish every year was for the pain to stop and for a loving family to take its place. His wishes were expressed and accepted, but the promises were never kept. This continued throughout this boy's school life and intensified in middle school. The boy had to study the next year's worth of courses during summer to prepare to ace the courses during the next school year. He could not play with friends, he had no other hobbies except what the regime supervised as appropriate. Finally, in the beginning of high school when he took a stand against the brutal regime, and the regime took a turn to the darker side.

Enough the boy had said, enough with your punishment for failure. He was bigger and stronger, but he was still a boy and still quiet. The regime coerced him into taking up crew/rowing, one of the more bittersweet memories of high school. The regime instead of physical punishment took to destroying his toys at any failure to comply with their wishes. They held their duties as a regime that provided care for him in return for his obedience and good work. They took to spying on him at random hours on his permanently unlocked room to make sure the boy was working hard and taking an inventory of his internet logs when he was away. The boy could not play games online (for fear of getting caught during a random spy check) nor had toys (video game consoles) as they were destroyed. These were the darker days and darkest hours when the boy was hit with sadness and loneliness. He was not to know until later that this was depression. The boy broke down multiple times during those dark days. He lost a lot of precious things, you might even go as far as to say he lost a part of his soul in those days. And he learned of a darker fear, one that has yet to go away.

The regime was uplifted once the boy went off to college and the burdens went away. He has a good life, struggling with motivation for classes as he always does things at the last minute, but its become a part of his philosophy and way of life. He has done internships at R&amp;D labs and is happy with his prospects for the future. He has a bounty of friends and a struggling bond building back with the old regime who cover for everything and have become a supportive group. The boy has finally become a man... 

But the man still misses the part he lost. The man still hurts inside, and the pain is deep. The man is afraid to confront the pain, just a giant black wall of pain that he cannot get past. He feels hollow at times, or maybe he has been hollow ever since he lost that part and was trying to fill himself up with fleeting emotions and fantasies. The man has questions, ""Why can't I love anyone"", ""Why do I distance myself from people"", ""Why can't I be more outgoing"". But the scariest question the man has to face is ""Why does it still hurt"" because the man can't find any answer to that. The boy had no one to help him in his struggles against the regime, no one to console his pain, no one to comfort him as he cried at night, no one to bring him up when he was broken down. The regime was not helpful, the extended family was continents away, and discussion with friends was out of the question. Everyone else was just a phony, how could they understand anything. And so he suffered for it and the pain just kept building up and up and up until he felt nothing but shallow fleeting emotions. Maybe the man's soul is still stuck in that time, that's why the pain and fear don't go away. Maybe there is so much pain built up that it keeps coming out and the man has been conditioned towards the fear.

If the man could do anything, he would build a time machine and go back to the little boy in the little room with his little toys and the tiny window with only the top of the tree to be seen, and just give that little boy a great big hug and tell him that he is loved, and loved very dearly. And he would go back in time to every day the little boy was alone and take him on an adventure to see what a wonderful world he lived in. And he would go back to every time the big boy broke down to give him a shoulder to cry on and a friend who understood his troubles. And he would go back to every time that boy ran away and keep him company in the cold and lonely nights and tell him stories about the crazy stuff that goes on around the world. And he would especially go back to the time the boy was hiding from the police after they came to arrest a member of the regime for a call of domestic violence against the other member. And he would take that boy in his arms and hold him tight and tell him that the world isn't all sunshine and roses, that its a dark world out there and its a painful world out there, but that for however bad the world seems to get, and however sad you may feel, you should never give up, because the one thing the world can't take from you is your hope, your determination, your courage, your passion. Only you are to blame if you lose yourself to the world. And just maybe, the boy wouldn't have hurt as much and the man wouldn't hurt either."

So I've been married for 2 years, dated before that for 3, with a guy that I'm just now realizing isn't the kind of man I'm into. I use man pretty loosely, since at most I think people would consider him a boy... he's 29 and has no real goals in life except playing video games and not finding a job beyond his no-salary internship. And on top of that, he has a ton of insecurities, anything from how short he is to how fat he's getting to how lousy he is in bed...

It's gotten to the point now where I'm actually looking a real man, and I know that sounds so cliche, but just to be with someone who knows how to take charge and own a relationship. I've spoken to him about how much he's disappointed me and given him a million ways to make it up (tried exercising with him - he gave up; applied to a bunch of jobs for him - he never went to the interviews).

So now I'm ready to think about moving on, but to be honest, he's played the victim so often it's sort of got me thinking about seeing a new man even while I'm married to him. I've become really into the idea of him either suspecting or knowing that a real man is in my life, taking over and owning what used to be his. I know it sounds hurtful and what not and I know if I were any other person I'd look at my ad and think it was horrible, but this is where I am and I'm looking for someone who could help me with this.

I'm 5'4, of Asian descent, black hair and black eyes and keep in shape. I guess you'd say I'm beautiful, but I only really blossomed until after college, which is why I dated my now (sorta loser) husband."

I just want to vent, or maybe even just write down my thoughts. Anyway, here it goes.

I started dating my girlfriend in November of 2011. We were really good friends starting around May of that year, and got closer and closer over the summer. By the fall, I had to start my first semester at college. Not being able to bare the thought of her finding someone else while I was away at school I made my move on her. We finally kissed and were dating the same day. Everything was amazing from November throughout the school year and summer. We grew even closer, I loved her more than I thought I could love a person. And even though we were only 18 and 19 years old, we started talking about marriage down the road and planning our lives out together. She said she wanted to be with me forever, and I was stupid enough to believe it. At the end of the summer we were both heart broken to let each other go. But, she had to start her Freshman year at school and I had to begin my second year. Our schools were 2 hours from home in different directions so we figured it wouldn't be any different than being long distance last year. We agreed that we'd both come home every 2 or 3 weeks to see each other. It sounded doable and I was ready for the start of the semester. But after only a few days at college she started to seem more distant. I didn't know what was going on, but I didn't like it. Late one night, still in our first week into the new school year, I told her that I felt like she was getting more distant with me, and I just wanted to know what was going on. She said she wanted to break up.

I was stunned. She was my whole world and out of nowhere she just wanted to be done. She was my first girlfriend, and obviously my first breakup, and this was a very serious relationship in my mind. So all of those factors led me to be really upset and depressed. She said that she still loved me, but she just didn't want to have a boyfriend in college. She didn't want to be tied down. As I said before, I was heartbroken and it seemed like our breakup lasted an eternity, in reality, it was 6 days. 

After less than a week, she realized that other guys didn't compare to me. They weren't worth saying goodnight to is how I think she put it. Anyway, she wanted me back and, not having any time to get over her, I took her back with open arms. Everything was going great after that, it felt like we were back to normal...for about a month.

Around the beginning of October last year I asked her a very potent question. One that was stupid and that I knew I wouldn't like the answer to. I asked her 'before me, when was the last time you had sex?' She didn't want to answer, but I finally got it out of her, and she told me that it was the day we first kissed. This crushed me. I felt like the song and dance we were going through before we started dating was a mutual experience. I felt like her sleeping around while we were in that 'pseudo-dating' phase cheapened all of the memories we shared during that time. So, after she told me that, I lied to her and told her that while we apart for 6 days I slept with someone. I hadn't really; at that point I hadn't slept with anyone else in my life. I had never kissed anyone before in my life. I just wanted to feel some idk, vindication? I wanted to feel like I could do what she did. But, after about an hour of thinking about this, I decided I didn't want to lie to her for the rest of my life and I told her the truth. She flipped out, asked me how she could ever trust me again, that kinda stuff. I still feel like she was over reacting a tad, but what I did was really shitty, and really stupid I know. So she used that to break up with me a second time.

 A few days later she said that she forgave me, but still didn't want to date me anymore. She gave the same reasons as last time, saying she didn't want a ld boyfriend blah blah blah. This time, we don't really talk at all for 2 weeks. That's when she calls me on the phone crying. She says she misses me, and how she's a terrible girlfriend, and she's really confused, and feels alone and all of this. I was a little overwhelmed but just told her that I was there for her. That kicked off a period of a few weeks where we were unofficially dating. I even went down to see her at school one weekend and it was feeling like we were going to get back together again. But she was still on the fence. So, I told her that we wouldn't talk for 2 weeks, she could get an idea of what not being with me would be like, and then she could decide what she really wanted. Well, the 2 weeks went by, and she decided that she wanted me back. Again I excepted. I also found out that she slept with someone while we were in our 2 week nc phase. I didn't blame her for that. All that stuff goes on with being single and not having a bf. 

So we get back together AGAIN and everything is good for awhile. We have less than a month left in the semester, she comes up to my school to visits me and then winter break hits. We were inseparable. For 5 weeks we spent maybe 2 nights  away from each other. Alas, winter break ends and we go back to school. About a week into school, I go on Facebook for the first time since break and notice that she's logged in. I go to log her out, but see her messaging her friend. They were talking about how she was thinking about cheating on me with another guy. I'm shocked once again (even though maybe I shouldn't be at this point) and call her angrily. She says she wasn't really going to do it, but that a part of her wanted to. And then she goes into the exact same thing about not wanting a relationship right now. 

So we break up again. And the first week, being 2 days before Valentines day (when I was going to go see her) I was a complete wreck. Crying every day, it was awful. The next week, a switch flips, I talked to my ex (that still feels weird to say) and she said that she still loves me, and even misses me, but that she doesn't want this right now.We decided that we would see each other in a month, so that we could return each other's things. But I hope that's just a front. I really can't picture giving all of her stuff back. I hope that she misses me just as much as I miss her. Anyway, since the feelings are still there, I decided to look at this more like a break and go out and experience things that I never thought I'd be able to do. So, I did that. 

It's been 2 weeks since I made that decision and for the most part I'm happy. I joined a bowling league, I got an internship in the nature preserve on my campus, I started a tv show for the school tv station, and I made a ton of new friends. I'm a little embarrassed to admit this next part, but I've also slept with 8 girls in about a week. And I think that's whats getting my depressed lately. No matter how many girls, or how good it is, I still feel empty afterwards. It's not the same. None of these girls can compare to her. It's not her. There's no connection. And I miss the connection, and I miss her.

Like I said, I've taken the mindset that this is a break that will end in a month when I give her stuff back. I feel like that will be enough time for her to realize what she's done again. But a part of me is starting to think that this isn't going to be just a break again. And I'm worried that it won't be. Despite everything that she's done to me, I still love her, and I still want her back. If I get that chance I won't be so careless with how we treat the relationship. We're obviously not perfect, and we need to change some things. Both of us. But if she's willing, I would love nothing more.

So that's my story. I feel  little better just writing it down, but I'm still confused. Getting over her is going to take a long time, but I don't want to think about that. I don't want to get over her, I want to get back with her.  Despite what she's done, and the pain she's put me through, I want her back. And I don't know if that's going to happen.

So what are your thoughts? How much time did it take you to get over your SO? Based on my story, do you think she'll want me back at some point? If she does should I do it, and if so what types of ground rules could we put down so that this doesn't happen again? I have some ideas but any advice is appreciated."

I'm transferring to a different college for Zoology, which has internships with a nearby zoo, I'm going to try and volunteer at my local zoo over the summer, but what I want to do for a career is still up in the air.

Helping or creating breeding programs for red pandas, gorillas, tigers (my favorite), or any other species would make me feel really good about what I was doing and would be something I love.

What exactly is an ""entry level"" job or position in the tech or IT sectors? What are the job titles that different types of tech companies (software companies, ISPs, open source foundations, etc...) use?

For example, I have been told that ""QA"" was the entry level job for developers. I didn't know what ""QA"" meant so I gave it a google and found out it meant ""Quality Assurance"" (or some similar variant). I thought to myself ""Finally! I know what to look for!"" So I plugged that in to search engines and all I've found are jobs looking for people with 5+ years in QA. So I need 5 years of experience at an entry level position to get an entry level position? Normally you don't see this kind of recursion outside of poorly written computer science textbooks.

I am not looking for a job that pays over $30,000 USD (GROSS) annually. I am not looking for a job with benefits, long term security, Hell I'm not even looking for a growth position. I am completely aware that these jobs are contract positions farmed out to staffing agencies.

I am not looking to get rich quick. I am not looking to pad my resume with a couple hundred certification acronyms my gut tells me don't mean shit. I just want to know what Microsoft or startups or Amazon or whoever calls their bottom rung. I just want to know what the bottom of the totem pole is. 

So, TL;DR: what are the entry level positions in the most common tech company businesses called?


Final note: for the purposes of this discussion, ""intern"" doesn't count.

Assume so) said you need a thorough, playable game sample to survive from resume screening, then I am building game. Now I have a tetris, a side scrolling game and a 2D fighting game(this one is ongoing) posted but I implemented the graphics part of both games with X11(barely anyone uses it in game industry I guess).

I finished with my undergrad in psych 3 years ago and am finishing a masters now in industrial organizational psych. I have been working at a consulting firm the last 2 years a week here or there every month or two. The reason I'm saying what I've been doing is to speak to the job prospects I would have in my field. I can remain at the small firm I'm at being treated like scum and barely making enough to get by since jobs are few and far between for the firm or go into HR. 

So 2 years ago I took an entrepreneurship class and loved it. I had an idea for a project and made a website for it and have since made many websites, logos and other design work. I spent a few semesters in a masters architecture career change program in between undergrad and masters psych. I enjoyed it, but none, and I mean none of the recent graduates were finding work so I decided I had to move on. So that's where my background in design comes from. So I've started to learn python and java on my own the last few months and really enjoy it even on a very beginner level. 

There's a masters CS program that's around 50th from the rankings I've found in my city that I'm planning to begin prereq's for this summer through the fall and begin the program in the spring. My gre score was pretty high and the program said with the prereq's I would be admitted. I'm really worried though that even after an internship over one of the summers during an MS that it would be very difficult with my background to find a job. Will my background really hinder me? Is this a reckless decision since I don't have the experience other students will have? I'm also a little worried about the research I've read a little about showing that there is basically two groups in programming, the one's that can and the ones that can't. I'm not afraid of working really hard but am worried that going off the 'I've been good at math in the past' thing might be way too small of a sample size to predict programming aptitude from. I would really appreciate any advice!! :)"

I have a few questions about changes I have thought about making and your input is greatly appreciated: 

* I think I have pretty good internship experience, should I list that ahead of education? Or perhaps my skills summary first? 
* I am pretty sure my first sentence in my skills summary before my bullets is just a waste of space, thoughts? 
* For my programming languages listed, what is a good way to differentiate between the ones I am highly proficient at versus the ones I am only relatively familiar with? 
* I went to a highly recognizable top high school for science and technology in my state- should I keep that information there still? 
* Can I list classes I am currently taking this semester under relevant coursework or what is a good way to show they are still in progress?  I have some classes (database systems, computer security, computer networks) that I want to show I am taking but am not sure how or if this is a good idea since I am still enrolled and it is early in the semester
* Should I include my knowledge of version control (Subversion and Git) under my skills section, or is that something employers assume you know or is not that important?

So I've been trying to get healthy for a while, with moderate success. I started going to the gym with my brother when I was 19, and started going off and on. I lost a good amount of weight, but kept on eating shittily. In the past year or so I've really started eating healthier, but I haven't going to the gym as much, the longest I've been away from the gym was the 3 months that I was working at my internship. I really want to get a good, consistent gym routine going, and my brother pointed out BTFC and asked if I wanted to do it with him. I said I would be down as it would be a good motivator and it's a lot easier going to the gym with someone else than by yourself, at least for me. So here I am now, and hopefully I will be able to stick to the routine that we made and have some good progress in the months to come."

19ayyv,7,2013-02-26,Descent,Kinkaypandaz,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/19ayyv/descent/,"As of late I have been reading some of the tales others have shared here on NoSleep, I decided it was time that I share a story of my own. A genuine story that has been quite disturbing for me.

It was late in the fall, the time when most of the leaves are a deep crimson red and the wind is bitterly cold and biting, I was scheduled for a job interview that day. I had applied for an intern ship with a big time oil company. The interview took place in a tall building that seemed to surpass the clouds and the heavens, it hurt my neck looking that far up. I was greeted with the usual business front a warm inviting lobby with a receptionist behind a desk, she looked up at me with a soft smile and said ""How can I help you?"" I returned her smile and said ""I am here for an interview about the internship, can you tell me what floor I am supposed to be on?"" She looked down at her computer for a couple of minutes typing away, still glancing at her computer she said ""You will be seeing Mr. Harkinson on floor 22"" I thanked the receptionist and made my way to the elevator.

I stepped into the elevator and slowly began my ascension to the 22nd floor, while I waited and gazed at myself in the mirror I began to give myself a peptalk ""Alright, you have got to be confident, smooth, make him laugh a little... but be serious!"" The elevator rang as it approached the 22nd floor and the doors parted revealing rows upon rows of cubicles and a large glass board room near the back. A man that was dressed sharper than a sword came out to greet me with a hearty hello and a firm handshake. From there we hit it off, I made him laugh he told me he liked my business ethics and I would make a great addition to the company. 

All I can say is that I was teeming with joy upon hearing this, a little too much though. For when I re-entered the elevator, my excitement got the better of me and I failed to notice that the elevator had went past the lobby and down to the basement of the building. ""Funny,"" I began ""I don't remember there being a basement button."" To my surprise there was no button for the basement as I had previously acknowledged, the elevator stopped with a loud and resonating mechanical whir and the doors parted. There was an empty room ahead nothing in there, I tried to close the doors and return to the lobby but the elevator refused. Thinking that I might be able to find some stairs that led back to the lobby I stepped out of the elevator, just as I did the doors shut and the elevator left me. I searched the empty expanses of the basement for a door but there was nothing. By this point I went from uneasy to nervous

I turned to make my way back to the elevator and there was a man, or what I thought to be a man, standing there, my hairs stood on end seeing this figure and the air chilled me to my core. I couldn't meet the man's gaze not because I didn't look at him but because no eyes met mine. He only had a mouth, which looked as if it was muttering something but it was too silent and indistinct to make sense of. The man begun to slowly shamble towards me still muttering to himself, I froze in fear and panic, his words became more clear as he got closer. He was whispering ""I shall take your eyes..."" 

With what ever strength I could muster I ran past the apparition towards the elevator, furiously tapping the up arrow and slamming my fists on the doors. Glancing over my shoulder I could see him continuing towards me still whispering those horrid words. As he inched closer the lights behind him began to flicker and shut off. I turned to the doors again still banging my fists, but to no avail did the doors open. I felt his breath upon the nape of my neck, his whispers rang loudly in my ears, I whirled around and fell against the door only to meet my him standing before me. He seemed to be intently focused on me, relishing his soon to be eyes. Fear had frozen me again, I stood and watched as he placed his hands on my shoulders and brought his mouth closer to me still whispering ""I shall take your eyes..."" 

I shut my eyes as tight as they could go and waited for the inevitable, I heard his jaw crack and unhinge and I could smell his rancid breath, his mouth centimetres from my face. I heard a loud ding as the doors opened and I fell backwards with loud thump, I opened my eyes to find that I had fallen inside the elevator. I stood up and reached to press the lobby button but before I did I gazed out of the elevator to see the figure standing just before the threshold of the doors, still whispering ""I shall take your eyes...."" With that the doors closed and the elevator made its climb to the lobby. I walked out of there as fast as I could.

I never take the elevator in that building any more. However, I still feel  uneasy, I still hear the faint whispers reminding me ""I shall take your eyes..."" "

10 years ago today (almost to the minute as I'm typing this) the most important person in my life died in a gruesome car accident.  It was his 23rd birthday and he had just graduated from our college less than a month before (I was a year behind in college).  We went to a very small private college, so those of us in our major, maybe 15, were very tight knit.
He was driving home (to the town our college was in) from his parents.  No one still knows exactly what happened, even after the accident reconstruction.  What is known is he ended up plowed into the back of a semi truck.  He was driving a 2000 Dodge Ram, but after the accident it looked as small as a sedan.  The semi truck did not know he had collided and continued to drive for a few miles onto an entrance ramp to a highway when he was flagged down.  He was still alive at this point and the only reason I know his condition at the time is that one of our best friends happened to be on his first night of internship with the police department and was first on the scene (obviously not knowing who it was).  I know that he was unrecognizable, but the license plate informed my friend who it was and he held his hand as he died.  
It wasn't my first time dealing with the loss of a friend or loved one, I've lost a lot of friends since graduating high school in 1998.  It was the hardest though (at the time, one of my best friends died 5 years later).  I never make it through these anniversaries very well, and sometimes typing things out help a little.  

I'm both glad our friend was there to hold his hand, but sad that he will always have that amazing man's mangled body stuck in his head. 

Again, i apologize if this is inappropriate.  But thank you for reading."

First, I think it's awesome that this subreddit exists. It's been hugely helpful to see the kinds of questions and answers that get posted here, and I want to thank you guys for being supportive of those entering this career.


To those wanting to get straight to the point, here is the resume in question (sorry, it's a direct download link): http://dl.dropbox.com/u/12995124/John_Doe_Resume.docx


So about myself, I'm going to be graduating with an M.S. in comp sci this May, and before that I graduated with a B.A. in comp sci and a social sciences major (double major). I went straight from undergrad to grad, so I have no in-between real world experience, and I also have no internship experience. I personally think this is going to be the killer (i.e. biggest downfall) for me, but please correct me if I'm wrong. Anyway, I think I'm a decent programmer, but I also didn't take the all the rigorous CS courses that the B.S.'s had to take (foundations of computing, undergrad algorithms, senior design, etc.) so I may be lacking somewhat in those areas. The biggest concern I have is that people will see M.S. in comp sci and immediately think ""Oh, this guy has a Master's, so he just MUST have all the theory down solid""...truth is, I don't. My school is okay, but they really didn't teach me as much theory as I thought they would in the past 2 years during grad school.


Really the only thing mildly going for me is my teaching experience (been a TA for the past 2 years during grad school), and one year as a graduate research assistant working with robotics (first year grad school).


Also, I'm sure this has some effect but I'm not sure to what degree, but I'm an international student so that automatically closes many doors for me (correct? wrong?). Should I include this on my resume?


Any input at all is greatly appreciated. Thanks for the help in advance."

I currently have an internship which will hopefully  turn into a full time position with a notable firm after graduation. This being said, I am fortunate to not be pressed to boost my resume this summer.  As a result I am very flexible but this creates a new problem, because I dont know what to do.

I do know that I want to travel very badly and am not super picky as to where I go.  Ideally I would travel as much as possible through Europe and beyond.  But I was wondering if there are any good programs that would facilitate this desire in a financially friendly way.
I know there are programs out there that effectively pay for your entire trip (or a portion) travel expenses, lodging, and meals included in return for services or work etc.  But I am having difficulty finding them as it is difficult to sort through the hundreds of phony ""internship"" sites that allow you to pay 10k for 4 weeks of working (doesnt seem like a very good deal).

TL:DR - I am extremely flexible and I am looking for a program where I can maximize travel and minimize expense whether it be through an internship, international job, or any other type of program.

One of my geographic interest-spots was the Boston area, and I was fortunate to receive invites to all places around there I applied (6 sites). None of the spots in Boston are match sites. offers were made for these sites right at the beginning or right before INS,  usually with a 24-hour or so response deadline. This really seems like Boston is poaching candidates in some way from other programs who are in the match. 

Also, I was a little annoyed to have bought a very expensive ticket out to Hawaii on an intern's salary just to not end up doing those match interviews as I had just accepted a boston one. I mean, Hawaii was lovely, but I would've preferred to save the nearly 2k I ended up spending on that trip. Of course it was a risk I decided and agreed to take, as the boston sites are very competitive an I felt I needed to interview with everyone I applied to, but it was still a lot of money.

What is keeping other programs from pulling out of the match? Is this system going to continue to work? Is Boston messing with things?"

First some back story to why I am considering grad school. I am an environmental engineering senior and will be graduating in may. Even though I am graduating with an environmental degree I would like to go chemE MS. Last summer I was working along side an EE at IBM and really took on an interest in nanotechnology in the sense of microelectronics fabrication. As an environmental engineer no company is going to hire you to fill a position in those interests, all they want are EE ME and ChemE. I have taken related courses such as organic chem, fluid mechanics, thermo and other kinetic reaction based analytical classes but nothing along the lines of reactor engineering courses. I am kind of new to the whole subject of chemE, but what my interest would be for a career is a job as a chemE engineering of the substrates and materials used for nanotechnology. I also wouldn't mind other fields related to what chemE's can do in that type of setting. As you can see I am not very versed in the field of ChemE, so other cool suggestions that interests people have along these lines are welcome. I just don't like my job opportunities I have as an enviro. When I signed up for enviro it was kind of on a little knowledge base of what I would be doing and by the time I found out and wanted to change it was too late. I have taken the gre's with a not so stellar 153 quant, and will be graduating with an even 3.0. I am considering taking the gre's again to improve the quant as I simply ran out of time on some questions I know I could have gotten right. Am looking to go to respectable school but by no means need it to be a top top school, that would be nice but I personally think with my credentials isn't possible. I am now coming to you guys for any sort of advice for me moving forward. All insight is helpful.

Long time coming but here are questions that I have

1. Is it worth it (would I be able to do it) for me to go back to school with intentions of a MS in ChemE?

2. I have had 2 internship based jobs. One as stated with IBM and the other was a once a week research position because I was working full time at IBM as an operator before I had the internship last summer. Even though I say research it mainly consisted of me reading about the subject, compiling the information then writing a weekly summary to my boss. Is this a good start to being considered by grad schools?

3. Should I take the gre's again?

That is quite the extensive post by as I stated above any insight will be very much appreciated, just need to hear some advice from you guys.

I've recently been accepted for an internship in Israel and I was wondering if I would be required to have a visa for my minimum 6 month stay.  On the Gov website it does say I won't need one as a tourist for 90 days but doesn't go into detail about what happens after that.

**Info about me and my position:**

* U.S. Citizen
* It's unpaid (so no work visa)
* It doesn't qualify for a volunteer visa
* I recently graduated so I'm no longer a student (no student visa)

Do I just go without a visa (like the gov website says?) and then extend my stay before my 3 months is up? Though I'm not sure what they would be extending since they won't have any paperwork.

...or do I apply for a tourist visa (even though it's not required) and then extend that after.  Not entirely sure where I fall here in terms of visas since I'm not a tourist. I've been trying to google this info for a while now to no avail.

Any help is appreciated.
Thanks!"

Last semester, by accident, I had an internship at a startup writing html/css from mockups on the RoR framework. While studying business has its engaging elements, my curiosity and interest in web development really makes me determined to learn more about CS and web development specifically and hopefully pursue a career in this field.

I'm taking my first CS class about structure and implementation of programming languages using Python this semester and once I graduate, I will be learning more web development related things online. However, with the vast amount of information and tools the web, I don't know which one I should prioritize first. I dabbled with some Javascript and Jquery, messed around with some RoR but I feel like I'm going no where. I don't think I have a solid fundamentals to approach web development properly.

I hope that you guys can pinpoint to me what kind of specific courses (on MIT courseware perhaps?) or general knowledge I should learn before going into learning a myriad of tools on the web?

[The study cited in this article was done on data from a past population in a single country, in/during which life was significantly different than it is today](http://www.shine.yahoo.com/parenting/study-having-boys-months-off-life-175000907.html). It doesn't show cause or even genuinely negative implications of the subject matter (the effects of having a baby boy on a mother's lifespan) yet the author's title implies relevance, cause, and negative effect.    
    
According to the article, the study was done on data from families living in pre-industrial Findland. The population sample size described is odd, with the number of mothers evaluated nearly double that of fathers. This leads to the question, ""Why so few fathers?"" Since this was during a more traditional time period, it isn't likely to be because of divorce. It is reasonable to wonder if the reason is that some fathers' shortened lifespans were ignored due to circumstances to which their deaths may have been attributed, such as accidental deaths.     
       
One factor providing some insight as to why the correlation discussed in the study cannot be related to cause is buried in the middle of a paragraph placed halfway through the story.    
&gt; In Finland during the 1700s and 1800s, a girl helped her mother by shouldering many of the household responsibilities, which could have increased the mother's life span slightly.    
    
...which can be turned around to say women died earlier if they didn't have daughters, as daughters represented the same type of help a business receives from an unpaid intern - free labor in trade for training.    
    
Attribution of shortened maternal lifespan to boy births involved speculation on the varying effects of gestation and childbirth on the body. The Daily Mail story linked in the Yahoo story even states that testosterone weakens the immune system.    
   
This idea did not make sense - If weakening of the immune system by increased testosterone shortens the lifespan, wouldn't that negatively impact on the survival of men in societies existing prior to modern advances in medicine like antibiotics?    
    
Most of the links I found in a search leading to assertions that testosterone weakens the immune system opened bodybuilding discussion forums in which laypeople were discussing the possibility, but almost nothing of a medical or research nature.    
    
Finally, I found [an interesting article on the topic on sciencedaily.com](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1999/10/991007083730.htm) which, instead of confirming the notion, contradicts it. The article suggests that rather than suppressing the immune system, elevated testosterone actually activates it, triggering the stress response and sending immune cells to locations where the body is often the most threatened.   
    
[This news-medical.net article agrees with the notion that testosterone weakens the immune system](http://www.news-medical.net/news/2004/11/08/6138.aspx?page=1), but if the study relied on blood testing for its evidence, it may suffer from exactly the type of flaw cited in the sciencedaily article... and the news-medical.net author admits that further study is needed before applying the concept to medical treatment.     
    
Regardless, one must also consider the fact that even with elevated levels following childbirth, women are still exposed to a lower level of testosterone than men, and shortness of male lifespan is not attributed to elevated testosterone, but to [other factors](http://men.webmd.com/features/why-mens-lives-are-shorter-than-women), some of which [can be linked to *decreased* testosterone](http://kwikblog.kwikmed.com/2012/04/17/preliminary-research-shows-potential-benefits-of-testosterone-for-heart-failure-patients/). Certainly, if testosterone were as dangerous as suggested in that one line of the article, there would be more evidence in the portion of the population whose testosterone is generally higher. 
    
The Daily Mail article also suggested that the size of baby boys had an effect. However, the size of baby girls varies among women, as well, and there is nothing in any of the articles to suggest that the study controlled for that factor. Further, the difference in weight we're discussing here is an average of 100 grams (about 3.5 ounces,) not a huge gap in weight. Birth weight of babies can vary by a few pounds, and has [increased over the last generation](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=9&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;ved=0CH8QFjAI&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Faje.oxfordjournals.org%2Fcontent%2F144%2F6%2F563.full.pdf&amp;amp;ei=uuEvUf3nO4e_0QGOhIHYCA&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNFwbqJiQZNjmS-wF-2DxbQ2tmpHmA&amp;amp;sig2=ZyxhQ7EPyAoCNgQD93IqbQ&amp;amp;bvm=bv.43148975,d.dmQ), possibly [due to changes in nutrition, and apparently also affected by the mother's weight](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2022126/Why-todays-babies-born-BIG.html).     
    
There is also nothing to show whether the cited study controlled for hereditary health concerns or environmental factors unrelated to pregnancy or the sex of one's babies.     

This leaves us with a study which may be flawed in its failure to take into account factors affecting its subjects, is made inapplicable to modern populations by medical advancement, changes in environment, and changes in family planning, and doesn't provide conclusive evidence of the assertion made in the story's headline.
   
In the end, the article did provide an example in answer to two questions.     
How badly is modern media biased against males?     
How far are they willing to bend in the exercise of that bias?     
Apparently the answer is at least to the point of publishing glaring misrepresentations and exaggerations of the results of narrowly (if at all) applicable studies, if such can be done in a way that casts a negative light on the human male."

19faqw,17,2013-02-28,Radio Submission,jesubear,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/19faqw/radio_submission/,"For about two years now, I've worked at a small radio station a town over from my college. I'm on a team of student interns that gets paid minimum wage to listen to new music submissions as they come in and determine if they are appropriate for airing by our station's format (mostly alternative and indie rock) and by the FCC. Interns don't get airtime, but it's still one of the best jobs I've ever had.

Obviously, some of the submissions we get are memorably bad or odd. Hair metal, tons of experimental shit, even more generic blues music (seriously, I have been turned off from the blues genre now...whoever sends this stuff, stop it) We've had one guy send in these grainy mp3s of him learning how to play guitar for the past year. Not teaching a song, mind you...he records himself for thirty minutes *learning* basic chords and grunting a lot. I easily have a compilation's worth of bad recordings and songs I've saved, but that's not why I'm posting.

**I got [this file](http://picosong.com/n28J/) sent to my station inbox about a month ago and I can't figure out.** I call it a file because it's definitely not music, nor is it the emergency alert system test sounds the station plays. It does sound like a code of sorts looping over and over with the sound of something crashing below it. *Note for headphone users: it gets loud towards the end.* Also towards the end, there's two clips that sound like human voices, but I can't hear what they're saying. I've shown this to all the interns and one of the managers at the station...us interns are kind of freaked out by it, but the manager said just delete it.

Before I got rid it though, I wanted to post it here and see if anyone could make sense of it. Yes, the file's info said it was created in 2002, so I don't know why we're getting it now.

Or just learn the basics and seek out an internship?,Dante2k4,web_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/19f3nm/bachelors_degree_in_cs_or_just_learn_the_basics/,"I recently posted a topic here about dealing with uncertainty when first attempting to tackle this field. Everybody that posted was *very* helpful for a variety of different reasons, but one thing I noticed that was a pretty common suggestion was that I should find a job or internship or something with a company and learn from *that.*

Right now I'm learning the basics at a community college so that I can earn my transfer degree, then move on to a university and earn a bacherlors in computer science. Thing is, I feel like I'm wasting *so* much time meeting the requirements of all these other classes, which aren't teaching me *anything* relevant to what I need to know. I'm an excellent writer, I know as much math as I need, science isn't gonna help me with jack at this point, and my social science teachers have all been terrible. I *hate* taking these classes and wasting time and money on them, but I've been making myself do it so that I can transfer to my university as a junior and get my bacherlors done.

But then I'm not even sure if a bachelors is actually necessary! I know that having a degree just by itself will make me look better... but I've heard *so* many tales of people who no degree who make it in this field simply because they have the knowledge to do their jobs.

So, you all were *so* helpful to me before, I figured I'd come to you again and ask, how much do you value a degree in regards to web development? Or even in general tech support type work, which I may end up doing as well?

I am *so* fed up with taking classes that don't teach me anything of real value, and I'm really genuinely contemplating just blowing all those classes off, taking the relevant computer science classes (web design, PHP, javascripting, hardware &amp; repair, etc), and looking for an internship or entry-level job of some kind.

So what do you all say? Should I just continue to endure the shitty classes and accumulating student loans? Or should I learn the necessities and look for work as soon as possible to gain experience on the job?

Also, something I thought of during the last topic when everybody was telling me to look into internships... where should I be looking? I don't actually know where you'd find those kinds of positions &gt;_&gt;"

Questions on if/how we should go about downgrading our 1 really used car/1 ok used car (2 cars total) situation to only 1 family car.**

Since I was late to read the [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/19d5kv/can_we_please_stop_saying_get_rid_of_your_car_as/) about 16 hours ago (In reddit time, that's about 2 weeks), I have a unique situation where my family is looking at the idea of downsizing our car situation. I didn't want to get buried and not get the your talented money saving minds to pick apart my predicament. 

**Back story:**

We're a two car family in the mountain west (of the US).  Under both our names, my wife and I bought a (pretty used) 2007 Dodge Caliber about a year and a half ago. We were bad in not being careful in getting it inspected and overall it still has about $1200 (non- detrimental) work needing done to it and our payments are already $190 a month (not including whatever insurance is.) It's a regretful situation, but it works okay enough. 
We're not gonna be heart broken to get rid of it though.

The other car is a 1993 Suzuki Sidekick and it's kinda on it's last leg. I've had it since my college years, about 2003. It's missing the driver side mirror (wife busted it off backing out of the driveway, lol), pretty busted driver side inner door mechanism, overall outer aesthetics have fallen off over time, squeaks and squeals when driving, the steering wheel sounds like the TARDIS when it's cold out and the roof leaks when it rains or the snow melts. It's been paid off and the upkeep has been standard barring the aesthetics and minor mechanical problems but the obvious noise issues could become deeper problems in the future.

My wife works full time, less than a 10 minute walk from home. I work part, timeless than a 10 minute drive from home and will be telecommuting a design internship.  We have a young son that's still in a car seat, so we would need a reliable car (which prompted our being duped into the Caliber). 

We're trying to pare down our lifestyles to afford everything with what little we make and the idea going down to one care came up. Still, with me? OK.

**So, the questions are:**

* Should we even try to trade both in, knowing the Sidekick could bring almost nothing to the table and we're only a few grand down on our payments on the Caliber?
* If we do, how and where should we go about finding the best deal.
* We know we're dumb asses for not getting the Caliber inspected, so what other things should we look at if we trade?
* Regarding choices, what would be the ideal used car for a one car family that would meet the essentials of lowered payments, reliability and functionality? We are **NOT** particular about aesthetic but sheer utility.

We appreciate any insight that you all can gives us. This can be another wonderful discussion about many other options of lifestyle changes as well. THANKS!"

This job is my sole income and barely keeps me afloat.

July 1st, however, I'll be doing a required 10-week, 400 hour **unpaid** internship. I'll have a student loan check of roughly $2000 to keep me afloat for the 3 months, but after that I'm worried I'll need a job immediately or I'll go under.

**My resources:**

$0 savings

$4300 credit limit on my main card ($0 charged to the card)

Public Transit is an option

$150/month EBT/Food




**My expenses:**

$460 - rent, utilities, phone, internet

$50 car insurance

$10 Gym

$60 Public Transit

$50 People food

$60 Dog food

$60 Additional gas

TOTAL: $750 (without ANY 'extracurricular' spending)




As you can see, $2000 would be gone by the time my internship was over and I'd be screwed if they didn't hire me on the spot (which is not likely).

So, do any of you have suggestions? For example, I could save most of my cash for rent and put the rest on my credit card in order to give myself a 'buffer' to get a job. I could also probably get by without the car, but (1) I don't want to suffer the insurance consequences, (2) I like my freedom and (3) it's a dying clunker that only (?) costs me about $110-150 a month.

Anyway, any and all help greatly appreciated. I'm trying not to worry, but I feel like the situation could quickly get ugly."

In Capstone and you're about to call a company for questions? Do some research first. Get on the company's webpage and dig around their technical site. Folks like to speak to ""intelligent"" students. 

Have an interview for a full-time, internship, or co-op position? Be early! Do not try to take Atlanta traffic into account if you think you're going to make it ""just in time"". Always have the mindset of being late when driving in Atlanta, especially if you have to drive through Atlanta. Also, if you're going to be more than 30 minutes late, call and cancel the interview (you should call regardless, but an hour is too excessive). Give your excuse and request an interview for a later date. Folks aren't sitting around at work just waiting to interview you, they're more than likely squeezing you into their schedule.

I’m really, infinitely sorry for posting this, but I’ve been reading other people’s problems and frustrations and everyone seems to feel better, even if just a little bit, after posting, and I just want to not feel like I’m going crazy anymore. I’m afraid of posting this because, on another internet forum of which I am a member, I asked for related advice and was attacked. I am ashamed to say I am a person who gets offended at words on the internet, and I know how dumb I am. Am I stupid for saying that? Ok onto the bullshit: 

Graduated in ’07 with a BFA, wanted to make video games more than anything else in the world. I knew it would be hard to get a job, and I didn’t even really believe in myself skill-wise, but I thought I could do it if I just worked as hard as I possibly could. School was too expensive, couldn’t seem to get any grants or scholarships, so I had to attend a community college my first year, but it was ok! I was filled with so much hope, and I worked very hard with my studies, got top grades in all of my classes, all while drawing like crazy on the side. Finally got to art school, signed my name onto $80k worth of private loans, but repeating in my mind what my admissions advisor said to me: “You are guarenteed a job!” I was an 18 year old kid with no concept of money: no one in my family went to college, parents didn’t want me to get a “useless” art degree anyway, blah blah blah I know I’m a fucking idiot for signing my name on that line but its in the past and I can’t change it. 
Couldn’t afford to not have a full-time job to pay for rent, food, gas, very little else. Lived off of ramen and got pretty ill after a while because of it, funny story related to this tidbit I will tell at a later time. 
Due to working a 35-40 hour a week job as well as school full time, my homework suffered a little. I could have been much worse with it, but because of my dedication I always received A+ grades, I just knew in my heart that I could have definitely done a lot better if I only had more time to try. One example of this is when I started to learn 3d: the place I worked was shutting down and so I spent more freetime than I wanted on finding something else, including going to my career services and asking for an internship but being denied because… nope, I don’t have any idea. I think the woman there just didn’t like me, I know it sounds like a bullshit excuse but I have no idea why a persistant, capable student was denied an internship. Maybe I just came off as a shithead and she didn’t want to waste anyone’s time, who knows. Anyway, I was better than most of my peers at 3d, but I definitely wasn’t the best, unlike my 2d skills where I was easily the best if not one of the best in all of my classes. (Not bragging or trying to sound confident here, there were/are a lot of people who go to “Video Game School” who have never drawn in their life, and since I started at 14 I had a bit of a head start)

I got better and better, and to date I’d say I’m a good artist (not great, excellent, amazing, etc.) and with fresh degree in hand, I landed an interview. It actually went amazingly well, but I did not get the job. I think I failed the art test because it was in 3d and not 2d where I am most strong, and there must have simply been a stronger candidate. Had to move home due to lack of funding (quit my job the last four months of school to focus on portfolio work) and back in with my mom in Indiana. 
Depression set in halfway through my BFA, and I hesitated to type this because I can still hear my mother saying “Depression isn’t a real illness” in the back of my mind, but it’s definitely real and it’s so, so awful. My relationships were strained, and luckily that was the only thing that suffered while in college, but after I got out and failed at getting the job I had worked so hard for, it took away everything. Because of strained relationships in college, I have limited contacts. In this industry I have heard a million times that it’s not about how good you are, but who you know. Fucked myself over pretty big I guess. 
I finally got a job doing something administrative, just to pay the bills. Sallie Mae calls and informs me of my impending $1100/month student loan payments. My job at the time paid around minimum wage, I made about $1000 a month. Keep applying, but notice that drawing becomes more and more difficult. 
Some life drama happens including all friends from college dropping off the face of the earth, my 14 year old dog died, a sinus infection with no health insurance, bf becomes distant, some other things too etc.
 Stop drawing altogether. 

2009: Move to Oregon with $1000 in my pocket, get an admin job, start drawing again. Risky, but I moved to be closer to more relevant jobs!
Admin job is at a call center, “hostile work environment”, too exhausted to work at night, but am able to create some things. 
Had my boyfriend of ten years fuck me over, long story short: I was working to support the both of us while he found a job in his industry of study, he was supposed to do the same for me. Once he landed a job (after 2.5 years of virtual unemployment) I quit my job to take a risky position as an artist at a start-up company. He couldn’t support us because he was shitty with money, we end up breaking up after he tells me he hasn’t loved me for years anyway. The start-up company tells me not to come back via email due to lack of work on their end. Extreme depression. Crawl back to my call center job after a month of desperately seeking employment. 
Start to feel myself again slowly but surely. An internet guy I was extremely close to in college (but the ex hated that I talked to) comes back into my life. He tells me he believes in me, and gets me to believe again, too. I start creating more. Internet guy visits and eventually moves here to upgrade into boyfriend status. We are finally happy! 
With something in my life going correctly, I start becoming more and more productive. Do some 3d freelance on the side, it exhausts me working so much, and 3d is infinitely frustrating since I’m not great at it, but I feel I am finally using my degree! One of my clients is a small company that sells ideas to Adidas. Most of my projects involve Adidas things, so when I later saw Adidas hiring an on-site, 3d Artist, I put together my portfolio and applied. Denial email less than 24 hours later. Accept that I must be just “passable” at 3d and definitely not “good” but I should simply work harder if I want to be employed doing it. Fighting off feeling really down about this acceptance. 

Stop doing freelance after this setback, but started doing projects that involve 2d things I enjoy more. 
Left crappy, emotionally manipulative call center job for a much more relaxing, higher paying job. Take on crazy projects. 
Currently: 
- indie game project where I am the only artist, it’s slow and challenging work but I am learning so much and will be delighted to complete! 
-illustrating a children’s book 
-getting ready to release my webcomic

Find out last month that my new job is not going to hire me on full time as I intially thought, and instead they’re letting me go in July all due to budget constraints. Was planning on relocating to Seattle due to less saturation in creative industries there. Overall more job opportunities, too. Not enough funds to move. 
Start looking for some kind of art job that I can apply to right now, something that I could definitely get hired for. Doing something creative, ANYTHING would make me feel less depressed and useless. Find nothing. 
Start looking for admin jobs. Nothing except considerable paycuts and more stress. Depression creeping back in.

What the fuck do I do with my stupid life? 

I'm sick of working administrative jobs where, it's childish to say, but I'm kind of always disrespected because it's a peon job or whatever. I am capable of working very hard and I accept that I must not be at a hirable skill level, but deciding what path to take is apparently my downfall. I can’t get hired because I lack experience, and I’m working for free on all these other projects hoping they will make me look good to employers, but I’m not sure if it will work. 
There seem to be more 3d jobs avaiable in general, in cities that I wouldn’t mind living, but I need to practice a hell of a lot more. I wouldn’t mind dropping everything and dedicating all of my free time into getting better at 3d, but if I stop doing 2d only to have all of my hard work not pay off again… I’m not sure if I could handle the disappointment. I love doing 2d, I’m best at it, but I’m finding a 9-5 decent paying (ie: not poverty level) job does not exist. I can do other things, I can use many different programs, but it seems like all of the jobs I’m seeing that are hiring require some other skill that I can’t even lie about having (ie: ability to code or program) I’m not sure we live in an economy that can support artists, or maybe I just haven’t worked hard enough. 
PS: I typed in a lot of incomplete sentences and I’m very sorry if it’s painful to read because of this, I was just trying to get it all out as quickly as possible. 


Tl;dr: I am a useless, talentless hack who cannot get a job. If anyone has any specific advice I would be greatly thankful.

19ehgk,6,2013-02-28,Bachelor of Mass Media?,[deleted],india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/19ehgk/bachelor_of_mass_media/,"Is it just me, or is that particular degree course incredibly popular? Why? Do students who study for that degree generally find employment without much difficulty? In general, do they go for a master's after that?

I just checked the courses covered in it, and it looks like it's like a ""communications"" degree, and the students can choose between focusing on advertising or journalism in their third year. 

Correct me if I'm wrong, but could a student studying for any other B.A (political science, English, history, philosophy etc) not find himself with similar job prospects simply by learning what they can on their own, and through internships? 

I do not mean to sound condescending. I'm just curious. If there are significant advantages to studying the BMM, I would be interested in knowing them.

I snooped around on Facebook to look for people who went to KMC in Delhi (wanted to ask some questions), and I saw one person who graduated with a degree in English who found internships in a for-profit environmental firm and a newspaper. I believe he eventually worked at the said newspaper. I wonder if there are others, or if he's just an exception. It's hard to come across that kind of information.

Note: I'm not from India, but I'm interested in studying there. Looks like a cool place to live in, though I haven't been there since 2005, and it's cheap enough to not cripple me with debt.

Thanks."

19edaj,71,2013-02-28,UPDATE: My Mother-in-law is driving me insane and I feel like she is taking advantage of us for money. Please help,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/19edaj/update_my_motherinlaw_is_driving_me_insane_and_i/,"[Link to original post here](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/199q4i/my_motherinlaw_is_driving_me_insane_and_i_feel/)


I spoke with my husband about how I felt about the whole situation, and he went over to his parents to discuss the situation. When he came home, he walked in the door and refused to speak to me. He stomped around the apartment cleaning up and would not acknowledge me at all. I finally asked him if he would like to talk, and he said ""about what?"" When I finally got him to talk, he explained to me that he forgot to tell me that his mom had told him before we even got married that she planned to claim him on her taxes for 2012. I was angry that he had this conversation and made a financial decision of that nature with his mother instead of me, and he said ""we weren't even married yet anyway!"" I then asked him why he is okay with his mom taking his education credit, because it is for his education which he pays for in full and the fact that we owe the government over $40,000 for our education. He explained that when he went to his parents, they sobbed and said they are in a bad place financially, so he decided to give them his education credit money as a gift to ""help them out."" I, admittedly, lost my cool and freaked the f out. I can't believe that he sat down and talked to me and felt uncomfortable with the situation, but then he went over there, listened to his parents cry for two hours, and suddenly he wants to help them out. 

I am the most upset that he made a large financial decision with his parents and omitted me from discussion entirely. When I explained to him why I felt uncomfortable with the way that his mother approached the situation, he screamed at me that I am insane and told me I had fifteen minutes before he was leaving. While I tried to talk him down, he repeatedly looked at his watch and then started putting on his coat and boots. I sobbed.. I couldn't believe he would leave me over something so small and so silly.. I can't believe I can't question his parents without him calling me insane. When I was talking, he shoved his finger in my mouth to prevent me from talking and lunged at me to get me out of the way of the door. I slapped his hand out of my mouth when he did this. I can't believe it escalated to this point.. I never expected it to become such a huge issue.

I am terrified at the fact that this is such a small issue.. In the big scheme of things, this is likely the smallest issue that we will encounter in our marriage. He divulged to me that he is a person that will ""do everything in his power to avoid conflict"" and feels that I do not pay enough attention to him and he is lonely (I work 60 hours a week, 16 hours a week are an unpaid internship, and I am also taking 3 college courses. I commute an hour one way four days a week - so he probably does feel lonely, I am friggin busy). 

I should have kept my cool and not gotten so upset. I should have prepared what I was going to say before he got home, because I knew that he would change his mind after talking to his parents. I knew he would side with them, because he always does. He purchased a vehicle without speaking to me once about it, he went over to his parents, stayed there for two days, and then surprise! He had a new car. He didn't even go to purchase the vehicle, his parents did it for him while he was working. There are many situations when he has made important financial decisions with his parents instead of me. I am offended that they feel that it is okay to make these kinds of decisions with their married son without considering his wife, and I am pissed that he thinks its okay to cut me out. He told me that I am ""too immature"" to make decisions with him, so ""until I grow up, he is going to keep making decisions with his parents.""

The whole ordeal ended with him calming down, telling me that he is trying to create boundaries, and that ""the taxes this year will be the last thing, I promise."" When I asked him how I was supposed to trust that he was going to make large financial decisions with me instead of his parents, he said ""yeah, I am totally going to go out and buy a boat and a vacation home. What other financial decisions will I be making in the near future anyway?"" 

I am shocked that he thinks it is okay to talk down to me. I am shocked that he thinks it is okay to decide financial stuff without me. I fear that, regardless of the situation, he will side with his parents. I refuse to ask him to choose between us because that is unfair. I don't want him to lose his family, I never had, but he insists that I am trying to force him to cut off his family. I don't want that. I know that if I did make him choose, he would not pick me. I don't know if I can live with that. "

I am currently a sophomore geology major who is interested in doing exploration geology for petroleum or minerals at some point down the road. Although I haven't taken field camp, I am willing to get down and dirty in order to aquire hands on geology experience.  I don't care about the location, hours, and working conditions as long as it is in the US and it pays enough to scrape by.

Can you suggest to me some companies that will take on a student who is willing to learn the job in and out? I have no previous work experience in the geology field but I have done coursework in calculus, chemistry, petrology, mineralogy, sedimentology and stratigraphy, introductory geophysics, undergraduate research on deep ocean sediment cores and structural geology so far. I am 19, fit, a quick learner, and my only previous jobs include being a waiter/barista.

My only experience in the field has been a two week trip to study the geology of the Western US, a two week trip to study the geology of Death Valley, and a two week trip studying the geology of Texas. None of the trips required mapping, but i could pick it up quickly. All the internships that I have looked at so far want someone who has completed field camp and is in the terminal year of the degree. That being said, I will take any job that lets me work alongside geologists 

I will be available from May 25th untill August 27th in the summer. I would also be available to work the next summer directly following my six week field camp. If you need a sharp kid who will work hard, can you point me in the right direction? Thanks!"

Reddit fights the good fight.",[deleted],circlebroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/19dp76/college_is_a_sham_and_our_parents_are_to_blame/,"Tonight I saw [this](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/19ckk3/oh_yeah_let_me_just_put_on_my_job_helmet_jump/) thread in r/adviceanimals. Upon seeing it, I knew it would be good.

In it, OP dares to talk back to his parents (by complaining to Reddit) because they are mad at him for not getting a job outside of college. Now, getting chewed out by your parents sucks. It sucks to let them down. And if OP worked his ass off in college, got good grades, did internships, networked, applied to 100+ places, and *still* didn't get a job, being called a failure by his/her parents would certainly hurt. While this is pure conjecture because we have no proof, I'd be willing to be that's not what OP did. OP is a Redditor of over 1 year. Likely spent college pissing it away on the internet, doing good enough in class to not get in trouble, partying, and generally enjoying being young. But that is neither here nor there. Let's get to the circlejerking!

We know what Reddit's general population consists of. 16-24 year old, white, upper middle class, above average intelligence, underachieving, lazy, self absorbed males. Mostly. And the world doesn't care about them. Who's fault is that? Not theirs, to be sure. Let's see how Reddit weighs in on the topic...

First post is a joke about internet job offers. Second highest post is luckily about calling the OP out on being lazy. After that, the good stuff.

[My parents are mad at me even though I took their advice!](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/19ckk3/oh_yeah_let_me_just_put_on_my_job_helmet_jump/c8mswb6)

&gt;It's funny because my parents do the same thing and I went into my major based on their advice

Did you do well in college? Or did you get the major your parents wanted you to get, thinking that's all they cared about? A piece of paper?

[College isn't useful anymore.](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/19ckk3/oh_yeah_let_me_just_put_on_my_job_helmet_jump/c8myphg)

&gt; The trope ""You're guaranteed a good job with a Bachelor's degree"" hasn't been true at all for the last 30 years. I wish my parent's hadn't convinced me college was the only way to go, because although it worked for them, college these days is a great way to saddle yourself with meaningless debt early in life.

You heard if here first folks. College was only useful in the 80s! Probably because jobs existed and Reagon was God! No more use to them any more. Oh, and college just gives you debt. Always. No such things as scholarships for the *average* person. (Because why should we have worked hard to get those good grades in high school?)

[Entry level doesn't mean experience???](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/19ckk3/oh_yeah_let_me_just_put_on_my_job_helmet_jump/c8murzq)

&gt;If job companys didnt require 2yrs minimum experience on a job that is listed as ""beginner"" we may be alrite.

This one always gets me. Redditors never seem to understand that entry level positions in a company do not mean no experience. It just means it is the bottom job in the ladder that is the company structure.  But if *every* company requires some experience (Protip: they don't.), where can we get experience??? Quick, answer this: How many internships did you get during your 3-4 summers in college?

[DAE STEM?](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/19ckk3/oh_yeah_let_me_just_put_on_my_job_helmet_jump/c8mwnv6)

&gt;Sounds like a classic case of picked a bad major.

We must all be STEM majors! After all, only those with STEM degrees can get jobs and are useful to society. There are no other careers nor jobs available to those who study anything else. At all. So don't study anything but STEM. And get me my coffee, plebe.

[DAE STEM HARDER???](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/19ckk3/oh_yeah_let_me_just_put_on_my_job_helmet_jump/c8mweea)

&gt;LifeProTips:
Get a degree in a field in high demand, like mathematics
Don't blow off your work while you're in school (a 3.5GPA is not hard to obtain if you do the work)
Become friends with your professors; they can help you find work

Step 1. STEM. Step 2. Be rich. Oh and by the way, even though STEM degrees are of *higher grade* than other lowly degrees, they're easy to get. 3.5 is easy, *if you just want it*.

[We are all brainwashed!](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/19ckk3/oh_yeah_let_me_just_put_on_my_job_helmet_jump/c8my663)

&gt;Feel like the idea that ""college = high paying job"" is bullshit. Like everyone fell for a sales pitch...oh wait.

College is bullshit! Even if we [ignore data that proves those with college degrees earn more and are employed more.](http://www.bls.gov/emp/ep_chart_001.htm)

[The world is hard, and that's my excuse.](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/19ckk3/oh_yeah_let_me_just_put_on_my_job_helmet_jump/c8mydv1)

&gt;I know how OP feels, the biggest problem being my parents don't understand the job market at all. When they got their degrees in the 70's it was actually a special thing, as not as many people had them. Now you are competing with every single other person.

It's almost like... you *are* competing with people for jobs... and that's a bad thing?

19dgnz,1,2013-02-27,Advice on internship offers?,[deleted],FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/19dgnz/advice_on_internship_offers/,"Recieved internship offers from two separate companies, one for accounting in a #2 domestic oil &amp; gas firm, and one is a $114 bn pension fund for a very large state.

I wonder about my options - the oil &amp; gas firm has more pay (~+750 month, 8% match 401k, relocation assistance), but is based in accounting and my role would be mainly as an accounting analyst.

On the other hand, I would work in investment management (perhaps TAA or SAA, Internal Equities) for the pension fund, but lose some attractive benefits, but get the chance to expand into a career in investment management, etc (pension fund works with PIMCO, JPM, etc).

I have both an accounting and finance background, and have more relevant background in investment management (fixed income and foreign equities analyst in an Endowment Fund). I like, but am not as interested in accounting as I am in finance (who is?).

My main question is, what does Reddit think about the post-internship prospects of these offers? Both are reputable, large, but the oil &amp; gas firm may have more resources. 

When I'm looking into full-time, post-graduation positions, which is more relative?

TL;DR Two job offers, accounting or finance. Which will help me the most in the future?"

I'm past the First Interview stage with one of the Big 4. And I was excited to pick up the phone when they called me a couple of days later, but instead of the usual spiel inviting me to the second rounds, they just asked me out on a one-on-one coffee date with a manager.

I googled enough to figure that this is what we call a *casual interview* in the industry, but what in the world is this in terms of recruiting? I don't have enough friends applying to this particular firm to know whether this is a common next step after the first round, so I'm coming to you guys in hopes that you can speak from experience.

I'm enrolled in dual admissions, so in order for my credits to transfer (and to make college more affordable), I opted not to transfer out before earning my associate degree. 

I'm not really sure where to go from here in order to take the next step in building my career because I am afraid that spending so much time in community college isn't exactly attractive to the bigger public accounting firms for internships.  On top of school, I'm currently working part time at a small firm run by a CPA that handles small business and individual tax preparation.  They haven't made it clear if they will need me after busy season, so I was wondering if anyone had any advice on where I should go from here.  I would like to work Big 4 eventually, should I be applying for their summer leadership programs even though I will only have completed community college?  Thanks."

Sell a gun to someone who smokes a joint, get 20 years in jail",coryfdw100,Firearms,https://www.reddit.com/r/Firearms/comments/19d9mr/smoke_a_joint_get_an_obamapass_sell_a_gun_to/,"I received this email from GOA don't know if it's been posted or not yet but the full text is below

&gt;  Smoke a Joint, Get an ObamaPass
&gt;Sell a gun to someone who smokes a joint, get 20 years in jail
 
&gt;It’s Looney Toons on Capitol Hill.
 
&gt;Everyone’s heard about the “red herring” Feinstein Gun Ban, which “red state Democrats” will vote down in order to pretend they’re “pro-gun.”
 
&gt;But the bigger danger is that Obama will sign “non-controversial” gun control which is just as dangerous, but no one but us is talking about.
 
&gt;Take the gun licensure bill which anti-gunners are trying to dub the “gun trafficking bill.”  In the Senate, the bill is S. 54, and was introduced by Judiciary Committee Chairman Pat Leahy (D-VT) -- although it appears that it could have been drafted by an intern.
 
&gt;GOOFBALL PROVISION #1:  The bill would impose a 20-year prison term if you planned (“conspired”) to purchase a firearm in order to give or raffle it to a person who, unbeknownst to you, is a “prohibited person.”
 
&gt;Who is a prohibited person? 
 
&gt;Well, there are the 150,000 law-abiding veterans who are “prohibited persons” –- for no other reason than that a psychiatrist appointed a fiduciary to oversee their financial affairs. 
 
&gt;But probably the biggest category of “prohibited persons” is persons who smoke marijuana.  Under 18 U.S.C. 922(d)(3) and (g)(3), you cannot possess a firearm in America if you are “an unlawful user of ... any controlled substance...”
 
&gt;In over a dozen states, marijuana has been wholly or partly legalized under STATE law. 
 
&gt;It doesn’t matter ... if you even think about selling or raffling a gun to this expanding class of persons, you can go to prison for 20 years under S. 54.
 
&gt;GOOFBALL PROVISION #2:  The bill would make you a federal “prohibited person” if you are prohibited from owning a gun under “State or local law.”
 
&gt;What does that even mean?
 
&gt;In places like New York and Chicago, everyone is prohibited from owning a firearm without a license.  Does that mean that everyone in these jurisdictions is a federal “prohibited person” under S. 54? 
 
&gt;What if someone applies for a license and is found not to have a need to possess one?  Under the slip-shod language of the Leahy bill, these individuals would probably become federal “prohibited persons” because the bill denies any person from owning a firearm if they are “prohibited by STATE OR LOCAL LAW from possessing, receiving, selling, shipping, transporting, transferring, or otherwise disposing of the firearm or ammunition.” (S. 54, Section 5.)
 
&gt;Oh, incidentally, under the Veterans Disarmament Act, states are required to send the names of 95% of their prohibited persons to the FBI’s NICS system -– or lose federal funding. 
 
&gt;So now you will have millions of law-abiding citizens -- living in places like New York City and Chicago -- who have their names placed in the NICS system.  And the Leahy bill doesn’t address some very important questions related to their status as gun owners. 
 
&gt;How will these banned citizens get their names cleared? The federal government has for years continued enforcing the Schumer amendment which defunds the ability of the ATF to restore the rights of non-violent prohibited persons. Will New Yorkers and Chicagoans get their gun rights restored after they move away from the localities that banned them from owning guns and which turned them into prohibited persons?
 
&gt;Again, the bill doesn’t say.  But we could expect that a few years from now, a future anti-gun President could use the language in S. 54 to impose a federal licensure requirement on these persons -- as part of a new 23-point Executive Action memo -- and make non-licensees federal prohibited persons (with all that that implies).
 
&gt;Maybe –- just maybe -– the courts would save us from the implications of Leahy’s goofball language.
 
&gt;But answer us this:  Why do anti-gun senators and representatives continue to push language which they know is fatally flawed –- just so they can say they “broke the back of the gun lobby”? 
 
&gt;The solution is clear:  Senators –- if they are pro-gun -– MUST vote against a “motion to proceed” to any of this goofball legislation.  That is, they must vote to keep ALL gun control from even being considered on the Senate floor.

19d5yy,3,2013-02-27,Why is there a dedicated link to donating to MPP? There are much better reform organizations.,puck342,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/19d5yy/why_is_there_a_dedicated_link_to_donating_to_mpp/,"Hello fellow Ents,
   
As I am sure many of you are aware, there are many drug policy reform organizations around the country, ranging from the local to the state to the national (and even international) level. Some of them are more effective than others, some have a better track record and some are just more visible (Like NORML, super visible, fairly ineffective).
   
I'll admit I haven't been on r/trees lately, getting most of my r/trees content from my frontpage. When I navigated over to r/trees today I saw a dedicated link to donating to the Marijuana Policy Project, which made me really, really uncomfortable. 
  
Not only has this subreddit been marred before by unethical economic directing on the part of one of it's mods (the whole MFLB incident), but the MPP is an organization that has been largely gutted in terms of staff and efficacy in the wake of the [sex scandal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marijuana_Policy_Project#Sex_scandal) in 2009 that caused 7 of its staffers to quit.
   
I speak from some experience. I have worked with or worked for a number of drug policy reform organizations, either for a specific event, a given campaign, a summer internship or in conjunction with my studies when I was still in college. These include the Drug Policy Alliance (DPA), Americans for Safe Access (ASA), Students for Sensible Drug Policy (SSDP), Law Enforcement Against Prohibition (LEAP), MassCann/MassNORML (MassCann), and while working with and alongside these organizations, it became very clear that people's money is not used equally efficiently or effectively by them all.
   
So to see the only dedicated link (all highlit in red and whatnot) be for the Marijuana Policy Project, who have a very checkered reputation amongst drug policy reform activists for placing an overly large amount of value on who (namely, them) gets the ""credit"" for the policy change, as well as being led by a man named Rob Kampia, who in addition to refusing to leave the organization for the good of the cause in the wake of his sex scandal in 2009, doggedly returned, after which many (if not most) major donors seriously if not entirely pulled out, greatly reducing their effectiveness, as well as the lingering stigma of a sex scandal adding more emotive layers to an already loaded subject.
  
If I had to make a top 3, I would say that Students for Sensible Drug Policy (SSDP), Law Enforcement Against Prohibition (LEAP) and the Drug Policy Alliance (DPA) probably use their money most effectively, with SSDP changing policies on college campuses all over the country, some of which have become the models for a state's eventual change (like in Rhode Island). 
Law Enforcement Against Prohibition sends speakers all over the country who are all former law enforcement to speak out against the inefficacy of the drug war. Their speeches are incredibly powerful, and I know of more than one drug policy reformer who got into the cause after seeing a LEAP speaker. 
The Drug Policy Alliance (DPA) is a wonderful umbrella organization for the movement that holds conferences, advertises, and engages people at the higher levels of policy making to induce drug policy reform, as well as fueling other drug policy reform organizations through its grant work.
  
TL;DR - Having a dedicated link to only one reform organization on r/trees is ridiculous, having it be the MPP is actually just stupid. There are many more effective and efficient drug policy reform organizations, and minimally people should have options in their donations, at least reasonable options. If you want to donate, donate to LEAP, SSDP, or the DPA. They're better."
