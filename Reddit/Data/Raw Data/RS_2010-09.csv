This wouldn't be a big deal but like an idiot, I used a username that was the same as my screenname for chat clients and it's the same as my email address. It never occurred to me that someone can just google it and see what will come up.

So the real shitty thing is that some douche I'm competing with for a position just realized that fact about my username and he's threatening to tell the managers of this internship I'm trying to get (he did say it in a joking manner, but knowing him... it wouldn't be beyond him). Those posts are very embarrassing and they're from like 5 years ago and I don't want this fucking up my opportunity at a job for the first time in my life. I tried asking the web hosts to try to take it down from the Google index, but none would budge.

I feel helpless. And yes, I am now getting a new email address and screenname and everything. I just don't want this word getting out, either. The fact that my friends can see this is really making me cringe.

And yes, I have learned the most important rule about the Internet: everything is permanent. Lesson learned the hard way."

Basically I have a very severe case of emotional abuse going on at home that I can't even remember a day without it happening in at least 10 years.  I'm 21 years old living at home (not by choice) and just trying to make it from day to day.  This is not your average kid complaining about stupid rules.  This is real emotional abuse.  Every single day of my life I have tried to simply avoid contact with my parents but I can't escape them.  My mother being the real issue, where my father is simply not willing to argue with her.  Life is easier for him to just accept what she says.  That's just how she is.  It's really hard to describe but more or less it is actually killing me.  I've developed severe anxiety and I'm certain that they are the cause.  I wake up every single morning dreading my life.  I'm scared that if it wasn't for my girlfriend I would have killed myself already.  It's that bad.  I feel like I can't live here any more but due to financial issues I will be stuck here for at least a year most likely, but then again I have been saying that year after year.  I am working as much as I can but my boss can't hire me full time due to budget cuts.  I am per diem with no benefits at all. 

I have no friends so I can't move in with anyone to just get away until I can afford to save up to get the first apartment I can afford.  My parents also make me pay rent which is making things harder since it's just more time trapped at home.  I do think paying rent would be fair normally, but I can't get out since they are making it impossible for me to leave while at the same time giving me a daily reminder that ""They hate me and can't wait until I leave.""

I'm trying not to turn this into a sob story but I'm pretty depressed and after at least 7 years of therapy and trying various anti-anxiety and anti-depressant meds I am literally out of options.  I feel like my life has been wasted so far and I really want to just be okay for once.  

Does anyone have any advice based on similar life experience?  Does anyone living in the Middlesex/North Shore area of MASS need a roomate who is willing to pay rent and take up as little space as you want and is willing to share everything I own?  I need to keep my current job because it pays far more than any other options I will get without a degree.  I work in PC support and hope to use the skills I have gained on my own to make it a career.  Luckily I got the internship in high school which is the only reason I have a job.  It was impossible for me to have paid for college without anyone to co-sign a loan so I accepted that I will have to work my way up the ladder of the IT world.  Just anything at all.  I'm out of places to turn so I sucked it up ignored my shame and posted this online.  Hopefully you don't all think I'm just exaggerating or taking things out of proportion.  I just really need some help and no one has been able to provide any at all.  Please help me.  "

SPOILERS",MrAvenue,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/d8fag/reddit_thoughts_on_the_film_moon2009_sam_rockwell/,"I finally watched it last night. Besides some obvious scientific errors, which come with all sci-fi movies, I though it was superb. Sometime before I watched the film I had accidentally spoiled it for myself. Therefore, going into the film I figured I already knew the key plot twist(the new clone finds the old clone), but I was shocked and pleasantly surprised when that fact was revealed fairly early in the movie. However, at the end of the film I was left with a few question which maybe some of you could provide some insight:

* With the way that both Sams reacted to each other, it made me think that they already had some notion to the ""clone program"" or they were smart enough to figure it out.(I am having issues wording this one)

* Is young woman that Sam 1 sees in the chair in the rec room and on the surface when he crashes his daughter at her current age?

* Sam 1's declining health is never explained. I came to the conclusion that 3 years is the shelf life for a clone or, with GERTY continually asking him for something to eat, he is being poisoned as a result of the circumstances.

* When Sam 1 is being dropped off to the crashed rover so the Eliza team will find him, Sam 1 and Sam 2 have a conversation about Tess. They speak of things such as giving her the internship although she isn't qualified, but it is to keep her in the country. That, coupled with the video conversation with Sam's present day daughter and what we can only assume to be the original Sam, led me to believe that the original Sam Bell is the CEO/President of Lunar Industries.

Thoughts?

Which is why I'm turning to you all. I've got two years to hone my skills and prepare to do something challenging, cool, and/or impressive. As I mentioned before, hiking the Appalachian Trail is one idea. Maybe a biking trip up and down a coastline. After that, I'm pretty much out of ideas.

If you could spend two years preparing for something, what would it be? It should take between 1 to 2 weeks to complete and cost less than, say, $5000. I'm in the US, so traveling outside of the Americas would be pretty expensive.

Also, how would you prepare for it? Hitting the gym? Flying lessons?

I am looking around Tampa, FL for internships dealing with IT (specifically; Linux server administration for bushiness.)

I would love to get an internship somewhere locally to where I can hone my skills and get experience to someday be a Linux System Administrator.  I know a little bit of bash and python scripting, and use Linux on the desktop regularly, but I feel without experience I can't actually get a job somewhere or learn as much as I could.  I've tried chaining together a network of Linux VMs to try and teach myself, but it's just not the same as having real-world experience.

I made a resume, but I don't exactly know how to get started in looking around for companies that need interns, since Tampa is such a large area, I'm just lost on how to get my name out there.

I would love to get into a business with an IT structure and system admin in place to help out and learn from, but I'm just lost on how to get started in this process.  I'm specifically interested on how samba works and catering windows clients.  I've looked at books, but I feel like I could get so much more out of experience.

I thought this method would have worked, but I was wrong.

This is how we're going to do teams right now: I need people who want to be a captain to respond here. Once we have at the most 8 captains, they can pick 3 people for their team or choose not to pick 3 people. Once the captains have picked the people they want (must be three at the max),  players from the league can join whatever team they want when we post the roster of the teams of 4 or less. At the max, each team will have 9 players.

dabty,11,2010-09-06,Why not...? Part 2,ThrowawayAccount4324,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/dabty/why_not_part_2/,"Hi reddit,

i've [posted a few months ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/bzj1c/why_not/) and just wanted to give you an update. **There's no danger**, so please don't worry. I really tried to get a better more livable life, but it just won't work. I know it's only been 4 months, but you have to take the 10 years before that into consideration.

I still have brutal headaches every single day. In the last 3 weeks they have been even worse, because i started a 20 week internship that every college student here has to go through. Being very close to people every day for 9hours is horrible for me. The constant ""do they think i'm stupid?"", ""what did that strange look mean?"", etc. drives me insane. I just can't concentrate and pretty much stare at program code for 8 hours without being able to read/comprehend anything.

I tried pretty much everything you people told me to do. I went to three new medical doctors and got my whole body checked and all 3 results showed nothing an unusual. I'm way healthier than most people at my age. Now that's some fucked up irony, huh? They gave me a bunch of different useless pain medications and the names of some psychologists that i already visited and one that i don't want to visit, because he has a horrible reputation.

I exercise again. I still run/swim/cycle for more than 10-20km two or three times a week and it doesn't help much. It relieves my headaches a little, but it's barely noticable.

I even tried massages for 3 months, twice a week.  It helped to make my wallet a lot lighter, but other than that it didn't do much good ;).

Between all that good and healthy stuff i had some fun and did whatever the hell i wanted to. Parachuting, driving to the Italy because a buddy wanted to camp and drink at the beach, riding rollercoasters in an amusement park on ecstasy and acid (holy fuck that was an experience!)... Believe it or not, i actually had a threesome on camera, if that counts as starring in a porno. That was all fun while it lasted, but the second i was lying in bed, it all was gone again. The insomnia is/was, as always there (5 hours of sleep in the last 4 days), and the next day was/is as horrible as always. Now i'm completely broke and the thought of going to another country right now is pretty much on hold. I'm stuck here for a long time.

As i've mentioned i started my internship and damn it makes me hate life even more. No matter how hard i try, i won't be able to do any kind of job to have a decent kind of living. It doesn't matter if it's freelancing or a regular job. Just the thought of something forcing me to work drives me insane. I know how stupid this sounds, but that's just the way it is and hey, it's my life.

I went back to the only medication that seems to help: weed. I'm high right now, because i'm sure this day would have ended bad without it. It's the first time in 4 months and damn it feels good. Most of the things i wrote have been written down before i got high, so please don't think it has anything to do with that. But you know what? My lawyer called a few days ago and told me i have to be in court in a couple of weeks and he's guessing i have to do regular drug tests and pay a hefty fine! This is such a fucking joke. I will need to get a second job just so i can pay the huge fine for the unbelievable crime of smoking and owning a plant, that is harmless when compared to alcohol and cigarettes, in the comfort of my own home. No growing, no selling, just smoking and owning around 3gram of weed. Fuck that, seriously. There's no way i'm gonna pay and support that corrupt, idiotic system. But of course that's not all. They will bully me on a regular basis with their drug tests and if there's even a slight discrepancy i will lose my driver's license.

My ""friends"" are pretty much gone. We had some small adventures in the last 4 months, but after trying again and again i realized i couldn't have a serious conversation with them and pretty much stopped talking to them. It's better that way.

Last but not least, i talked to my sister. She had holidays for 4 weeks and it was a ""good"" timing. She was not as shocked as i suspected her to be. She knows i've been in pain every single day for such a long time. We talked for a long time and both cried, but at the end she understood it, at least to the point where i know she could handle it. She doesn't want me to see unhappy, in pain and struggle every single day. She said if it is the only way i can be ""happy"", she won't stand in my way.  It was so horrible to talk with her about all of that, but it looks like she knew how desperate i was and why i turned to her with such a horrible thing.

I know how i would do it. I already tried it on on some different materials and even metal burned away like it was paper. I'm guessing the only thing that will be left of me are some really small chunks of burned teeth... scattered across a huge area. There's no way anyone would stumble upon anything of my body. That takes care of the problem that somebody could find my body and be scarred for live. I'm almost a bit proud of my contraption. Wow, that's a morbid thing to say... :D

I still can't think of a reason why i should stay alive. There's really nothing keeping me alive anymore. Thanks for reading all that stuff. You people are awesome. I've said it at the beginning of this post and i'll say it again: there's no danger of me killing myself, so please don't worry. I just needed to get these things off my chest again.

Time to go to bed now. I'm not sure if i'll be able to answer tomorrow, because i have to work late."
dagkd,5,2010-09-07,Straight guys and Craigslist Sex,I_See_Nah_Nah,sex,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/dagkd/straight_guys_and_craigslist_sex/,"A quick note:  this has nothing to do with ""Adult Services"" being removed from Craigslist.  This relates to personals ads such as Casual Encounters and w4m

After moving to a certain major city and finishing an internship I found myself with quite a bit of downtime.  There was no longterm relationship looming over my head and all I had to worry about was paying the bills on my swanky new room.  The room itself had come from Craigslist fully furnished and left me wondering what else Craigslist was good for.  I’d already used CL to rideshare, sell textbooks, buy a computer and just make quick cash.

Honestly, who hasn’t noticed the personal ads and laughed about it?  We all know someone who has “checked the missed connections.”  What about actually getting dates or hooking up... this is the part where the conversations change direction.  Coincidentally, there was no one around for me to joke with as everyone I knew was almost 24 hours away by car.  I figure why not live dangerously.

Too timid the make my own posting at first, I began an CL RSS subscription that I would check before and after work.  It didn’t take long for me to realize that most of the female postings for the entire city were fake unless they’d been posted by overweight women, disgruntled wives or single mothers.  Also, the majority of fake posting are put up later in the evening.  One will find it a little easier to narrow down selection by grammar and a basic comprehension of the English language.  Desperate ads are commonly written by bots waiting to verify your identity through a credit card.

After about ten days of this I decided to create a fake e-mail to send some replies and post an ad.  Note:  Always use a fake e-mail address from a legit site.  Know that nothing gives away a BS ad like lghji53k4@g-mail.com so the sender should be the first thing you check.  If there is any interest in this post I can create a handy little cheat sheet or flow chart for identifying real Craigslist sex opportunities.  

On to pictures:  On the subject of pictures I have a few thoughts.  In my opinion one should never use a picture in their Craigslist ad that reveals their true identity.  This is a horrible idea that could easily backfire on you as anyone can see it.  The correct response is always to meet in a public space and verify who you are hooking up with.  imho Anyone who refuses to do this is not worth my time.  Also, general dating listings on Craigslist is just as, probably more, effective at hooking you up.  If you play things cool (with the few legit people who respond) you might end up getting them interested enough to make your dreams come true.  It paid off for me twice over a two week span and both women were quite fun.

CE works like an ongoing game of Yahoo Chess.  The difference is eventually the only way to truly meet others becomes posting an ad and filtering through the endless spam that will follow.  Maybe only 1 real woman will respond out of 50, but that is the whole point.  This is especially true for men.  One of the women I ended up with said she’d had over 57 men contact her in less than a couple hours a few weeks earlier after she stupidly included a phone number.  Most of the responses will not take the time to actually read your ad, which is your key to filtering responses.

In the end CL works far better for the queer community, which has tons of better online options, and a few brave, selective women who aren’t yet familiar with where they are.  This leaves us straight dudes with little to go on besides a general sense of disbelief.  Even after posting you should expect to wait days before getting anything resembling a real person, but it does happen.  Just remember to double bag it and get tested afterwards.

Best of luck!"
dajtm,1,2010-09-07,What political label do I fit under?,tagus,politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/dajtm/what_political_label_do_i_fit_under/,"So I wrote my Congressman for the first time ever in my life and I figured that it'd be cool to share it with the intertubes so that I can see which party people think I can associate most with... because I have no idea.  I chose Independent when I registered due to ignorance of the platforms.  I also figure that seeing someone's actual letter might inspire someone to do something similar.  I'm ignorant of this whole process.

Anyway, here's the letter I wrote:
---
===================
Dear Representative X (or Dr. X, I'm not sure which you prefer),

I'm a constituent of yours and I thought that instead of writing a bunch of letters to annoy your aides and interns or whoever will probably end up reading this, it would be smarter to just write one letter detailing my stance on many of the more current issues of our day.

I hope that the actual you can read or skim this along with the many other letters to get a better idea of how your people feel, as opposed to just listening to lobbyists (I admit that I'm fairly ignorant of the whole ""who's in bed with who"" tabloid gossip when it comes to politics).

Anyway, here's my list:

First, I am one hundred percent for having my tax dollars help to pay for the medical expenses of every person that I see on the street and on a personal note I think that anyone who doesn't feel that same way with at least me should be ashamed of themselves as a human being.

Second, I am also one hundred percent for the war in Afghanistan, or more accurately, the war against the people who were behind the September 11th attacks.  (although I don't have much regard for at least some of the private companies fighting alongside our soldiers because of the bad PR of some of their bad apples)

Third, I am one hundred percent for an increase in the wage of the average teacher.  I could have been a teacher myself but I turned it down because I didn't want to be that poor coming out of college when there were other more lucrative possibilities.  Perhaps when I'm older and already have my own small degree of wealth, I can get a teaching license.  Since teaching is one of the most basic of public services, I think that the justification for this is self-evident.

One of the frequent arguments I hear on C-Span or in the news is along the lines of, ""Well, how can we pay for all of this?"".  To this I say, ""Our country has been shitting money left and right for the past several decades and we've been number one in the world without exception for the entire time.  We earmark practically every bill that passes.  I don't see your point.""

On the topic of immigration, I am vehemently against having anything like the Arizona law that has been in the news recently arrive here in Louisiana or even any other part of the nation for that matter.  If Arizona honestly believes that that kind of thing is necessary, then okay.  Its none of my business what they're doing.

On the topic of guns, I'm completely for allowing the sale of all of them.  For automatic weapons though, the regulations should be much more strict than for the handguns for (what to me are) obvious reasons.

On the topic of the housing market and all of the things that are associated nowadays with that in the media, I cannot help but be reminded of being taught in school about the free market.  I readily admit my ignorance of the more intricate economic stuff, but my naivete says to just let it fix itself.  If companies go under, new ones without the stench of bankruptcy will always be ready to jump in and replace them at a moments notice, because there is always money to be made in this country.

On the topic if drugs, specifically and only marijuana, I'm for its legalization, but only if it is taxed.  I think that my generation (as well as the younger ones) have collectively not been convinced of its need to be illegal.

On the topic of the poor, I can only echo something that Constable Odo from one of the Star Trek shows once said: ""What better way to judge a society than to observe how they treat their poor and helpless?""

As for Homeland Security, I'm not convinced of their necessity.  I think that the Department was created out of fear and I think that the Department of Defense and the National Security Agency can handle their job just fine.  Besides, I've heard in the news that there are far too many people in the Intelligence business as it is.

As for agriculture, I have to admit I'm the most ignorant of the issues here for anything else, so I won't say anything about it.  I just wanted to acknowledge it.

On the topic of Natural Resources, I can't help but be reminded that the plaintiffs of the Exxon-Valdez case still haven't been fully compensated yet even though they posted their largest profit in history last Quarter (or was it the Quarter before that? The timing might be a bit sketchy there) from what I remember reading in the news at the time.  I don't think that we should over exert ourselves financially alone as a nation to help clean up the oil spill, but I do believe that our government has a responsibility to at the very least do the best that its people will pay for.

On the topic of taxes, I am completely for any increase in taxes, but only if I am convinced that it will not go toward someone's earmark.  I want my taxes to pay for what the troops need, for the health care of my countrymen, and for the further development of our society.  In fact, I want my taxes to not only be the minimum necessary, but a little bit above that minimum to ensure that our soldiers get not just a trash can lid for body armor but the good kind... like Kevlar or whatever they use.  Government cheese may be nasty, but if we give more than we need to then the cheese will only get better (assuming that the appropriate people are doing their job with the budgeting).




The most important issue to me personally, though, is the Net Neutrality matter.  I don't think I need to explain my reasons why because I'm sure that you don't care about that, but I am one hundred percent AGAINST allowing the people from whom I buy my internet access to allow for one website to purposefully load faster than another.

I'll repeat that for emphasis purposes:  I want the Net to remain Neutral.  This will be an extremely important and key issue for me in November.

Regards

PS: As an aside, I'd like to see your campaigns emphasize what you voted ""Aye"" on, rather than ""Nay"" like all of the other people's campaigns that I've heard of in the country.

dal21,3,2010-09-07,I want to work at this card shop...how can I convince the owners to hire?,KrosTrikare,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dal21/i_want_to_work_at_this_card_shophow_can_i/,"Hey everyone. First post to /r/AskReddit, so, I sincerely hope this is an appropriate question.

I've been going to a local card/board game store for a few months now. They sell games like Magic: The Gathering, Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, and that sort of thing. I'm an avid player of the foremost of those mentioned, and I quickly got swept up in the community.

The shop has been around for about two years now and is family owned. They aren't hiring due to barely being able to get by. Recently I've been helping out at the shop during tournament nights, helping run them and judge them but, I haven't really gone past that.

I'm **very** interested in the business side of the place; I've always had a bit of a desire to run a store of my own and I've got this weird desire to help them do well even if I'm not getting paid for it (store credit would be fantastic, though, if they were to offer).

I've considered offering to do a sort of unpaid internship there (just to buff the resume). I've also tried to think of some sort of revenue stream that I could bring in that would pay me off + increase their profits. Maybe offer to run an online store (which they currently don't have)?

My question boils down to: I don't know exactly how to confront the owner(s) about this, nor what I could present to them to help sway their decision. Help?

Thanks all!

damzv,5,2010-09-07,Wondering about software engineering internships in Bris...,[deleted],brisbane,https://www.reddit.com/r/brisbane/comments/damzv/wondering_about_software_engineering_internships/,"Hi Brisbane Redditors,

I'm nearing the end of third year Software Systems &amp; Aerospace engineering @ UQ and I think it might be about time to start looking for an internship. Having never applied for something like that before, can someone give me a quick list of good software houses or aerospace companies in Brisbane? At a recent conference someone urged me to leave Brisbane to find a job (esp in Aerospace), but I think that's a tad defeatist.

I can program in Python, C, C++, Java (though a refresher is necessary - I'm not a fan) and AVR C (though that isn't necessarily a language unto itself). I'm also learning Brisbane-designed Qt through PyQt for a uni project.

I guess what I'm really looking for is a vacation internship this Christmas holidays, so if anyone has any tips, please let me know."
dave6,11,2010-09-07,"Reddit, I'm becoming cynical, misanthropic, and alienated. I feel like I'm drifting away from everything and everyone else, and I don't know what to do.",Blankoogron,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/dave6/reddit_im_becoming_cynical_misanthropic_and/,"I recently graduated university, and have, since that date, found work as a cook, on the opposite side of the country. While I have no expectation of finding a job I love right out of university, the job I work is a unique kind of hell from which there seems to be no escape. My coworkers do drugs and drink every fucking night, more or less. This is something I (no longer) do with any sort of frequency. I feel completely disconnected from these people, and from people in general. I'm no longer personable, I don't feel like I can laugh or joke with other people, and I'm increasingly nervous in social situations. All of these things never used to apply to me.

On the upside of things I've been working out religiously, and am in the best shape of my life. This doesn't change the fact that I see no way out of the hell that my life increasingly is becoming. I have no idea how to find work that doesn't involve the 12 hour clusterfuck that comprises a job working with food, and while I'm applying for teaching positions overseas, it does nothing to help the fact that it's near impossible to have something even approaching a social life when you work 30 hours every weekend, and upwards of 55 hours a week. 

I'm finding it increasingly difficult to see the bright side of things in life, and spend most of my time looking at others with scorn and derision. I don't know when I became such a spiteful, hateful person, but other people see it in me and they want nothing to do with me. I don't know if it's a result of the pressures I face at work, or something else entirely, but I feel like something has to change, because I'm becoming increasingly anhedonic and angry.

I spend most of my spare time playing video games, or working out, and the few times I have gone out drinking with people from work I've woken up with powerful feelings of guilt and shame, as I feel that I should be finding better ways to spend my money, and time on. 

I've quit my current job, as months of working 55 hour work weeks, even at a shitty rate of pay, has allowed me to accumulate a fair amount of money. I've applied for an internship in south-east asia, and am going to start applying for teaching positions in Korea, (which would make good use of my degree in english), but months of rejections from every job I've applied to have left me disheartened at my ability to anything even remotely meaningful with my life. While intellectually I see that there has to be a light at the end of the tunnel, I feel as if I am getting dumber, angrier, and more and more hopeless that life will ever again be something I experience any joy in.

I feel lost, so hopelessly lost, and don't know how to do anything worthwhile with my life. I hate myself for my failures, others for their successes, and have, bit by bit, driven away everyone who has ever cared me, save for my parents, with my cynicism and my anger. I have no idea what to do. I feel like I've been twisted into some horrible mirror image of what I used to be, and there doesn't seem to be any escape, and it's fucked, reddit. It's fucked.

I don't know what I'm expecting, exactly, but I just needed to get this out in the open. I spend more time alone than is healthy, and just want to know, reddit, what do I do? Maybe you have similar stories, where you've overcome these sorts of feelings? I don't know.

This is a throwaway account, too.

I remember how it felt to go to sleep as a child, feeling warm, with everything around you seeming in perfect order, and you fell into sleep with a perfect trajectory, bypassing the nightmares and dreams and waking up in the morning right where it should be, and everything as it should be, and now there's only the mess of my sheets and the emptiness of my white room to greet me, and Jesus I just don't know.

TL;DR I bitch about my life. I'm angry.

In my last year of high school I got really passionate for my subject, but by the time I realized my goals, it was too late. My SATs were shit, I hadn't bothered to work towards making an impressive application and I had only applied to two schools. I got accepted into a state school, but instead of going there, I decided to take the community college route in California (for the opportunity to transfer into UCs).

At this point, I'm almost sure that I'm going to transfer into UCSD, and it just so happens that UCSD has a really strong computer science program (thank god). I also stand a good chance at getting into Berkeley, but I'm pretty sure my parents are in a shitty financial situation. Even if I got accepted, I don't know if I should go. 

My problem is this: I feel like I've dug myself a hole by taking this route (through community college). Lately I've been hearing that I need experience working/ interning/ researching and recommendations from professors to have any sort of chance to stand out in admissions for graduate programs. I haven't had the opportunity to do such things and when I transfer, I'll have even less time to attempt it. I can't take upper division classes and therefore I wouldn't be eligible for internships/ research positions. I don't know of any clubs or any serious local organizations to be involved in and I haven't the slightest clue where to look for internships (basically ANY sort of positions for learning and getting experience).

What the hell do I do?"

We have been exclusive since April or so and have definitely grown closer. I fell in love with her and she fell in love with me. 

There were tough times as well. We broke up for 5 days a few weeks ago over arguments we were having over petty things (IMO) but she convinced me that breaking up was irrational and that we could work through this hurtle so we got back together and it's been, honest to say, like those days when we first got together; quite amazing actually. 

At the same time, I knew she had an internship in a city a couple hours away. She knew it, I knew it that it was beginning to be the make or break of our relationship if we made it that far. She moved away on Sunday for the next 8 months and it's been shitty to say the least. I've done LDR's before (she hasn't) and I know how they work or actually, how they don't work. Despite all that, I love so many things about her and I feel special because I helped her through her recent diagnosis of Celiac. She has expressed to me how I mean so much to her and the thought of ending things pains me to think about...

I don't want to be single which is quite the opposite of how I would have felt a year ago. I thoroughly enjoy the companionship but now that she is gone and I can only expect to see her, at most, once a week (which is still unlikely) I feel like I am worse off than being single. I don't have a g/f i can see whenever I want to hug and hold her and there is absolutely no prospect of me doing that with someone else who lives where I am as long as my g/f and I are still together. 

Here's the worst part. I am having thoughts of throwing away what we have together because I have met a possible replacement. It was the day after my g/f left that this girl walked into my life. I actually think of it as a stupid thing to say because I hardly know this girl. I just met her on Monday night. It sounds even more fucked up as I reread what I just typed. Any yet, here I am. Still having these same thoughts. This isn't even the first time I've had girls throw themselves at me. WTF is it with girls being able to sniff out the non-single guys? This wouldn't happen if I didn't have a g/f! So far I've been able to brush off temptations like these before with little effort but this one...not so easy.

(true story)",aspiering,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/dbtht/mf_i_was_18_and_there_was_an_intern_at_the/,"*First, let me emphasise that this story is completely true. I *have* Asperger's syndrome, and while I don't have many of the negative traits often associated with the disorder, I keep in touch with this commune, mostly to have a social network in case shit one day goes bad, and to harvest the (mostly economic) benefits.

Additionally, this is a longer story, so if you're looking for a nice buildup, this is for you. If not, you may as well go on your merry way and find a shorter piece. Or a porn flick.*

------------

I was told an intern had started her six-month internship. She wanted to be a caretaker, and naturally, an asperger commune seems like a logical place to be in that situation.

Let's just say her name was Anna. She was about 28, and absolutely gorgeous. Freckly skin, long dark hair, and deep, brown eyes. Not usually my type, but eh.

Naturally, I thought, this wouldn't ever work out. She was an *intern* at the place I went for ""help"", and she was 10 years older than me (by only a few days, I would later learn).

She took a couple of my appointments from the usual crew (some of the others in the commune need a *lot* of planning and organising), but I would never really take up the full time of the appointments. So, instead we'd talk about clubbing, drinking, smoking. I'm a smoker, and I casually offered her a cigarette, even though I had no idea if she did, or ever had, smoked. She took it, and with a wink asked me not to tell anyone. As it turns out, she had quit smoking a couple of months prior, and none of her current co-workers knew she had smoked.

We laughed, we talked, and time flew past quickly. My appointment was well overdrawn, and she quickly thanked me for the cigarette, hugged me, and ran out to her next appointment.

I promptly logged onto my PC and added her as a friend on Facebook.

------------

That same night, I noticed her online. I felt somewhat awkward, but I figured I'd message her and challenge her to have a drink with me at some point, knowing fully-well she'd be out of her mind if she accepted. She laughed, and then a one-line reply:

""sure ;)""

I was excited. In the conversation that followed, we agreed (half-heartedly on my behalf, though) not to do so until she'd finished her internship, making it at least somewhat more acceptable. It was about a month later, and I figured I could wait.

------------

Approximately one week later, I was bored out of my mind. School was out. All my friends were on holiday, and I was just craving going out drinking with some friends and have fun (this wasn't in the US, so drinking laws are much more lax here). I get on Facebook and immediately notice her online. *click*. ""An"". *click*. ""Hey, you want to go grab a drink or something? I'm bored out of my mind.""

Her reply was something along the lines of ""I really shouldn't,"" or ""Nah, not tonight"". I wasn't really paying attention. I was determined, and after a bit of heckling, I managed to convince her to go to a nearby gas station with me to pick up some wine. I met her in front of her dorm; she smiled nervously, and we went on my merry way. I broke the silence by taking out my whiskey-filled 20 oz hip flask, taking a swig and offering her a swig. The gas station was about half a mile away, and we picked up cigarettes and alcohol. On the way back, I noticed how buzzed I already was, checking my hip flask. Half-way back, it was already empty. 20 oz of whiskey in about 15 minutes, shared between two people. This was going to be a good night, I felt.

------------

After we got back, we hit the wine. It hit hard, and heavy. We were both pretty drunk after a short while, and ended up on drinking games. At some point during the night, we ended up talking about relationships. I was still in one at this point, but I knew it wasn't going to work out, and I stressed it heavily. She had come out of a pretty long relationship about six months prior, and was slowly picking up dating again.

Drinking games turned into more kinky ones, and we finally ended up playing strip poker. We started talking about sex, and I revealed to her that in all my years, I had not found anyone able to give me a good blowjob. She looked me straight in the eyes and said ""go sit on my bed.""

What happened next almost escapes me entirely. She comes over to the bed, sits on her knees, removes my pants and just starts sucking. We're talking vaccuum here, and I just lay back and enjoy the whole sensation; this truly was unlike anything I'd felt before that.

Blowjobs turned into pretty wild sex. For hours we just lay there, making out, trying out every position in the book.

I stayed the night at her place, and got up the next morning, still feeling dazed and confused. Did this just happen? Is this illegal? Oh well, fuck it. At the very, I now had a very good story to tell.

And you, /r/gonewildstories, are the first people I've told. This is 100% true, happening only a few months ago. I hope this lived up to your expectations."

Today, her articles were all published in this 20-ish page newspaper booklet and I found quite a few grammatical mistakes (many of them in the first paragraphs of the articles).  I don't mean to be picky or anything, but she would like to use these publications when applying for jobs and whatnot.  I would like to tell her about these mistakes so that she only showcases certain articles and also so that she proofreads more closely in the future, but I know she's worked very hard on this publication and don't want to upset her (which has maybe a 70% chance of happening).

I work at Heartspring (http://www.heartspring.org/) a non-profit school for children with special needs (such as autism) in Wichita, KS.

We are looking to hire a part-time person in a project-dependent position. Looking for someone with experience in PHP/MySQL on the backend, and jQuery on the frontend. This is a great opportunity for a student looking to gain some real-world work experience. We can be very flexible in regards to schedule, and the pay should be very competitive compared to other student jobs in this area. We are also willing to treat this as a paid internship if you are a student and can get credit through your school for those types of things. Non-students are also encouraged to apply, but please keep in mind that this is a position without benefits and is only guaranteed for the next 6 - 12 months (the length of the project you will be working on).

If anyone out there is interested, shoot me a PM and I can let you know more about the job.

Also, just to clarify, this cannot be a 100% telecommute position, we are looking for someone located in/near Wichita, KS."

Short background: I got to chatting with a girl on okcupid at the beginning of this summer right after I moved across the country for a summer internship. So we both agreed it'd be fun to correspond for the summer until I got back. That went well and when I finally got back into town I took her out to dinner and we went out for a drink afterward. A few days later we got together to walk around town and enjoyed a pleasant evening talking. Then a few days after that we went for a run together and talked a bit afterward. I was planning to take her out for a nice dinner this weekend but she's off running a half marathon so she said she'd have to take a raincheck till next week.
Problem: Seems like she's not super interested, we haven't talked that much outside of our get togethers. I don't know if I should be throwing it into romantic high gear, trying to build a friendship, etc. I haven't made any sort of romantic move, due to my own fear and awkwardness, so maybe she's just losing patience waiting for that. 

TLDR: Feel like a great girl is losing interest in me, do I just go for broke or is it too late for me?"

I'm right by the Victoria and Albert museum which has become my favorite place in all of London. I've done a ton of cool things so far (including an incredible modest mouse concert on Wednesday), and expect to do more as the semester passes. It's looking like I'm going to get a really cool internship at a really cool restaurant around Camden Market as well which is pretty cool because Camden is running close second as favorite place in London.  
  
however, this comes with a trade-off. I have absolutely no access to pot here. I mean, I've had some ents help me by guiding me in a direction (camden market, specifically) but that has really proved to be a poor and incredibly unreliable substitute for the personal relationship that I've been able to make with the dealers I've had back home. when I finally found someone to deal to me last week it was at the expense of getting (quite obviously, at the time) ripped off. It has me feeling like a beginning stoner with no idea what's an acceptable price to pay, let alone how to go about getting it. Add that to the fact that I'm once again living in a dorm situation so i can't smoke inside, and am in a city that is basically covered in cctv cameras which puts me in a state of unease, and your left with a guy who just has no idea what to do with himself.  
  
pretty much everyone else here in the program makes up for it but just going out to bars/clubs most nights and getting drunk, but that's not what I like to do. I'm not a big drinker; being drunk just doesn't appeal to me like it does others. Plus some nights I like to choose not going out at all and instead have a nice night in, which is what I was hoping for tonight. Of course this is where I screwed over by my school as they can't even fork over the money for a basic cable package to just sit back, relax, and watch, let alone decent internet that I can stream tv shows over.  
   
so that's where I am, looking at 1:21AM and my nice night in has consisted of a 1/4 drunk bottle of wine that I really don't feel like finishing right now and a bunch of half-finished episodes of Venture Brothers and me in no way feeling nice and relaxed like I wanted, just bored. I don't really want pity or anything, because, really, I'm sure I'm in a better position than most, this just isn't conducive to the type of fun I prefer having. I'd really just like some funny stuff that I can read and chuckle at before I finally give up and just go to bed. also, I'm sorry about how mopey this is, I hate being mopey, really.

I wasn't the most active kid while at school so I didn't get involved in many groups and unfortunately wasn't able to land any marketing internships that I applied for. After I graduated, I was offered a position at a small software company doing mostly inside sales, along with very few marketing/webinar hosting tasks.

I've looked online to see if I can find some other Marketing jobs to apply to but my lack of experience in a real marketing position is hindering me, even though I know I would be great at it.

* He believes that we don't need the FDA and the EPA.
* He believes that the ""free market"" doesn't need any regulation.
* He loves Ayn Rand and yet claims to have read Upton Sinclair's ""The Jungle""
* He believes that regulating industries so they can't dump toxic material, like formaldehyde, wherever they like, will drastically harm American industry
* He believes that all of illegal immigration can be solved by building a wall and placing soldiers on it with the order to kill on sight.
* He believes that the ""mosque"" a few blocks from Ground Zero shouldn't be built because ""they killed 3,000 American citizens"".
* He believes that whoever is caught on tape saying something ignorant or racist at a Tea Party rally is a ""Democratic plant""
* He believes that video evidence of racism at a Tea Party rally is ""obviously doctored""
* He claims that if I can find any ""authentic"" evidence of Tea Party racism/ignorance, Breitbart will pay me $10,000. (Not true)
* He believes that FOX News is the only source of news that tells the truth.
* He believes that all of the companies boycotting advertisements while Glenn Beck's on the air are ""afraid of what he has to say""
* When I told him that libertarianism would only work in a perfect world and that our own citizens shouldn't die on the streets because they can't afford over-priced medical care for preventable diseases, he gave me the nickname ""Mao Zedong"" (to be fair I did compare his corporatist views to fascism and his proposed actions to those of Hitler (oh, and I found out later he's Jewish oops))
* He believes that Israel deserves our unwavering support and that any news questioning their treatment of the Palestinians is merely terrorist propaganda
* Oh did I mention that he doesn't really consider the Palestinians as being people and that they have no right to be there?
* He believes that that Obama administration (which he's nicknamed ""Big Brother"") is trying to monitor all of us and is tracking us (though he thinks the Patriot Act is a-ok)
* He believes that it's not ok to monitor American citizens unless they fly to the Middle East and they look Arabic. (""Damn right it is!"" - his response when I told him that he's supporting racial profiling)
* He thinks that we should just nuke all of Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran, and maybe Pakistan

Here we go again*

Hey there Reddit ECE. Thanks for checking in. I could really use some insight, especially from those already out in the field (both industry and research).

Let's start with a little background. I'm in my senior year of Computer Engineering. At my school, CE is defined as a mix of EE and CS. It's mostly (say 80%) EE, but with the classes not related to computer technology (EM Theory, some advanced physics, etc) weeded out and replaced with a strong foundation in computer science.

I got into ECE because, like many of you out there, I've always been a computer guy. I was fascinated with them as a kid, and started doing website design, webhosting (read: pissing off Comcast), networking the computers in my house, etc around 12. I was the type of kid who had a lot of online friends from all over the world. And, while some might argue that I should have outside, I think this phase of my life was really good for me. I was exposed to people and ideas from all over, and I think that helped penetrate the bubble of apathy about the world outside myself that many of us (especially Americans, though that's a whole different debate) have.

So when I saw the dropdown box on my college application, I clicked ""computer engineering."" I figured I'd like to get into making computers even better. I had this vague idea in the back of my head for a while as I worked a few summer internships, etc

Lately my interests have solidified a little bit. I think the computer revolution has, overall, been a pretty awesome thing. Communication, education, buiness, every facet of our lives - revolutionized. But that's only the developed world. Whole regions of the earth have yet to experience the potential for growth and development that computers can bring. I want to get involved in fixing this, developing the next generation of low-cost, low-power computers that can extend the range of the computing revolution. Projects like OLPC and Intel's classmate PC fascinate me. But my attempts to contact them and figure out what kind of research is going into furthering these devices has been met (not surprisingly) with little to no response.

So the problem is: how to go about doing this? Should I be looking into grad programs in computer architecture and microprocessor development, and work on the next generation of devices like Intel's Atom processor (the micro-CPU powering most netbooks). Or perhaps System-on-a-chip and embedded computing is the future? Or maybe something else entirely.

Let me know what you think, reddit. I'm counting on you.

**TL,DR: I like computers and think everyone (not just the relatively wealthy in the developed world) should have one. What kind of research should I do?**"

deasp,1,2010-09-15,Robotics with a bachelor's in ME?,Vorsorken,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/deasp/robotics_with_a_bachelors_in_me/,"I'm going into my third year of undergrad at UC Davis. I decided on Davis because it was the best (overall) school available to me at the time, but I didn't research any sort of robotics program here because I wasn't sure what I wanted to emphasize.

I'm weighing three options:

1. finish up my undergrad where I am then pursue grad school at a different university with a more reputable robotics program (recommendations?)

2. get into the MS/BS program at Davis and focus my research on robotics

3. just finish up my BS here and try to emphasize robotics with my design projects and try for an internship at a robotics company (the internship part would probably be applicable to any of the three options, but with this option it would almost seem necessary)

unexpected fourth option: transfer to somewhere like Stanford, Berkeley, Caltech, etc. (I'd really rather not do that though)

All options differ as far as cost is concerned. I don't know much about grad school funding, so I will definitely be doing some research there. I'm currently on student loans and will continue to be so, so I'm a little afraid to stay in school for 6 or more years, ending up with an insurmountable student debt bill. On the other hand, I think having a BS in ME at a solid school then a MS in robotics would be optimal when I'm ready to head into the job market.

I currently have a 3.75 cumulative GPA and I'm going to try really hard over the next two years to keep it there or better. So I'm hoping doors will be open at some good grad schools if I can do that.

**tl;dr:** I'm a third year ME undergrad at a good school but I want to pursue robotics. Just finish up BS? Get into a MS/BS program? Grad school?

By the way, I don't expect someone to give me a single, ""correct"" answer, nor do I expect there to *be* one. I'm just hoping to get some opinions and potentially learn about some of my options."

debvr,1,2010-09-15,Is it best to notify your employer when you are looking for a new job?,runescaper,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/debvr/is_it_best_to_notify_your_employer_when_you_are/,"Warning: a bit of a rant is below, but it's needed for context.

The place I'm currently working at doesn't seem to particularly like me.  When I first started, I fixed something in a legacy system that seemed like a bug, because the testing procedures they gave me would just not work with this one flag turned on.  Of course, it turned out this flag was very necessary, and that the testing procedures they gave me did not match what happens in production at all.  So, they go through a big talk about not doing anything unless I'm instructed.

Several months ago, about two years after I started, I didn't do something that I thought would be good, because they didn't tell me to do it.  Then, they didn't like I wasn't ""communicating"" well, and have labeled me in many ways that simply aren't true.  One issue was from a different manager changing his mind several times in the course of a conversation, and I couldn't remember which option he finally decided on, so crap hit the fan when he said that he said one thing, and I said I remembered him saying something else.  The hypocrisy of the higher ups does not occur to them -- they recognize that anything they do without the approval of the big cheese could be wrong just because they didn't get approval first, but at the same time blame the peons for making any sort of decision without getting approval from them first.  This isn't just me, it's happened to several other people here.

If I were to tell my supervisor that I was looking for a new job, they may just fire me as soon as I'm done on my current project, even though I have a lot of knowledge of a legacy system that other people only know half as well.  On the other hand, I know that as I'm going to have a second interview with a new company soon, that they will be contacting my current employer to see what they think of me.  Additionally, I have to schedule flex time at my current employer to be able to leave early now and then for interviews, and they really want a reason; it sounds like, if you don't give a reason enough times, they pull you in to a meeting to talk about it.  I really don't want to lie, but at the same time don't want to lose my job before I have something else lined up.

del29,7,2010-09-16,i can't do this anymore,jmontheedge,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/del29/i_cant_do_this_anymore/,"I'm 22 years old. I feel like I'm having a mid-life crisis.

I'm a father, I'm married, I'm overworked, I'm depressed, I'm lonely, and I just don't know how much longer I can take this.

I got married in June 2009 because I got my girlfriend pregnant. Our daughter is now 13 months old. She wanted a baby, and at the time had an uncanny ability to guilt me… I couldn't say no. So, we ""tried"" for 6 months until she finally got pregnant. Normally, I'm a very analytical person… but when we made that ""decision,"" there was no real discussion or actual planning. I just went along with it. I figured it would just be okay: I was helplessly in love with her; I was nearly done with college and had a well-paying Software Engineering internship.  I was already going to school full time while working full time. When she got pregnant, I purchased a 3-family home so we could live rent-free (until recently, the rent from the 2nd and 3rd floors covered our mortgage), using a small loan from my sister for the deposit. I graduated in March of this year and have been working as a Software Engineer ever since. My wife is a stay-at-home mother.

Our daughter was born in August 2009.  There were some complications with the labor and she had to be born quickly… luckily, she was fine, but my wife had to be cut on her vagina in order to get our daughter out in time. It took a while for that cut to heal. It got infected, but she is finally starting to feel better. She keeps going back to the Ob-gyn who has been giving her new medications. The infection is gone, but there is still some spotting… so we still cannot have sex. ""Just 2 more weeks"" Is a phrase I've heard all summer. I am so horny, so often, it hurts. 

Since early July, we have been going to see a marriage counselor: we have a lot of communication problems in addition to our intimacy problems. I understand why she doesn't want to have sex, but we could still be intimate in other ways - at the very least don't let me feel so desperate for attention! When I'm horny, she wants nothing to do with it; I'm on my own.

I love my Software Engineering job, but the commute is ridiculous 3 hours a day (luckily 2.5 hours of the daily commute is on a commuter rail; I mostly spend that time browsing reddit to avoid my thoughts of depression/suicide). I leave my house at 7:20AM and get home by 7:00PM. I'm away from home nearly 12 hours. Then I take care of the baby for an hour and a half before she goes to sleep, since my wife had to take care of her all day….

I feel so over-worked and under-appreciated. I have no fun at all. I work, take care of the baby, often fight with my wife and usually go to bed alone since she stays up late, but I can't fall asleep when she's not there.
Tonight was the 3 year anniversary of when we first started dating. My wife's friend watched our daughter for us. When we got home, another one of their friends came over and the 3 of them went out to a bar. I laid in bed, alone, for hours. We had a fight last Friday because I wanted to go out to the bar more often with her, but she said she ""out grew"" it. Tonight I realized that this was the 4th time she has been out to the bar with friends in the past 5 weeks. I asked her about it when she got home, and she said she felt it would be ""irresponsible"" of us to have a baby-sitter watch our daughter for a night just so we could go out to a bar.
So this is my life. I'm over-worked, very tired, very lonely and very depressed. I want more fun in my life. I have only 1 friend, but he and I rarely hang out since I'm often too busy/tired. I fear my wife and I may get a divorce, but I really don't want that to happen. I don't know how much longer I can keep living this life.


**TL;DR:** I just don't know how much longer I can take this, Reddit. I want to just give up and end it.

For only $75 a month you can get the life saver plan and firefighters will not only put out unlimited fires but also try and save anyone who is still inside the burning building, and for only $10 more a month this coverage can be extended to pets as well.

Can't afford any of these plans? Don't worry, the economy plan is only $5 a month and for that the intern, Steve, will de sent out to your house on his bike with a fire extinguisher as long as it is during normal business hours and Steve isn't on his lunch break.

I'm updating my resume right now, and I'm thinking about what to add/subtract.  I have a list of related courses, then I have experience next.  Under ""experience,"" I have:


* Undergraduate Research Assistant, XX Group

* Summer Internship, Local Utility Green Building Program

* Project Lead, Engineers Without Borders
* Lab Proctor, Mech. Engr. Computer lab on campus


Then the other things that I have had on there in the past that I'm currently debating about whether to include:


* Tour Guide, Our Campus' awesome Tower (pretty prestigious job on campus)

* Camp Counselor for a camp hosted by my university for HS girls that want to do computer science (sort of techy, right?)

* Waitressing job that I did through the end of high school until the middle of college


I also have a section for accomplishments but the only things I have in there are being a member of Engineers w/out borders and ASME.

So my question is... should I leave in those things that I'm debating?  I know being a waitress doesn't have anything to do with engineering, but it shows that I started working at a young age and worked most of the way through school (until I got jobs at school) -- and anybody that has every worked as a server knows that it's not easy.  Also, I worked there for almost 4 years, which maybe is significant?  I also don't know whether to include the camp counselor (I helped younger high school girls build robots and computer programs), and Tour Guide is completely unrelated, but still shows that I've worked all through college.

So.... any thoughts?  Is there something I should put on my resume that I'm not thinking of?

This past month I have been a lot more active than I have this whole past summer. I also eat pretty healthy foods, not completely crazy where I measure out everything that I eat to the gram, but since I eat a mostly Chinese food diet, there're a lot of veggies, some rice, some meat, and not a lot of fattening things like cheese, butter or grease.

However, I can't turn down the alcohol. Whether it's beer, wine, or whiskey on the rocks, I love it all. I like to have a beer with dinner, or while I'm watching some futurama episodes. Sometimes I'll pour myself a glass of jack on the rocks to help put myself to sleep. I've been doing better at it, for example this week.. currently it is Thursday night, I drank a few glasses of rum Saturday night, had only one beer on Tuesday, and had another beer today. However, tomorrow afternoon I'm hanging out with some friends that I haven't seen in months. Since there's really nothing for us to do (in NYC) that doesn't involve spending money(only one of us has a legit job, the rest are students or doing internships), the plan is to basically sit around in a room talking, catching up and getting smashed.

df677,9,2010-09-17,Leaving the US,[deleted],needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/df677/leaving_the_us/,"Hi Reddit. This is a throwaway account. I can't give any personal information....Anyways, long story short:
Came to the US from a developing country, got my degree (and as you could guess, I graduated with high honors and I love my career). Did my internship...started meeting awesome people,including one very special person. Then, I did everything i could to get a job, but nothing for almost a year. the company I did my internship kind of wanted me back, but they stepped back a couple of weeks ago. So, no job offerings, no visa, not enough money to probably go back to school. 

In these last few years, college was an ok experience...but it wasn't until I did my internship that I truly enjoyed being in the US, but now, there is a 98% probability (a made up number that I hope, shows the seriousness of this case) that I'll have to go back where I came from, leave the life I had here...and specially, leave that one special person I met.

For the last few years, at the beginning, I couldn't see a future in this country, but once my internship started, I slowly and unconsciously started dreaming about being here. I didn't appreciate all the things I had (freedom of speech and choice, multicultural society, chance to be myself) here until I became aware that this scenario is close to a 100% chance of happening. 

Sure, I might have left details out, but anyways, I don't want pity or anything like that. I just wanted to let this out. Thanks for reading.

I recently got picked up for a non-paid internship with a soon-to-launch magazine (out of Vancouver) called HUSH Magazine (http://www.hushmagazine.ca) in the capacity of a PR/marketing position. I would be competing with about 15 other interns for a single or few positions in a 3 month long internship, and it would be a lot of work. I have little problem with this, and think it would be a lot of fun and a great opportunity, but for the fact that I'm leaving my current job, and can't afford to dedicate so much time and effort to a non-paid position.

**My question:**
The owner saw my blog (http://www.bijand.com/blog) and likes my writing. He wants to use some of the articles for the business/tech section of the website (as it is nearly empty). He just called asking if they can 'borrow' some of the articles, and I explained the above predicament- that I like the magazine and where it's going, but cannot afford to do an internship for free at this point in my life.
There was a group 'brainstorming' session yesterday, and they really liked my ideas and leadership, and thus I said that I'd like to be offered a position- either staffed or freelance (my mistake, should have just said staffed)- with the magazine immediately, as they had already seen the wealth I could contribute.
He seemed open to this idea, and asked how much an article would cost. 
Now, me having never done any paid writing before, I really had no idea what sort of number to give him, so I said I'd have to figure out the numbers, and would talk to him at a team mixer tonight.

Any insight on my gf's WTF story from last week?,frustratedboyfriend,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dfpgv/anyone_work_in_hr_or_hiring_any_insight_on_my_gfs/,"I know certain business environments are friendlier than others, but what my girlfriend experienced in her first week at work, which would then be her last, is one of the rudest things I've ever heard of. I'll try to keep it brief:

She interviewed last Friday for a social media specialist position at a small company (45 ppl). This would be her first real job, tho she's had a few paid internships and keeps a blog with a dedicated audience, so she knows her shit. At the interview, she laid out all the variables of her situation: she lives in another state, has a dog, and plans to start looking for an apartment pending a job.

Wednesday of the next week, she got an letter and a plane ticket for Sunday so she could come up and train for a week. She made it seem like they were going to work with her to make the transition smooth. She'd stay with me in the meantime.

Monday was great. Lots of meetings, paperwork, introductions. She brought up figuring the whole next few weeks out. They were definitely going to plan a meeting soon.

Tuesday she went out to lunch w/ her supervisor. He was very reassuring that they want to make her happy so she could do a best work, and a hotel or other accommodations weren't out of the question. They talked family and the upcoming Jewish holidays and kicked things off well.

Wednesday she found an apartment at lunch. Threw down the deposit. Move in around Oct. 1. Gravy.

Wednesday right before EOD her supervisor, CEO, and her talked about the next few weeks, at which point they pulled a 180 on her and said that any sort of remote work was out of the question and they expected her to be there Monday. They went back on just about everything they promised, citing the contract she signed. She left work visibly upset. I interpreted as some sort of cruel test, but we'd make it work. She could stay w/ me longer til move-in.

Thursday was fine. Back to work as usual. Still meetings and the beginning stages of assignments, but no deliverables.

Friday morning, first thing, they let her go, saying that its not going to be a good fit. One week, zero chances of proving oneself and ""Sorry, you're fired."" What the hell?

They're paying her through the end of the month regardless, and she was able to get the housing deposit back, but now its back to square one. All I can think of is that they're an agency, and they tend to grow and shrink with accounts. Maybe some really bad news happened Wednesday morning? Maybe they were trying to get her to quit on Wednesday by being mean?

At least that was my original thought. The job is back up on craigslist.

I've personally left a job after a month because of the environment, but they were apparently nowhere near firing me. I'd say you'd need at least a few weeks of screwing up to be let go that quickly.

So reddit, if you work with HR or run a business and have any insight as to why a company would hire somebody only to fire them in less than a week's time for no apparent reason, I'd appreciate your thoughts!

Here’s a little background: I met my ex during senior year of high school and we decided to stay together even though I was leaving for college at the end of summer. We went through the typical ups and downs of a college LDR and seemed to make it through just fine.



We broke up at the beginning of the summer because she was graduating (from college) and had decided to travel for about 6 weeks. I understand I’ll probably get a decent amount of criticism for this next part. I told her that I found it unfair that I would come home every chance I could to spend time with her and during the only 3 months of the year that we could be together, she decides to take that time to travel and get her life in order. So I told her to choose between traveling or being with me. She obviously picked the former.



At that point, I took 2/3’s of RA’s advice: I cut contact and hit the gym (didn’t bother deleting from Facebook because neither of us really use it at all). She tried to contact me once during the summer about how much she missed me but I had self-control and was able to answer her back in somewhat of a cold fashion.



Fast forward to the end of summer, we start talking again (mainly a few short texts to see how each of us are doing). We decide to see each other and end up hooking up (as we both honestly expected). We had previously agreed to do this with no strings attached so it was somewhat alright.



Once again, at the end of summer I left for college (actually an internship near my school but I’m still a student). She has mentioned that she still has strong feelings for me and wants to get back together. I’ve told her that I don’t want that and that I think we should talk less.



Here’s the main issue: I find myself texting her and talking to her even though I know I shouldn’t. It’s not that I can’t help doing it, I honestly just have nothing to do and no one else to really talk to. My school has a very low population of girls and since I am working full-time, I have virtually zero opportunity to talk and connect with any of them. The ones I already know that I am interested in either already graduated/moved or are in relationships. There’s no one at my job I am interested in (especially since most of my workers are older and/or male).



I am seeking advice on whether I should totally cut contact with my ex and how I should do it, as well as how I can go out and meet girls my age (for dating). I know the bar/club scene exists but if anyone else has any ideas, I would appreciate them. Thanks in advance for your help and sorry for the long post.



TL;DR: ex wants to get back together after a post break-up hookup (with me). I went back to school for an internship and am trying to cut contact. I’m finding it hard to stop talking to her because I am not taking classes this semester and have no way of meeting girls my age. So I end up talking to her because I have no one else to talk to and nothing else to interest me. 



EDIT: I know I need to cut contact but I'm having a hard time doing it because there aren't many other girls that I talk to that aren't just friends. Also, I don't want to get back together with this girl. I think the right thing to do is to stay broken up, I'm just having a hard time cutting off communication and finding new people. That's why I'm asking for advice on HOW to cut contact and/or meet people."
dgo0e,0,2010-09-20,Can anyone help my girlfriend get an entry level job in NYC?,Kapnobatai,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/dgo0e/can_anyone_help_my_girlfriend_get_an_entry_level/,"My girlfriend and I work in NYC and she's been trying to get a job for the last 3 months with no success. She's trustworthy, reliable, a quick learner, diligent, hard working, etc. This is coming from someone who hires entry level workers (not so much now) and interns and manages a large wealth management team in the financial sector. If I could hire her objectively, she'd be the perfect type of employee I would want supporting the team. I know she can get a job eventually its just a matter of when.

I would get her a job where I work, but there is a freeze on hiring at my firm which makes what would have already been a difficult push (since my hires go through HR and they don't approve of boyfriends getting their girlfriends job) impossible.

The problem is: Debts are starting to pile up. Because of that, she's really nervous and has all this anxiety about what shes going to do with bills and future expenses which doesn't help for interviews, and her resume is a little weak; She graduated from Fordham University with a degree in poli sci (she eventually wants to go to law school), has a mixed-bag of prior work experience so she's not fresh off the boat so to speak, but none of those jobs were ""career orientated"" so she needs to get her foot in the door as an entry-level worker. 

She's been looking very hard but hasn't found jobs other than the kind where you stand out on the street taking surveys/hand out fliers/ask for donations or something equally menial. 

So I come to you reddit, can you help her get a job? I'm not asking for something set in stone but at least a ""softer"" interview bearing in mind she comes with a redditor reference :P

If anyone out there could help me out, she's looking for anything really. And if you do hook her up with an interview, I'd be more than happy to repay the favor with a beer/spliff/financial advice/sc2 advice or whatever. If you hook her up with a job, then I'll really really owe you one.

PS:

I know that recently people have started praying to reddit for various things/favors/money. At first I thought it was pretty distasteful, but then in lots of instances those posts asking reddit for real help ended up being examples of why the reddit community has little to no equals. Now of course, Pandora's box is open so people trying to cash in on reddits generosity by asking for lame things and using false stories. Hopefully I'm not in the latter group. If I am I apologise for being so crass. "

I ended up following my family and am lucky enough to live with my parents till I find something.

Anyways, the job search isn't really my concern, but I'd really like to stay sharp during my unemployment and develop skills that might make me more marketable, if I am going to be unemployed for an undetermined amount of time.  What kind of things might you recommend?  I've already found /r/eebooks, I've spent some time looking over my old textbooks, reviewing and looking at things we didn't cover, but I'd really like to know what you think the best things I can do to keep me relevant in electrical engineering are.

My internship experience was in RF/Wireless, which I found really interesting and learned a lot in, but I also know there's a chance my first job will be in something else, so I'm trying not to be too picky in what I focus on.

Are there any magazines I should be subscribing to? Should I become an IEEE member?  I have some spare cash too, maybe something like an Arduino Board would be fun to play around with.  I'm actually a bit disappointed that I haven't been doing stuff like that already, but I guess school (and maybe a bit too much gaming) kept me pretty busy.

Basically, if there's any advice you would have liked to give yourself at this early point in your career, what would it be? My ears are open.  Thanks so much."

This is going to sound like self loathing but I am sorry, I need to get this off my chest and I don't have many people to talk to. 

I was fairly successful in academics on high school which secured me a scholarship to a well known engineering school. I graduated and was offered a well funded position in graduate school studying fluid mechanics. I met my wife during the end of my undergraduate education and I have never been so close to someone in my life. I've never met someone who understood me so deeply and cared so much. 

After completing a masters, I secured a good job as an engineer with a large environmental consulting firm in Texas. I married my fiancee just before moving in a very large ceremony which she desired. My wife went to graduate school, I worked, we made a good living and everything was great. Unfortunately, in 2008 I was laid off and there weren't many prospects in Texas (and we did not particularly care for Texas, sorry Texas people). The fortunate thing is that I was laid off 3 weeks before my wife defended her masters and we did not own a house. We had mobility and we decided to get out.

I wanted to pursue a PhD and my wife wanted to work and we figured we would reverse our texas arrangement of me working and her going to school. I actively searched for PhD programs near her hometown on the west coast and my wife did the same with her job search.

She was abler to acquire a fantastic job in her field making great money and I was able to be accepted to a great engineering university in the same town. Last year we bought a house and a new car and were very much financially rooted in the area. everything was great until march of 2010.

Last March my wife tells me very casually she wanted to chat on the couch. I sit down, she tells me she is miserable, has been miserable for years, is leaving and there is nothing I can do to improve the situation or to get her back. This was the worst day of my life. 
Walked out of the house, left me with a mortgage, cats, and our whole life. I was shellshocked. There was no indication she was ever unhappy, no mention of seeing a counselor, no mention of anything to help the situation, just silence and many I don't care at all anymore. 

I went back to school instead of seeking a job with the plan that my wife and I are a team and she would support me while I was pursuing a PhD. 

I feel like I have lost my mind and failed as a person now. I don't have much family and friends live very far away. I feel trapped and I don't sleep at all at night. When I do sleep, I have nightmares like a kid. It's always some monster trying to eat me or something terrible. 

I have always been emotionally very stable and I can't even go through the day without an incredible rollercoaster of emotions. Let's say I'm on reddit, I see a kitten and get ultra warm fuzzies and see a post about an Iraq qar vet and I cry. I'm losing my mind in some fucked happy/miserable dichotomy world. I'm always one or the other. 


I'm scared to go about normal tasks for fear of failure and my education, though not suffering, isn;t really progressing the past few months. I have an internship in my field and a second job at a coffeeshop to pay the bills, school, etc. I work about 65 hours a week not including schoolwork I must complete at home and I can't do this anymore. I barely pay the bills and I'm almost going hungry as I don't have much left over for groceries and there are only so many campus events you can go to with free food before someone starts to notice. I've never struggled just to put food on my table and I can't believe that is the situation I'm in. I feel alien at school and work because how do I tell fellow students/friends/coworkers making money and living well that I didn't go get a beer with them or hang out not only because I couldn't afford it, I fucking barely ate at all that night.

I don't want to live this life but I can't commit suicide. I lost a friend to suicide and it is selfish and never a good answer. Honestly, before I fall asleep, my wish is to just not wake up.

I'm exhausted. I feel like a shell of a man. I feel worthless. I need someone or something at the end of the day to just share with and the silence at home fucking kills me. I live in 1700 square feet of a life that no longer has any chance at survival.  Call me crazy but sometimes at night I talk to my cat about my day. 

I'm beyond my breaking point and I don't know what to do.

Please, if you have been through anything like this, I need advice. What do I do?What did you do? I need help, support, guidance, etc. I don't want to feel like I don't want to live anymore. I don't know how to be proactive anymore.  






tl;dr   Wife left, cannot pay bills, going hungry, too much between school and work for any free time. I feel like a ghost and I need help because I don't think I can do this much longer."

I know I need to apply to more jobs, something, anything so I can pay the bills but everything seems so daunting in my head (I know it's not objectively true, I used to be pretty good at getting shit done, got scholarships, good grades, internships etc). It feels like everything I used to do for fun is just a little bit too hard to get back into--I cracked a rim on my bike last week, my car's been acting up so I can't get outside on the weekends to climb and hike, my knees hurt and pop and click all the time (never used to do that, went to the doc twice, they said ""live with it""), I discovered the hard way that I'm apparently now allergic to alcohol (beer, liquor, wine--same result, swollen throat and hives all over my body), broke up with my girlfriend a couple weeks ago (she was headed to grad school), etc.

I know I do a lot better with exercise but I haven't found a good replacement activity, and work has been extremely stressful because they want us to get even more done now that funding will run out in two weeks.

I feel like I'm stuck, and my brain keeps saying ""YOU'RE HEADED FOR TROUBLE, DO SOMETHING, YOU'RE HEADED FOR TROUBLE, DO SOMETHING"" but my heart isn't in it anymore.

I'm not suicidal or anything but I've definitely never felt this hopeless before.

EDIT: I guess my biggest worry was, whenever I used to get stressed out like this, I'd just tell myself ""OK, go to the gym for a night, forget about everything, tackle it in the morning"" or ""OK, go out with your friends etc"" and the next day, I'd feel refreshed and ready to get shit done. Now anything I do just makes me think about how shitty things still are, I can't seem to 'reset' my mood anymore

I need some advice and/or perspective.

I'm sure that Reddit is getting dozens of posts like this a day, but I'm really starting to feel like that I'm just not cut out to be hired by anyone. I feel that the little work experience I do have is not nearly enough for most companies to even care. Can anybody tell me if I'm overreacting, things I can do, etc?

I recently left my previous job (see below) and I've only been unemployed for about 3 months now, which is hardly any time compared to the majority of people. Still, in this entire time I've only ever gotten 1 interview, and I just found out the very next day after that interview that they're not interested. And even before this previous job I had a ton of difficulty with getting recruiters to acknowledge that I even applied.

I'm just not convinced that my experience is up to snuff. I can program in java pretty well (**I** think I can, anyway), although I don't have any experience with frameworks such as Hibernate and Spring, and it seems that most java developer positions require 2+ years experience with those kinds of things. I have less than a couple of months of experience with web technologies (I know what html, css, etc are, I just haven't worked with them), and that's another major thing that shoots me in the foot because 9 out of 10 jobs are web development positions. I have some experience with relational databases (mySQL, more specifically), but not enough to be able to do query optimizations or do truly complex schema design. I've worked in C++ and C# and feel pretty comfortable using them, but that experience only adds up to a few months, and once again I have no practical knowledge of any frameworks or third party software that typically gets paired with them.

I have various books on all of these subjects and I've been doing some learning on my own, but I just don't think companies will give a shit about self-taught candidates, especially ones who haven't done professional work for other companies or organizations. I'm sure somebody wants to chime in ""do an internship,"" but I've graduated over a year ago. Don't companies only want students for interns?

I'm just worried that I've ruined all of my chances for getting employed. I don't have nearly enough experience for most companies to consider me, but I'm overqualified just enough to not be able to do internships. Even the few ""entry-level"" positions that I do find require 2-3 years more experience than I currently have. What should I do, Reddit?

Some background on me: I graduated a year ago, I've got my BS in computer science. While in school I worked an internship at IBM, which I enjoyed, but when the recession began and IBM laid off a bunch of people I was among them. For half a year after graduation I had no success in finding work.

Then finally, at the beginning of this year, I did manage to get hired at a start-up company. The compensation was very crappy (think roughly 25K a year and no benefits to speak of), but I didn't care about the money, I was after some experience. I was also too elated at the prospect of being employed to care too much about anything else. Well I tried my best for roughly 6 months to make it work, but things didn't pan out too well. I'm not going to bore anyone with specifics unless asked, but basically I started to find the work environment and the company itself somewhat toxic and lost all motivation to stay, and so I left. I think leaving was the right decision, but I seriously regret leaving them at this current time. It was particularly unwise to quit without producing a two-weeks notice (in my defense, I was told up front that they didn't require them; if you didn't want to be there, get the hell out). I'm also pretty certain that the bridges I had built over there are fairly charred, so forget about a good reference."

dhrl1,169,2010-09-23,"There seem to be ALOT of misconceptions about CPR and the new Compression Only CPR, lets get some things straight.",SDAdam,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/dhrl1/there_seem_to_be_alot_of_misconceptions_about_cpr/,"This post is in response to the recent [front page post addressing compression-only CPR](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/dhecy/out_with_the_old_and_in_with_the_new_8_more/).

There are A LOT of misconceptions about CPR going around and I think it's important that we address them as it could make a big difference in someones life.

First off to qualify myself; I am a paramedic (NREMTP, and state licensed in my state), a paramedic instructor, a CPR instructor (AHA-BLSHCP), an Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support(ACLS) instructor, and a bunch of other things with acronyms of varying difficulty to remember.

So, CPR.

lets start with a note on the ethical and legal aspects.

**Ethics of CPR** - This one is easy, you don't have to do anything at all. Now, you should probably at LEAST call 911 (or whatever the emergency number in your area is) if you want people to think you are a decent human being, but you don't even HAVE to do that. So the first thing to do is think about things now, before you find yourself in an emergency and decide just what you want to do if you end up in one.

I have seen irate and irrational family members attack rescuers, I have seen people injured by entering emergency scenes with unforeseen dangers and I have known people who caught diseases from sick patients while trying to help them, these are all reasons why ethically you don't have to do anything (again maybe call 911 just for the heck of it though).

you have a family, friends, life, people who count on you, and in no way do you need to be exposed to the above dangers unless you are absolutely SURE you want to be. So decide now.

**Legal aspects of CPR** - The only answer I can give here is that the liability involved in providing CPR varies. It varies from country to country, state to state, and in some cases county to county. It is possible you could get sued, although unlikely to be successfully sued, it doesn't mean someone can't try. 

A good rule of thumb is this; if you would feel uncomfortable explaining what / why you were doing something in court you probably shouldn't be doing it (i.e.""well you see Mr. Judge, I once saw an episode of CHIPS and they brought the guy back to life by punching him in the chest, but I'm not very strong so I decided to jump on his chest"" - this example would seem a poor choice when held to the comfortable explaining yourself standard.)

A better rule of thumb is (and the one you would most likely be held to in court) what would another reasonable person in a similar situation who has the same amount or lack of training as I have do? (i.e. ""Ummm, you're telling me everybody in this courtroom wouldn't have used a swiss army knife to preform an emergent thoracotomy in order provide direct cardiac massage for that guys asthma attack?! pfffttt... whatever"" - this example would seem a poor choice when held to the reasonable person standard.)

**On To The Medicine**

I'm now going to address what seem to be the biggest misconceptions about CPR and Compression Only CPR;

**1. Compression only CPR is better than classic CPR.**
Compression Only CPR was never meant to replace CPR. It was meant to remove decision making from lay peoples hands.

You see medical decision making is difficult, and emergency medical decision making is even more difficult, and it's all compounded by the fact that nearly everything in medicine is a grey area. Let's look at an example;

When a person suffers sudden cardiac arrest (their heart stops beating) often for the first several minutes, and possibly for quite some time they may have something called agonal respirations, they are dead (clinically) but randomly every once and a while they take a gasping breath. Once you have seen this it is obvious. However to a lay person this could be considered breathing, so now the lay person has to make a decision; is the patient breathing or not? I mean they just gasped, but now they aren't, should I breath for them? Should I start CPR, shit, I don't know.

See how, to an untrained person there is a lot of grey area and decisions to make?

Well, research showed that when presented with grey area and decisions, bystanders decided that for fear of making the wrong decision they would make none at all and do nothing.

Thus Compression Only CPR was born, the idea being if we remove the grey area and decision making more people will do the one MOST important thing; chest compressions.

Another place Compression Only CPR is useful is if you don't want to do anything else. Let's take me for instance, I have a ton of medical experience and training, years and years. If I were walking down the street tomorrow and someone collapsed in front of me who needed CPR I would do Compression Only CPR. Why? Because I don't carry anything to protect myself if I were to try to breath for them. So I would do compressions until other paramedics arrived and that's it.

**2. Doing Compressions On Someone With A Pulse Is Bad.**
Now let's take you for example. Let's say that you are at the grocery store and you see someone collapse, so after watching that other threads video you run over and start pounding away on their chest. Then I come along, with my lights and sirens and bags of medical junk and I notice that the person you are doing CPR on is actually alive and asking you to stop.

Will I:

a) Yell at you for your ignorance and endangering of another person and mock you infront of all within earshot?

b)Thank you for your effort, quick thinking, and willingness to act calling you a hero in front of any cute girls/guys who happen to be within earshot.

c) Make fun of you when I get back to station.

The correct answer is b and c. (Hey if I tried to do whatever the hell it is you do for a living you would be the one laughing at me.)

There are really two points to make here.

First there are VERY few medical emergencies wich render a person so dead-like that they would actually be mistaken for being dead. Things which will NOT do this but have been mentioned in the thread I linked to at the top are: Fainting, low or high blood sugar, seizures, or strokes.

Second it is ALWAYS better to do CPR on someone who doesn't need it, than to fail to do CPR on someone who does. Lets look at a quick cost benefit model to illustrait my point:

&gt;You do CPR inappropriately:
*cost* - Sore chest, possibly minor rib fractures (actually relatively unlikely), embarrassment.
*benefit* - none.

&gt;You do CPR appropriately:
*cost* - none (possibly sore arms and back the next day for you).
*benefit* - you GREATLY increase a persons chance of surviving sudden cardiac arrest and returning to their loved ones.

The choice seems clear.

**3. What do you mean I don't check for a pules?!**
Let's get something straight, checking for a pulse is great. I always check for a pulse.

YOU have no idea how to check for a pulse in an emergency. I know you think you do, and the boy scouts taught you to 20 years ago, but you don't.

Here is what DOES happen. Bystanders (that's y'all) try to feel for a pulse, if one's there they mistake it for their own racing heart and start CPR anyway, if there is no pulse they mistake their own for the patients and don't start CPR. (It's that whole grey area / decision making thing again)

Even new Paramedic interns have trouble telling weather there is a pulse on cardiac arrests sometimes and these are people who have been Emergent Medical Technicians for quite a while prior to getting in to Paramedic school!

I hope this has cleared some things up about CPR and made some people more comfortable just jumping in and pumping on a persons chest as long as they are unresponsive and you think they are dead. 

Feel free to ask any other questions!"

We've got about 3000 deals we're tracking on the site.

Our main focus are ""flash deals"", which are time sensitive promotions restaurants send out when they are slow. So if it's raining at 11 and a restaurant knows there's going to be a slow lunch, they can post a deal that's only good for the next 3 hours to try to drive in some traffic.

We've had great success signing up businesses - including Pat &amp; Oscars, Pick Up Stix, Hooters, Kensingon Grill, etc. but we are struggling with our user base.

I don't want to spam or self promote, but I'm really curious to get some honest feedback. Would you guys use something like this? Would you sign up to get a ""flash deal"" via sms or email from your favorite restaurant? What can we improve on the site? What restaurants would you like to see added?

The site is: http://www.tipcity.com and we also have an iPhone and Android application

We're also hiring a graphic designer and salespeople!

**EDIT:**
We've really been blown away by the response from you guys! Few notes:

- We want to say thanks by sponsoring an /r/sandiego meetup! If someone wants to organize a gathering, we can use one of our partner restaurants and we'll pay for the meal or something to say thanks! I'm not sure who organizes these things but please send me a PM.

- If you guys refer a restaurant, PLEASE let me know and I'll give you something to say thanks!

- Please send resumes directly to me at: kpflynn(at)tipcity.com

- One more thing we really need: students! We're looking for paid interns from all the various colleges (SDSU, UCSD, USD, CSU San Marcos, Mesa) to help us spread the word on campus. Once again, please contact me and I'll try to get something set up

- We're using all this feedback and should have a new version of the site ready for testing in a week or so, I'd love to get some feedback then.

di0gr,0,2010-09-23,Why are the qualifications to run for office such a FUCKING JOKE!,treeonthehill,politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/di0gr/why_are_the_qualifications_to_run_for_office_such/,"http://www.sos.nh.gov/qualifications.htm

I mean seriously, I know this is just for NH but I bet is quite similar to other states and many other positions where you just need to be a certain age, live a certain amount of time in the state and just be able to get a shit load of signatures and pay the fees. NO EDUCATION REQUIRED...

It ridiculous, that you can elect some one into office and give them so much power when they could possibly not know jack shit about how the government works, and whats even in the constitution. It's just fucked up that now in this coming election there are all these politicians that strait up talk bull shit, just present talking points, might not and most probably don't know anything about how the REALLY  economy works are now given the position to make big monetary and legislative decisions that will affect possibly hundreds of thousands of people with no real prior education about the subject. 

As an Architect i know i needed to get a college degree, work in Architecture office for several year then take multiple exams (that are hard as hell) in order to get certifications the prove that when i design a building it will be functional, and that it wont collapse and kill you, (there is more than that but just keeping it simple for now). This process is mainly done for peoples safety, maintain high level of professionalism and worthiness in the field, and of course liability reasons. 

However for Politicians its becoming increasingly clear that they are not liable for anything they do in office, even if its war crimes. So they make choices on the assumptions, or more often than not, because they have some special interest, because you know its perfectly legal to buy off politicians, just make sure you call it ""political contributions""... I know this is not the case for all politicians because there are some really smart ones out there that know what they are doing and actually do good things for their constituents however i feel that should be all not just some. 

I propose that there should be more requirements like some type of political degree, and a one or two year internship with a politician and some kind of test of some sort. I mean something has to change, too much power is given to people that cant really prove that they know anything, and then get paid a ton for it.

I need some ideas for a new job.,feeshyfish,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dibdl/doctor_hates_practising_and_wants_to_quit_i_need/,"Hi reddit, same old story- long time lurker, first time poster. So this is the story, I graduated from medical school in June, had some time off to chill-lax and have just started my intern year 2 weeks ago. In that 2 weeks, I have become so deeply upset and frustrated about the system, myself and everyone working around me. I don't even know where to start on this rant. I have been home everyday crying about the stress of the job, the horrible hierarchal system and inhumane hours and amount of work expected of me. Most of all, I find that I do not even get the opportunity to interact with patients. I can't see myself completing this year without some sort of psychological breakdown, much less entertain the thought of specialist training. I don't want to go on like this feeling upset every single day. I honestly can't see this intern year getting any better- I know for a fact that my mandatory surgical and medical postings will be far shittier than my current rotation. I feel that my job is only an aspect in my life and my life shouldn't have to revolve around it, like it does now. Now, I am just plain miserable at work, cry when I get home about being upset at work, then go to sleep dreading the next day and the cycle repeats itself.  
I feel like I have the right to make a decision regarding my own job, my life and my future. Thing is, the options do not come without obligations. I worry that I am throwing away something valuable by quitting my job. However, I also find the thought of pushing on for this year unbearable. And what if I end up at the same place as I was before- and having to admit that medicine just isn't the job for me. I have been having this feeling towards the end of my medical school.
The thought of finding a new job fills me with comfort, just this idea that maybe I do have a choice after all in choosing my own path in life.

I know that there are many careers out there which are not the regular doctor, lawyer, accountant type- the kind of jobs out there which wouldn't occur to me to apply to.
So question is, what sort of jobs, given my medical degree and limited working experience should I be looking to apply to? 
Getting back to school at this moment is out of the question, so its got to be something which does not require being educated within a very specific field.
Any and all suggestions will be greatly appreciated.

Just a side note to say that I am not in the US.
Another to say that I will be heading to bed very soon, and that I am on call tomorrow (Sat) morning till Sunday evening. So I wouldn't be able to reply at all but will be reading the replies on my phone in between covering my ward duties.

Too long; didn't read: doc hates job, looking for a new one which does not require any more formal education. Need some ideas- better if medical related but does not require internship qualification or actual practising."

I have a story for you:

Last year, I got an internship at CurrentTV, Al Gore's indie cable network. My first day there, I was terrifically nervous, and had gotten about an hour of sleep the night before. I was running on Red Bull and first-day jitters, trying to remember everyone's names and not fuck up. About halfway through the day, my friend (who'd gotten me the gig) popped his head over my cubicle and said, ""Hey, Al Gore's in the hallway if you wanna see him.""

Apparently he's only at the office once in a while, so this was very exciting. My friend led me down the hallway and we walked past Al Gore, who's much taller than I expected him to be. I whispered ""HOLY SHIT, IT'S AL FUCKING GORE!"" and we kept walking. We got to the end of the hallway, which we'd walked down for the sole purpose of seeing Al Gore, and I went ""Is there a bathroom down here? I really need to pee, and I don't want Al Gore thinking I only walked by so I could gawk at him.""

I went into the bathroom, which was empty, and took one of the two urinals. About ten seconds later, Al Gore walked in and took the urinal on my left, and started going pee.

I'm standing there, running on way too little sleep and way too much Red Bull, trying to take a leak, and the former Vice-President of the USA is standing right next to me doing his business. I don't normally have a shy bladder, but under the circumstances, it was a bit of a challenge to do my thing.

Then Al Gore farted.

At this, I broke out into a cold sweat and probably burst a blood vessel in my eye trying not to laugh. If I had balls of steel, I would've turned to him and coolly said, ""You know, I hear that's bad for the ozone layer."" But instead I just finished peeing, went to wash my hands at the sink, and tried to retain motor skills because my brain had just exploded from the utter weirdness of the situation.

Al Gore followed suit. I got out of his way as quickly as possible. Aside from being a Nobel Prize winner, he was also my boss and it was my first day as an intern. While I was getting a paper towel, he casually asked me how I was doing, and I stammered something along the lines of ""Fine thank you, sir, and yourself?"" but while I was doing this, I wound up yanking out three paper towels instead of one. There was a moment of sheer panic, thinking I'd get yelled at for killing trees. I don't think he noticed, though I'm sure he's used to interns freaking the fuck out after he farts next to them and then accidentally wasting paper.

I went back to my desk and just sat there shaking, trying to comprehend what had just happened, because let's face it: that doesn't happen every day. My friend walked up, slapped me on the back, and said ""SO! How's your first day going?"" 

And that, my friends, is the inconvenient truth.

**TL;DR: I once took a piss next to Al Gore in a public bathroom. He farted and I took too many paper towels by accident. It was surreal.**"

""In rural Wisconsin, there is an old abandoned park. Built in the 1920s, it served as the town’s gathering place for everyone.

That is, until a newly developed Train and Tunnel for Tots™ ride was installed in 1932. It was an innocent looking childish train, with one main (mechanized) head car, with three small trolleys pulled behind it. It went around some loops before going into a small tunnel.

But this is where the story gets weird. There were numerous cases of child deaths that year, all of them happening after the child rode on that train system. Some kids went missing in that short tunnel (about ten feet), and others went comatose after leaving. One, upon exiting, was found to be dead. Her dress was covered in what looked like small bloody handprints. Some killed themselves by scratching at their throats until they bled out, and one of them even killed another child before hanging herself with razor wire at the family’s farm.

The park was closed, and the town’s popularity as a tourist town plummeted.

Recently, a team of scientists were sent out to the park. They taped a video camera to the train, and put a new intern in with it, before sending it on its way onto the tracks.

When the train left the tunnel, it was empty, except for the camera.

The last ten seconds were nothing but static, save for the sound of children laughing.

And I know I'm not the *only* one for which the last two apply for people here, but I feel like these other people at least have some sort of relationship with family to fall back on. My relationship with my parents is non-existent and will continue to be so because I can't forgive them for being so distant to me and my brother for all our lives (especially when my brother has been dealing with depression as well at home and attempted suicide, and my parents never noticed anything). I have no relationship with my mom because there's a huge language barrier, and there's nothing I have in common with my dad. My parents were just there to drive me to school, to sign important documents, and provide the essentials of food &amp; shelter. Outside of that there was literally no interaction. There was nothing for us to talk about as I didn't know them and they really didn't know me. I don't know old my parents are. I don't even know when their birthdays are.

So my career life, romantic life, and family life have been utterly pathetic and non-existent. What else is there? People usually say at least you have friends, right? But I have a hard time saying I genuinely have friends. I'm not actually *close* with anybody in my life. I'm just *there* sometimes. Nobody ever calls me specifically up to hang out or have lunch or anything. And it's senior year now; everybody has their close group of friends and stuff already, and I can't help but feel like the lonely freshman that is still eager to make friends.

And then I look at the bigger picture. There are millions of people out there that have it worse than me (I'm going to a top ranked university after all). People with REAL problems. People fighting diseases like cancer and AIDS (I still have my health...). People suffering in Haiti. People living in fear every day due to terrorists and the like (I still have my freedoms...). My problems are so trivial in comparison, yet here I am unable to stop dwelling on them. It's hard not to feel like a crybaby, you know?

I feel like I've done all the ""right"" steps. I've reached out to people, I've tried meds (Lexapro &amp; Pristiq), I've gone to therapy and even a support group, but I'm still here in this slump. I know if you look at all the statistics and read all the success stories online, odds are I will get better with time if I continue reaching out, taking meds, and going to therapy. But when I consider the days from this day to that arbitrary point in the future, and if every day is this shitty and if every night I think about this...that's when I start to consider if it is worth it. Am I insane for thinking this way?

Thanks a bunch if you clicked on this link and took the time to read my bitching. I know that there are so many people that post here and I know everybody has busy lives, so it means something to me that somebody bothered to take time out of their day and listen to the problems of an anonymous person on the internet."

Do you have a good story to share? Has someone on Reddit gone to great lengths to help you out? Are you going to the Rally (that's where I would most likely film the interviews)?



Edit: It's been asked a few times already, but yes, I am a film student. I've posted stuff to Reddit.com and ColbertRally, but I needed a new post to be more specific. It will be for a film class, but I wanted to choose something that I am passionate about. It would be amazing if I could pull together some interviews from famous Reddit stories. This would be used 100% for NON-PROFIT. Thought I should throw that out there. Much like the stories, I don't intend to gain anything from this documentary, but would rather just spread the word about how amazing the anonymous users of Reddit are.

Edit #2: This is awesome! This has gotten a great response and I'd like to thank everyone who has written something here. I try to respond to everything, and I'm orangered every time I refresh! Sadly, I have to go to lunch and prepare for an internship interview in about 15 minutes, so I'll be out for a while. I'll try to answer as many comments as I can! I responded through my macroeconomics class... I didn't listen to anything today, but I still consider my time well-spent.

Edit #3: I am utterly amazed at the response that I received. It's been amazing... Really. The only major thing left that I need is a place to do these interviews. That's the one piece of the puzzle that I'm most worried about. You all are amazing and have really reached out and I am inspired by you to make this documentary great. I even made it (at this point) 11% over the 66% rule! I love you Reddit."

As a kid, I had a solid background in theatre, performing arts, music, etc. but I handled the pressure of choosing a ""better"" future, which to my family meant science, by giving up my artsy ways in pursuit of a major in biology...

I've jumped from a strong musical background to majors including international affairs, psychology, art history, nursing, and biology.

I have never finished any of these. I get decent grades in science, terrible in international affairs (history is not my thing), and ace art, music theory, psychology etc...

I still don't know what I want to do and I'm stuck and burnt out trying to find creative ways to figure it out. Internships are tough to get without having decided my major, I dont have the funds to travel and need a bachelor's to do the teaching abroad thing that everyone loves to recommend.

I love art and music, but have been out of the game for a while. I'm under the impression it won't make much money, but I'd be willing to try if I believed I had a chance, if I saw something I could look forward to.

I'm ok at science. I can continue to major in it. But it's science, and I feel that that just isn't me. And to be honest I don't want a job working within plaster walls wearing scrubs. I like being hands-on, but hate the research aspect of science, which will inevitably be my job if I continue on with it.

I need a middle ground, I guess. I can't lie and say that I'm great at piano or singing anymore. Maybe there's a business aspect to music? God I just have so many credits I don't know what I can put them toward that will lead to a satisfying career, and I'll be done with nursing pre-requisites this semester.

TLDNR: I am a very visual learner, have a great ear for music, a personal background in theatre and pick up quickly on most concepts, but am not inspired by my family's choice and my mild interest to do science. I need interesting ideas (or methods of discovering them) to figure out a path that will pay my bills and feel satisfying. I love music but am very rusty, but I need to decide NOW what I am doing as I will run out of resources to just try the basics of everything.

Any ideas?"

As stupid as each side considers them, both Republican and Democratic economic plans are put under the ""bringing jobs back to America"" aegis. 

But officially-quoted employment figures are always stupid. If you stop looking for a job out of sheer depression, you are no longer unemployed, but a ""Discouraged Worker"". If you have worked a temp job in the past few days, but not enough to cover much of any expenses, you are not longer unemployed. And probably most endemic of all, if you were dropped or cannot get a full time job (with very necessary ""benefits"" like basic health care coverage), and can only find a part-time job a few hours a week that doesn't realistically cover any expenses, you are technically employed. 

I'm in the latter category, but I'm not just whining about myself. Most 20 somethings I know are lacking in the ""real job"" category, instead attempting to pad out their mini job with volunteer work, internships, and trying to get into packed graduate schools. The generation before, even if they try to help, are flustered - or at worst clinging to their full time jobs longer because their retirement portfolio fell double digits a few years ago.

Is it just a case of false entitlement, with the emphasis on higher education outpacing the real world (""over-qualification"")? Or are we going to live in a society of a stripped middle class because our macroeconomic earnings just nosedived for a generation?

I've been dealing with anxiety and insomnia for some time now but I should still be able to do what everyone else is able to do. This year I can barely bring myself to leave my dorm and go to class. All I want to do is sit alone on my couch and smoke weed. It helps alleviate my fears, helps me escape. Parties aren't even that fun anymore, I just drink to get fucked up, not to socialize. I've also recently had trouble dealing with strangers, especially other students in class. I avoid one of my classes solely based on the fact that we break up into groups to talk about class readings. I have no problem understanding anything and in the past I was a very social person and had no issues like this, but now I get super stressed and freaked out just thinking about talking to my peers. I have to make a presentation on a paper in October and it's been weighing on me since the day we got the syllabus in August.  I don't know if I'm going to be able to do it. I'm at a do or die point.

At this point I don't even know if I can pull my grades up enough which means I have no clue what I'm doing after I graduate (if I graduate). I'm already limited in jobs I can get now because of my GPA (forget any decent internships), and I sure as hell will be limited after school because of them. I love to write, but it seems all I do is come up with ideas that I can never fully express. It's more realistically a hobby than anything else. 

Basically I don't feel normal. I don't think I can hold a professional job. I feel too aware of reality to invest so much pain into something that doesn't even seem to matter. I'm just going through the motions.

tl;dr I have lost all drive to go to class, talk to people, create a future for myself. If I graduate college I'll have a very subpar GPA, little work experience, and very little direction."

I have watched idly as you have continued to roll out more or less the same products for the last ten years: 3 desktop models (the cheap, the moderate, and the extreme), 4 laptop models (the cheap, the moderate, the desktop, and the portable), and maybe a cellphone or printer in which you merely jump on the bandwagon of whatever's fashionable at the time.

Occasionally you try your hand at something difficult like palmtop computing where you try and compress the desktop operating system into something that resembles the likes of which can only be squeezed from the bowels of Marketing, or you attempt to satiate the somatic desires of pasty faced individuals or coffee addicted hipsters with some kind of ""tablet"" when we all know you took your latest laptop, chopped off the keyboard, and glued on a touch screen.

(Cellphone makers, you're not much better - you probably throw a dart at a dartboard to see which features your next model will have and then steal a design from an intern)

And lately I've not seen innovation come from our manufacturers, but rather from our software developers. And truth be told, this is perhaps the way it should be, after all we are limited by the physics of computing, but in the infinite wonderland of software there is still much left to be developed.

But what troubles me most is that, while I can forgive the lack of innovation, I cannot forgive the lack of desire to continue to seek it.

Do not attempt to console or chide me with remarks to the contrary. You cannot point at your product line and tell me with a straight face you've honestly spent time pursuing it.

So while you have your R&amp;D team twiddle their thumbs waiting for you to tell them to glue two processors together again to ""double"" the processing power of the latest and greatest device, I just wanted you to know... I don't give a flying fuck about Moore's law.

I ask you to continue to pursue innovation by perfecting what we have developed. Stop insisting that you have the patent to every little design... let's be honest - Touch screens make sense. The Mouse point clicking and moving objects is a no brainer now. Graphical User Interfaces, Web 2.0, shiny things... it's all been done. The only thing you can do is take what has come before and try and improve it, maybe by combining it with something else, maybe something no one ever tried before.

You're in a giant sandbox with other kids and you're all playing with the same blocks. Sure, one kid may have his perfectly neat little blocks and not share them, but it's not like your blocks are any different- in the end they're the same blocks and it's up to you to put them together. But the beautiful part is you can put them together however you want!

And sure, you can make them smaller, glue them together to make them bigger, or try and hide the blocks you broke by burying them in the sand. But ultimately it comes down to... How have you arranged your blocks today?

So please, strive to put your blocks together in new and ingenious ways, and if certain blocks work well together, then keep them together and see which blocks continue to compliment them. Don't keep tearing your blocks down and building the same old house with the same blocks... and don't try and pretend that shiny new blocks make the same house better. It's still the same house, it just doesn't smell like shit yet. (You know, because you're a diaper wearing kid in a sandbox)

Sincerely,
Concerned Technology Enthusiast

PS Oh... and... I don't care who the hell you are. If you ever go into the brainstorming session for your next product with the way a product looks first... I will personally find you and kick you in your ass. Computers work because of careful engineering... not because an art student got bored in modeling class."

A little background: Up until Junior year of college I didn't have a clue what I wanted to do with my Accounting degree; I was pretty sure I had the wrong major.  Then I was introduced to auditing and fell in love with it.  I would've died for an internship with any of the Big 4 (and still would), but I watched in vain as they scooped up all my friends around me.  So I applied again senior year...and just now again as a grad.  No bones.

I know that this is due in large part to my awful 2.5 major GPA (overall is 3.24).  I was disenfranchised with school and counted down the days 'til I could get that special job and do something with my life.  I finally got my senses back senior year, realizing that without the grades there is NO job.  So, I'm happy to report that I've been doing extremely well in grad school thus far.  But, alas, there's no way to convey that in a resume and it's certainly not something I'd include in a cover letter.  

If that weren't enough, I've worked temp in the internal audit department for a national bank and caught over $1,800,000 worth of errors in the course of a summer.  I also followed a thief's paper trail and in doing so won an award for excellent service- the youngest in my department.  Did I enjoy the hell out of the actual investigative process? Yeah, but there wasn't any satisfaction or substance in helping the bank.  I want to work on behalf of the public.  I want to work with the Big 4.

I KNOW I have what it takes- long hours, commutes, and crafty clients be damned.  I'll try again next year and continue to do so if I have to.  But until then, I'm lost. I have an accounting degree with no interest in non-audit accounting.  Grant Thornton? Maybe.  What do I do, Reddit?

tl;dr I am now a grad student with no purpose for my degree.

EDIT: Yeesh, I really appreciate the feedback, but apparently my lighthearted attempt at humor in ""What do?"" was setting off some grammar alarms.  My apologies."

And also to help other young adults deepen there relationship with God and to grow as a person spiritually, physically and mentally. The Honor Academy sends out thousands of interns around the United States to put on a big worships called, Acquire the Fire. The Honor Academy is set to help young adults learn leadership, and business skills, and to work as a team and on your own. The Honor Academy is a really great opportunity for me and will definitely be a great life changing experience. The Lord has shown me to love people when they might hurt you, to cherish people, because they could leave this earth any second, and to just really be thankful for the life he has given me. 
My plan was to actually go in August but i had a lot of financial issues. For my full year tuition at the Honor Academy, it will cost 10,000 dollars, which includes food and mission trips and sleeping cost Ex.. I have been fund raising and working hard but it is very hard to do alone. Even though I didn't make it in August God has given me another Chance to go in January. 
Prayers are so grateful, but if you would like to donate to my year at the Honor Academy call 903-324-7518

dl8vb,7,2010-09-30,Contemplating Joining The US Military. Life Altering Choice.,airfocemanpowpow,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dl8vb/contemplating_joining_the_us_military_life/,"  First let me say that I would have never even considered joining the US Air Force. I am a college graduate. I have not yet sunk my teeth into the job market. I have had some very reputable internships. I graduated with a 3.0 GPA and always loved learning, any type of information that was out there.   
   
  My senior year my college roommate and longtime friend said he was looking into the Air Force, I knew he would not join, he didn't. But I wanted to make sure if he proved me wrong that he would be alright. So I looked into it and frankly I was impressed with what I found and honestly, it has been at the back of my mind for a good year now.  
  
  Now I am thinking of enlisting into the US Air Force, my loved ones are fine with it as long as I am safe.  
  
* I feel it would be a great life experience, might even make it my life long career.  
* I would be able to travel. I would welcome the structure.  
* I would welcome the new friends that I would make due to the bonds we would share.  
* I would welcome the new skills I would gain.   
  
  And within the last 5 years I have felt very patriotic, within reason of course. I happen to have the belief that if you stay where you were born you will never get to be your own person or know what kind of man you are. Not sure if anyone has seen the movie Cinema Paradiso (1988 Italian film) but the boy leaves his hometown, never returns until decades later, to only find out the man he became, that is sort of where I am coming from.  
   
Although having completed college, I feel on one hand I might be wasting what I learned (I studied Documentary Film). Not a big demand for educational filmmakers at the time, or do you get paid a hefty amount to live on, best to be a hobby. I have been working on and off at a IT help desk. Never was my field, but I have always loved computers. Also feel if I do decide to leave what might I be able to get out of it aside from putting “Veteran” on my resume?  
   
**TLDR:** Went to college and gradated, considering enlisting into the US Air Force, not the Officer route. Any suggestions from those who have done this?
