Should I find an open source project and start contributing immediately? How does the job market look for those starting out?

awjoj,6,2010-02-01,Any advice for a web dev student thrust into a freelance internship?,throwawayintern,web_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/awjoj/any_advice_for_a_web_dev_student_thrust_into_a/,"I'm just starting my second semester in a web development program at a local technical college. Immediately after the first semester concluded, I was offered an internship via one of my professors. It's a NPO that has been around for almost two decades and their website, obviously, has a lot of content built up already; most of the recent content is dynamically driven, but the older articles are static and using templates.

The job is to convert all the content to WordPress and create an entirely custom theme to display various types of articles and news from each of their chapters. Of course, afterwards, I’m to provide training and technical support for a period of time. It was estimated (by my professor) the whole ordeal would take about eight months and they offered me next to nothing. I would make over twice as much continuing to work at my minimum-wage job.

I countered for twice as much, assuming they wouldn’t be able to afford it and was okay with that. I didn’t feel like it would be a pleasant experience considering their offer. But they came back and said they could afford about that much, so I accepted and took time off my previous job to do it. I’m sorely regretting it now.

Considering I have no experience with the business aspect and freelance is hard and terrifying for even seasoned web developers, I expected I’d be getting some direction and heavy guidance from my professor. Not so. He offers very little until I do something the wrong way. If I contact him with questions, I usually get patronizing and semi-rude responses. It’s also worth noting he was the previous (and volunteer) developer for the organization and seems to be pretty close to the client.

I’m feeling extremely discouraged and turned off to the whole project. My friends/family know how I’m feeling about the whole thing but I’m getting very little support. They seem to think I should just suck it up and do it for the experience, no matter how dismal it seems to be.

Are they right? Will I screw myself out of further opportunities if this one doesn’t work out? If not, is it even worth it for me to try to “save” the project? At this point, I haven’t turned in a project plan yet and I doubt there will be any contract signing."

I just got my first real job ever, it's in San Francisco.  The only problem is that I grew up in NY, went to college in PA, and moved back home to NY after graduation for an internship.  So essentially, I don't know anyone or anything in SF.

I've never had problems making friends, and I have a good group of friends at home and from college.  But this isn't college - I'm going to be busy working!   The job is at a tech startup with only two other guys, who are older, and probably not material that I'd want be making good-buddies-to-go-out-drinking-every-weekend with.

So Reddit, what do you all suggest I do?  

If any of you live in San Francisco and would like to be my friend, let me know!  I'm a 23 year dude, ex-college athlete (wrestling), I love video games, movies, getting drunk, tech-geeky stuff, football, being active, and generally just having a good time.  I'm easy going, I never get into fights with anyone, and I just want to be able to meet people to hang out with.

**tl;dr** I'm moving to a city I've never been to before for a job.  I don't know anyone there, and the people I'll be working with are probably not the best bet for me to be hanging out with on weekends.

How do I go about making friends!?

Thanks so much for any help!

axlcw,15,2010-02-03,"Whats the average frequency of sex in a relationship? I want more, but its always according to her schedule.",GGINQUISITOR,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/axlcw/whats_the_average_frequency_of_sex_in_a/,"Background: I'm 26 and she is 23. We are both students (im in grad school and she's nearly done with undergrad), I work a full time job, she works a part time and then also has an internship (the total is about 30hrs on her side and maybe 50 max on mine). We have always had busy lifestyles. We've been in a relationship for 3 years and living together for 10 months. This is the first relationship I've been in although I've dated and slept with around 15 different girls beforehand. Her track record is the same except that she's had more boyfriends (and maybe her number is more around 9). In the past year she's started bringing up marriage once a week or so.

When we first started dating we'd have sex daily and sometimes even more than once a day, as time has progressed (and presumably is only natural) we have had sex less and less. Currently its about twice maybe three times a week max. For a while we were having sex once a week (at this time our schedules weren't anymore hectic than they were prior to that). Whenever we do its always according to her schedule. If I'd like to after a long day of work and class and I come on to her she'll push me away more than half the time (even if all i'd like is just a quickie) even if the only thing she's doing is watching HGTV (all the nesting/house hunting shows). 

Frankly, I've grown tired of practically begging for sex. If I don't bring it up at all then we'd have sex maybe once a week. If this frustrates me enough that I end up talking to her about it then she'll grudgingly at first have sex with me that night (but again always right before bed and on her schedule). 

Before we have sex she practically makes it feel like a chore, during sex she seems to really enjoy it so I don't think its that she doesn't enjoy having sex with me (im rather certain she orgasms a couple times, although a lot of times she'll complain if it hurts if i go too deep or towards the end if i'm taking longer to finish). 

One aspect that may be affecting the frequency is that I'm more physically active than she is and go to the gym and play sports regularly (gym 3-4 times a week, then snowboarding once). She plays tennis occasionally (in warmer weather), but never goes to the gym and isn't in the best of shape (that's another issue in our relationship, for a different time). 

The lack of sex makes me bitter and when i go out with friends to bars and get hit on by girls (which is actually pretty often, though of course, i state I've got a girlfriend and am uninterested) it drives me crazy to come home and thinking about what I'm missing. I don't know if I'm blowing this out of proportion, if I'm simply being an unrealistic asshole, or if we're are simply too big a mismatch. This is only one issue of many but its one that really sets the stage for aggravation in other areas of our relationship.

TLDR; How much sex is normal at our stage in the relationship and at our ages? I want to have more sex and I feel like if we're not having that much now, how much worse will it get when we get older and the sex decreases even further? Is it normal to see other girls that are more attractive and receptive and become frustrated, at times bitter, in the situation I'm in? I probably sound like an enormous asshole.

**Update** We spoke about it last night and she agreed to have more sex and with more spontaneity. There are still other problems in the relationship, but provided we can resolve them as well (and that this one really is resolved) I plan on staying in the relationship. Can't say that it all won't end the next time we have a big fight, but I think that three years is worth trying to save. Thanks for all the advice!

My boss ignored the licensing issues due to the GPL, and is reluctant to make the code open-source, thus making his innovation available to competitors. I told him about *BSD and explained him about the more permissive license, he was interested but not willing to switch, because some of his software was already based on Linux/iptables.

Currently paying for an apartment I haven’t lived in for two months.",bentaboutrent,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/aywyf/advice_please_reddit_currently_paying_for_an/,"Anyone here had to leave an apartment before the lease was up? Did the landlord have an agent who did a questionable job of re-renting the place?

Backstory: Your average roommate horror story, I ‘spose. We had worked together during an internship in San Francisco and then decided to get a place together once the internship was up. We find a place with a great view ... but once we move in, we start noticing all the crap that’s wrong with the place: elevator doesn’t work, fridge leaks constantly (spoiling our food), no fire alarms, icky mold, screen door that’s fallen off because it’s so corroded (landlord said she would replace before we moved in), etc. Only after constant complaining does the landlord do a halfass job fixing anything--after two months the fridge was never fixed or replaced because she wanted to see the fridge leaking herself. Well, it would leak sporadically and we even showed her our soggy food and food with a layer of ice on it.

Soooo ... shortly after we move in, roommate gets a boyfriend and she does a complete 180. The world stops for this guy, she starts acting different, and I soon get it out of her that he’s a drug dealer. I’m a pretty quiet person who keeps to herself, and these two are up all night talking, playing music, and laughing (sweet jesus, did they have loud, annoying laughs). She gets no sleep, starts acting increasingly erratic, and I can hear her at all hours of the night blowing her nose. Oh, and the guy has basically moved in at this point.

After several confrontations, weeks of her drug dealing boyfriend living in the place, me not feeling safe in my own home, and her refusal to compromise at all (I didn’t trust that she was in a sound state of mind during all this, I knew this when I talked to her, but didn’t know what else I could do). We have the traditional falling out. And landlord could care less about the situation, as expected.

The landlord said before that we could give a 30-days notice and leave--this was after our calling about several things wrong with our apartment. She just never wanted to deal with it. Don’t have it in writing, though. We both move out, and I drop the keys off with the landlord’s agent about two months ago. I now live about six hours away. The place still hasn’t been rented, according to the agent, and our deposit is almost up (in another week).

Any advice, Reddit? Should I start pestering the heck out of the agent? Or just accept that I’ll probably end up in small claims court for additional rent?

Or do you have any similar stories? Or any words to put this whole thing into perspective?

I'm a casual user of the site and have been for several years, but because this issue is sensitive to me, I've decided to post this with an anonymous account.

For some background, I was a skinny kid until midway through grade school when I had a bout of clinical depression and weekly hospital visits during which I put on a ton of weight rapidly, taking me from the average flat-stomached eight year old to categorically obese in a few months. After about six years, early in high school, I lost 50 pounds straight without any exercise which left me with an unalterable amount of excess skin. (And hey, if I'd known that I'd end up with this problem, I would have lost it steadily the right way.)

Now, I'm in my early twenties, and I've been eating healthily for several years, my weight remains stable, and I've lifted weights from three to five days a week for over a year. It's my lifestyle. Despite the strength gains, excellent health, and increased tone, I still suffer from visible, albeit somewhat mild, [gynecomastia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynecomastia), love handles and pouch. This sort of excess skin is visible through any cloth, so I am way too self-conscious to even wear t-shirts that would otherwise look great on me. Lastly, it deals a direct toll on my confidence, and I stray away from prolonged social contact with persons I'm sexually or romantically interested in because of my fear of my body. I've lived this way for all of high school and now most of college. I'm a bit fed up of feeling left out of life.

Foremost, I'd like to know what entails surgery for excess skin removal or liposuction. I'm also looking for any advice regarding the potential for surgery, or anything you feel that should be said. From people who have had surgery for excess skin or similar problems, doctors, health enthusiasts... even people suffering from the same problem now. Any advice helps.

Lastly, regarding finances, I'm an American, and I do not expect my health insurance to cover this or to help me. I'm paying for this with all the money I am saving from work and internships.

I would love to hear any thoughts or critiques that the reddit community might have. My father is a very thoughtful man who has plenty of insightful commentary to offer; the following is a note he wrote to me as I packed up my things and prepared to move away for the first time. (I edited out the glaringly personal details).

1. Take this next four years to explore the world – macro and micro. Don't let yourself settle into familiar things and activities and lose this chance to look at things from different angles. You will never have another time like this in your life – don't regret not taking advantage of the things around you at [school]. Get involved, go to the art museums, take interesting classes, attend plays, watch your friends play sports, join intramural teams, go for hikes, go skiing, study abroad, do an internship, have a snowball fight, take road trips, do community service, hang out in the common rooms...don't just exist for four years. Be memorable and build tremendous memories and a foundation that will last your whole life.

2. Keep an open mind – let different ideas, people, experiences, and passions enter your world for you to examine. Question things. This is not the time in your life to reject things or people outright that are in conflict with what you know and enjoy. You are not fully formed yet, and you may just find that some of the diversity of thought and background and perspective around you will enrich you if you let it in.

3. Find the right balance between academics and fun – too much of either one could ruin college for you. You are there to learn in the classroom, certainly...but you are also there to learn about life by living it. Love and respect the freedom you will have, but don't let that freedom prevent you from being a good student and good ""citizen.""

4. Remember that it is impossible to have too many friends in your life – and having friends in college will only add to your group of friends from [high school]. It isn't an ""either/or"" proposition...it isn't a zero-sum game.

5. Stay connected with the people in your life that matter most to you – including your family (and especially [your brothers].) We want to experience just a little bit of the joys and challenges and discoveries you will have at [school].

6. Kindness, consideration, respect, and the ability to listen with empathy are great life skills – and you will be amazed by the wonderful things that can happen to you if you continue to use those skills with the people around you.

7. Don't do anything half-ass. Commit to your classwork, your soccer team, your friends, your professors, your college – do not go through this wonderful opportunity on cruise control. Challenge yourself and push yourself and surprise yourself with what you can accomplish.

8. Don't be afraid to fall in love, but don't think that you have to be in love to be with a girl. Girls are remarkable in many ways, and you will find you enjoy spending time with them. But respect them always.

9. Remember that you can call us at anytime day or night – to chat, to complain, to ask for advice, to beg for money, to share your world and to let us share our world with you. You are not that far away, and we will literally be there for you whenever you need us. Literally.

10. Succeed in the things that matter, and relax about everything else."
azm6q,0,2010-02-08,"Draft 2 of ""Tips for Incoming College Freshman"".  Need more feedback.",SirMashew,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/azm6q/draft_2_of_tips_for_incoming_college_freshman/,"TL;DR VERSION:

* Go to class.  ALWAYS.
* HAVE FUN!
* Be somewhat of a ""keener""
* Be very open socially.  Do not be shy.
* Have a strong work ethic.  Having a level 80 will not get you a 80k+ a year job, having connections and a degree MIGHT.
* Don't overdo the partying! School first, partying second.  Keep it to a minimum.
* Overestimate on how long it will take you.
* Stay very well organized.  Keep a planner.
* Do not study in your dorm or with a computer nearby.
* Take notes on paper rather than computer, it will keep more focused.
* Learn responsibility.
* DON'T WORRY TOO MUCH!   The point of being in college is to LEARN, not to be perfect every single time.  College is more of a networking tool than anything.  Take plenty of (unpaid) internships.

FULL VERSION:

* Try to meet as many people as possible, join all the clubs you are interested in.
* HAVE FUN!
* GO TO CLASS! ALWAYS! UNLESS YOU ARE DEATHLY ILL!
* Get outside of your department in terms of friends.
* Have a strong work ethic
* If you're having problems with work you've been set, remember you can go see a professor. Academics are clever and usually helpful (though often quite busy), and in general, undergraduates never go and look for advice.
* In general, it's better to seek help early rather than later.
* Know your limits in terms of drinking / partying / etc.
* Overestimate on how long it will take you.
* Do NOT go home every weekend, and avoid going home at all for the first semester so you can learn responsibility. Be open minded and respectful of others' beliefs or disbeliefs. 
* Don't take more than 16 hours at a time. (This depends on how well you did in high school.  If you are an A-B student, feel free to pile on as many as you feel comfortable.)
* You only get one chance to learn something: you miss a lecture, but it's ok - you'll catch up over the weekend? No, you won't. It's now or never.
* Get a job while you're there, but not just any job. Try to find something that's low stress, keeps you engaged, and somewhat relevant to the real world. (Go for something like office or lab work instead of food service.)
* Day one - no one knows your past. That can be fantastic - or complete reboot. Fresh slate. Meet people, get involved - do stuff. Don't be a dorm slug.
* There's usually a lot of drinking - don't overdo it, it fucks you up. Most people get only mild hangovers from beer, but terrible ones (with headaches) from booze. Drink a lot of water before you go to sleep.
* Don't smoke weed before lectures.
* Never do any drugs that you do not know what they do or have preparations to handle, such as Trip Sitters, etc.
* Go to any and all freshmen events.
* GO TO CLASS! ALWAYS! UNLESS YOU ARE DEATHLY ILL!
* Be open to people.
* Be prepared to work, but make sure you have fun in the process. Just don't just create a self contained misery chamber.
* Try not to waste the time between classes.
* Try to do readings BEFORE class.
* READ YOUR SYLLABUS EVERY DAY!, complete EVERY ASSIGNMENT ON TIME! Submit drafts of major projects to professors for critique.
* For tests,  get involved in study groups.
* Get a whiteboard. Stick it on a wall away from your computer. Use it to study and revise.
* Write in your text, it will help with studying.
* Redo all your homework. Well, not all of it, but most of it. I'm a Mechanical Engineering major, so most of my classes are heavy on math and physics. I find that re-doing homework helps me master the basic equations and reminds me of all the sneaky tricks the questions might try to pull.
* GO TO CLASS! ALWAYS! UNLESS YOU ARE DEATHLY ILL!
* Set realistic goals.
* Become familiar with the library!
* Don't procrastinate. Don't stretch margins or fonts to get the right page length and, conversely, don't turn in 10 pages when the professor wants 5.
* Put your laptop AWAY. Take PAPER notes.  Paper notes WILL make you focus more. 
* I'll repeat what's been said: keep track of your attendance. You never know when you may be sick or have to run out of town, and the day you decided to stay in because you took too many beer bong hits will cost you. 
* Tip for a better syllabus: Make an Excel spreadsheet. Column A had the class name, Column B had the date of every instance of that class, and Column C had the ""task/event"" from the syllabus for that day. Fill it all out, then SORT by Column B. You now have all your due assignments for every class in chronological order. 
* easybib.com is your friend
* GO TO CLASS! ALWAYS! UNLESS YOU ARE DEATHLY ILL!
* Go to the first class. I don't care if the professor just goes over the syllabus and then dismisses you can get a really good idea of how the class is going to be just from that.
* Do not be afraid to drop a class.
* Take charge of your class scheduling.
* SCHOOL IS FIRST, PARTYING IS SECOND.
* DON'T WORRY TOO MUCH!   The point of being in college is to LEARN, not to be perfect every single time.
* You are in college to learn valuable skills and develop yourself. The classes you take and the major you choose should reflect that.
* Drinking is for Friday and Saturday only.
* Be prepared to feel overwhelmed.
* Look into ""CLEPing"" out of things. (http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/clep/about.html)
* Do not write down everything. Write in outline form so your notes will be easy to skim and review. Be sure to take clear, concise notes every class.
* There are administrative departments at your college designed to help students with studying, finding/founding activities, finding internships/jobs/grad schools. Use them.



STUDY TIPS:

* Use 3x5 cards to make flashcards from your notes and texts. Carry them with you everywhere, even at work, and use them to study.
* Take Omega-3 supplements (fish oil/flaxseeds), this will increase your concentration and focus.
* For anything that requires memorization, learn advance memory techniques. I recommend ""The Memory Book"" by Harry Loryane.
* Use abbreviations and mnemonics to translate all your books and notes for the test to a couple of pages and reread them at least 100 times.
* If professors offer any practice/old exams before a test, go over them multiple times.
* Take care of yourself, it will help your concentration. But if it tastes good, eat it anyway! 
* Never study for more than an hour without taking a break.
* Set up a consistent study schedule.  
* Find a nice, quiet study area that is not your dorm room.  One hour of focused studying is a lot better than three hours of idly flipping through a textbook while chatting to roomies. If you're studying with a laptop, turn the internet off.
* After each class, take a few minutes to review what was taught while walking to your next class
* Study and don't hook up with any of the girls on your floor because you will regret it.
* Study the hardest subject first."

My grades haven't suffered yet, but since I have almost no motivation to do homework or study and I drink more than I used to I don't think that's going to be the truth for long. I'm becoming so despondent that I can't even feel the love I used to have for my boyfriend, and I'm becoming downright cruel towards him. I want to break it off completely, but he won't let me because he knows this is not who I am. I've gone to a psychologist, but he did little to help me and I really don't think going back will help. It makes me focus on my problems more than get past them. 

Anyway, I was wondering if anyone else has gone through a similar phase and how they got out of it. I'll be glad to give any extra details so long as they do not give away my identity. This is my first post so please be kind...

First, I think it would be great to have a forum for women in male-dominated fields to be able to discuss openly about the pressures they face in being women and in these fields. Second, I think it would be a great academic resource. My sorority has a list of majors/minors in the house, in hopes, that if you are having trouble in the class, you can seek help from someone who has already taken it. This is great, but there are no other physics majors in the house, so the resource has been useless to me. Also, I find it easier to ask for help from fellow women because of some issues I have had with asking for help from misogynist professors. Third, I would like to inform the members of opportunities. There are many organizations that are working hard to increase the female numbers in their offices (for jobs and internships) but it is hard to find this information. So, those are my ideas.

I met her a few months before she left for nearly a year in a cross-country internship.

I was worried about my own ability to abstain.  I am a sex addict and use sex as a way to overcome a crippling depression and loneliness.  This is something I've spent the past several years coming to terms with and was getting in a good way when we met.  Still though, I was worried.

I'd lost many of my supports as she was leaving and since she left.  I spent the first few months alone in my house as drunk as I could stay.  Drunk to get through the lonliness and terrified to go out for fear I'd slip up and fuck someone.  I noticed I was drinking to blackout often and have a history of waking up with people not knowing how I got there.  She and I discussed this at length - I was trying not to drink but had few supports and honestly a problem.  We agreed on people we both knew who I would go out with - who knew us and knew me and would get me home if things got silly.  I also agreed to drink less.

I went out last week with one of my designated friends.  We went to a party.  I drank too much too fast.  I remember being at the party and laughing then seeing how much I'd drank and thinking I needed to slow down.  There is a flash of possibly throwing up, my friend in my bed and then I'm awake.

I call my friend and thank her for getting me home.  I mention I don't remember getting home but I feel like something is off.  She texts to say, ""Your message implies you have conveniently forgotten the events of last evening.  I have a hard time with this.  Please never contact me again.""  She has not responded to any of my calls.

I told my lady I'd gone out with the friend and I didn't remember what happened.  I haven't mentioned the uneasy feeling that something sexual may have.

It's been about a week and I was calming down.  Perhaps I groped her or said some inappropriate things.  The friend knows me well, knows my past and was of my confidants as I worked through explaining to my gf my history of blacking out.  I was beginning to think it was nothing.

Today she text me to say I'd given her an STI (unlikely).  I still don't know exactly what happened but I'm pretty positive by assumption.  I'm getting tested Monday.

The most upsetting part is not knowing.  Having only a flash of an event.  How do I explain what happened?  What went wrong?  I don't know at all!  I have a history of this behavior but never in a relationship.  I don't want to lose her.  Advice?"

b1j27,5,2010-02-12,IAmA recovering Compulsive Gambler who has been clean for over a year and a half. AMA,NoMoreBets,IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/b1j27/iama_recovering_compulsive_gambler_who_has_been/,"I don't want to give my exact clean date because I would like to keep my anonymity as I have not shared most aspects of this story even with my closest friends. Yes this is a throw-away account. 

I will start my story at the beginning of my collegiate career. Directly out of a very good high school i attended a very well regarded college where I studied a form of computer science. For the first 2 years of my college career I was extremely involved around campus. I was a member of many many clubs and organizations and active in greek life. I was very happy with my life and had an extremely bright future ahead of me. 

During this period of time I would gamble a little bit every now and then, maybe once a semester. During the summer after my sophomore year the trouble began when I started visiting the casino's more and more often with my friends. I was also winning. A lot. I played poker exclusively as I didn't want to play a game that I didn't ""have an edge at"" but that summer I could do no wrong. I basically played ""professionally"" as in I didn't have a job other then playing cards and living at the casino. It was a dream come true. So I thought. 

The next semester in school I started doing extremely poorly gradewise, and I started to lose interest in doing the activities I had previously enjoyed. I was going to the casino at least once a month if not more. Looking back on it now I see this was the beginning of the end for me. It was during this period that I also started playing craps and blackjack. I basically new the moment I first rolled the dice that I was a compulsive gambler, unfortunately it would take a lot more of my money and misery before I was willing to admit it. You see, I had always looked down on anyone in the casino who was ""playing against the odds."" 

This continued for another year where I was mostly just scraping by in class by doing the bare minimum and I had almost completely dropped out of my social activities. When I wasn't gambling I was also playing quite a bit of WOW which didn't help (and for a long time I thought was my primary problem but now I realize it was only a placeholder from the gambling when I couldn't get to the casino. I have subsequently tried to get back into other mmo's and find I don't enjoy them at alll... ) 

The summer after my junior year of college I had a fabulous internship offered to me which I took. It was a dream job in more ways then one (so I thought) because it also put me within a 15 minute drive to the casino. I started going daily and in a very very short time it began to affect my performance at work. 6 weeks into my 11 week internship I was fired. This was the beginning of the end. 

I was now a total recluse except for a few of my closest friends. I failed out of school this semester while continuinig to go to the casino as often as possible. I wasn't working but still had access to large amounts of money due to being born lucky. I was losing around 10 grand a month. It was sick, but I couldn't stop and I didn't know where to go for help. I had never heard of Gambler's Anonymous at this time. 

I kept up this charade for another 15 months or so, living off of my folks money and contemplating suicide on a regular basis because I could not control my gambling. 

Finally I had snapped, I went on a week long spree to foxwoods where I lost enough money for a small house. This sum I could not explain away and I finally decided to end my own life as I felt there was no way out from the situation I was in. 

I felt horribly alone and I was fed up with my inability to control my compulsion, I literally felt like the only way to free myself and my family of my sins was to end my life. I won't go into the attempt, as if I did it would break my anonymity to anyone I know IRL who would read this. I will say however it was a very serious attempt that left me with a broken back and in the hospital for several weeks. 

Fortunately my parents understood that my gambling was an illness (I'm still not sure I believe this but it is useful in helping me recover so I go along with it) and with the proper treatment it could be arrested. They sent me to a gambling rehab for 45 days. 

The rehab was an amazing experience but most who read this will not be so lucky so i'm not going to dwell on it. If you have questions ask. 

When I got out of rehab I went to live with my folks and started to attend GA meetings several times a week. I got a sponsor and started to figure out how to get my life back on track. 

The first thing about Gambler's Anonymous (referred to as GA from here on out) is first and foremost stopping gambling. Let me tell you it is not easy. It is the hardest thing I have ever done in my life, and what's worse is that it is a constant, never ending struggle. My first several months home I went to 3-4 meetings a week and the urge to gamble hardly ever left me. This is what brought me around to calling it a disease. 

I can look at it objectively, as I am not a stupid person and I can say ""here is what gambling did to me, it made me want to end my own life"" and yet I still WANT to do it. I still feel compelled to do it. It's insane, it has to be a disease of some sort (again I don't buy into this 100% but it helps me in my recovery so I'm not going to argue over semantics) 

I got a job and started to get my life back on track. I again started beocming involved in organizations around me who did things that I loved to do (I won't say which again for anonymity reasons) 

I also got a sponsor and started working the twelve steps. The twelve steps are an amazing process that I think everyone should go through even if they are not an addict. If you actually read the twelve steps you will note that only 1 of them (the first) even mentions your addictions (gambling, drugs, sex .. whatever.) The other 11 are simply about character change. 

I will only make this a little longer by getting into my journey of step 1-3 and 8-9. 

Step 1 is admitting your powerless over gambling and that your life is unmanageable. This may seem like a trivial step but when your in the position of an addict it is extremely hard to admit that you are powerless. You think to yourself, if I am powerless then how can I hope to arrest this disease? Also most addicts are very intellectual and narcissistic and do not want to admit defeat in general and certainly not over their addiction. However once you embrace this step you move on to steps 2 and 3 (which I will cover together) which shows one how they can recover once they admit they are powerless. 

Step 2 and 3 are as follows: 
2 Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to a normal way of thinking and living.
3 Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of this power of our own understanding.

You'll see that 2 follows from 1 naturally. If nearly everyone in the GA program has admitted to being powerless over gambling, but yet still somehow manages to refrain, then there must be a higher power helping them. 

Step 3 follows from there. We, as addicts must turn our will and our lives over to our higher power. This is very unnatural even for most religious and spiritual people. Most people, when they pray to G-d (or any higher power) will pray FOR something, they will say ""G-d please let me get a good grade and I won't try to touch shirley under her dress anymore"" or ""please G-d let the colts win the superbowl so I can make one more score."" 

Instead the recovering addicts prays only for knowledge of G-d's will and the power to carry it out. When I pray each day I thank G-d for giving me another day to live, another day to be better and make up for my past wrongs. I pray that today is my day to help another person who is suffering, to put my in a situation where my knowledge can help others. When I do get an urge to gamble I simply step back and say ""G-d help me"" and it helps quite a bit. 

One trigger for my gambling is stress and espcially relationships. I have never been very suave with the ladies and these situations can easily send up triggers, however I have learned to embrace the serentity prayer in all aspects of my life. 

G-d, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change. 
Courage to change the things I can, and the 
Wisdom to know the difference. 

When I come across a tough situation I ask myself ""can i change"" if so I try to do it. If not I pray for serenity to accept that I have to live with whatever is occurring and to not let it affect my recover. 

In closing I want to say that one thing that has helped me the most is remember the phrase 1 day at a time. As a human I can, with G-d's help, endure ANYTHING for 1 24 hour period of time. However earlier in the program it would be even 1 hour at a time. I would say, I won't gamble now but I'll go in an hour, and then do the same thing next hour. The time passed, slowly but surely and by the grace of G-d and Gambler's Anonymous I now have over a year and a half of clean time. 

I am recovering as well in other aspects of my life. I  am now working full time (at a different better job then when I started my recovery) while attending school full time to finish my B.S..  I am more involved in the lives of most of friends then when I lived next to them (as opposed to several hundred miles away) and I love my life. I am also beginning to take care of my body (which I had neglected both while gambling and in recovery) and it feels good. 

One last thing I will leave you with that gives me chills. The first day I wen into rehab I was given the Gambler's Anonymous ""One day at a time"" book, which has saying in it for each day and a small prayer. On that day the prayer was: ""G-d preserved me to help carry out his purpose""

Many of my friends use reddit nearly every day, and I've seen some of the stuff that you lot can do, so I thought worth a try!

I'm a second year student at Bournemouth University currently looking for a years internship / placement.  So far, it's not going too well.

I applied to Microsoft, and didn't get an interview (because of the situational questions). Just got a reply back from the only other place I've applied, which was a local school, no joy, no reason.

I've had my CV checked by a good number of people from the Uni's employment help service, and they say it's fantastic. I got a 1st in my first year of uni, and so far doing even better this year.

I think my main problem is I don't know EXACTLY what I want to do. I'm studying ""Computing"", which is the broadest course I could find! This year our units are Programming, Data Management, Games, Team Projects, Networks and Security, and System Design. I enjoy them all really, although I do like programming alot.

I'm a problem solver at heart, it's what I like to do, solve problems! I also like computers, and have a pretty good all round knowledge too!

I'm looking for a placement preferably in the South of the UK or London.

Any help or advice welcome :)"

I was not in foster care or involved with the child welfare system during my childhood, but was abused during my childhood.

I have a dear friend who was in foster care and she aged out in 1999.

b3811,13,2010-02-17,Reddit Please Help! My sister is falling apart mentally and I need advice to give her.,[deleted],lostgeneration,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostgeneration/comments/b3811/reddit_please_help_my_sister_is_falling_apart/,"I'm really at a loss for my sister's situation.

She's currently unemployed and living with my mom and has completely lost motivation to try and help herself. She is almost 22 and has never held a job longer than a couple month long internship as a pharamcy technician assistant. She has some college education but dropped out and got her pharmacy technician certification. The month she obtained her certification all the employers started their hiring freezes. She has been unemployed for a little over a year and has stopped trying to do anything to help herself. 

Problem is, my mom is financially underwater and she is going to have to sell her house because she can't afford to pay all the increased taxes, bills and maxed out credit cards. My mom and my sister do not get along and they always fight over stupid things. My sister has a habit of getting defensive and shutting out people, so anything you say to her that doesn't jive with her perconceived notions of the world she reacts negatively to. This includes well intentioned advice. My mom is a whole different can of worms that I don't want to get into, but let's say she's a very dysfunctional and negative person.

It's hard enough to get a job with experience and qualifications, but not caring about your outward appearance and how you interact with people will almost certaintly doom any job interview. She is simply really naive to a shocking degree. Almost as if she's missing fundimental life skills to cope with the real world. I told her it might be a good idea to see a psychologist to help with her feelings of depression but she doesn't want to do that. Her health insurance is running out next month due to her not being in school anymore, so it will be harder for her to get help after that.

As a person sitting on the side lines watching all of this unfold, it is really disturbing. Granted she has a little less than $20,000 from my dad's life insurance policy left, I really don't feel confident she understands the urgency of needing to try to help herself. She'll probably sit around feeling sorry for herself and messing around on her computer until she is broke and then be in even worse shape. Neither myself or my mom can pick up the slack for her once she goes broke.

Does anyone else have experience with situations similar to mine? 

In the past, I've tried suggesting that she take her volunteering role at the animal shelter and try to make it into a good work experience bullet point on her resume. But she decided she wanted to quit after 2 weeks once the shelter operators had her start working with the dogs (she likes cats). I've been stressig that showing dedication and a work ethic, whether you're employed or not will look good on a resume devoid of substantive work experience. Taking on responsibility and learning something as simple as how to do clerical work and run an office. She doesn't seem to make the connection. As a last ditch effort to get her out of the house and talk to people I told her it might be a good idea to take a fun class at the local junior college. She decided to take an art class, but now it's looking like she may not stick with that either.

I know there isn't a whole lot I can do to influence her, since she's her own individual and the decisions are ultimately hers. I just hate seeing someone completely collapse in front of my eyes like this. If she's waiting for another economic boom to hand her a job, she'll be waiting a LOOONG time.

EDIT: I don't live with my mom. I left the house when I was 18 for college and have been on my own for the past 7 years. If my mom sells the house I anticipate her being able to make a profit because she and my father (deceased) bought their home back in 1994 before property values got insane. Still selling a house in this economy could take over  a year... mom waited until she got into a pretty deep hole before she even wanted to admit to herself that she may need to retool her lifestyle.

Seeing the successful coming out stories has me thinking of making one of my own, but here’s some background info first. 

I’m a second year college student studying biology. I really like it, especially evolutionary biology. I would love to make it into a career. I have a good shot this summer of getting an internship at a museum, studying paleobiology.  One problem, my dad is a conservative Christian, and I mean very conservative. He hates Obama with a passion, thinks homosexuality is evil, believes the world was created 6,000 years ago, and thinks evolution is a big lie. I slowly became atheist throughout high school but kept up the pretense for my dad, who seemed to become more conservative as I grew less. Now I pretty much silently disagree with him on everything he believes. And he loves to talk about conservatism too! It seemed like every day he had to bring up how Obama is corrupting America, how gays are evil, or some “fact” he found whish disproves evolution. That’s one major reason I chose the college I go to now, it’s over 10 hours away and in another state, that way I only have to hear about it when I’m home for breaks, or on weekends when I call home, or in the random emails he sends me….

Anyway, I’m sick of lying and pretending to be someone I’m not. I’d really like to go on this internship, but there’s no way my dad will let me if he knows what it’s about. But at the same time, I’m afraid my dad will overreact, either kicking me out of the house permanently and disowning me or forcing me to drop out of college and come home to preach to me day and night. I’m still financially dependent on them as they help pay for some of my college expenses and I still live at home during the summer.  I only have a few years before I probably move out permanently but I can tell these last few years a gonna be a pain.

So now I have a question for all of you, do I risk coming out atheist or suck it up for a few more years? If I do come out, how do I go about doing it?

I was responsible for the database backend and interface, which I implemented using Java and [an h2 database](http://www.h2database.com/html/main.html). The member of my group responsible for the GUI basically didn't do it though, so the project didn't end so well. Next year will be my Senior year, and I'll have courses focused more on testing than development, and the final course is a Senior project and 30-minute presentation/seminar.


Most courses have repeated the same concepts of the ""Software Design Model,"" including specification, requirements analysis, coding, testing, maintaining. We've also talked about other methods like agile programming, extreme programming, and pair programming.


My chief complaints are that the professors in the department aren't convincingly knowledgeable/experienced, and that the courses don't require enough work to be comfortable in the languages.

I work for the school's web team, but that only consists of HTML/CSS/Javascript work with the occasional C# form. I'm beginning to worry that when I graduate, I'll be completely unprepared for what's expected of me when/if I get a job.

b4dqs,1,2010-02-20,How much vitamin D3 should I take?,[deleted],AlternativeHealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlternativeHealth/comments/b4dqs/how_much_vitamin_d3_should_i_take/,"Official Recommended Intake for Vitamin D is Too Low
2,000 IU/Day or More Needed for Optimal Health

by William B. Grant, Ph.D.

(OMNS, Feb 19, 2010) Vitamin D has been a natural part of man's experience forever, and 90% of vitamin D is derived from solar ultraviolet-B (UVB) irradiance. The health effects of vitamin D can be and have been determined from a variety of studies including ecological, observational (case-control and cohort), and cross-sectional studies.

Vitamin D helps both to prevent and to treat chronic diseases including many types of cancer, cardiovascular disease (coronary heart disease, stroke, etc.), congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus (types 1 and 2), osteoporosis, falls, and fractures. It is also effective against infectious diseases including both bacteria and viral infections: bacterial vaginosis, pneumonia, dental caries, periodontal disease, tuberculosis, sepsis/septicemia, Epstein-Barr virus, and influenza type A such as A/H1N1 influenza. The autoimmune diseases include asthma, type 1 diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis, and perhaps rheumatoid arthritis.

Pregnancy outcomes are also adversely affected by low serum D levels. 40% of primary Cesarean-section deliveries in the United States are linked to low D levels (9% of births in the United States involve primary C-section), and preeclampsia is also linked to low serum levels of D. In regards to cancer, vitamin D helps cells fit into the organs properly or commit suicide (apoptosis), and also reduces angiogenesis (new blood vessel growth) around tumors and reduces metastasis. For metabolic diseases, the mechanisms include increased insulin sensitivity and insulin production. For infectious diseases, vitamin D induces production of cathelicidin and defensins, which have antimicrobial and antiendotoxin activities.

Due to current lifestyles in the United States, most people do not spend sufficient time in the sun to produce the higher serum D levels associated with optimal health. Black-Americans are particularly vulnerable to low levels due to their darker skin, which reduces the amount of UVB that reaches the 7-dehydrocholesterol in the lower epidermis to produce previtamin D. Black-Americans have a 25% higher mortality rate than White-Americans, and this difference may be explained in terms of lower serum 25(OH)D levels. Solar UVB is an excellent source of vitamin D during about half of the year. The way to take advantage of the sun as a source of vitamin D is to expose as much of the body as possible without sunscreen near solar noon, the time when one's shadow is shorter than one's height, for 10-30 minutes depending on skin pigmentation, being careful not to turn pink or red or burn. ( http://www.doctoryourself.com/holick.html )

Supplements represent an efficient way to obtain sufficient vitamin D. African-Americans should consider taking 3000 International Units (IU) per day while White-Americans should consider taking 2000 IU/day. The current dietary guideline, approximately 400 IU/day, was based on the amount of vitamin D in a spoonful of cod liver oil, which prevented rickets.

There are few adverse effects of vitamin D. With whole-body exposure to the sun, one can make at least 10,000 IU/day in a short time. Adverse effects such as hypercalcemia have been found in general only for 20,000-40,000 IU/day for very long periods. However, those with certain diseases such as adenoma of the parathyroid gland, granulomatous diseases, lymphoma, sarcoidosis, and tuberculosis, should limit their vitamin D intake or production due to the fact that the body's innate immune system produces too much 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in the serum, which can raise serum calcium levels too high.

Several studies have examined how much mortality rates and economic burdens of disease could be lowered if the population had more vitamin D. These studies were for Western Europe, Canada, the Netherlands, and the United States. They generally found that mortality rates could be reduced by about 15%.

During pregnancy and lactation, women should be taking about 6000 IU/day. The current US ""Adequate Intake"" recommendation is a mere 200 IU/day. Bruce W. Hollis and Carol L. Wagner, Medical University of South Carolina, recently completed a randomized controlled trial vitamin D supplementation for pregnant and nursing women and found that even 2000 IU/day was inadequate, and that there were no adverse effects with 6000 IU/day.

I'd been vaping a few times a week for a month, but I stopped 2 weeks ago once I started applying for fear of drug tests. I just came into some cash and I really want to buy a Launch Box and a big pile of green. I certainly have the self-control not to , but I really have no idea if/when I'll hear anything back from these places. How should I play this? Should I just keep it clean until I know? If I do decide to go back to light/moderate usage (~8th/10 days), how long would it take me to rid my body of the evidence? The internship (which I really doubt I'd be drug tested for [does anyone have any experience getting tested for internships?]) wouldn't start until May. If tested, would I face my test upon hiring or upon starting? This internship is far more important to me than the potential retail job.

He will be getting an undergraduate degree in political science and I will have one in marketing (laugh if you want, but it's what I'm interested in). The topic of life after college came up and we got into an argument about what both of us will be doing. 

He wants to become a corporate lawyer; he's applied to several law schools and hears back from them soon. His LSAT scores are good and he has some experience with clubs and social groups, but no actual experience practicing law (in the form of mock trial competitions, etc). I told him that that the odds of him becoming a corporate lawyer are very small and that graduating from law school in no way sets you up for success in the legal arena. He has trouble with social awkwardness too and finds it difficult to speak up in front of people other than our close circle of friends. I told him that this will add to his troubles and he immediately got mad (understandably so).

From his point of view, he thinks that I'll be set up to fail by graduating with just a bachelor’s degree. I know the economy is absolute shit right now but I’ll be finishing up school with almost zero student loans, and I don’t think it makes a ton of sense for me to go back and accumulate debt with no guarantee of finding a job to pay that back. Plus, I’m interested in getting an MBA, and a good deal of programs I’d apply to require you have at least a year or two of experience before you apply. Granted, I don't have a TON of work experience, but I've worked hard over the past year or so to build connections with businesspeople from both home and up here at school. I know that at the very least I’ll be set up with an internship in May which may lead to a full-time job opportunity. 

What I’m asking from you is to paint a realistic picture for both of us. How difficult is it to become a lawyer (in any area of law) and is law school worth it? From my side, how bad is the job market out there? Do you think it makes sense to go back to grad school right now or should I try to gain some work experience (which I’d prefer doing over spending another year or two in school)? My roommate refuses to listen to my side of the story since he thinks I’m being biased, so I’d appreciate it if you could offer both of us some insight.

I've been lurking for a while now, and this is my first post. I don't know if I'll keep this account or not, but I guess it can't hurt.

I would like to submit the thesis: Sexism, although certainly bad, is only a special case of a more general problem. The general problem is: It seems that most of a person's success in life is determined by their birth lottery, not by their ability. This includes things like sex and race, but it also includes who your parents were, whether they were rich, whether they were smart, where they grew up and whether they remained married.

I'm a college student, computer science major at a top 20 school. I've been applying for programming internships, and I've just heard back: Rejected from everywhere. Most of my classmates have the same story: rejected either from most places, or from everywhere. The economy is bad, companies are laying people off, yadda yadda yadda. 

The exceptions are the three people I know whose parents are rich, and own their own businesses. They all got great internships, because their dads knew people in the company. I *know* (having worked with them) that I'm a better programmer than all three of them. But it didn't matter.

I might dismiss this as a fluke- data is not the plural of anecdote- until I started looking up the biographies of famous startup founders and computer scientists. Most of them have smart and wealthy parents. If you don't believe me, look up the parents of Bill Gates. And Paul Allen. And Larry Page. And Sergey Brin. And Pierre Omidyar. And Alan Turing. And Michael Dell. 

So, is there sexism and racism in our society? Of course. But I think we can attack them as part of a general, more comprehensive strategy of ""evaluating people based on performance and not based on birth"". After all, if you look at the fields where pure performance is the most important thing, like professional sports, you *do* see large numbers of minorities."

Not because of my skills (which have been commended by my bosses on many occasions), but due to the studio being a fairly small operation, and if they don't create a job for me, I don't have one. 

I've already made a niche for myself at the studio, and they will miss me dearly if/when I leave, so creating my own job has already been done, its just a matter of funds to hire me.

I need advice on where to go from the end of my 1 year internship. I've already sunken into debt, and looks like I'm going to keep going further. 

All job prospects look to be more unpaid internships, to prove myself to another studio, before they hire me on, and it seems like this will just be a waste of all the time and effort I've put into this studio so far. (Not to mention that I'm going to run out of money eventually.)

So, I'm at an impasse. And I'm just asking if there are any professionals out there that could sit down and talk to me, and offer me advice on what my next best possible step could be.

b5qyo,1,2010-02-23,Indecisive about where to go now in pursuing a career in IT?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/b5qyo/indecisive_about_where_to_go_now_in_pursuing_a/,"I'm planning to pursue a career in IT, specifically network administration. I'm nearing the end of my first degree program – a technical degree (Associate of Science) in network engineering – at a community college. This quarter I'm interning for the IT department at the college I attend. I have two more classes and then get the degree this coming June.

But now I'm stuck. I have no idea what I should do after that. I have a lot of options: going to a university to get a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (or something similar), trying to find a job working as a help desk tech and start to work my way up, taking certification exams... I just don't know which route to take.

The university option means four more years of school (since the degree I get in June will have been a technical/accelerated degree).

I don't know if I can get a job with the two-year degree I'll be getting. From what I've heard from many of my IT colleagues and friends, the degree, and even the certifications, don't mean anything. I've been told that the actual experience is what lands you the ideal job and enables you to advance.

On the other hand, I still hear that the two-year degree is almost equivalent to a high school diploma nowadays, and that I need to get the Bachelor Degree.

I don't have any certifications currently. From what I've experienced, the courses that prepare people for the exams, and even the exams themselves, is all bookwork and memorization. I don't learn much from reading a bunch of text and better absorb the information by applying it in some kind of scenario or simulation. Furthermore, I don't have the money to spend on the exams (that keep getting updating anyway).

Something else I've noticed is that being female seems to be to my disadvantage; I'm not taken as seriously as the men doing the same kind of work. Even for my internship, all my supervisors are male, and I know only one other female on the campus who works in IT – I thought the male-to-female ratio was decreasing?

Anyway, I just need some insight on what I should be doing next, because I feel stuck, and I don't want to waste time on school if it would be more to my benefit to find work, or vice-versa. Any advice?"

I'm interning, doing volunteer work for a radio station and a government press office branch, and the work I'm being given to do is a significant step downwards from the work I had to do to earn my Bachelor's Degree last May.  I'm paying my own rent out of savings to be here and I cannot understand why.

Culturally, the city I'm in feels like everybody hates each other.  I cannot feel a shred of empathy from anyone I pass by.  Transactions are completed without any consideration of customer care or satisfaction, and everybody seems to feel like they are owed something by everyone else.  Even the mothers attending to their children seem to be doing it without any real emotional involvement with them; dragging them to where they need to be and not engaging them in play or conversation.  The internship program I am on is full of people who are unashamed careerists who network almost instinctively, and have no interest in me.  I'm the only one who's from America but not from a coastal city.  I'm an outsider to the outsiders.  

I'm poor and almost friendless and I feel like all I really want to do is leave but I don't want to be a quitter.  I feel like there's no support for me in my life here and I don't have anyone to relax with.  Whenever I share how I feel, I feel like I get looked down on for not being happy here.  They tell me to toughen up and that people here are really very nice on the inside once you get to know them.  I think it's either self-delusion or a vicious lie.  And after someone knows how much I am suffering, they can never treat me normally again. I get the kid gloves, the pity, which I can't stand seeing in another person's eyes when they look at me.  In every attempt to bring someone a little closer to me, I push them farther away.

I feel like a weakling because I end up thinking about the luxuries that I miss (like my normal sized bed or my gaming, or first-world internet access) or the friends/family that I haven't seen in months.  I thought I was going to come here and do something good but I've been inconsequential, blowing my money to do it.  I feel like a total failure and I don't know what to do."

I've had counseling on the matter, but I guess not enough, because I continue to fret and panic and worry about things that will barely affect my future. 

I say this is regulated to school because AFAIK I didn't feel this way concerning an internship I had at a software development company last summer. I felt stressed (a now noticeably different emotion than anxiety), but I didn't worry about my work. 

If anyone else has encountered this, please let me know I'm not alone. And if anyone has recovered from something like this, I would very much like to know how it happened and how you recovered. I've considered counseling, therapy, hypnosis, self-help...but (maybe as a bi-product of the anxiety) it seems like nothing will help. Thanks everyone!

However, I can only do that if I still collect unemployment.  What are the rules concerning this?  I've read that in order to be eligible, I have to be fully available for any full-time offer.  However, if I work 20-30 hours a week, I will still have plenty of time to interview/job search.  Plus, given that it's unpaid, I'm sure my supervisors will be fully understanding if I have to change my schedule around to interview.  Also, it's arguable that the internship will give me skills I need to find a job faster.

The thing about working for the government is everything is inefficient--it takes one year to hire someone externally and there's so much beurocratic bullshit nothing gets done and everyone slacks off because they know they can't get fired.  Not to mention for EVERY SINGLE JOB there's literally thousands of people applying (an EA job for my manager was open for 48 hours and had over 4,500 applications).  The only reason I got the full-time job is because there's a big 'once you're in, you're in' mentality.  It's extremely hard to get a job but once you're inside you're allowed to apply for jobs internally which is much much easier then externally.  If I didn't take this job, I don't think I could get back in and I do think there's a lot of potential for advancement.. but no chance I could 'make it big'.

I was also also just offered an internship doing software development for a very big IT company.  Not google or MS, but if you started to name global IT companies you would say this one early.  The pay is good for an internship.. more then the gov't job but without benefits... and it's only for 16 months.    The thing is, as I said... I'm a FINANCE major.  I've done some freelance web development, tech support, taken some CS classes (my minor), and done some Database work for a relative who has a Financial Services company but I don't think I'm even at an intermediate level of any programming language.  It doesn't help that I'd be working with Java which I've never even touched before.  I'm not going to say I lied to get this job because there was a very thorough interview process but I did exaggerate a thing or two.  if I did take the internship, I'm scared to death that I'd be completely lost.  I have friends in SE/CS and they almost beat me when I told them I landed this job... I don't even think you could compare my technical knowledge-base with theirs... and those are the type of people I'd be working with.   On the other hand, it'd be an amazing opportunity to learn a lot and I'd have something solid to put on my resume.

Am I out of my mind for even considering taking the internship?  I'm a pretty ambitious and I know I'd be bored to death at the government job... even if I did end up getting transferred to a job in IT or Finance (still not sure where I want to work).   I'm young and I have absolutely no idea what I want.. which is why I'm asking for advice.  Sometimes I think I want to do a masters in finance or MBA and see if I could break into equity research or trading (which has always been a dream).  Other times I think about just having a relaxing and fairly stress-free and stable life.  Once you're in the government, your resume is radioactive in IT/Banking because they think the public sector is a joke... I'd most likely be in the public sector my entire life.

Thoughts?  Experiences?

tldr: i'm a young finance major who got offered two jobs, one full-time clerical job (with a lot of upward potential) with the govt that would provide a golden pension and stability my entire life.  The other an internship (16/mo) for a very well known IT company doing software development which is something I don't have much experience in."
