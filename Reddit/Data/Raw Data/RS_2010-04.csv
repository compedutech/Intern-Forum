That said, I have a very high opinion of this organization and the position is an ideal fit to complement my advertising management degree. Most ad agencies require 3-5 years of experience, even for entry-levelers. While I've sent resumes to them, my plan of action was to try and get some experience client-side to bolster my resume until I fit more into that 3-5 year window.

Would working on behalf of an NPO be a kind of lateral move, relative to (probably) marketing more consumer goods down the road? My best experiences so far have been a series of internships with a sports team in Indiana, albeit in their marketing department.

I'm nearing the end of my second year of my university career in computer science. I like it; the field is interesting, the pay is as I understand it great, but as I look for an internship online, I can't find any sort of internship that I can apply for because all I learned from my university was Java (I picked up C# on my own), and all these internships online want me to know PHP, Ajax, CSS, C++, SQL, etc...

How can I possibly compete? I didn't start programming until I went to college, and academic wise, I'm doing great (Deans honor list, Undergrad research). But as I look at the industry, I get a feeling of hopelessness like no other. I'm busy enough with academia as is; I can't possibly learn all those languages at the same time. Maybe computer science isn't for me. Maybe I should have gone down a more linear major, like Biology. 

I'm feeling pretty depressed and hopeless right now Reddit. Can anyone offer me some words of wisdom? I get the feeling the university doesn't prepare me for half the jobs out there. What's the point of getting an A in class anymore if I know I can't do anything with it later?"

I'm an intern who's been put in charge of finding a means of searching documents on our company's file server and possibly our intranet.  Does anyone have any suggestions for something like this?

There are roughly 800 employees at this company, and maybe 450-500 computers.  It's an all (or nearly all) windows environment.  The primary goal of this would be for searching Microsoft Office documents (doc/docx, xls/xlsx, ppt/pptx) and PDF files.  Maybe searching through our internal web servers as well.  Any solution would probably need to take into account the contents of the files, not just titles.  There are probably less than 100K files to search/index.  

I've found Microsoft's Search Server Express, which seems like a pretty good solution.  However, I thought I'd see what the more experienced users of reddit had for suggestions.  Let me know what you think!"

I worked as an unpaid intern for a non-profit radio station aka-Classical Radio Station closely connected to the University of Houston-as an Audio Engineering student.

I went twice a week for four hours and it was the greatest experience of my life. The most menial thing I had to do was cut/edit/paste audio recordings and file them in the network database. It was a sweet gig since I got to go, set up and record the symphonies and ballets in town for free and watch them from the catwalk or pits.

Anyway, the hardest thing I had to do was a mock edit with the head audio engineer behind me acting as the Symphonic conductor [Hans Graf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Graf) and going through the recording and having to splice out 16th-32th notes with others of the same note/timber and splice them in. He's yelling at me, telling me this note is wrong, that note is wrong, why the hell is it taking is so long. I was going mad with the pressure. After all the face-yelling and shit being thrown around he told me this is what Hans Graf does to him after every performance. He really put me out to the dogs so to speak. The internship ended with me being the head audio engineer for a live performance inside the radio station's studio being aired live with my name being given as Lead Audio Engineer over the air. I left with a burned copy of the session that I set up and engineered and a lifetime of experience in radio.

My classmate? He worked at a recording studio building bass cabinets. He never even got to touch the console.

I am moving to Dublin for four months in May (I'm a law student from Canada on an internship), and I am mid-apartment hunt at the moment.

I'll be working in the south side of the Dublin 1 area, and was hoping to live in Dublin 2, because I heard it was the nicest, and also very safe. My source for that information is a friend who lived in Ireland for seven years, and has friends still living in Dublin that he double-checked with. As a young female who has never been in the country before, safety is certainly a factor.

That said, I am finding a lot of rooms to rent in Dublin 1, and very few in Dublin 2. So my question now is, just how unsafe is Dublin 1 at night for a female foreigner? Is it worth an extra couple hundred euros a month to be in Dublin 2?

Also, general tips and advice about different locations/things to avoid/things to do is also welcome. If anyone happens to know someone who is renting a room for the summer in Dublin 2, that would be even cooler.

Hugs and thanks."

* HR Directors or people that do hiring? What's your take?

bmvrz,0,2010-04-05,"I have a unique opportunity this summer, but I also have opportunities that would further my education/career.",Caked,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/bmvrz/i_have_a_unique_opportunity_this_summer_but_i/,"Alright, first and foremost, I'm currently a Junior/Senior in the Mechanical Engineering field. I'm on my fourth year, and have been through several co-ops/internships without a semester off. Mind you, I'm not complaining, just setting up what situation I'm in for the rest of the story.

Essentially, the semester after high school, for my senior trip, I went to China. Now, a month before I left, I shattered my knee cap, so everything went wrong from the start. I arrived in China, and due to the nature of travel in China, walked close to 10 miles a day with a leg immobilizer on. Furthermore, before I left for China, I had apparently picked up Staph infection. I didn't realize until a few days into my trip, but essentially it forced me to come home early. But, I digress, this was not the reason for this post.

Onto the actual purpose of this post. The friend I initially went to China with has recently graduated, and has planned another trip for the summer to visit relatives. I have been working my ass off to make money for this trip, but just now, my parents have decided to 'sit down and talk with me' about my expenses. Currently, I have roughly $1500 sitting in the bank, and am continuing to work through this semester, while taking classes full-time, to try and make enough money to make this trip. My parents are worried that I'm going to be put in a bad situation with how much money I'd spend on the trip, and how little money I'd have when I got back.

While I understand their worry, my question is about the risk vs. the reward aspect. I currently have the opportunity to partake in an internship with an engineering firm nearby over the summer. While this would solve my money issues, it wouldn't necessarily be my 'preferred' option. Furthermore, I can continue to take classes and get closer to graduating which, while overall getting me closer to finishing school, would not be my 'preferred' course. My question is, am I deluded in thinking that I would be capable of going to China and have enough money to live off of when I get back, or should I take the internship/coop and just hope that I can return to China at a later time?

To summarize, I'm not generating very much income due to living expenses, school expenses, and the like. So, my parents are worried that I won't have enough money to live off of and all that when I return from China. 

Also, considering my money issues, would it be feasible to pick up a second job in between ending this semester and leaving for China to make enough money for the trip? Otherwise, would it be ok to take out 'student loans' to make the trip to China, or possibly put it on credit?

I know this is essentially not the ideal situation, but I always hear about how experiences are more valuable than materialistic items. And, being an engineer, I will most likely make more than enough money once I finish school to cover the credit/loans. Also, I've pretty much sold all the possessions I can feasibly get rid of.

Anyway, I would like everyone's opinion: Am I being hard-headed when considering my parent's opinion? Or, should I attempt to make the trip and just work my ass off to make the money?

Here is a link for a little more insight on what I went through over there and the link if anyone is interested. http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/az0q5/opportunity_to_go_to_china_but_in_need_of_another/

bn3zu,5,2010-04-06,Any Oregon state employees?,[deleted],Portland,https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/bn3zu/any_oregon_state_employees/,"Hey there. I know, I know. You don't want any more people moving to Portland, I'm sorry. I visited, and I'm hooked. Moving from the east coast as soon as I can secure a job. Don't worry, I won't bring a car or a bad attitude. My question is this: I'm about to graduate with two bachelor's: PoliSci and Mass Media Comm. I like the idea of government work. No, I am nobody's brother, cousin, neighbor, etc (sadly, that's how things work in much of New England.) I've got a decent gpa (3.5-3.6 depending on how this semester goes) from a small liberal arts college in Rhode Island, have decent work experience (retail mgmt/high-end appliance sales)/multiple completed internships (Dept of Environmental Mgmt, local NPR station, news dept of other popular station), and have visions of efficiently-run government dancing in my head. It is my dream to make a government agency that tax payers look forward to dealing with. Idealistic? Maybe. 

My question is this: From the little you know of me, what are my chances of getting something entry-level? I know the job market is tough.. but I'm trying to figure out *how* tough. And what does my competition look like, specifically in the Portland area? Are state jobs in high demand, or am I unusual for being very interested in one? Is Oregon's state government run on the efficient side of things, or is it large and lumbering? 

I suppose what I'm asking is for those individuals who will say things like, ""definitely don't do it!"" (and why) and ""do it!"" (and why), to come out of the woodwork. I did look through past pages, just to be sure no one asked this before. I know it's another ""moving to Portland, where's the work?"" post, but I am hoping it is distinguishable.

bna8l,10,2010-04-06,I'm pretty messed up Reddit,thewalkindude,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bna8l/im_pretty_messed_up_reddit/,"This post (http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/beu53/i_think_there_might_actually_be_something_wrong/) inspired me to do something about my life. Looking at it, my situation is similar, but different in many ways, although it could be like that in a few years.

Let me start out by saying that I know I'm depressed, and that I'm on medicine for it. The problem lies in the fact that I feel like I have to be perfect. Lets see if I can lay out what my philosophy is.

   1. You are either perfect or flawed
   2. If you are flawed, you have to feel bad about yourself
   3. You are not allowed to work to become perfect, because that is admitting you are flawed and then you have to feel bad about yourself.

That last point is probably the main reason that I'm avoiding professional help. Hell, posting this here is a big first step for me. I'm doing mediocre in college and feel bad about it, but I can't study, because I'd feel bad about that, and I don't know how to begin, anyways. People say that I'm smart and well-liked, but I just don't feel that's true. If it were true, I'd have a 4.0 GPA and be always out with friends, without having to work at it at all. I don't have a driver's license, and so am pretty much dependent on my parents to get me places. I don't like this either, and I want a license, but I'm afraid to practice, because practicing means you're flawed. People always tell me that you have to seem like you really want a job in order to get one, and to always follow up on the interview, but I feel like if I do that, then the employer will just think ""Oh, there's that annoying guy again, we're not going to hire him."" I'm graduating from college next year, and have never held a job that you could interview for. I feel like all my relationships are balanced on a razor's edge, and one stupid move will ruin them forever. These stupid moves include calling people, because they obviously don't want to do things with me. If they did, then they'd call me. That's part of the deal with getting a job too. They obviously don't want to hire me, because if they did, then they'd call me for an interview. I don't understand how not to take things like rejection from jobs personally. They might as well be saying "" We won't hire you because you're a terrible person who will never amount to anything"". So I get mad at them. I still hate the college that rejected me, up to the point where I can't even go past it, because I feel like it's mocking me, saying ""You could have had a perfect life if you had went here, but we decided you don't deserve it."" You either have to hate the one who did the rejecting or the one who was rejected, and I'd rather not hate myself anymore than needed. I got rejected for an internship today, and it's the end of the fucking world. They say ""Unfortunately we were unable to give you this position"" but that's absolute bullshit. All they're saying is ""We don't think you're good enough, and you should feel bad for even trying. We could give you the position if we wanted to, but you're not good enough for it."" This is an internship with an organization I know, and the people who got it are my friends, and I still want to strangle them, because they think they're better than me, and they have the right to look down on me.  If they wanted to give me the position, they would have. If they wanted me they would have created another position or given me one over the people who did get it. I don't want to hate the organization, but if I don't then they get away with treating me like shit. Overall, I feel like I'm the most pathetic person in my life, and if it weren't for the internet and people like Chris-chan, I'd probably think of myself as the most pathetic person in the world. You know, this is the first time I wrote out my big bundle of problems, and I hope you can give me some advice

It seems like the typical college kid who just doesn't work and has entitlement issues. That's not the case, at least I hope it's not. I'll find out soon enough.

I never wanted to go to ------- because it wasn't my dream school. I had no intention of going there, until I found out that going to the ---------- -- ----- would lead to an enormous pile of student loans and private loans. I calculated that it would take about 3-4 years at best to actually pay for them all. It was out of my grasp as my parents had bad credit and did not have the means to help me pay for college. They are financially stupid and ended up with credit card debt when I was a child. They improved, but made many mistakes afterwards. So, college savings were out of the question. I cried. Yes, I cried. It sounds pathetic. But, I waited all these painful (emotionally and mentally) years in high school to get screwed over by my lack of foresight.

Yes, I do admit that I'm grateful to live in a world power and not a destitute nation. However, to put the ""painful"" times in perspective, I was clinically depressed in sophomore year of high school and wanted to commit suicide. At the time the only thing stopping me from doing so was my fear of hell. I was a devout Christian at the time. I have been an atheist for some time and I will delve into it a bit later.

My parents told me take loans like everyone else and go to my dream school. But, I told them that I don't find it to be worthwhile in the end. After that harsh realization, I decided to go to ------- because of in-state tuition fees. I lost all the motivation I had for my senior high school classes because there was no point. My SAT scores and overall GPA were way ahead of the curve when comparing to admitted students at -------. Accordingly, I dropped most of my classes and was left with Psychology AP, Statistics AP, Health (requirement), English 4A, and a Study Hall because they did not want me to go out so early. I had late arrival and early dismissal. It was great compared to a full class schedule, but I hated most of my classes.

Admissions time came and I submitted my application after the regular preferred deadline. ------- had rolling admissions so I had a chance to get in even if it was late. I got admitted after a few months and they later sent a warning during the summer about my declining grades as a warning. They said that they made an exception. I think they just let me in because of my scores that were way above the upper percentile of students attending  -------. After all, my declining grades didn't make my GPA that low. The essay was the crappy generic type anyways.

So, after admittance, I was so reluctant to go through with it that I told my parents that I'd like to go to ------- during the spring semester. After all, I could get more financial aid if I sent it during the priority deadline and more aid from the school if I sent the application sooner as well. But, they weren't persuaded and my mother told me that I have to get out of the house. Hahahaha... I was not the prospective student that she predicted when I was in freshman year. She gave up on me years ago.

All of these were life lessons, yet they were mistakes made by my lack of planning. At the same time, I did not learn much from my college classes. My two philosophy courses taught me the proper structure of philosophical arguments yet failed to enlighten me upon new concepts that would lead me nearer to the objective truth. I had to learn about St. Thomas Aquinas which I learned by my independent research during my junior year of high school that bordered upon graduate school research. After all, I did buy the rare Wistar conference book, *The Mathematical Challenges to the Neo-Darwinian Interpretation of Evolution*, C.S. Lewis's *Mere Christianity*, and Richard Dawkins's *The God Delusion*. Both *The God Delusion* and *The Mathematical Challenges to the Neo-Darwinian Interpretation of Evolution* provided cogent points with C.S. Lewis providing absolutely subjective and weak arguments. I even researched about the other religions from Daoism and Vodun (Caribbean religion) to Doomsday cults and New Age movements which were espoused by Oprah years ago.

I did all this by myself. I did not need a bloody graduate course nor a repeat of everything I learned for my philosophy 101 course. I was dissatisfied already. The class finally moved on past these themes to newer ones like existential arguments, but they weren't based on science at all. Many famous philosophers did not know about current biology, psychology, physics, and other scientific fields that are essential to seeking the objective truth. They did not have access to it, so their arguments are flawed in that aspect. Studying the classic philosophers feels quite antiquated sometimes. It disgusts me. The blind acceptance of it all.

I tried to have intellectual discussions. But, I merely got irrational ramblings of local hispanic students that got in through affirmative action that argued that god must be real because the bible tells you so. I'm not kidding. I even have screenshots of these posts. It wasn't all that bad. I had some interesting discussions with a select few. But, I wanted more. I did not want the 3% who could think for themselves and remain rational. I wanted the 90%. I did not even have the 50%. I expected too much and it saddened me considerably at the time.

Yes, this was only in my intro courses for philosophy that had hundreds of students. I'm sure some were just too shy or apathetic, but I don't want to talk with apathetic people anyways. I also expected less shy people in college as well because there are more people which means there is a greater possibility of finding people like you. That generally leads to greater confidence outside of that social tribe.

The trend continued as I found out that I could learn the same material by myself through the assigned books instead of going to lectures with professors talking too slowly for my tastes. The braindead students didn't help either.

Now, I'm at the precipice of my stress. The place I hated for its greediness-- my hometown is actually welcoming compared to this city of --- ---------. I'm left with demotivation and disgust. Demotivation stems from the lack of mental stimulation from college for my maturing brain that is growing ever more rational. Disgust at the illegal immigrants who live here that get children for social security and spend all their money on wasteful things, such as cable TV, instead of planning for their children. The children suffer and most turn into their parents. The endless cycle of disgusting drudgery.

I just feel like it's not worth it at all. I had plans for my four years of college to get ready for an internship at a video game company. I've always wanted to work for the games industry since I was 13. I planned out potential mods and the portfolio. I would love more time for that instead of my boring classes, but then I would need to get employed at a dead-end job. My classes and financial aid provide me the time slots necessary for me to finish my portfolio in time. However, this boredom. This utter disappointment has left me with regret. I regret not going to my dream school where I would have chosen dorms. I regret not going to the spring semester. I regret not planning ahead. I regret it all.

What am I to do? I hate this place so much that I'm seriously considering moving to Alaska to temporarily join the Inuits. That sounds like a lot more fun and enticing than continuing my second year. I'm even considering the possibility of staying with some nomads in the desert regions. I just want out. I'm sick and tired of this place, this city, this absolute shameful place full of crack dealers, chain smokers that leech on social security, alcoholics who don't give a shit, hobos that stop cars in the road for their arrogant means, and the general student body at my college. What do I do? Do I soldier on? Do I take a break? I can't ask the psychological counselor here. They're here for freshman retention and not for my goals. What do I do? Experience is truly much more valuable than I thought given my mistakes I've made. I need some input. I need something from the objectively above-average (in terms of intelligence) community of Reddit. I just need something."

My boyfriend will be graduating this May.  We have both decided to take a year off of school (Sept. 2010 - Sept. 2011ish) to travel before returning for our professional degrees. We are slowly beginning to make arrangements for our adventure but would *love* any other input.  

We have narrowed our destination to the South Pacific and would ultimately like to visit (and stay in, if we enjoy the area) several places.  Our ultimate goal is to not dig too deep in the red so we would be looking at working while we are there - where ever 'there' is.

We have ruled out any 'Teach English' program as we plan to travel instead of staying grounded in one location.  One of the options we have been exploring extensively is enrolling in a Dive Master Internship in SE Asia - somewhere - and ultimately working as a Dive Master - somewhere.  We have also considered the Harvest Trail in New Zealand. 

Our schedules are open and the options endless.  If anyone has any comments or suggestions, they would be greatly appreciated! 

Thanks!"

",ConeOfIce,programming,https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/bns3z/can_anyone_think_of_a_reason_for_this_bizarre/,"Let me start off with that I am not a C programmer but am doing an internship designing hardware in VHDL. 

Whenever we design a piece of hardware we need to make a comparison to a C-model. In one section of the design, there is a divider which is supposed to divide and round according to standard rules (0.5-1 -&gt; 1, 0-0.4999 -&gt;0). 

For some reason the code inside the c-model did


    int round( int a, int b)
    {
       y = abs(a)/b;
       if( a &amp;&amp; b&gt;&gt;1 ){
           y++;
       }

       return y;
    }

It then went to a section that would make it positive or negative when necessary after the fact. 

With a quick glance you can see this does not work, 5/3 = 2 but so does 8/3. 

We do know how to fix this, but what I would like to know, can anyone think of a use for the code that is there, because I cannot?

bouwz,11,2010-04-09,"Hey Reddit, I need your help and support. I'm obsessed with my gay boss, and it's causing me mental problems.",weirdohio,lgbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/bouwz/hey_reddit_i_need_your_help_and_support_im/,"Hey Reddit, I need your help and support. I'm obsessed with my gay boss, and it's causing me mental problems.

Let me start out by saying I used to be a perfectly happy, sane, normal human being. Everything was great. I loved life. I'm a 20yr old College student, having an excellent time. Oh and I'm a straight, heterosexual guy (or at least I thought - I had never even become slightly aroused by any of the male form. Period.)

Then ~6 months ago I met a lovely guy; a ~30yr old gay man with a an apparently attraction to guys younger than himself. I suspect it was this attraction of his that drew us together, though he didn't try to rape me, so I was fine with it. We met through a mutual friend.

Things were great. He (at least was) a really awesome, loving, caring guy. I mean, we were really good friends, spending most waking moments talking to each other on msn; I dare say, for a short period, the best friend I ever had. Many a weekend I would make the 3-hour drive to visit him, we would eat out at a lovely restaurant, get drunk, cuddle up in bed and try the occasional handjob/BJ (hell I even enjoyed it a little). I know I'm not a gay guy - but he could easily make my dick hard given the chance. Looking back, I think he considered this just a bit of playful fun, but to me it was more than that. No-one had been this special to me before. Though it may not have been, this was certainly the closest I'd come to love.

He had also managed to snag me a (highly useful &amp; interesting) internship at his company. I was really excited; I would get to move into his neighborhood for the summer, do interesting work in the day, and hang out &amp; enjoy ourselves together in the morning. It sounded awesome.

However after maybe January this year he started to lose interest in me. Subtle signs at first; not being quite as talkative or flirty on MSN, his SMS messages now without a once-obligatory 'X' at the end, etc. Since January, 100% of my attempts to meet up and hang out together have been declined. He will usually make up a bad excuse such as he's 'busy' or 'tired'; and when I suggest he chooses another date, he dodges the question.

This was when I started to go a little mad. I could not understand why he would not want to see we; we had such fun! So when he turned me down (on numerous occasions), I would become really upset - and made this clear to him. This would always decend into argument.

In one of the more recent incidents, I kept pushing him and complaining that he wouldn't see me. He then came out with 'you act like i'm your boyfriend or something, it is weird'. And I think he was right. I was acting like he was my boyfriend, expecting to see him. That's what it'd become, to me.

So I started my internship two weeks ago. I hate it. By far the worst two weeks of my life. All I can think about is him, I am in tears crying every night and losing lots of sleep. He is merely my boss now (and my direct boss at that). He has not been very supportive at work; if anything mean to me. We do not speak on non-work-related matters. When I moved cities on the Saturday (before starting work on the Monday), he would not even welcome me by turning down my request to share a beer; instead he chose to stay at home and watch tv. He doesn't give a shit about me any more. But I do about him. I really do.

What can I do? The love-part of my brain wants him back in my life, but the math-part of my brain says it will not happen. If I am to let him go completely and accept the status quo, how can I do it?

*Any* words of advice would be really appreciated. I can't talk to any friends about this, I feel like I have no-one to turn to. Please help me before I really get even worse.

My God, it is hard work. I chaperoned my school's prom on Saturday, so I worked all that night on top of working a 50 hour week. Also, my students are writing papers, so I set aside 4 hours on my Sunday afternoon to go to the library and give them some guidance. Then I sat with a student for 45 minutes after the study session was over so he wouldn't have to wait alone for his ride.

I definitely think teaching is my calling. I love and care deeply about my students, and from what I can gather they like and respect me. I just worry that I am putting in more time than I'm supposed to at this point. I think I am the only intern in my program who's working this hard, and I am exhausted. I wonder if my efforts are really appreciated by my students, or if I'm just wearing myself out for no reason. By the time I get home every night during the week, I can barely keep myself from passing out completely, and it's tough to wake myself up in the morning.

I really do want my students to do well, and I definitely don't want to slack off. Lazy teachers, I think, are the bane of the education system. Also, I love interacting with my students and learning more about them.

Could you guys give me some kind words to keep me going...maybe talk about a teacher who has had a really big impact in your life? I know I have chosen a demanding and difficult career, but I don't want to get burnt out. I genuinely want to do my best and have a positive impact on others.

What I wanted to know is if there is anyone out there who already works with facial reconstruction and how I should go along trying to attain this goal. 

I hope to eventually get a Masters and possibly a doctorates at UT where the Body Farms are located. But I need a very good background to get into that. Any advice?"
bqfwa,6,2010-04-13,I need advice for how to work in a large corporation,Sloloem,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/bqfwa/i_need_advice_for_how_to_work_in_a_large/,"I graduated college in May 2009 with a degree in Information Technology, and was immediately offered a job doing software engineering for a large financial firm in Boston, Mass.  I've worked here since July and already the seer amount of bullshit bureaucracy I've been exposed due to the size of the corporation has almost reduced me to tears.  The layers within each silo, and the silos, and the retarded not-my-job mentality that's here is seriously impeding my ability to perform my work.  And for whatever reason I still deeply want to do my work.

Requests for access are done slowly, incorrectly, or never at all.  Problems are closed simply because they're being filed with the wrong group and they don't want to tell me who should take care of it.  Questions asked to people who are supposed to be my co-workers (though many of them are contractors and I'm full time) are answered as if I'm prying into closely guarded secrets, or threatening their jobs, or am just a complete fool.

And I have to ask people where to find things, because finding information here is also a full time job that can take several hours if not days.

And through all of it I have no idea where to go for help, because it's never anyone's job.  I'm frustrated at how difficult even simple tasks are here, and I have no idea who I can talk to about it because I have this overwhelming impression that the corporation simply just doesn't care.

The other companies I worked on full-time internships were small enough that I knew if I hit a brick wall I could eventually 6 Degrees of Separation my way to someone who'd have an idea how I could proceed...some other people I just haven't talked to.  But here I don't even know how to find that out, and the feeling of utter helplessness is depressing beyond belief.

I'm looking for any advice that reddit might have for how to work within a corporation this large and not feel so helpless when I need to depend on another person or group.  Or how to deal with it besides ""get jaded and stop doing work, point fingers when asked why work is not being done.""

tl;dr
Corporate America sucks, how do I deal with the despair of being a cog."

He says he'll support me no matter what I decide, and I do trust him while I'm away (we've done long-distance for four weeks in the past, this will be eight), but I'd love some ideas for keeping the relationship from stagnating despite the temporary lack of physical contact.

We always complain about it
but Di* effin sucks
it's the scummy asshole of the net
FUCK DIGG

**Sex:** Male

**Age:** 22

**Height: **Between 5'12 and 6'0

**Weight:** 254ish (I hover between 250-256 during the week)

**Measurements: **40"" pants

**Why, why, why?! **I've always been the pudgy kid, but things got out of control this past summer. I went from working 20-30 hours a week in a hardware store to pulling 60 hours a week behind a desk at two internships: 75% of my meals were fastfood. I went from 200ish to 250ish.

**The excuses:** I had a pretty busy fall (last semester of school, several on campus jobs and crap) then got a job shortly after graduating, then moved out. 

**The motivation:** I finally got settled in the last week and stepped on a scale for the first time in a long time and it was too much for my tastes. It's starting to get warm here, and I don't feel comfortable in my clothes (wearing a hoodie when it's 80 out? *COME ON*)

**Current method: **I've been going to the local gym on and off since January but they recently upped their night hours from 9pm to 10 (I don't get home until 830) so daily trips are now a necessity. I mostly do random strength training followed by elliptical/cycling, and some experimenting with HIIT. I've also started shooting hoops for an hour or two a day when I have time after work; my buddies were talking about starting a summer league and I want to be able to keep up.

**Planned additions to method:** Pretty sure I can lose a few pounds off the bat by cutting out fast food (pretty normal consumption) and pop (mostly only with fast food, but I'll drink the occasional coke). But why stop there? 

Daily situps/pushups in the morning. I like the way my body feels after a workout, and doing this in the morning seems to get my day off right. Beyond that though, I'm mostly at a loss. I'm still not positive what I should be doing in the gym other than 'things that feel good after I do them'.

**Today I did: **45 minutes in the gym before work. Random strength (bicep curls, leg press, upper arms) followed by 12 minutes of elliptical.

**Goal:** For starters, get my ass back in those 36"" pants I have in the closet. That will entail getting back down to the 200 range, but I'm not stopping there. Obviously I'd like to lose it as fast as possible, but I'm not going to rush."

They were pretty vague on the whole thing, saying that it is a sales position. After her spiel, someone yelled ""Go to southwesterncompanytruth.com to read what actually happens!"" So, obviously, the entire physics lecture was spent on that website, reading testimonials that make ""interning"" with them sound like a hellhole. Is there anybody who has/does work there who can confirm or deny these claims?

For those who might not know, ""Each summer, around 3,000 students from over 350 colleges and universities worldwide spend their summer
running their own business selling educational products to families. The students relocate to another state and become part of the community, living with a host family and several other students from the same school or geographical location."" (Taken from the Fact Sheet made by the company)

From the general readings, you're selling books door to door. You pay for all expenses incurred: housing, food, transportation, etc.

I have only heard bad things about this experience. When confronted, the person who pitched the option did not, could not?, say anything to defend herself. If this company is as bad as these testimonies claim, I don't want them soliciting students from my campus."

I have an AS in IT (Engineering School), a certificate in applied CS, and plenty of experience.

EDIT(0): I know I *should* get my degree (2 more semesters for a BA in Philosophy) but I honestly don't think I can take another year living at home depending on my parents, which would essentially mean I'd have to start looking for a full-time job in order to support myself.  It's hard to explain, but I'm 26 years old with a [marketable skill-set](http://bit.ly/r3sum3) and busy course work that doesn't pertain to what I will be doing in the market + lack of money + living at home is psychologically draining. I desperately need a change of environment and the cost of this is getting out of school to get a job; this doesn't mean I'm giving up on getting a degree.

I can remember putting a gun to my head when I was in the 7th grade. I told myself that there is so much out there I can't do this yet. I kept telling myself you need to have sex. You need to love, live, and accomplish things.

If you saw me you'd think that guy has everything going for him (women, grades, money, looks), but inside I'm as poor as an Ethiopian baby. As I'm writing this I can't stop crying, a girl is coming over to spend the night in a half hour and shes probably gonna notice my eyes fuck. I have tons of friends, but I feel like none of them know me. They know me the super social intelligent guy, but they don't know me. I feel I've done a great job of hiding it and training myself into thinking all display of emotion (other than happiness) is weak. I feel like I've been depressed my entire life and in denial the whole time. In a way my intelligence is my downfall, I realized early on that being realistic about the world is negative as fuck because the world is fucked.

When I first started college I was pretty worried about failing out, which is probably why I succeeded. During my sophomore year I came pretty close to ending it, but told myself you have to finish what you start. The hardest thing for me has been living next to a 10 story parking garage, honestly I can't tell you how many times I've stood up there toes over the edge. Everyday I walk past it and it's the only thing I think about despite how much I try to immerse myself in studying or women or hobbies.

I'm a month away from graduation now. I've had plenty of internships, but I can't seem to find anyone to hire me. My plan right now is to go home for two weeks maximum. If I can't find anything by then I'm just going to leave, I can't stay there it's like hell in paradise. I feel, even with a great degree from a top 5 engineering school in the country, I still have no direction. I realized during my junior year I didn't want be an engineer anymore, but I knew I wanted that feeling of accomplishment. Some would say go to grad school, I can't handle anymore school.

I've done my fair share of drugs, experimenting when I can, trying to experience as much of life as possible and really that is all we have (our experiences). Right now I have pretty much zero serotonin in my system. I know my current manic depressive state is most likely caused by this and I'd love to blame it on this which I could easily rationalize any thoughts of wanting to die away, but I know I felt this way even before I ever started. I don't know why I'm fucking writing this.

If I can't find something to do by June, I'm going to hike the pacific crest trail. Part of me thinks this will be great for my psyche, my health, pretty much everything, but I know as I've been backpacking several times on my own that it is bitter sweet. When you're by yourself no one for miles and you're looking over a thousand foot cliff thinking what the fuck does it matter. At least in this place the animals will eat me and I won't get fucking embalmed. As much as I want to go, I feel like I won't make it out. Dieing alone in the middle of the woods has always seemed to me as the most peaceful way to go.

I'm not asking for help or to be talked out of anything. I just want someone to understand how I feel."

While I won't cite stories I worked on (I'm not going to lose my job), I'd love to answer questions.

As a starting point, I'd like to say The Onion is a much less rough and hard place than ""This American Life"" made it out to be.

**EDIT:** I'm trying to find an old pay stub or some such thing to confirm my identity with the mods. Sorry about the delay. What is truth anyway?

**EDIT 2:** To answer the most common questions here:

I have a degree in Journalism and English. 

I wrote for a number of websites before joining The Onion. I recommend everyone who wants to write for The Onion to do the same. Find websites that DO take open submissions (College Humor, Cracked, etc) and pitch articles. You'll build up a good portfolio that you can show off at a later date. ALWAYS save PDFs of your web work. You never know when a web site featuring your brilliant essay will disappear. Has happened to me a dozen times.

The Onion does not take unsolicited headlines. We have freelancers, but it's a thorough vetting process. It's really a know somebody / get noticed by somebody / intern process.

My favorite article of all time is ""Daddy Put In The Bye-Bye Box""

My favorite headline of all time is ""Man Who Likes To Move It Move It Still Searching For Perfect Song""

We're all very nice people. Most of us are very nerdy. There's a high glasses to no glasses ratio. A lot of people named Joe work here and they're all much smarter than me.

Our drug of choice is whiskey. 

Yes, we do employ women and we do employ black people. That's a weird question, but it's cropped up a few times.

I don't know the AV Staff very well. The comedy staff and the AV staff are in different states. We're all friends, but in that second-cousin sort of way. You know faces, a few names. However, they're all very cool folks who could easily beat us in Trivial Pursuit.

**EDIT 3:** And most of my inspiration comes from the real news. Of course, real life influences my ideas. I've literally transcribed things I've heard at restaurants and turned them into verbatim Opinion articles.

**EDIT 4:** There is no topic we'll stay away from as a rule. However, there are topics we're tired of and try not to cover too often. Robots, Ninjas, Vampires, Unicorns, Time Travel - all that stuff has sort of been done. If it's REALLY funny, we'll cover it again. But more often than not, we've exhausted the immediate topics. 

So there's nothing ""too dark"" for us to do, but there are topics that are simply stale.

I had a job lined up when I graduated but it was rescinded about this time last year.

I kept submitting applications and I got a lot of interviews from fairly prestigious places and gov't jobs (13 total so far), but I never got anything other than feeling trolled. Maybe I don't interview well? Or they don't think I would make a good underling? Regardless, no job.

Not gonna lie, I'm jealous of my 5 accounting major friends who secured employment who each bragged about not studying a lot (or right before an exam), had weak gpas and chronically missed classes. Congrats to them and they're good guys, but I'm jealous.

* This is done in business clothes.

When our food arrived, one of the guys started praying. 

Now in my experience, I know there are a lot of theist engineering and science majors. What I didn't expect was that the three other guys would be so adamant about religion.  Once the one guy started praying, the others started chiming in about how often they pray before eating or in general, and why we should be thankful, etc.  Since I didn't say anything yet, one guy turned to me and asked ""So what about you?""  

This was my shining moment. This was also the first time I publicly confirmed my atheism.  I told them I was atheist, and the next two hours was me trying defending my position against people who wouldn't shut up long enough to hear my defense. To be fair, the Eastern European guy was more laid back about the topic, and generally sided with me on a few issues (such as ""Nobody really knows anyway""). 

I'm not a very good speaker (hence the engineering major), but I think I defended myself pretty well. I've had lots of philosophy of science and religion classes, and have read a lot of theist and atheist material (having been Catholic before).  The Prayer was a hardcore Catholic, and really knew his stuff.  It's funny that he actually helped me with certain points against the Protestant, who obviously wasn't very well read in religion (but was still very devout).  

* So I guess I just want people's thoughts about **why engineers, of all science fields, seem to have the most theists.**  One relevant point the Protestant brought up was that because we obviously don't know everything about how the Universe works, or that because theory doesn't work practically, that there must be a greater power that created such complex organisms.  But he obviously didn't know much about evolution, which is what I tried to explain before the topic quickly changed.

As an aside:  The Protestant was supposed to help me get an internship with Eaton Corp where he currently works as an Eng. Technician.  I don't know how this conversation will impact his motivation to get me in there, so I'm wondering if there are any Reddit Engineers in the Detroit Area who is looking for a rational, logical M.E. Junior (thermo/fluids focus) who is also interested in electronics.  :)

**[Update 4/21/10, 8pm EDT]**

Thanks everyone for your insights.  Some of you criticized my labeling of engineering as a ""science field"", and I agree that it's not really a ""field"", but an application of a ""pure"" science. But I don't think it makes it any less important or less scientific.  I wouldn't say an engineer is less ""scientific"" than someone with a BS in physics or chemistry.  To do real scientific work (eg research) one must have at least a MS, and generally a PhD. At that level, most engineers are doing applied research, and are still adding to scientific knowledge (especially in fields like materials and fluids, where there are few perfectly applicable/solvable equations).  It's different, but I don't think it's less difficult or less scientific.

I've seen similar theist/atheist ratios in physics (and its professors; I've had a physics prof with a MS who is a creationist), so I agree with the commenters who say theists tend to go into sciences that don't challenge their beliefs.  I find it strange that people can separate the sciences so much from their studies.  I love all sciences, I used to read geology and paleontology books for fun since I could read (mostly for the pictures, but I ended up learning a lot).  I also used to memorize scientific names of animals (what a nerd), but I digress...

To think ""I trust the research and scientists in my field, but not those darned biologists"" is just absurd.  To know and use the scientific method, but restrict its use to certain spheres of one's life is hypocritical. "

btvzp,97,2010-04-20,Stories I have heard at sea.,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/btvzp/stories_i_have_heard_at_sea/,"Hey gang,

In my previous post about a 'demon-possessed house and subsequent exorcism' I lived in as a kid, I alluded to the fact that I used to tell this story out at sea when I was bored on watch. As background, I am a warfare officer in the Australian Navy and I drive warships. The easiest way to describe my job is the person who pilots the ship for 4 hour shifts, and when the Captain walks onto the bridge, he often takes control of the ship off me, if he requests it. As such, I often have a team of about 3-4 on the bridge at any one time consisting of a helmsman (who physically drives and controls the engines on my behalf), a more senior 'quarter master' (QM...whose job is to make sure the admin of the bridge happens while i am busy navigating/talking to the operations room) and another junior warfare officer under training to learn my job, if we have a few of them onboard. 'Watches' are 4 hours long, with the usual rotation being 4 hours on, 8 hours off. As such, one of the most bemoaned watch rosters is being the person who gets the afternoon (12-4pm)-graveyard shift (Midnight-4am), also known in Navy slang as the 'Arvo and Guts Watch'. This watch is hated as it gives you the most broken sleep, as everyone onboard normally has to be up and about at 6:45am to start the day. I digress. 

What this means, is that if you are unlucky enough to get the midnight-4am watch, you need to stay awake. Being up on the bridge of a warship, you need to have everything dark so as to not ruin your night vision out the windows and into the sea beyond. 80% of the ship is asleep, and I personally enjoy the quiet 'downtime'. Weird conversations happen, and more often than not, people start talking about weird things that have happened to them. I will never forget the one night I was on a patrol boat in the middle of the Arafura Sea in northern Australia, and the story two of the sailors told me.

A patrol boat is smaller then normal warships, so I only had a helmsman on watch with me. We were hundreds of miles in the middle of the ocean, and were just having a coffee and a laugh while we sat in the dimly red-lit dark of the bridge, the muffled thrum of the ship's engines, the sound of our bow cutting through the dark water and the muted static of our VHF radio scanning empty channels being the only sounds. Every now and then the wind would pick up and you'd hear the howl before it deposited a thin spray of salt water into our bridge windows. Hopefully I have set the scene and made you feel what it is like to be in the middle of nowhere late at night.

One of the senior engineers had wandered up to the bridge for a coffee and he was sitting on the stairs that led up to the upper deck from the bridge, and I had just finished telling my story about our old house to the sailor on the helm, who was a bit freaked out! The helmsman then told me his story....and needless to say, it in turn freaked me out. And I generally like a good 'unexplained story'. His story really re-enforced my wariness of ouija boards/seances, as this was the prime factor behind the weirdness of the afore-mentioned house I lived in as a toddler. His story is as follows....

THE HOSPITAL SEANCE

To begin with, the sailor told me how before joining the Navy, he used to work as a wardsman at the Royal Brisbane Hospital in early 2001. He said it was a great place to work, with other young wardsmen for company, and as he put it 'heaps of hot young nurses.' A few of the girls were into seances and a few of them were living on the hospital grounds in accommodation while they did their internships. One of the girls suggested that one night they go into an abandoned ward and conduct a seance, because as anyone who works in a long-established hospital will tell you, they are normally hotbeds of weird activity. (My mother is a 30 year midwife and she has some things she said she can't explain...like mothers reporting a 'smiling, kindly old matron with a weird hat who came and checked on me in the middle of the night and patted my baby to sleep'...despite there only being 2 young nurses on that shift all night, but I again digress). Thinking it sounded like fun, he said yes, and a few nights later after work, a few of them (plus a few nurses he hadn't met before) all went up to the disused ward and set up the ouija board.

He said they started the seance and the glass started to move as they had 'apparently' contacted a spirit. He scoffed and thought it was a joke, as the glass was moving randomly with everyone putting a finger on it. Of course he thought that the others were moving the glass. He said someone was given a pen and a paper and told to scribe anything that happened. Little did he know that their innocent night was about to get really weird...

Apparently someone asked this spirit, 'What is your name?' The glass moved and spelled out 'N-I-G-E-L.' They all laughed and someone else asked, 'Are you Good or Evil?' (I have goosebumps as I type this) and the glass moved over to 'EVIL.' Still scoffing, the sailor said some other questions were asked, but they got back a lot of jibberish. Suddenly, about 2 mins later he said the glass started going absolutely nuts, and some people started goetting uneasy. Despite this, it seemed to be following a pattern so someone told the guy scribing to write down what the glass was moving to. He got something like the following, and slowly it started making words. Apparently it read, 'I-L-L-B-A-B-Y-C-A-S-S-I-K-I-L-L-B-A-B-Y-C-A.....'
After a few more repetitions the guy scribing went, 
'Kill baby Cassi.....oh, Cassi kill baby? What the hell does that mean??' (I joke you not here when I tell you this, the sailor telling me the story said this screwed/disturbed him for quite a while) One of the girls in the circle turned pale, held her hand to her mouth and ran from the room sobbing hysterically, like a wailing cry of utter terror. He said one of the guys went 'Haha what's up with her?'. 

One of the other nurses went outside to console her, and the story came back as such. The girl who ran outside confessed to the other girl that she had had a secret abortion 3 weeks prior after finding out she was pregnant. She told NO ONE about the abortion, not her parents, not even her own boyfriend. Her name? You guessed it, was Cassie. That pretty much wrapped up the night, and horrified, the rest of them finished the seance and swore never to do it again. 

After he finished telling me this, I was pretty freaked out, but the other older sailor (he was in his 40s) just sat there and said nothing, and drank his coffee. Trying to lighten the mood, I said 'that was a godo story, but what about you Chief (his rank), surely you have a good one you have heard?' I noticed he was looking really uncomfortable so being a great people manager/officer (lol), I decided to go for the jugular and shame him into telling it. 'C'mon chief, tell us!', I jibed. I probably should have left it there, but he decided to tell us. I don't know if it was true or not, but in hindsight, judging how reluctant he was to tell the two of us, and how freaked out he looked when he told us, it's inclined to make me think. I've included it below as I think this pot might run out of room..."

I'm trying to find a internship in the mechanical engineering field, though I'm open for other related fields of engineering.  I'm a dedicated, problem solving, innovative person, and I have participated in or led several projects, both inside and outside of school, some include:

- Led acoustical and structural design of a recording studio - 2008
- Designing an ROV for an organization in Chicago - present
- Design of a Class 7x SCORE truck to compete in the BAJA 1000 - 2009


If this helps at all I'm also a Master scuba diver, I've got alot of experience with AutoCad, and I'll also work for almost nothing.
I'd really just like to get some experience under my belt this summer, any help in this endeavor would be greatly appreciated.

bvblh,16,2010-04-23,Am I doomed to be a housewife if this persists?,notformethanks,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bvblh/am_i_doomed_to_be_a_housewife_if_this_persists/,"**TL;DR:  My boyfriend doesn't clean anything and has a million excuses.  I am not clean myself and I hate cleaning up after both of us.  How do I make him clean?**

My boyfriend and I moved in together two years ago, and we've been living in relative squalor ever since.

Here is the backstory:  I'm not a very clean person anyway.  When I was a teenager, my carpet was knee-deep underneath one huge pile of discarded clothes.  My desk has never been clean.  I even think better (I'm sure of it) with a small amount of clutter.

My boyfriend is the same way.  When we first moved in together, I tried to make sure that we wouldn't fall into our regular habits.  However, it soon became me cleaning everything.  Well, as I said, I am not a very clean person and I heavily resented being the maid.  I am a full-time college student, and I also work part-time and have an internship with a local non-profit organization.  He just goes to school.  He was uninterested in any sort of negotiation on the cleaning.  It was either split 50/50 or he didn't want any part of it--by which I mean, he wouldn't clean.  When I pointed out that I was busier, he said that I was insulting his achievements.

Well fine.  But he never actually lifted a finger to do his 50% anyway.  At a certain point, I decided  that ""50/50 or nothing"" could be my prerogative as well, so I simply stopped cleaning.  

Reddit, I lived at least eight months in the most filthy conditions you can imagine.  Most days the apartment smelled like rotting food, which even began to seem pleasant to me toward the end.  Dishes were everywhere; we didn't do them until we ran out of random things to be used as forks and plates.  Trash was everywhere.  Every article of clothing I owned was dirty (and on the floor).  We used the same towels and sheets for most of this time period.  Ultimately I could not live the way we were living anymore.  It took me several weeks to clean the house from top to bottom.  Now I routinely clean (I still have the same busy schedule--even busier) and he helps me if he's around.  

**Problems:**

* *If he's around*.  This is a key plot point.  If my boyfriend does not witness me cleaning, he somehow manages to pretend as though it never happened.  Say that I spent the whole day cleaning the apartment.  He gets home and suggests that we take the trash out.  I ask if he will do it.  He gets angry because I'm not doing anything.

* He half-asses everything.  Dusting, to him, means that he dusts the front and top of an object.  Sweeping crumbs means that he doesn't have to move the toaster (underneath which is the crumbiest part).  He puts dishes in the dishwasher regardless of whether they are caked with dried old food.  If I say anything--anything at all--about this, he tells me that I am too fastidious, a control freak, and bossy. 

I am starting to get really nervous about this.  I am a very career-oriented person and I have absolutely no intentions of being someone's housewife.  I don't even want to stay home with a baby if it means that I have to be in charge of the cleaning.  I don't know how to say this any clearer: I hate cleaning from the depths of my soul.  I am not even a clean person; I am a complete and utter slob.  Being a woman doesn't make me any more inclined to do the cleaning, and I'm not going to do it.  

I've been thinking about my own parents.  My dad is a slob and my mom is too--she just got stuck taking care of my dad.  Their relationship has been full of resentment.  I've also been thinking about my dreams of a gender-equal household in the future.  I keep imagining having a baby and not being able to trust my half-assing boyfriend--or having to take care of the baby 24/7 because someone's got to do it and *he's* not motivated enough so *he* doesn't want to.  I mean, he can't even dust behind the television because he doesn't want to move his arm an extra few inches.

Other relevant details:  I am going to be making a shit ton more money than he is after college.   Also, he is very fond of holding our eight-month slob-fest against me and saying things like, ""Well you didn't clean anything for several months!"" even though he didn't either.

Tips to get my boyfriend to clean?  Stories from people who married someone like this?  Did it get better or worse?  Is this still a danger sign if everything else is going well?  

The last thing I want to mention is that I DON'T WANT TO KEEP THE MENTAL LIST.  In my head lives a list of things that need to be cleaned.  The sheets need to be changed within a few days, the laundry needs to be done, the dining room table needs to be oiled.  I do not feel that I should have to tell my boyfriend what to clean.  It should be evident.  I do not want to tell him to clean, period.  I want him to see a dirty table and think, ""Oh, that needs to be cleaned.""  You know, just like a real adult."

bvu3g,0,2010-04-25,I'm uncomfortable around my mom's new boyfriend.  What do I do?,turtlesallthewaydown,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/bvu3g/im_uncomfortable_around_my_moms_new_boyfriend/,"A few years ago, my mom got divorced from my dad (20 year marriage).  During the past few years she's concentrated mostly on her job, resulting in a lot of stress.  Just recently she's found a guy that seems just right for her.  He's of the same religion AND he's a genuinely good person who treats her like a lady.  He was happily married to his previous wife for her entire life, so he never was in any messy divorces.  Sounds perfect for her.

The only thing is, I really can't stand being around him.  My mom is constantly lecturing me on how wonderful this guy is.  He's teaching me some things about how to fix and maintain my car which is nice, but he also got me a very nice toolbox full of tools.  I was really uncomfortable about getting this big of a gift from somebody I barely know.  They're nice tools, but it seems that they're also a common talking point for my mom to show me how wonderful he is.

What's more, they spend a lot of time in the living room of the house together, reading the Bible, listening to music, talking quietly, and being lovey dovey.  I hear kissing noises occasionally and that is something I REALLY don't want to walk in on or even hear, so I sequester myself in my room and do homework until they go out or he leaves (which can be pretty late).  It sounds immature, but I know I want privacy with my girlfriend if we're being that quietly romantic.  This weekend he's been staying over in the guest bed, so he's been near-inescapable.  I can't just go hang out on campus until he leaves, because most places would close before he leaves.

I'm twenty years old.  The college I attend (I study Computer Science and Electrical Engineering) is near my home, so I decided to live at home so that I can save my internship money for a home for me and my girlfriend after college.  When I'm on internships I move a good 200 miles away and live in an apartment by myself, but otherwise I live at home.  I'd prefer not to move out on a whim (although if they did get married I would move out).  Moving out right now isn't an option anyway as I'm moving in a few weeks for an internship.  Getting a local apartment now would be a waste.

How can I improve my situation?"

What do I do?,throwitaway22,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/bw1sk/does_anyone_have_this_similar_type_of_work/,"I'm a college student that's been offered many internships (I'm decently qualified and a very smart kid) or jobs and have taken them but end up freaking out beforehand. I either end up not showing up ever for an interview or making an excuse for my first day or going for a few days and then freaking out and never coming back. I guess it's this fear of failing at work that I get so anxious that I just don't want to go anymore. I get so nervous before every day of work and am so nervous once I'm there. I feel like I don't know how to do anything even though as I mentioned I'm very smart (3.8 GPA so far) and probably qualified.

I realize eventually I'm going to have to work full time and that this is going to affect this. I can't be pulling this shit for much longer, so what do I do? I'm currently at an internship that I've gone to twice though I haven't done much work (yet). The anxiety is starting to hit me again and I'm getting to that point where I want to just get under my covers and hide and stop going there. What do I do?

Edit: I should also say this also happens beyond just work. I'll get excited for joining an intramural team or something and then just get so anxious and nervous I never end up showing and quit the team or something. What the hell?

What can I do to fix either of these, does anyone else have anything like this?"
bwa9g,1,2010-04-26,"Hey Lawddit, newspaper reporter here looking to start over - should I be a lawyer? ",theawesomeishere,law,https://www.reddit.com/r/law/comments/bwa9g/hey_lawddit_newspaper_reporter_here_looking_to/,"I know, you probably get this question a million times a year. I feel you. But let me lay it on you. 

I've been a newspaper reporter (fuck) for about four years, but  I just moved to Nashville so my girlfriend can attend Vanderbilt Law - leaving my writing job in California behind. It was my choice, whatever, but now, my resume is so specialized for journalism, it's been really hard to find a job. I'm doing some retail, is what it is, people. 

So, I've been thinking about going back to school to kind of start-over, and I've always considered becoming a lawyer. Really, it's something I've gone back and forth on my whole life. 

Pros (at least from what I limitedly know): 

* I studied philosophy in college, and have a knack for logical thinking, I think.
* This post aside, I can write and communicate pretty well. 
* I've done internships at public interest law orgs, love politics, arguing, etc. 
* My girlfriend will be a lawyer (and we can bang, lawyerly; also use terms like ""Sidebar"" for the bedroom, and help me with studies)
* I miss challenges and intellectually improving myself. 
* All kidding aside, at least ostensibly, it seems like the most pragmatic approach to going back to school - I have a liberal arts background and would probably, in a perfect world, want to pursue a media studies or theory degree, but, ha ha, come on. Law seems like a nice balance between pragmatic considerations and idealism. Hope that doesn't sound naive...

Cons:

* My grades in school were not that great (I think my GPA is a hair split under a 3.0) and I'm worried that could really hinder the cost-benefit of going to law school (why go if you can't get into a good school?). 
* I know my girlfriend is, ha ha, a little stressed right now. I'm kind of a laid back guy and never took academics as seriously as she did in undergrad. Naturally I'd have to start doing that if I go through with this, but sometimes I worry I don't have it in me (on the other hand, I'm at a point in my life where I feel like I should try type A-life for a little bit). 
* A part of me is worried if I'll start doing all this stuff, take out the student laws, get immersed in this and realize I hate it. Is there anyway to get around that? 

I guess I'm kind of rambling. Given my grades, I was also wondering if anyone could recommend a ""demo"" LSAT or something online, where I could test the waters and see if I have any aptitude for a test I'm going to have to nail to pull this off properly.

Eh, yeah. Any help would be appreciated. I'd imagine you're all very busy..."

When I first started college for some reason (honestly I have no clue why now) I got a credit card despite that everyone always tells you not to if you can't handle one. I thought I could; I couldn't. 

So here I am, nearly 3 years later barely being able to afford basic things I need like food, gas, and other living expenses. I racked up probably around $5,000 dollars in debt, which may not seem like a whole ton, but as a college student who makes ~$500 dollars a month, it is. I realize what a huge mistake I made, and haven't used them in over a year and a half, but I stopped working 2 jobs during the semester to focus on my last couple years of school and now I'm struggling to make even minimum payments. My situation might be a little better off if this was at least all on one card, but it's spread across 4 of them (I'm such an idiot!), one with a larger amount and the rest all under $1,000.

So what can I do? I fully intend to pay these blasted things off, once I'm out of school and have a real job (or any job that I can work more than 16 hrs a week) it wouldn't be so bad. I still have another year left of school. I'm hoping to get a decent internship this summer that would help me make some money, but if that falls through I'll be stuck with a couple minimum wage jobs because the city I live in (Erie, PA) has the most god awful job market even when the economy isn't crashing. How screwed am I? Is there ANYTHING I can do?

tl;dr I was an idiot a couple years ago with credit cards and now I'm screwed."

Our group is located in Disneyland was in charge of updating pre-existing attractions.  There is another group that is in charge of maintaining attractions as well. Everyone who works in Disneyland is a Cast Member because we put on the show.  It doesn't matter if you wear a costume or not.  

The engineers at Disneyland are also Cast Members to the guests.  However, there are different engineering groups within the corporate structure.  There is a small handful of people who work for Imagineering but are housed in DL.  Imagineers can be engineers, writers, AV people, any and all creative types.

I know it's not like shows like criminal minds or CSI, but I could see doing a more realistic version of that would be interesting. When someone gets killed investigators have to go to somebody for insight, right? Do any redditors work in a field like that?

Edit: FYI, I live in the Baltimore-Washington DC area. This makes government jobs a little more appealing."

bxlej,8,2010-04-29,Need Advice /r/Design. Regarding an internship decision.,KorgRue,Design,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/bxlej/need_advice_rdesign_regarding_an_internship/,"So this summer I accepted an internship. Really fun agency. Will be interning in their interactive design and development department. In a really great district of the city. Really cool old building. Casual, jeans and button down type work environment. Good client base. Only catch is that it is an unpaid 10 week internship.

Today, another agency contacted me offering an intern position with their interactive department. Conservative ad firm. Pretty well known. Some really big clients. Located in a nice suburb. Shirt and tie type work environment. Well paid internship.

Possibility of full time employment with either company next year after I graduate.

What should I do? What would you do?

**EDIT:**

Thank you all so much for the feedback. I made my decision this morning in part from your feedback and in part from other information that I should have revealed when I posted this question.

I am a 34 year old disabled vet. I worked for 10 years after I got out of the military (due to injury) for a stuffy shirt and tie company, in a stuffy work environment, with stuffy co-workers. The pay was **really** good, but I was miserable and creatively crippled. I quit my well paid job and went back to school in a field that allowed a larger degree of creativity, that did not require a shirt and tie (in general), and would put me among other creative people. The thought of working for a conservative ad agency in the type of environment that I quit my career over is what makes the decision so difficult.

Money or Happiness?

I had to go with happiness, and selected the ""fun"" firm. I called the other firm and declined the offer a few minutes ago. I have a secondary source of income, and although the extra money from the paid internship would have been helpful (who doesn't want more money?), I decided to put my happiness (and sanity) in front of the money. 

Again, thank you all for your feedback. It was seriously appreciated in helping me make this decision."

Only a few superstars get 10+ million.

Now think about it: In Manhattan, a very average, entry-level condo near Central Park starts at $10 million. Then you'd need at least one maid. Need to get a new car at least every 2-3 years: probably a new Bently or Maserati or Ferrari. Now your children need to go to some private prep school like Dalton or Trinity. And once the school finds out you work on Wall Street, then you'd have to shell out a lot for school donation every year. Then your wife needs to spend on jewelery, clothing, cosmetics, spas, vacations to Europe, etc just keep up with her social circle. Then you'd need to maintain a summer house on Long Island or in Connecticut to keep up with your colleagues and friends. After all that, the bonus is really not that much.

Think about how hard we work: a senior managing director in Wall Street wakes up at around 6:30 AM, arrives in the office no later than 7:30AM. Then the rest of the day, every nerve is tightly wound for every second of the day, watching over 5 screens of constantly changing data/index/trends, answering phones from customers, designing trading strategies. Lunch is just an egg salad sandwich brought to your desk by an intern, as you have zero time to step out even for lunch. You unwind at at 8,9,or even 10pm, then you call a cab home, falling asleep in the car. Once at home, you are too tired to even make love to your wife.

For 150K a year, who would do this job?

I have 2 pre trial conferences coming up. What course of action should I take? The bar incident I never admitted to the cop that I used any false identification he found it in my wallet after handcuffing me, because I told him I didn't bring any identification.

Basically I am here to ask for advice from my fellow redditors and what possible consequences I could be facing.

by5qv,13,2010-04-29,IAmA guy whose life was going nowhere until he got a huge internship in Singapore. It totally changed my life. AmA.,jimmygibbs,IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/by5qv/iama_guy_whose_life_was_going_nowhere_until_he/,"I spent my days singing to Youtube videos - not playing video games, not reading Reddit - singing to Youtube videos aloud. Looking back at myself, I was pathetic. I was out of school and getting more depressed every day; every job interview I had, I completely failed.

My life wasn't going anywhere. I had no girlfriend (still a virgin), no money (no job) and huge debts, few friends and wasted day after day, always wondering what I should do with my life. Then, the e-mail came.

It was a small internship in Singapore. It was sent to everyone at my school, in my domain. ""No chance I'd get it,"" I thought. ""I shouldn't even bother to apply."" But I did. I wanted to believe and try, just one time.

2 job openings. 500 students. Hundreds applied. I was chosen. For a second I swear my heart stopped to beat. I could not believe it.

It was in Singapore. Everything was included - plus, we were paid and we would receive a huge grant as well. It wasn't even taxable, do you get how amazing this was? 

The other chosen student was an amazing girl. We first met days before leaving and I couldn't believe how cute she was. Obviously, I was the only person she knew in a country very far from home, which means... Yeah, you get it :D At this point, I could barely believe my luck - I then realized just amazing Singapore here. I was free, I was American and everything was paid - food, lodging (in a four-stars hotel) and even going out (the senior would pay us clubs and drinks after a good day!!!!!!). It was simply kickass, amazing. Best year of my life easily!

The job was excellent. I was American and I was looked upon like somebody who knew everything. The simple internship ended up being a management job. Every morning I would wake up and people would tell me ""Good morning Mr., how has your night been?"" They even brought me a cake for my birthday! We spent our few nights going out discussing America and how it was to live there. 

After much time, I ended up coming home (my job was finished) but I still work for the company here. Me and my girlfriend are still together :D

So there it goes, I got a huge internship in Singapore, it became a full-time job and I am now happier than I've ever been. If you get a chance to work overseas - DO IT!!!! It totally changed my job - I was borderline suicidal, spent my days doing nothing and now consider myself moderately sucessful!

AmA!!"

- Sending out hundreds of applications

- Getting my resume reviewed

- Using meetup.com to go to networking meetings

- Letting friends/family know I don't have a job in case of ""oh i know one!"" possibilities.

- Going to the Employment office to see if they could help, they couldn't

- Considering Peace Corps/Americorps 

- Asking reddit for advice on getting a job

Background:

I'm a business administration major and my only real experience is helping my dad out with administration side of a family engineering business since high school and a one semester internship in the business office of a private school (they can't do anything for me).
I also have some experience with college acitivites (like being the president of an entrepreneurial club) but even though they're on the resume, I doubt they add much.

I foresee the first comment being ""stop spending so much time on reddit"" but I need to be on here at least an hour a day to keep from gong insane.

Any advice?  Shoot myself? 

EDIT: Going to a temp agency seems like a good idea."
