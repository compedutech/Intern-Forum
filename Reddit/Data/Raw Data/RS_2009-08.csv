I only have about a single semester's worth of Java knowledge under my belt, and that was a few years ago at the first school I went to.

The company I'm currently interning at uses Java. My internship is in the QA department, but the higher-ups recognize my status in school and my interests and would like to start bringing me over into the development side of things (and hopefully give me a full-time programmer's position once I graduate). 

I worry that I've grown rusty and unfamiliar with Java but I'd like to not disappoint if I'm offered some entry-level programming intern stuff to work on in the next few months. Does reddit have any advice or know of any good ways to get my feet wet again in Java and pick up my confidence?

Maybe I'm worried over nothing, but this would be my first real experience of programming as a job so I have a hard time knowing if I'm ready or not."
977e5,4,2009-08-03,"In three years, I'll be graduating with a degree in Journalism and entering an industry that virtually no one has anything good to say about. How about you, Reddit? Got any hopes for journalism and journalists? (more questions inside!)",gill_outean,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/977e5/in_three_years_ill_be_graduating_with_a_degree_in/,"Hi, Reddit. I'm a Canadian university student living in southern Ontario.

Newspapers everywhere are dying, magazines are hiring less and less, and the Internet is still somewhat of a mystery to journalists wanting to make a decent living. I feel I'm a strong writer and reporter with a lot of qualities that lend specifically to being an excellent overall journalist, but I'm growing more and more concerned that this industry will have croaked before I even get a chance to put those skills to use.

So here's a few more questions I have:

1. How much can I expect to make straight out of school? I'd like to know how $$$ differs from medium to medium, job to job.

2. Are there ways I can increase that income? What are the accompanying consequences? For instance, I know that freelancing often fetches a much higher income than a salaried position, but it's also nowhere near as consistent and much more difficult to start doing in the first place. Also, will I get paid more living somewhere other than southern Ontario? Is there anywhere in the world where a journalist's quality of life is better than elsewhere?

3. In three years' time, where do you expect the best jobs in the journalism field to be? 

4. What can I start doing right now to increase my chances of getting a stable, good-paying job after I graduate? To save some time, assume I'm already aware of the most obvious stuff: work on my portfolio, do internships, make contacts, etc.

And finally, 5. If being a journalist in the traditional sense doesn't work out for me, what are some other routes I can take with my degree? I've been especially interested in PR work, but I'm one of those unlucky few who couldn't see himself working at a job that consists largely of deception (maybe that's an unfair statement, but it's the bias I have towards PR.) 

Err, one more question to expand on the last one:

6. If PR is something that interests me, but I have this moral gag reflex (justified or not), what are some clients or types of clients I could relate publicly and still be at ease with myself?

Thanks."
97u78,11,2009-08-05,"I want to adventure, reddit.",ZanshinJ,lostgeneration,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostgeneration/comments/97u78/i_want_to_adventure_reddit/,"I'm pretty sure alot of us grew up with the fantasy of grandiose adventures--on TV, in video games, and other places. I'm also pretty sure that many of us liked these fantasy adventures so much because our lives were extraordinarily cut-and-dry. You go to school and do well in school so you can go to college and do well in college so you can get a good job and so on.

We know that the path that we were given wasn't what was being advertised. I know that sitting here, in the office at my internship, I realize how terrible this job I have actually is--I know it's not what I want to do for the rest of my life. I'm glad I got to do it, no questions there, but I'm equally glad it has a preset end date. I'm going to be graduating college soon, in anywhere from 1 to 3 years--it all depends on whether or not I want to work that extra bit to get done.

But none of those things sound satisfactory, reddit. I don't -know- what I want to do. My parents tell me that I should go to graduate or medical school, and then my life will be made. A good friend of mine says that I should do the same, but take the mantle of teaching or research, since I like those more.

Every story that I've read or seen involving an adventure or journey ends with the traveler learning something deep about themselves, and I'm convinced that I need to take that journey myself.

So, reddit. Any suggestions on how to start an adventure? On how to carry out an adventure?

Let money and time be obstacles. They'll be troublesome to deal with, but they're not out of the picture."

I have a problem that I need advice on. First of all I created this throw away account because I did not want my close friends knowing about my problem. I'll get straight to the point. I have been working with this company for almost three years. I started off as an intern and right after graduation from college they hired me on full time. The thing is, I never graduated. I failed one class and the company never bothered to ask to see my transcripts. Anyways, I decided not to say anything because my parents got a divorce 1 month before my supposed graduation and I knew I had to help my mom get back on her feet. Plus it would have broke her heart if she found out I had failed. This is why I initially decided to just go ahead and work full time in a good salary. Here's what I need advice on. My mother is back on her feet now and I want to get my actual degree so I went back to my University, spoke to my advisor, and registered for the 1 class I need. I don't want my work finding out about this. Should I return and get my degree or should I continue working without one? I'm already registered but I can always drop.  "

I've had two internships and have decent grades at a good school, so I'm not too worried about finding a job.

I'll be quitting smoking in a few months because virtually all companies have drug testing for new hires.

It looks like completely random tests aren't allowed for most industries, but employees in regulated industries and safety sensitive positions may be subject to random testing.

Anybody with 1st hand experience working in CA?  I'm think I've read that medicinal users aren't given any special protection against drug testing; is this correct?  Also, if anybody works at or knows of non-drug testing companies that hire engineers, shoot me a PM.  I'd like to keep smoking, but if it's not possible to get away with while working in CA, I'd like to know now, though it probably won't stop me from trying to move out there."

9a6so,2,2009-08-13,What should I do with my 16-year-old cousin for a week?,WelpHereWeAre,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/9a6so/what_should_i_do_with_my_16yearold_cousin_for_a/,"My 16-year-old cousin has to do an internship for school, so he's visiting me for a week (I'm 29) and coming to work with me. We're friendly with each other, although we've only really spent time together at family gatherings in large groups. 

He lives in a boring suburban town and I live in a big city, and I've also got more progressive political and social beliefs than his parents, so I'm mindful of the opportunity I have to give him a different perspective on things. He seems more or less Internet-savvy (much more so than his parents, at least), so I can relate to him on that level -- we joke about memes and so on. And I think he's been fairly entertained by coming to work with me (I'm self-employed but have an office) and seeing how I make a living.

But I worry about boring him, and I've kind of forgotten what stuff I knew and didn't know when I was 16. I've tried to just talk to him like an adult, and for the most part it's going fine, but sometimes it's clear that there are certain gaps in his understanding of the world. It's just a little awkward and I'd love some words of advice for things we could do or things I should keep in mind.

And I'm not sure what's going to happen on Sunday when he learns that we don't go to church.  I don't necessarily want to have awkward conversations with his parents.  Thoughts?"
9ak8o,133,2009-08-14,I was an actor's assistant. AMA.,buttcircus,IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/9ak8o/i_was_an_actors_assistant_ama/,"I was Mickey Rourke's personal assistant before, during, and after the production of The Wrestler.  I did this for a little less than a year.  
I'm not sure how well this will go because it's certainly not my place to divulge details that Mickey wouldn't want out there.  I'm very much not in tune with celebrity gossip, but I know enough to be weary of jeopardizing someone's reputation in a public forum.  So I've gotta tread pretty lightly here.

I'll give you a basic rundown, to get it out of the way:
I was taken in as an intern at Darren's studio Protozoa Pictures in the early stages of pre-production.  Mickey arrived a few days later.  A few days after that, he and his assistant at the time parted ways.  Mickey then asked me to take on that role, so I did.  This all happened within the first ten days of me moving to New York, so I was a bit apprehensive.
Being around Mickey all the time also meant being around Darren all the time, too.

Briefly on Mickey:  He's been an actor since he was in his 20s, so that's bound to make anyone idiosyncratic, but he's far from alien.  He is at heart, and in practice, a good man.  
I don't have the sample size to put any science behind this, but I feel that actors tend to derive a good bit of their life's affection through the adoration of strangers.  If you get this, most of what I experienced with him will make more sense.  
He maintains a strong work ethic, in his own way.  He'd sometimes toil with our agenda,  but we got just about all of it done.

Briefly on Darren:  He is the most impressive professional I've ever been around.  His efficacy, day in and day out, is pretty astonishing.  It's extremely hard to keep an audience of wrestling fans entertained and engaged after they've sat through eight full takes of a match with body doubles.  I suspect not all directors take this responsibility on, but he did.

A few months after The Wrestler wrapped, I ended my stint as a personal assistant.  Nothing bad happened, it's just pretty taxing being another human's assistant."

About 15 years ago, as I was finishing up undergrad, I fell into a pretty deep depression - Stopped exercising, overate, isolated myself - All the typical stuff. With meds, a psychology intern, and some good friends I was able to pull myself out of it.

I started grad school in 97 and was doing great until I graduated in 2000, when I went through the exact same ordeal as I did 5 years earlier. By 2002 or so, I was well on my way to flushing my life down the toilet, but I was married w/ 2 small kids and was not just hurting myself, I was hurting my family as well.

I began drinking and using, and came very close to losing my professional license. My wife threatened to leave, kick me out, have me committed, but nothing worked. Finally, I woke up one morning (about 3 years ago) and was tired of being drunk or hung over 24 hours a day. I didn't drink or use that day, or the next, or the next...

I started seeing a shrink again, got involved in some recovery groups, and got to work repairing my relationship with my family and trying to save my career (both of which I was able to do). Happy ending, right? Well, yeah. I don't want to downplay the miraculous changes that have taken place in my life; but the underlying depression, desire to isolate myself, low self esteem, and inability to get off my ass and engage in life is still there.

I know what I need to do to stay healthy (because I read about it on Reddit all the time): Stay away from the booze and dope, exercise, eat right, get off the couch (and the internet) and find a hobby, make some friends, learn to meditate, do yoga, etc, etc.

I know a lot of you have gone through something similar, and I always read in your comments/advice to other Redditors that ""You've gotta FORCE yourself to get off the computer/go to the gym/go for a run...""

How the fuck do you do it? Knowing the right thing to do is not the same as going out and doing it. How do you motivate yourselves? How do you FORCE yourself to get outside and exercise? Or give up junk food? Or socialize (especially when you're very self conscious and have convinced yourself that you're a fuck up and not quite as good as everyone else)?

Looking forward to some good advice. Thanks everybody."

I've recently graduated with a barch and have been looking for jobs all summer for my part 1 year out, and after a summer of dead ends and interviews that go nowhere, I got two offers in two days. 

One offer is basically to work on a £180 million project as document control and detail drawing/design, whereas the other is to work in Amsterdam for 6 months as an intern, doing all stages of design, but as it's an internship, it has low pay.

From a pragmatic point of view, the doc control job would be better as it would give me more pay, and pretty up close site experience, but I'm worried that I'll be bored. Does anyone have any experience doing this type of work?

I've probably left loads of important details out, so I'm happy to give more info if you can help.

If I have an error that references another file, and I fix the error in the other file, then it underlines an absolutely random line of text and spits out a random error until I rebuild my entire workspace.

From the website:

To those of you who were redirected here, we apologize.



In an attempt to befriend Asian investors and increase office morale, we here at Grooveshark established some connections with the Chinese black market and imported our very own black-and-white Giant Panda (hereby known as ""Pickles""). Unfortunately, due to circumstances no one could have foreseen, Pickles became agitated at the fluorescent lights and near-constant belly rubs and began clawing at our computers.



Pickles is currently thrashing about in the server room, causing the technical difficulties and temporary outage you just experienced. As soon as our interns return from Pier 1 with synthetic bamboo, a picnic basket and an oversized net, we will be able to return the servers back to normal and, if we can, rescue the coder that Pickles has taken as a prize.

http://img153.imageshack.us/img153/2677/depewdj5.jpg

Now that I've got your attention, it's time to disappoint you: No, I do not sleep with her. No, I don't even make a sly attempt. If you're still interested, read on.

Okay so at my school we have faculty advisers that are assigned to students according to their last names. The faculty advisers help students with scheduling conflicts, general questions, help with internships/employment, etc. My adviser is named Jess Depew and as you can see she's pretty hot. The picture doesn't really do her justice but they're all I've got at the moment. She's like 25 and she's only been at the school a few years. Anyway, I have been looking into getting an internship at a TV station or something over the summer, and the school helps coordinate these things with an internship database that's maintained by the advisers. You log on with your school ID and password and you can browse internships and stuff. I was having trouble logging on to mine so I went to go see Ms. Depew. That's where all the trouble started.

Firstly, I walked into office like 15 minutes early like an idiot and she's in the middle of lunch. So I awkwardly make stupid stall talk until she's finished.

""Oh, hey, what are you eating?"" ""Salmon. I love it. I eat it practically everyday."" ""Just salmon? That's pretty weird."" Why the hell did I say this? ""Oh, well, I don't know. I try to eat healthy, natural foods...you know, like wild berries and honey and stuff."" ""Yeah, I like food too."" facepalm

Man, I was so nervous. Anyway, we finally begin squaring my stuff away. She looks up what I registered with in the beginning of the year. This is when the crap really hit the fan. This is how the conversation went:

""Okay, you're account name is [my name] and your password is ...'depewissexy'...""

Oh damn. I completely forgot that I put that as my password in the beginning of the year. What the hell was I thinking? It was probably the longest 20 seconds of my life before I finally got my balls together to stand up and leave. Just as I walk out the door she says,

""In the future, you might want to bear in mind what kind of things you want keep to yourself.""

I was so freaking embarrassed I wanted to kill myself right then and there. I wanted to run the hell out of there and never, ever see her again. But something about what she just said kept me standing in her doorway. I decided to man up and apologize. I turned to her, looked her straight in the eyes, and swallowed my pride. And then, it hit me like a train full of bricks.

She was eating Salmon.

She tries to eat all healthy, natural foods, like wild berries and honey.

She told me that I might want to bear in mind what kind of things I want to keep to myself.

Ms. Depew was a bear disguised as a human.

Immediately, the bear saw that I had seen through its charade. It roared loudly and took a menacing swipe at me. I deftly avoided its claw and sprinted out of the office. The bear was soon in chase, crashing through the walls of the office as if they were made of paper. I jumped over the receptionist desk and ran out the back entrance. The bear followed, tossing the secretary aside like a rag doll. The bear began to pursue me through the street traffic. While I fought my way through the maze of vehicles, the bear simply careened its massive force through anything standing in its way. Cars veered off the road to escape the onslaught of grizzly force that was barreling down the road. The bear was gaining fast. I had no other option but to make my way into the nearest building: a preschool. I burst through the door, startling the children from their naps. Immediately, the bear slammed through the wall, crushing a child beneath his massive paws and burying several other children in sheet rock and debris. I maneuvered my way through the chaos towards the back exit. The pre-schoolers were little more than a screaming annoyance for the bear. Its massive paws cut swaths through the sea of toddlers with each swipe. I used the precious time these children had afforded for me to make my escape into the playground. I scrambled up a ladder to a fort-like structure. My goal was to walk across the monkey bars then jump to a tree which I could climb to the roof of the preschool and perhaps flag down a passing helicopter.

I began my trek across the monkey bars just as the bear charged outside, its teeth and claws still fresh with the blood of the innocent. It let out a monstrous roar and began its assault on the cheap, wooden playset. I let go of all caution and ran to end the end of the monkey bars. I leaped for the tree branch just as the bear's enormous girth came plowing through the entire structure. I grasped the branch tightly as the bear collided with the tree, sending it into a daze. I saw this as my one opportunity not for escape, but for victory. I leapt off the tree onto the ground and grabbed a stray bar that had been shorn from the playset. The bear was slowly coming to so I had to act fast. I ran to the beast and thrust the jagged end of the pole into its jaw and through it's skull.

The bear had been defeated. I shambled home in pain but victorious.There will be more threads and more bears in the months to come.

But today, I returned home a champion.

    * I found this on 4chan a while ago, so I cant really cite where I found it.

I've decided to become an actuary. My econometrics classes were always the ones I enjoyed the most. I decided on the profession because of the expertise and skills it requires and develops on your path to attaining fellowship in an actuarial society. I'm hoping to find a job in P&amp;C, Life Insurance, and the CERA certification is intriguing but I would definitely be all over a position in Health or Pensions -- just want my foot in a door somewhere.

I passed exam 1 in May, and am sitting for (or will register TO sit for as soon as exam registration opens...) exam 2 in December. I've got the academic requirements for eligibility for VEE in economics and applied statistical modeling. I settled on the profession sometime senior year, and as a result have totally whiffed on internships. It also doesn't help that the UW is not known for its actuarial science program. My last ""job"" job was last summer, and I've been doing odd jobs and day-to-day work (dog sitting, private tutoring, et cetera) in order to pick up cash here and there since. Nothing really worth putting on a resume.

I'm writing this because I need help, reddit. I don't know if I'm going about it the right way, and I need all the advice, connections, and maybe... just maybe... **interviews** you can give.

There's also the fact that after putting together so many applications and cover letters I am itching for something to take my mind off of the job hunting process for a little while. It's probably why it reads like a cover letter.

The nice thing is, I've gone down my list of 82 companies and applied for every relevant open position, so that's out of the way... for this week, at least.
