vwdyo,4,2012-07-01,Need advice with mother/daughter relationship and I feel as though you ladies can help! It's making me majorly depressed! x-post from r/relationships,sambunny,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/vwdyo/need_advice_with_motherdaughter_relationship_and/,"I'm a 24/f and my mom is in her 50's.. The past 6 years have been extremely stressful and things are finally coming to a boiling point and I don't know what to do! Warning it's very long! There's a lot of history and I'll do my best to explain!

Six years ago my mom's business started failing. Money was being taken from every bit of mine, my brother's and my fathers lives.. She was (maybe still is) addicted to gambling. Some of my mom's clients decided they were going to get together and sue her for money that was taken and for work that was never done. Now, I believe that what mostly happened was bad business on everyone's part.. but I can't help but feel as though my mother gambled the majority of the money away. Anyways, once the lawsuits came to light my mom disappeared for two weeks leaving suicide notes behind to my brothers, me and my dad. I called the police immediately and after an agonizing two weeks of not knowing if she'd show up alive or dead she finally called saying she took a bunch of pills and was at a shitty hotel. We went with the police officers to pick her up and under the Baker Act she was committed for 72 hours. 

Once released, the damage from the money situation was worse than we thought. Bills, including rent, hadn't been paid for months and we were being evicted. I dropped out of college, took another job and began to save every penny to avoid too much disruption in my younger brothers life. I took a loan out on my car and used that money to find a house for my family to live in. (my dad had just stated working again after losing his job and my mother obviously used all of the savings)

So, we move to the new house and my mom finally becomes useful again shopping, cleaning doing things around the house.. My dad starts making money again and I finally have the chance to start college again, or so I think. Turns out my mom is not only being sued, but criminal charges are being made because of the amount of money that was taken. For the next year she is in and out of jail and court while I drop out of school again to make sure my younger brother gets too and from school so he can graduate high school. Eventually things are figured out in court and my mom has to pay restitution and will not see jail time. Things once again seem to go back to normal and I finally move out on my own to try and get my own life together.

Fast forward to about a year ago and my roommates and I all decide to go our separate ways. I decide to move in with my parents again for a few months only while I look for a new place to live. A couple months go by and my mom starts acting strange again, much like she did when she tried to commit suicide. However this time instead of suicide notes, my dad and I come home to notes saying she doesnt want to pay restitution anymore and is going to serve the rest of her jail sentence. She thinks it will be two months, it turns out she is incarcerated for more than 8 months. During this time I'm trying to finish my last semester of college, work and participate in internships. I have to drop out of my internship to help take care of my dad and the house, somehow still finding a way to finish school and completely disrupting my plans to move out again on my own.

Now, my problem with all of this is that my parents like to pretend that nothing has ever happened. We're a very traditional italian family, and my dad believes in family loyalty no matter what and believes things like this should not be discussed. I obviously feel differently.

My mother has never ever acknowledged the mental anguish she put my brothers and I through with her suicide attempt and had no regard for me when she decided to go to jail without talking to anyone first. She pretends that none of these things have happened and that my life hasn't been affected by any of it.

When everything was happening I lent my mother more than $5000 in cash. On top of that I paid off my car loans which was another $10k (used for rent went we had nowhere to live) and credit card bills for things that were needed for the house after the eviction totaled almost $8000. I paid all of this off with a lot of hard work and have never said anything to anyone about it yet my parents still act as though I'm so spoiled brat who didn't contribute to anything during tough times.

I just don't know what to do anymore, I feel so helpless. After everything i did to support my family during these tough times, my parents and mom especially act like I'm a horrible person who has no respect for anyone. They constantly nag at me and don't respect my privacy and completely refuse to admit everything I've done for them and our family. My brothers did nothing when all these things happened yet I stepped up and stopped my life to make sure everyone would be okay.

i don't know how to forgive my mother for these things when she's never once said sorry or even acknowledge that they've happened. She says she needs to be selfish but was she not being selfish when she ran off without saying a word to anyone else? Whenever I try to being these subjects up to my parents they just gang up on me telling me to get over it, but I just can't. Not when they ignore everything that happend.

So what can I do? Do i just cut them out of my life? Try to talk again? I am so lost and don't know where to turn.

TLDR; My mother has been making life a living hell.. Tried to kill herself, steals money, goes to jail yet refuses to admit she's ever done anything wrong. Ignores the fact that I took care of our family for years and just can't take the disrespect anymore. What can I do?"
vwdsp,42,2012-07-01,"Difficulty Networking - None of my friends or family members ""know anybody""",GodBroken,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/vwdsp/difficulty_networking_none_of_my_friends_or/,"**The facts:**

My SO (of 3 years) and I are having serious difficulty getting started out of college.

We both went to engineering school, I am Mechanical and he is Chemical.  He shines on his resume - internships, 3.5 GPA, research experience, and one contract as an associate engineer.

I got a low-ball offer for a go-nowhere company in another state doing RF Engineering that uses absolutely nothing I learned in school, and have been here for 19 months.  My SO moved here with me after his contract ended in hopes of finding something or perhaps going to grad school (grad school didn't work out.)

He has been applying to approximately a dozen jobs a day, every day, for 19 months.  His resume is top notch.  He has cover letter writing down to an art.  We are very aware that every online job application gets submitted with 1000 others into the black hole of the internet.

**The problem:**

I think one of our major problems is that we have no networking.  We have exhausted all family members and friends of family members (nobody in our small family is in engineering).  We have bothered our old professors to no avail.  Most of our friends aren't working, but rather chose the ""go to grad school to ride out the recession"" tactic of life.

It seems like everybody I've talked to who has gotten a job, has gotten it via some friend or family member contact.  We have none of those.  We've heard of those young professional meetups - do those work?

And to top it all off, we totally suck at this.  I am shy in general, and my SO has issues with anxiety and talking to people.  The awkwardness of social situations is enough to make him physically ill or panic.  The idea alone of going to random meetups based on various hobbies makes me cringe.  However, we know we need to push these excuses aside and get down to business.  

**So the question is: How does a person network, starting from nothing?**

All advice appreciated.

Edit: Crappy grammar."

[link](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/353562/redditversion.pdf)

Still debating adding a branding statement, dont really know where to start on that.

I tried to quantify my bullet points (easier on my most recent work, harder on my internships work)

I want to try and include the fact that the project I am working on for my research was someones PHD work (designing it), and that when he received his PHD in May and left the university, I was put in charge of finishing the experiment.  This meant picking up where he left off in the design, designing the entire experiment (what to actually test), acquiring and analyzing the data etc.  This will probably be something i briefly address in a cover letter.

How is the wording on that section? since, as undergrad research work goes, mine is pretty in depth, properly describing it can get wordy, and might be hard for non-engineers to understand. 

Also, I have some really cool videos and pictures of the mechanism/experiment hosted online, would it be proper  to include a link to a webpage with experiment info on it?

Thanks in advance for the comments!"

I commute three hours, by bus, to and from work every day, minimum. Roughly 6 hours of bus commuting in one of the most dangerous cities in the US drives my mom, who is thousands of miles away, completely crazy. She insists on hearing from every night after I get home, much to my chagrin. I usually don't contact her and without fail, she'll contact me and find out if I got home that way.

Well, one night, after an unusually difficult and long day at the office combined with little sleep the previous few nights, I got home around 8:30pm and went straight to bed. Now, my phone is REALLY shitty and tends to turn off randomly. That night, I guess it turned off shortly after I had fallen asleep. My mother and I had spoken briefly earlier that day because she had to ask me some inconsequential question mothers tend to ask. Anyway, it had been about four or five hours when my mom started calling around 9 or 10pm, to no avail. Long story short, she panics. Worst case scenario for everyone, she calls the cops and gives them the low down and the address of the place I am staying. I wake up at around 12am to my buddy, who's house I am staying in, getting yelled at by a cop asking if ""IS *my name* PRESENT AT THIS LOCATION!?"" Cop busts in my room. I am in my undies and scared shitless. I have no idea what's going on. Cop screams ""ARE YOU *my name*!?"" I respond affirmatively, totally disoriented. He demands to see some ID. I show him my drivers license and he finally just kinda smirks and is like, ""Call your mom, kid. She's worried about you"" as he walks out.

Oncology is the branch of medicine that deals in diagnosing and treating of cancer. Oncologists must undergo many years of schooling and training. They also work with different types of healthcare professionals, whether it is fellow doctors or nurses and technicians. Patients who visit oncologists are cancer patients who have been referred to the oncologist by their primary care doctors. Oncologists have many tools available to them to help aid in the treatment of cancer. Lastly, there will be many different types of medical transcription reports the transcriptionist will see in this field.

In order for one to become an oncologist, first one must attend a four-year college and attain a bachelor’s degree. After graduating college, one must then attend medical school, which is also four years. Following medical school, the new medical doctor would then do a three-year residency in internal medicine, followed by an oncology internship for two to three years. Nurses and technicians who work with the oncologist generally just need bachelor’s degrees in the required field (Wiki.answers).

Oncologists work closely with many healthcare professionals. They work most closely with a patient’s general practitioner (PCP), radiologists, pathologists, surgeons, radiotherapists, and organ specific specialists. The reason patients visit oncologists is through referral by their pcp when they suspect or detect cancer. 

Oncologists also work closely with radiologists and pathologists. Oncologists take a sample, a biopsy, from the suspected tumor and send it to the pathologist. The pathologist’s job is to define the cells in the sample as cancerous or benign (Pathology). Radiologists use different technologies to get a closer look at tumors, such as: ultrasounds, CT scans, and x-rays (Radiology). 

After oncologists confer with the patient’s primary care doctor, pathologist, and radiologist, they might then meet with an organ specific specialist. These doctors specialize in a specific organ or whole body system, so they are very knowledgeable and might offer special advice as to what is best for the particular patient in question.

With the advice from the specialist, and determinations from the other healthcare professionals involved, the oncologist would then decide what the best course of action would be to get rid of the cancerous cells. One of the options at this point would be radiation therapy in which the oncologist would then meet with a radiotherapist. The radiotherapist is one that applies the radiation treatments to the cancer patient. Another cancer treatment option would be surgery, so the oncologist works very closely with many different types of surgeons, depending on the type of cancer the patient has. 

Oncologists have many tools they use in their field. These include: diagnostic methods, therapies, and nuclear medicine. Diagnostic methods include biopsy, which is taking a sample of the affected cells, endoscopy, which takes an endoscope, a tool used to look inside the body, and examines a certain hollow area of the body (Endoscopy), and blood testing. Blood testing is used in oncology to test certain blood counts associated with different cancers.

There are also many different types of therapies used to treat cancer. The main ones used are chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Some oncologists might also use some less-known types of therapies like hormone therapy, immunotherapy, and alternative therapy.

Chemotherapy is a regimen of cancer-fighting drugs that kill cells in the body that rapidly divide; cancer cells. Unfortunately, chemotherapy has side effects such as hair loss, loss of appetite, weight loss, and these drugs can decrease the production of blood cells. Chemotherapy is usually given intravenously, orally, or injected directly into muscle tissue. Chemo is given in cycles. There are also different types of chemotherapy, combined modality, neo-adjuvant, adjuvant, and palliative. Combined modality chemotherapy is the use of chemo with other forms of cancer treatment such as radiation therapy. Neo-adjuvant chemo is given before surgery to shrink the main tumor. Adjuvant chemotherapy is used after surgery and when there’s little to no evidence of cancer left. Palliative chemotherapy is used when the cancer has progressed too far; it has to intent to actually cure the cancer (Chemotherapy).

Radiation therapy is more direct in that it uses radiation to kill cancer cells. It does this by damaging and changing the DNA of the cancer cells.

The lesser known therapies used in cancer treatment are hormone therapy, immunotherapy, and alternative therapy. Hormone therapy changes the growth patterns of certain cancers. Immunotherapy is sometimes called biological therapy and uses the immune system to help fight the cancer. Alternative therapy would include acupuncture and homeopathy. Acupuncture is the use of thin, tiny needles, stuck into certain points in the body known to correct imbalances within the body. Homeopathy is the study in which scientists determine what causes a disease in one person, but might cure it in another person.

Oncologists also use nuclear medicine, also known as internal radiology. Nuclear medicine is what happens when radionuclides mix with certain elements and then become chemical compounds. Sometimes they combine with pharmaceutical compounds; they then form radiopharmaceuticals.

My speculation on what reports I would see if I worked as a medical transcriptionist for an oncology office would be pre-op and post-op surgery reports, reports involving biopsy, and also reports with just regular check-ups.
In conclusion, oncology is the branch of medicine that deals in diagnosing and treating of cancer. Oncologists are well-trained medical doctors who work with different types of healthcare professionals. Oncology patients are cancer patients. Oncologists have many tools available to them to help aid in the treatment of cancer."

As short of a time that three months is, we never fought and really just spent most of it enjoying each other's company. Until last night.

I've bent over backwards for this guy, doing so much out of thought and consideration for him. When he needed someone to accompany him to an acquaintance's shotgun wedding, I went. When his fancy internship fell through, I spent hours googling for a new one until I eventually found one. When he was having a bad day, I went out of my way to make it better. When he had a long day at his internship, I was sure to have his favorite dinner ready for him when he came to visit.

Our relationship was semi-long distance. His internship is at the coast, about 3 hours away from our university where I'm taking summer classes, and conveniently, my family has a vacation home about 15 minutes from where he stays. I'd come every weekend just to see him and spend time with him.

On Friday, everything was normal. I made him dinner, we had sex, and he slept over. He told me I was perfect. We cuddled and he kissed me before he left for his internship. Not even 12 hours later, I get in his car; we're going to see a movie. He even clarified the time and what we were supposed to be seeing a few minutes before he came. And then, he pulls the ""we need to talk,"" shocking me, as I never even saw it coming.

He didn't give me any ""reason."" All he said was, ""I've been thinking a lot lately and I just can't be in a relationship."" Even with all of my tears and questions, he just kept repeating that one line over and over, along with some cliche, ""you're a great girl,"" ""it's nothing you did"" bullshit. He assured me that he hasn't been unfaithful, but for something so unexpected, I have my suspicions. He was just so callous, unsympathetic and unfeeling through the entire time I was falling apart in his car; he was unable to even look at me while he was doing it. It makes no sense to me - why come over, have sex with me, shower me with compliments, and then the next day tell me that you've been ""thinking a lot"" and can't commit to the relationship anymore?

It'd be nice to know why he ended things the way he did so I can have some closure. It's so difficult for me to accept this happening, as for so long, he's been nothing but compliments, telling me how lucky he is to have me and how perfect I am. It's even more shocking because some might say I'm out of his league - which I never thought I was, but I always envisioned myself breaking up with him if it ever came to that.

I know there's other people out there and once time passes, it'll get better. The problem is, I'm back at my university, in a single dorm room, with no friends around, trying to focus on a dry and boring class I didn't want to take in the first place. I feel so lonely and heavy-hearted, and haven't gotten a wink of sleep or a bite of food since it happened. I try to keep telling myself that I have a lot going for myself in life and don't need someone who doesn't treat me like anything less than a goddess, as demonstrated by his overall lack of tact as he broke up with me last night. It's just so hard to actually believe those things when I feel like my world is crashing down around me. The rational side of me doesn't want to be with someone who'd just so casually dump me, but the irrational side of me  wants him back so badly.

vw1y6,1,2012-07-01,Trying to find a way out,ptcjstc1984,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/vw1y6/trying_to_find_a_way_out/,"I've been having suicidal thoughts lately. Here's the relevant info:

My mother died of breast cancer last October. She was only 48. I have had a really hard time getting over it. For most of my life, my father has also had a gambling addiction. He refuses to get a real job...even to this day. My mother was working well after she should have been resting because he refused to. That's apparently the kind of person he is. He also gambled away her paycheck while she was laying in the hospital getting chemo. Things were so bad in the past that my mom once had to hide our grocery money. My brother had an account on which my father was also listed, and the money he made from roofing (very labor-intensive work) was wiped out in hours. My dad pawned my mom's dead mother's wedding rings, and the necklace my mother saved long and hard to give to my sister-in-law at my brother's wedding. He's also big into lying, deceiving, and just being a downright evil person.

I'm stuck living with him at the moment. I lived with my now ex-boyfriend before that. I had to move back because I work part-time. I have a Masters and am trying to find work, but it's so hard. 

My dad was seeing this other woman for awhile after my mom's death. He spent MY MOTHER'S LIFE INSURANCE MONEY on her and despite us all screaming that she was after his money, he stayed with him. She wound up stealing a bunch more money from him and leaving the state. Now, believe it or not, her daughter is living with us. He says he has no choice...she must stay to drive him around, because, oh, forgot to mention, he got busted for drunk driving. He totaled the van he received after his father passed away. But yeah, this girl took my shirt without my permission while I was out of town, wore it, and posed for a picture in it on Facebook. I cried when I saw it. It was too much. I feel like nothing is really mine anymore. I told my dad about it with tears in my eyes, and all he said was that he would talk to her. He was defending her behavior too. It was sickening. 

I want to move out, but like I said, I don't have the money. I tried to get a discount with the hospital to be seen by a counselor, but I'm not poor enough to qualify. I don't have insurance or any real extra income, so that's a no go. 

A final layer of complication. I'm in love with a great guy and he loves me back but we've only met in person once. He's European. He's coming here to do an internship in January. I know this might be wrong, but I'm thinking he might be a way out for me. A way to a better life. But since he's the only one I can really talk to, I throw my troubles onto him, and I fear it will eventually push him away, although he's been wonderful to me so far. I feel like I would be better if I got out of this environment but I just don't know how to make it happen. 

My brother is also deployed in Afghanistan and my very beloved dog passed on recently. So well, I am in a bad state. I'm only still alive because I think the guy I like would be downright devastated and I don't want to do that to him. 

I sometimes fantasize about leaving my body for my dad to find though..with a note. I feel satisfied when I think of him realizing what he's done."

vvt6s,2,2012-07-01,The future of human evolution after the collapse of civilization - part 3,TheoryofTechnology,collapse,https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/vvt6s/the_future_of_human_evolution_after_the_collapse/,"Knowing what happens to the biosphere we live in allows us to make some predictions about the future world that we will inhabit.

The most important point to understand is the following:

-Authority will be rare and little.

Contrary to what we believe, modern humans spend far more time ordered around than our ancestors. Medieval peasants spent a minority of their time working for their lord, and most of the time worked on their own land. [In total they spent less time working than modern humans.](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/rauch/worktime/hours_workweek.html)

The reason for this is obvious. **Authority is inefficient.** In an ant colony, order exists without authority, because the most efficient system is one in which every organism does what it enjoys the most. Societies based around authority are inefficient, and are either destroyed from within, or destroyed by more efficient outside societies. 

Modern society is incredibly inefficient, but we get away with this as a result of our large fossil fuel subsidies. As our society revolves around being paid to do things we do not want to do, humans spend much of their time pretending to be working. Humans also spend much of their time doing surrogate work, in an attempt to be able to receive jobs that they do like when they grow up. Hence we see trends like unpaid interns. Although we need plenty of people to clean toilets and work in factories, most people don't want to do so, and hence spend their lives competing for access to the few jobs that are fun (politics, entertainment).

Technology also has the effect of reducing the proportion of jobs that are fun. As an example, in a society with little transportation and communications, we need a larger number of musicians and journalists than we currently do. Making a shoe or a chair by yourself is more fun than operating the machines that make thousand identical shoes and chairs per day.

The reason authority is necessary in our society is because people will voluntarily work for kin that also provide services in return, while only force will cause us to work for people unrelated to us. The reason we have to work for people unrelated to us is because technology causes centralization and the destruction of natural communities.

Not a single species besides the human species practices authority. It is true that dogs for example have alpha-dogs that are the only ones in their group that breed, but other dogs in the pack voluntarily chose not to breed, and do not suffer from this, because the alpha dog is closely genetically related to them. 

Hence, in the future, communities will again be based more around voluntary cooperation than around competition.

-Humans will be more feminine than they currently are.

The evolution of the human race represents the evolution from masculinity to femininity. Female chimpanzees are more muscular and hairy than human males. Even compared to our hunter gatherer ancestors, our muscles are small. Humans sacrificed their strong jaw to be able to grow a brain large enough to survive in our modern world.

The reason humans will be more feminine is because cooperation is a more efficient survival strategy than competition, as mentioned earlier. This is especially so under agriculture. This leads to the spread of female traits, because women are more dependent upon cooperation than men. During pregnancy, women are vulnerable to predators and poorly able to autonomously gather food, and hence are dependent upon allies. For this reason, women are inherently more social than men. Male communication revolves more around sharing information that benefits our survival, while female communication revolves more around communicating for the sole purpose of forming social bonds. Hence when women talk about problems to men, they are simply seeking to form social bonds, while men are simply seeking to respond with solutions.

Agriculture requires cooperation, because during short periods of the year, a large amount of work is required that a single individual can not accomplish by himself. Harvesting and sowing are for example short periods that require a large amount of work, while large parts of the year have no work, and are hence known to us as ""holiday seasons"". This compares to hunter-gatherer life, which requires a fairly equal amount of work throughout the year and can be provided by individual humans.

In agricultural societies, intelligence is a very important trait, because intelligence enables cooperation and the formation of strong social bonds to the exclusion of others. Intelligence is less required in many (not all) hunter-gatherer societies, where tool use is not absolutely essential, and where it is possible to hunt animals by simply chasing them to exhaustion.

A large amount of land on our planet will always be unfit for agriculture, and will hence only be populated by hunter-gatherer tribes. However, the majority of humans will always live in agricultural societies, because agriculture enables far higher population densities.

Intelligence will hence be a trait that will be maintained throughout the human gene pool. The ability to entertain and manipulate people is an ability that requires high intelligence and is most useful in agricultural societies.

**The future of human reproduction**

Polygyny, one man having multiple wives, as found in certain cultures is a temporary trend in many countries. It is capable of rapidly increasing intelligence, by allowing a minority of the most intelligent men to gather all women at the cost of everyone else.

The downside of polygyny is that genetic diversity rapidly declines. Every generation, only a minority of men pass down their genes to the next generation, hence causing a decline in genetic diversity, which is very important under high population density, because disease spreads rapidly in agricultural societies when compared to other methods of food production.

Polyandry will always exist to a certain degree, but will not become very widespread, because it spreads sexually transmittable diseases that cause infertility that can not be treated without antibiotics. Polyandry will however be the most popular reproductive strategy amongst hunter-gatherers, where everyone will be able to freely mate with one another, as under low population density and small isolated tribes, sexually transmittable diseases will be rare and limited in number. 

The most widespread form of mating will be the ones that maximize genetic diversity, while keeping the spread of sexually transmittable diseases relatively low. The most popular reproductive strategy will be serial monogamy. Serial monogamy is the Western reproductive pattern. Under serial monogamy, people spend a few years with one partner. These few years can be extended if children are born, to allow the father to help raise them. Eventually, the two partners grow bored of each other, and both find new partners with whom to raise another litter.

Sexual behavior that encourages cooperation will become more likely. Examples are attraction to the same gender, which is very common amongst non-human Bonobos. Homosexuality is likely rare amongst humans when compared to Bonobo's, because amongst humans it was punished with the death penalty under many religions. It is known that amongst the Romans bisexuality was widespread, with heterosexual Roman emperors being a minority. Besides sexual attraction to the same gender, romantic attraction to the same gender will likely become very common, as it will encourage humans to be able to sacrifice themselves for those related to them. Homosexuality manages to survive in our species, because homosexuals increase the number of children that are born to their relatives. As an example directly observable to us, homosexual men understand better than heterosexual men what makes a man attractive and hence are capable of increasing the reproductive success of their male friends and siblings.

**Human speciation**

Speciation benefits an organism, because a lack of reproduction between two groups means that sexually transmittable diseases do not spread between them, and furthermore every sub-group can maintain genes that are only useful for that specific group (as an example, the Sickle cell gene is only useful to people exposed to malaria).

Amongst humans, speciation will also occur unless we rapidly go extinct, which is unlikely. There are various ways by which speciation can occur, but the most important for humans will be assortative mating.

Assortative mating means that individuals only mate with other individuals that are similar to them. Over time, this separates a species into two groups, because individuals that fall between two stereotypes and have intermediate characteristics will be unattractive to either. As an example amongst humans, being an average musician and an average military leader doesn't increase your reproductive success, while being excellent at either and horrible at the other does.

One form of speciation that is likely is speciation due to a difference in intelligence. It is already known that the most important factor to intelligent people in a mate is intelligence, and people in relationships have comparable levels of intelligence.

Hence, humans will split into different species not because we are isolated from each other, but because we will find each other *disgusting*. Humans are naturally intolerant to people who are different from them, and it takes strong social conditioning to teach people to tolerate people from other groups.

This current trend of tolerance will be temporary, and in the future, different groups will avoid conflict between each other by isolating themselves from one another.

Hence, humans will continue to dominate large areas of the planet, but we will not be the homogeneous blob that we currently represent.

He was the first to suggest that I go into engineering physics, so I made him a petition",dochoff,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/vvt6r/xpost_from_rcanada_reddit_my_high_school_physics/,"Long story short: I heard about this [whole ordeal](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/story/2012/05/31/edmonton-teacher-zeros-sheppard.html) a few days after I moved to Boston for a summer engineering internship. Given his impact on my academic path, I tried to get in touch with him, however his email was shut down immediately. Seeing him tear up during a national interview was one of the most heart-breaking things I have ever seen, and I couldn't just sit here and do nothing. 

So I made [www.bringbackdorval.com](http://www.bringbackdorval.com), posted it to r/Canada, and got over 1000 signatures in one day. I was told that posting here might provide additional support, so here goes nothing. I know he would appreciate it. 

For the skeptics: I know this is a controversial issue, and it is not nearly as black and white as the media has portrayed. My issue, however, is  that the administration has been so uncompromising in the policy's implementation - especially considering that it is based on opinion and qualitative survey responses (I have included the references provided by the school board below).

It is also worth nothing that I have received a lot of (anonymous/confidential) support from current teachers.

Edit: Formatting 

Edit: For the record, I definitely do not agree with the policy, nor do I wish to make light of workplace insubordination. However, I think when several senior teachers speak up against an untested policy, their compromises should be considered. I should also mention that other teachers are now facing suspension at the same school.

vvpwo,1,2012-07-01,How do I get things better? My Uncle and his family are a pack of douche bags and my Dad just takes it.,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/vvpwo/how_do_i_get_things_better_my_uncle_and_his/,"My Dad and his brother and Sister in law who are conservative Catholics last year we went camping at this stupid campground that the family goes to year after year and it's basically a crowded shit hole. The only reason he really goes there is because he wants to use his boat there (We live in Michigan there's more than one place to have fun with the boat)
Anycase last year and years before Dad could never get family to come over or have guests. It's always up to him to take care of my grandmother. My Grandmother should in all honesty be placed in a assisted living home) But Uncle will not stand for it. and basically says he will take care of her big surprise my Dad who is retired is obligated to do the heavy work by him. Dad has said to me countless times he's sick of driving her to doctors appointments and such. He won't stand up for himself at all or even me. My Dad when i was five years old went to Illinois to live and work and left me with my grandmother coming back to see me every other weekend. I just wanted to live with my Dad I never even visited his home in all the eight years he was away. He has gotten to the point where some days all he does is sit and play computer chess and surf online and drown himself with watching t.v. it was why we got rid of cable tv. He was watching so much tv to escape the house got put into shambles there are repairs to the house that need to be done and they won't be because he doesn't want to do them and when I do it he gets pissed.  
A little back story here since I was forming my own opinions. My uncle would basically verbally attack me for having another P.O.V. besides his. MY aunt would put pressures on me to become a baker. Why? I still don't know why. Yes I baked and decorated cakes before but that hobby made me fatter and quite frankly I enjoyed the digital arts and sciences better. I still struggle with my weight.  
I was a great college student at first. But later on when I was just going and going and going more to escape the crisis at home. I got caught in this viscus cycle of college classes at the community college that never took me anywhere. I tried to get work locally but i soon gave up because my skills in using digital editing software and Photoshop were all but depleted till I got a copy on Ebay of Adobe CS 5.5 now I'm working on an online career. 

But back to the campground last summer. No one wanted to come to our sight for a bonfire and after basically begging Aunt and Uncle came and so did my 88 year old Grandma. I was never more happy to have people visit us! But my happiness turned into sadness when no one wanted to roast marsh mellows or do anything they just sat and didn't stay longer than 15 minutes my Dad drove my Grandma back to her site at the campground. My Aunt left soon after and my Uncle stayed behind. The weird thing was my Uncle was really unnerved when he was alone with me he and I talked about sci-fi books and about Star Trek. Then as my dad slowly returned he started to get angrier and started to attack what I believed in he verbally attacked President Obama claiming he was a member of the tea party. He talked about how gays were ruining the American family on PBS and NPR where at one point I was an intern at. Then he said something that ripped my soul asunder.
He said me and my Dad were not a family because my Dad didn't remarry. 
I am trained in martial arts to control my anger and at that moment I wanted to grab my poker stick and skewer him. I at some point told him I was Bisexual and he got pissed off blamed me for the argument and grabbed his chair and ran off. I told Dad I didn't want to come out that way but it was the only way to get him to stop. 

But this afternoon was a low, low, low, blow to my Dad. My grandma's birthday was this afternoon and Uncle and aunt came over with my cousin with cake and ice cream. They called and said come at 12 we'll be here. 
We arrived earlier than we were expected as soon as we came they left. They had eaten almost all of the cake and sang Happy Birthday to my grandmother. 
I want to know what do I need to tell my Dad to make him realize these people are assholes and how can I get out of this mess? I'm pretty much running out of hope for myself. "

Okay. Now that that's out of the way, here are some facts that may help you to understand the person that I am:

I get very excited about things that some people might call mundane. My roommates consider it a running joke to mimic a time when I took a bite of a very tasty sandwich and exclaimed ""Oh, yes!"". There have been many more such instances that they like to mimic, as well.

I love to laugh. Silly things make me laugh.

I'm very bad at a few musical instruments, the latest being the harmonica. I won't make you listen. That would be cruel.

More than anything in the world, I love to act. I want to voice act some day, if the whole software engineering thing doesn't work out.

My first therapist was actually still an intern at my college campus counseling program. The program only allowed you to get 12 sessions, but she requested that I finish out the year with her because I was working so hard and they granted me permission. I think that one of the main things that I liked about her is that she was so new at it. I felt as if she and I were discovering my anxiety and how to deal with it together. She didn't have a ""right"" answer, and I liked that because I still had a bit of my ""teenage"" rebellion in me. 

So, what characteristics do you like in a therapist or psychiatrist?"

Little help please,wellbygreenbottle,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/vvbeq/21mmy_gf20f_is_a_theater_actress_and_has_to/,"Just a little background: We don't live in North America and have been in a relationship for 2 years. I'm a law student and an intern in the law area. She's studying to become an actress, but still haven't got her ""actress license"" (I forgot what's the name). I don't consider myself a close-minded person. I have black and gay friends, I smoke weed on regular basis, I'm in favor of homosexual marriage and abortion, I watch shitloads of porn, I have a few fetishes that we explore in our sexuality(but not them all sadly :P). Feel free to ask anything you'd think it's relevant.

So shes a theater student and she loves it. She's very dedicated to it and acting will probably be her professional future. She used to have acting classes as a child, then stopped, had ballet classes for a few years, and now is again studying theater and getting ready to join theater college. So after 1 year in a professional acting course, today was her premiere. Of course I was there. I had been given warning that the play had sexual content, although she didn't told me exactly what was her scene about. It involved partial nudity and a fake sex scene (both with underwear on. standing up, and quick, for about 10 secs). I thought I'd be cool with it but I'm really not. It hit me like a rock. Artistically speaking the play was nice, and she was beautiful and performed very well. But I can't get my mind of what I saw. I know I should be feeling happy for her, but I couldn't help myself and ended up showing a little of my uneasiness to her by the time I drove her home. She tried to confort me but it didn't work very well. 

TLDR: GF is actress student. today was her first play. she has to show her breasts and fake sex (with underwear). I thought I'd be ok with it but I'm not, it's killing me. 

Has anyone ever been in a similar situation? What should I do? Any tricks to help making it easier? Am I overeacting? undereacting? really, anything that could help? 

In advance, thanks very much

vv6ij,4,2012-06-30,Never take the first offer?,evergreenminty,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/vv6ij/never_take_the_first_offer/,"I am a recent 2012 grad with a masters and bachelor degrees, but no years of job experience outside of 2-3 years of internships, freelancing, and part-time jobs. I got a job offer with great benefits that I'm reasonably happy with and more than I expected. According to my background research using PayScale.com, the base salary they offered is in the 62nd percentile for my background, city and position.

The position was listed as 2-4 years experience, so I think that they were expecting to pay more to fill the position. During one interview, I was also told to expect an offer in the middle of their range and my salary research supports that information. I would ideally like to get about $2000-$4000 more than what their offering, but I don't really have any other offers as leverage. Maybe it's my natural inclination as a woman and timid personality to think that I'm being greedy; however, I'd be kicking myself if I could have gotten more money. I don't want to ask without reason.

So is it reasonable to ask based on:

* Relocating and living expenses: I'd have to move across the country to an insanely expensive city and I have a lot of student loans. Although I am not sure this is strong enough as a reason since people do manage to live there with less than I'd be making.
* They basically needed someone to start last week, so they have urgency working against them. Some other factors indicate that they had some trouble filling the position based on the skills and experience they needed, but this is my unconfirmed hunch. 
* Most of my interviews basically trying to sell me on the job and company and scheduled additional ones just so I could chat with people about the company. I'm not naive enough to think they don't have backups waiting, but I would like to think I'm their first choice.
* Since I already did my graduate degree, I won't need any tuition reimbursement or return to school after 2 years for any reason I can think of.

So Reddit, what strategies and leverage work for recent grads? Is there any truth to ""never take the first offer""? How do you get over that mental block of negotiating salary?

I hate feeling like this. Being depressed.. I know. Who likes being depressed?  No one. 
But I'm really hating it right now. I'm a 22 year old scandinavian girl, who's been diagnosed with a severe depression. I tried to kill myself once, called the suicide hotline as I was dying (cut my wrists in the shower. My phone didn't work afterwards). This was last year. I have since been diagnosed with a mild type of schizophrenia. I think I've been taking it all in strides, but lately it's been having an effect on my life. I see things, I feel like crying all the time, I can't eat, I can't sleep and worst of all I can't work. 

I thank my lucky stars that I'm scandinavian, because I get unemployment benefits from the government, but still... 

I've got a temporary internship in a lovely store close to where I live. My bosses and colleagues are great. This is what frustrates me, though. I want to do a good job, but I just can't concentrate. I see things, I have a constant lump in my throat. Why do I have to feel like this? 

I want to find a quiet place to cry and scream, but I know in my min it's neither rational nor productive. I just want to throw myself against a wall and shake off all the bad feelings. 

I try to smile and be happy. My colleagues don't know how I feel. I just wonder why it hurts so much to be happy? Seriously, what the fuck brain? 

I'm exhausted. No one suspects a thing, because I can't bring myself to say anything. 

I guess I'm just fed up with this. I just want to feel happy or ""normal"" like again...

She is ready to call it quits but we have a problem: neither of us can afford it.  There's a good chance she's already planning her exit strategy which could leave me high and dry.

History: after we had been dating for about a year, she moved into my house. We both had well-paying jobs at first. Later on, I found myself in a lower-paying job and she found herself back in university.  We had to pinch pennies, but we made it work.  And though I have shouldered the lion's share of the bills since she's been in school (she works, but part time for the school), I'm not in any position to be able to pay all the bills if she decides to leave. 

She can't afford to leave right now, but she's almost done with her internship and has a few leads on some high-paying jobs.  My gut says she's going to split as soon as that new job comes along, leaving me to barely make ends meet.

So my question is: Should I ask her to pay for *our* debt we incurred together after she leaves? Should I ask her to split it (even though I can't afford the payments on it by myself)? Or should I ask her to leave now--she can't afford it yet, but why let her stay here and let myself get hosed when she can finally afford to leave?

What should I do?,cupidatlast,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/vy8f2/need_advice_with_my_new_gf_i_dont_really_feel_a/,"I'm 26, and she's 26. We've been dating for about a month and a half now, and I don't really feel a strong connection with her. Let me elaborate below:

I was in a serious relationship before my current girlfriend for just a little over a year. It wasn't until our one year anniversary (when she didn't want to hang out with me -- mind you, we were living together) that I knew things weren't going correctly. Long story short, I ended the relationship, and spiraled into a depression due to the absolute psychotic and abusive relationship I had with this woman. It took me about a month to get over the depression, and another 2-3 months before I was really ready to start talking to other girls again. 

After 4 months of being single, I created an account on a dating website. I hit it off with one of the girls on there (my current girlfriend) and after talking to her on the phone, and via IM, we decided we should meet. 

I drove to her place (which was about 4 hours away) and we had some drinks, and ended up having a really good time. We have a pretty good amount of things in common, and it wasn't hard to keep a conversation going with her. We ended up having sex that first night. I asked her to be my girlfriend the next night. We end up having sex that night, and again in the morning, then one more time before I leave .

It wasn't until two weeks after that when I could see her again. I made the drive, and everything started off what seemed like it was great. We basically have sex the second I get in the door, go out drinking, and have sex again when I come home. At this point in time, I'm starting to feel as if sex is losing its meaning. We wake up in the morning, and have sex again (I'm reluctant, and worn out, but we end up doing it anyway).

This continues this way. Now, mind you, she doesn't have any money. I pay for literally everything. All of our drinks, all of our food, everything. She has been working this job only making $9/hr and can barely pay for her rent and car payment. This started to wear on me after the third weekend we spent together.

We've been dating now for about a month and a half and I've seen her 4 weekends of that. I have spent an ungodly amount of money on gas, food, and booze while visiting her. I feel like sex has lost its meaning. I feel like the spark wasn't really ever there, and I asked her to be my girlfriend before I really knew her. 

I have a year left of college, and I'm doing an internship now where I have a pretty good chance of getting a job offer at the end of it. I told her this, and she said that she refuses to move from the city she's currently living in. I tried to politely tell her that if I'm offered a position for 50-60k a year, I'm not just going to pass it up to possibly get a different job in her city. (I moved for my last girlfriend, and it really didn't turn out well)

Does this sound like a typical rebound relationship? I really don't want to hurt her at all. The thought of me breaking up with her, or me making her cry in general, really makes me not want to do it.

I'm so god damn confused. This is my second girlfriend... What should I do?

tl;dr - I'm not feeling the spark I think I should be with my new girlfriend. What should I do?"

The main question is after a couple paragraphs - skip there if this intro stuff bores you.

So, I'm a 20 year old AFC. At the beginning of this year I had enough of being a lonely virgin and wanted to do something about it. But when I read the guide for recovering AFCs, I realized that before I start trying to get women, I had to get my life in order first.

So I decided to not worry about learning about pickup until after I get my life in order. And for the past 6 months, I've been working on fixing myself up. I'm working on overcoming my depression, I started a bunch of awesome new hobbies, I started eating right, sleeping right, and exercising daily. I still have ways to go, but I'm getting more fit each day. 

I also started working on my crippling social anxiety. I started talking to random people in my lectures, smiling to strangers as I'm walking, making smalltalk, etc. Again, I'm far from where I want to be, but at least I am not a miserable loner locked up in my room anymore.

I was planning on reading about pickup this summer and, with my life now in order, starting approaches etc. in earnest when I get back to school in August, since for summer I'm back at my parents' place and I don't really have much of an opportunity to meet girls my age in this town.

**skip down here if you're bored - here's the main question**

I have an internship at a startup this summer, and two weeks ago a cute intern about my age started work here too. Since I'm no longer completely socially inept, I managed to talk to her and was overall pretty friendly. But I haven't read up on pickup etc., so I've just been treating her as a friend and didn't think more of it.

Last week, one of my coworkers said that this cute intern has apparently been giving me IOIs all week. I've never had any girl interested in me before, so I had no idea what to expect or look for. Even now, I don't know if my coworker is fucking with me or if this really is the case.


I know that the advice is always ""assume attraction and escalate,"" so how do I do that? Do I ask her to lunch? Do I just flat out say that I think she's cute and we should fuck?

I'm fine with getting rejected, and while she's cute and fun to be around, I definitely don't have oneitis for her. I just want to make sure that I make the most of this opportunity, and that I don't fuck this up. Any advice at all would be really appreciated!

So I was a virgin until 22. I was awkward, didn't consider myself attractive, and was vastly overweight. Then I went on a Eurotrip with a friend. Stopped by Amsterdam, and in 3 days, I went from a virgin to sleeping with 8 model quality girls. 

I came back to the states, managed to get into a relationship. After that one ended, I got into another. That one ended traumatically, and after that I had a 10 month dry spell. My solution? Coming full circle - I visited 5 more prostitutes in 4 months.

After that, I stopped because I ran myself dry. I spent 6 months worth of savings from an internship on those 5 girls. The fact that I couldn't see one again drove me crazy - I was fapping atleast 3 times a day everyday. Once I graduated and got a nice paying job (past jan), I got back to the same old habit. From Feb until April, I saw 8.

In total, of the 23 girls i've been with - 21 were prostitutes. Average price? $300/h

I spent more than $6,000 on prostitutes, and had I not been a student during that time, I'm sure that number would've at least doubled.

Since April, I stopped. I replaced it with the same habit as before - fapping 3-4 times a day. As of 3 days ago, I decided enough is enough. I'm tired of not having control over my sex life and succumbing from one addiction to another (prostitutes to porn). 

PS. The reason I haven't had a relationship since my second sexual one is due to extreme trust issues, fear, and trauma caused by it. I don't want to go too indepth but the girl had a rough life, and a craving for one of her own addictions quite literally almost got me killed in a setup (she wanted my money). That and learning afterwards of chronic cheating and a possible STD pretty much traumatized me from getting close to another girl ever since. I've seeked therapy, but it's still a work in progress

Long post and a bit all over the place, but yeah, wish me luck. Day 3 and I'm already browsing that dark expensive side of the web. I can't give in again. 

If anyone went through something similar... I would love some advice

TLDR - Traumatized by an ex who literally almost killed me, cheated on me, STD scare. Resorted to prostitutes ever since. Tried to get over it with excessive masturbation but just got addicted to porn. Now going cold turkey to try and get control over my sex life again.

EDIT - Holy shit that felt good getting off my chest"

I am starting my 5th and final year as a microbiology undergrad and have some questions about possible future career/school options, as college is definitely wearing on me and all of the people I’ve been able to speak to about microbiological careers have it sounding nothing like I expected it to be when I embarked on this venture 4 years ago.

I decided to go the MBIO route after I learned about drug resistance and superbugs. Seemed like really brilliant stuff. Unfortunately I ended up at a university that specializes in anaerobic and mostly ecological microbiology. No pathogenic strains are studied anywhere on this campus. Add to that all of the silly, seemingly-irrelevant courses I have to take every year, and I started to wonder (especially this last year) if I had gotten into the right field or not.

I want to eventually do drug research, perhaps. I want to study pathogenic strains. I don’t want to do this in an academic setting. At least I don’t think so. With how tired I’ve become of college, I was thinking it might be better for me to get a job right out of college and go back to school after I’ve had time to breathe, but it seems like only incredibly boring jobs await a BSc. Please, correct me if I’m wrong. 

Now, I don’t have the most stellar GPA. I think it is about a 3.3. But I have been working/researching in labs since freshman year. I was a student assistant freshman year in a research complex on campus for MBIO. Sophomore and junior year I was a lab tech that occasionally got to help with research in a lab in the MBIO building on my campus. The summer after my junior year I did a research internship with the College of Pharmacy doing some molecular work on a strain of streptococcus for my school’s Health Science Center campus. Instead of taking a “capstone” class for senior year for my major, I chose the thesis option and researched both fall and spring last year in a lab on my thesis project. This summer I am continuing that research under an REU grant and next year I will also do that research both semesters (likely for money as a lab tech, as I don’t need any more credit hours for this project). My PI really wants me to stay for at least an MS with him, but his lab doesn’t do the kind of research I’ve been craving. None of the labs at my school do.

I was really starting to hate microbiology until this summer. Full time research is where it’s at, I think. I am able to actually focus and think through my project and make progress; it was slow-goings during the school year. Anyway, I haven’t taken the GRE or even looked into any grad schools because I got so jaded about all of it for a while, but I think I’d like to go, and I’d really like to eventually end up in industry or, preferably, the government sector working on superbugs. 

My questions for you are: 
1.	How do I get there?
2.	Is getting there even possible?
3.	What steps should I take from here if it is?
4.	How hard would it be to get into grad school if I’ve made C’s in Molecular Bio, Biochemistry, and Organic Chemistry? (It is hard for me to be motivated for lecture-based classes. I learn when I experience things, and l my lab grades are much higher.)

I want to have hope that my job of working on superbugs is possible one day. But the microbiologists around here make me feel like there aren’t any jobs at all. 

Sorry for the long post!

This winter I tried to get an internship but I never passed the psychometric tests stage. I am simply scared that I will never get a job in my industry (accounting, all the applications are for a charted accountant training contract) just because I can't seem to be able to improve my score on these tests (especially the numerical ones).

I have a good math background, but obviously I am doing something wrong  when approaching these type of tests since I can't seem to finish them on time.

I know that I should ""practice, practice, practice"", but apart from this do you have any experience or advice/tips how to approach them when practicing? Do you know any good books I should read or any particular tests I should practice?

For example, for standard SHL test of 20 questions in 20 minutes (or 15 question in 20 minutes, I don't remember exactly) how do you get to do one question in 1 minute? Sometimes there is too much to calculate or you don't get the question from the first reading. Any tips or shortcuts I should know?

I'm just a beginner at piano, and from what I've read it is essential to get a teacher if one is serious about improving.

However, I am only in my current city for an internship which ends in late August.  Is it worth it to try to find a teacher when we will only be able to have ~6 lessons together?  I really want to learn, and can probably devote 2 hours a day to practice.  But I feel like to get the most out of lessons, you really need to connect with the teacher and that may not be possible in such a short timeframe.  So, can anybody offer some advice or experiences?

Thank you very much!!

PS: I found [this list](http://www.pianoteachers.com/) of teachers.  Can anybody vouch for the quality of the list?

PPS: If anybody can give me a recommendation for a teacher in the Seattle/Bellevue area, that would be incredible.

What kind of stuff do trees help you with?,[deleted],trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/vxvxh/my_recent_lack_of_trees_has_killed_my_creativity/,"So back at University I would smoke pretty much everday after I was done with whatever work I needed to get done that day. I keep a keyboard in my room, so when I was [5]+ I would jam out for hours a day. I'm big into classical music too. I used to practice more challenging pieces as a break from studying. By the time I got home for the summer, I had memorzied 4 pieces of higher level classical music, made 3 songs, and got pretty good at jamming out in different chord progressions and doing a little jazz improv. Needless to say, my old piano teacher from back home was impressed as I wasn't all that special of a student through middle/high school (but average).

Now I'm out of my hometown and college town doing an internship for the summer. I brought my keyboard with me, but the problem is I don't play as much as I used to. I kind of lost that spark to play because I used to play so much after blazing. The root of the problem is not that I'm getting drug tested, it's that I just don't know where to get trees from. I don't know anybody in this town except for the people I work with, and I'm not willing to risk asking them because.. job. It really sucks though because I love piano and I'll still play for a little every day or every other day, but I remember when I used to sit there for a few hours, blaze up again, and then play some more before bed.

vxsyy,4,2012-07-02,Motherboard will not recognize new SSD with SATA operation set to AHCI,DFP_,24hoursupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/24hoursupport/comments/vxsyy/motherboard_will_not_recognize_new_ssd_with_sata/,"I've been in contact with Dell and Samsung about this for about a month on and off now, but I'm still completely in the dark about this.  My laptop is a Dell XPS L701x with 6 GB RAM and an i7-Q740 processor, it contains 2 HDD bays.  I've updated the BIOS and all drivers to their latest versions.  What happens is after installing the SSD (Samsung 830 series 64 GB) in the second bay when I turn on my computer with SATA operation set to AHCI mode, BiOS claims that the second HDD bay is empty.  When I boot with SATA operation set to ATA the drive dose appear in the second HDD slot in BiOS, but attempting to boot into Windows 7 installed on the primary HDD in ATA mode results in a BSOD (the computer turns off before I can read the error message).  Booting into Ubuntu when it was installed on the same HDD worked, and hardinfo also recognized the SSD, but trying to install Ubuntu to the SSD resulted in the system crashing.

What I've tried so far:

**Switching the slots of the drives:**
Impossible.  I tried this early on and found that one of the screws securing the bracked holding the primary HDD to the laptop was stripped before I got to it.  I can't remove it.

**Testing the SSD in another computer**:  Can't.  This is the only computer I own, none I can borrow, I'm in a new town for the summer doing an internship and don't know anyone here who would let me borrow their computer and test the drive out.

**Updating SSD firmware**:  The Samsung SSD Magician that came with the SSD fails, since it doesn't recognize the SSD is installed.  I tried to update from a bootable USB in ATA when the drive was recognized, but the UI was bizzare.  I could read Samsung in the corner of the screen, but the rest of the text was replaced with green bars on a black backdrop.  I can try doing this again.

Additional Notes:  Dell customer service rep said once that the minimum size of a HDD that can be recognized by this system is 256 GB.  I know this to be a complete lie due to the many reports on notebookreview of individuals running just fine with a 128 GB SSD.  I'm a little concerned that my BiOS can't recognize 64 GB sized SSDs, but Crucial guarantees that their SSD of the same size of my Samsung SSD is compatible with my system.

Specs:

* Dell XPS L701x i7-Q740 6 GB DDR3 RAM, 500 GB 7200 RPM HDD in primary drive

* 64 GB Samsung 830 series Solid State Drive

I'm 22 and I'll finish my bachelor's degree in Statistical Sciences by the end of the year and I found out I pretty much hate it (I mean, I like the mathematical and the programming parts, but, as I found out, it is near impossible to find a job where I'll use it).

I have a great interest in CS, and I actually was accepted in a university in this course, bud I didn't register because...well, because I was a rebel, I guess.

So I guess I have 2 options:

1. Pursue a master's degree in Statistics, maybe trying to find a intersection between CS and Statistics (while I do realise this intersection exists, and is a quite big one, I'm not in the US nor Europe (I'm in Brazil, if that matters), so finding a place where I can pursue this area of research is hard, especially coming form the Statisticas side).

2. Try to pursue a second bachelor's degree, this time in CS, starting it  at 23, probably finishing at 27, 28 (I would be able to cut many math credits). I would be damn afraid to start job hunting at this age in a field that I have no professional experience.

I am actually considering doing both at the same time, but maybe that's too much.

Heroes and Villains

It's a bird, it's a plane, it's….a work of art? Although the art here may not look like that in comic books, that doesn't mean it isn't riddled with superheroes and supervillains alike. Quick! Grab a cape, and take our ""tour in tights""!

Figure
Central Africa, Democratic Republic of the Congo, late 9th-mid 20th century
Wood, lizard skin, leopard tooth, seed pods, cloth
Date: late 1800s-mid 1900s

Before visiting some of the darker characters on this tour, be sure to seek protection.

Although it may not seem like the best defense, this figure was once used as protection against witches and other evil forces. Carved by the Yaka people, these wooden figures are containers for magical medicines known as biteki. Biteki is made by a ritual specialist, who gives it the capacity either to cure or to harm. Once the medicine is created, it is activated by rubbing it onto the surface of the sculpture, inserting it into a cavity made in the body, or keeping it in a bag that hangs from the body. After the sculpture has been anointed, the ritual specialist then uses it to determine if a curse has been placed on the client. (638)

Scene with Witches: Morning, Day, Evening, Night
Salvator Rosa (Italian, 1615-1673)
Oil on canvas
Date: c. 1645-1649

Bubble, bubble, toil and trouble are sure to be found in these four paintings of witches.

The practice of witchcraft had existed for many years, but in early modern Europe, new systems of belief led to mass hysteria, with people accusing others of being witches and often going on literal witch-hunts which ended in executions. In the following paintings of witches at different hours of the day, the witches are shown engaging in rituals and practicing black magic. Among the recognizable paraphernalia are cauldrons, wax voodoo dolls, toads, skeletons, five point stars, the seal of Solomon, owls, and a witch carrying a broom. All of these are signs still associated with witchcraft today. (603)


Apollo and Daphne
Massimiliano Soldani (Italian, 1656-1740)
Terracotta
Date: c. 1700

Some people will go to extreme lengths for love, even if it means tapping into their dark side. 
	
Apollo, the Greek god of the sun, found himself on the path to becoming a villain after mocking the weaponry of Eros, the Greek god of love. Growing tired of Apollo's teasing, Eros decided to teach him a lesson. Eros had two types of arrows in his quiver: golden arrows, meant to kindle the flames of love, and leaden arrows, meant to incite hate. He shot one golden arrow into Apollo and another leaden arrow into the nearby nymph, Daphne. Apollo immediately fell in love with Daphne. Daphne, who had received the leaden arrow, felt nothing but contempt and disgust for Apollo and ran away from him whenever he came near. Daphne, out of breath from the chase, cried for help from her father, the river god Peneus. As Apollo caught up to her, Peneus transformed her into a laurel tree with branches and roots sprouting from her body.  (835)

Console table
Italy, probably Rome, late 17th-early 18th century
painted and gilded wood, marble top
Date: c. 1700

With great power comes great responsibility; no one knows that better than Chronos, the Greek personification of time. 

Crouching beneath this console table, he is shown here in his human form, as an old man carrying a scythe and hourglass. In his true form he is much more intimidating, as he is a serpent with three heads: one of a bull, one of a man, and one of a lion. While he is not formally associated with any particular myth, he is credited with being responsible for the divisions of the past, present, future and eternity. So is he a hero or a villain? It's difficult to say. Given the immensity of the power he holds, he is certainly a force to reckon with, as he can easily manipulate time and cause all kinds of temporal destruction. (628)

Oedipus at Colonus
Fulchran-Jean Harriet (French, 1778-1805)
Oil on canvas
Date: 1798

Unlike the other villains on this tour, poor Oedipus never had much of a choice as to whether or not he would become one. 

Before Oedipus was even born, an oracle prophesied that he would kill his father and marry his mother. Determined not to let that happen, his father, king of Thebes, abandoned him on a hillside, where he was found, and adopted by the king and queen of that kingdom. Eventually, figuring out he had been adopted, he consulted an oracle to find his true birth parents. The oracle, rather than telling him who his parents were, told Oedipus about the prophecy. To prevent the prophecy from being fulfilled, Oedipus traveled far from home all the while searching for his parents. Along the way he got into an argument with a man and killed him. Unbeknownst to Oedipus, the man was his birth father, thus fulfilling the first part of the prophecy. Continuing his journey he approached the kingdom of Thebes and defeated a sphinx. The people of Thebes were very grateful and gave him the hand of the recently widowed queen, his mother, thus fulfilling the second part of the prophecy. Many years later when he discovered what he had done to his parents, he blinded himself and left the kingdom of Thebes, never to return. (1115)

Armor for Man and Horse with Vols-Colonna Arms
North Italy, 16th century
Steel
Date: c. 1575

Finally, for the last stop, who would make a more fitting hero than a knight to escort a museum visitor home?

Knights, in addition to being skilled fighters, were also expected to follow a chivalric code. The chivalric code ruled their day to day life and determined their religious, moral and social conduct both on and off of the battlefield. Knights were expected to uphold the values of faith, loyalty, courage and honor. They would help the weak, defend the defenseless, and treat ladies and lords alike with respect. The chivalric code was deeply embedded in medieval culture and the ideals of chivalry were well-publicized in poems, ballads, writings and other literary works of the time. (586)"

_____  
I'm fairly bad at starting things out, but here goes. I'm Canada-born,  Texas-raised, 19 years of age, a man, and (despite the surrounding caustic Christian environment) I am an atheist. 

It's funny because I became an atheist around the age of 10 kind of... suddenly. Originally, I was Catholic, *very* Catholic. I prayed every night for my family's safety and the safety of my pets Emma (who passed last June) and Kitty (who got hit by a car 10 years ago), I attended Sunday church and Mass every day I got the chance. Then, when I turned 7, I read about the Holocaust. After that, I still believed in God, just that he didn't give a flying fuck about us. Then one day,  I just woke up and felt that there wasn't a god. A few years later, I found that I was openly and unabashedly calling myself ""atheist"" in public despite the overwhelmingly cloying air of ignorance and intolerance that purveys most of Texas. A few times I was called a Satanist, a few times I was called a Communist, and more than a few times I was called an asshole. The first two came as no surprise to me because, again, I live in Texas, but the asshole comment always stepped in my egg salad. I've been tolerant of everyone my whole life. I've even been tolerant of the people who tell me I'm going to burn in Hell for all eternity because I don't believe in their particular version of the magic sky daddy. Even when I was 7 and people were telling me I was going to burn in Hell just for asking *too many questions* I was tolerant. The only time I've ever been intolerant is when somebody calls me stupid over a subject I know very much about or when I feel like making a joke.

As another component to the backstory of my journey to atheism, I am the offspring of a wedlocked couple composed of an abusive drunk and a self-deprecating and very loving mother. I am bisexual and open to any kind of love. I don't give two shits what people do in this life and I don't give two shits about what they believe they'll do in the next. My friend once asked me why I became an atheist and I couldn't answer him immediately. It had just been who I was for so long, I forgot why I became one. The following list is something I made more for myself, so I never forget all of the reasons I became an atheist. So I never try and relapse into the drug that is religion. 

Reason's I became an Atheist in order of impactfulness:


* 1.The Holocaust- When I use this term, I'm not just referring to ""The Holocaust,"" (although that one played the biggest role), I'm referring to every genocide that's ever been recorded. It's just a standard ""If there was a God or what-have-you, why did so many people have to die?"" After reading Elie Wiesel's *Night*, I was utterly convinced that if there was a God, he just didn't give a *fuck* about any of us.
* 2. My Family- My mother is amazing. She is the most fantastic woman I've ever met. She doesn't care that I am an atheist, she doesn't care about my lovers or girlfriends/boyfriends, she doesn't care about any of that. *She just cares that I am her son*. So why did she have to marry that Irish piece of shit who physically abused her? Because of God's unholy judgement. Without the influence of my Great Grandma (RIP), who had a profound impact on my mother's life because her mother got hit by a truck, she wouldn't of had to marry my deadbeat, fuckhead sperm-donor. I could have been, and basically was, raised solely by the morals that governed my mother. He was just there to remind her that she was a woman and he was a man. Currently, I am best friends with my mother (who was 20 when she had me, roughly a baby herself) and I have disowned my father, who I now call ""Chris"" and haven't spoken to in 4 years. My last conversation was ""Can I have some help paying for college?"" to which he responded ""You sound like your mother."" I immediately removed him from every social networking site I am a part of. I don't plan on attending his funeral and I wish he would die sooner rather than later. I'm always waiting for my Grandmother to text me on Facebook saying ""Your father got raped by a bobcat and died of internal bleeding yesterday. He's dead."" So that I can immediately do the touchdown dance. As for my mother, she's married to her soulmate and in one of the happiest relationships I have ever seen. I can't wait to have what she has one day.
* 3. Death- I used to believe that when you died the place you went to when you died depended on your actions no matter what and that it depended on your religion. It was one of the more tolerant views that I've ever heard of. I still held this view 6 years ago when I was 13. Now I believe that this life is the only one that you have and that you shouldn't waste it. In the past 2 years, I have had many different sexual partners, many different kinds of hallucinogenic drugs, many parties, and many wonderful and many shitty friends. I have lived my life more in those two years than I could have hoped for. It's actually gotten to the point where I'm ready to have kids and settle down as soon as I finish college at Colorado School of Mines. I honestly feel I have lived a life worth living and I'm only 19. I don't impose this life on anyone and I'm not suggesting everyone should ""go do drugz, it r life better maker.""
* 4. Pot- I have smoked pot since I was 12 years old. I recently had to quit because I got an internship and they do random drug testing here in the states. It *always* got me thinking about religion and, well, just about everything. I'd grab a bag of cheetos or dorritos, munch away, and just... ponder. It has been a main source of inspiration and feeling for me and my current girlfriend/boyfriend's feelings toward it greatly affect my relationship with them, the same as their religious outlook.
* 5. The People- I don't have to tell you how stupid some people sound when they talk about the past. About history. Scientific evidence is normally visible proof that leads and points to a significant discovery. When I read ""Science is just like religion, no facts"" or its equivalent I shit a brick. I don't want to be grouped with people I consider to be clinically retarded, so I jumped off that bandwagon as soon as possible.
* 6. My Kids- My entire life, I've wanted a kids. Specifically, a raven-haired daughter named Violet. I want these kids to grow up unabashed and in a manner they see fit. If they want to practice LaVeyan Satanism, that's fine. That's their choice and I'll love them for it. I'd even permit all of the ""ground-grown"" drugs such as shrooms and pot. That's fine, I did them all the time from 12-18 (I'd tell them 16-18 until they were much much older though). If I were Catholic or any other religion, I'd basically be required to make them be that religion. Atheism doesn't really hold that above their heads.
* 7. The Various Religions- There's so many religions in the world, why choose any at all? That's my view and that may end up being my kid's view, but I'd rather not waste time beating a dead horse (not the saying, I'm pretty sure that's a custom of some religion somewhere).
* 8. My Profession- I'm going into a scientific profession, Engineering. I've known this since I was 5. I decided, then and there, that I would adopt a scientific mindset.  As we all know, science and religion hardly go hand-in-hand.
* 9. Rebellion- I have, since I was very young, had a ""fuck the establishment"" kind of attitude. I openly advocated gay rights and religious freedom when I was 8. I lived in suburbian half-rural Texass, so this was... frowned-upon. Most of the adults were like ""Oh, he doesn't know what he's talking about, he's 8."" This infuriated me more than anything in the world. The assumption that because one is young, one knows nothing. I knew more about the world than most of the people here know about *cereal*. When I became an atheist, it was also to say ""fuck you, fuck you, and fuck you"" to everybody who gave a shit.

There are more, but they're not coming to mind immediately.

Thanks for reading if you read. If you have questions I'll be happy to answer them.

TL;DR: My mom's awesome, genocide is bad, my biological father is a piece of garbage, everyone dies, people are stupid, I'm fairly tolerant regardless, forced marriage sucks, I used to smoke pot, I want kids some day who make their own choices, I'm bi, I'm going into Engineering, there are too many religions, I'm somewhat rebellious, I feel more grown up than I should, I'm somewhat pretentious, and this TL;DR is getting TL.

vx8db,26,2012-07-02,Not My Best Summer,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/vx8db/not_my_best_summer/,"Hey Reddit, been debating for a while and I guess I just want to write this out to feel better I suppose, any advice or comment would be appreciated.

This summer has simply been awful for me. I am a pretty optimistic and positive guy, but even this summer has been taking its toll. To start off, I am in an internship in Iowa, and am currently about 4 hours away from anyone I know. I thought coming in that it would be a great opportunity to meet people and have a lot of fun, NOT! All I do is work from 7 until about 5, go home and stay to myself for the whole week. There are about 60 interns and I only work with 3 and do not hang out with any of them. Everyone is from Iowa, so they all just go home after work and hang out with buddies. Here I am all alone and starting to realize I don't like the work at all.

Then comes my grandmother getting sick in another country, and my dad has to fly off to take care of her. He missed Father's Day and my Birthday, and I am paying half the bills at home since things are pretty tight and have been for a long time now. I am constantly worried both of them are ok and it just wears on my mind.

Lastly my girlfriend of about half a year decides to break it off right before I start my internship. We were fine when we left school (She was a senior, I was a sophomore at the time), and she was coming back for Grad School so I thought all would be well. Suddenly she said things didn't feel right for her or something along those lines. I am fucking mad. I know she just graduated and friends left and all that, but I see no reason to fucking leave me too! I know she is afraid of commitment and all but GIVE ME A FUCKING BREAK! You don't play someone up all that time, not see them for 2 weeks, and then say it doesn't feel right anymore. She trusted me and I was perfect and yada yada yada, forget you...

In the end, I realize my summer would still suck even if she was with me, and I understand it was hard for her to do that. I know she cared deeply for me and put a lot of thought into it. I feel like when everything is crazy in her life, she doesn't know what to do. Still hurts though man. First girl I really felt was right and now it all suddenly is gone. I am a really outgoing and positive guy, but for once I feel this UTTER sense of being completely alone and I can do nothing to help my situation. I sit at my apartment and just count the days off until I am back at school (I attend in another state).

In the end, this makes me a way stronger person, and I have a TON to look forward to. In the end, but for now it really sucks.

Happy 20th birthday to me, huh? Thanks everyone for listening/reading.

vx7oc,3,2012-07-02,Should I question where our relationship is going... I am picking up mixed signals.  ,MrJotJotts,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/vx7oc/should_i_question_where_our_relationship_is_going/,"-Have been hanging out with a certain girl more and more as of late. I have been picking up subtle signals from her sporadically. Don't know if she playing me with her woman ways, or is she testing the waters? -Women readers, would a upfront, mature, logical, and calm Q&amp;A session and ""where is this going"" type of relationship talk be appreciated? Would it ruin a friendship if this is just a shot in the dark? Would such a conversation show confidence and tip the scale in a man's favor?  





**[Background *long post*]**





-I am a 26M, she is a 27F (Now known as ""L""), and we have known each other for nearly 7 years now. In recent months I have been at home and waiting for a internship to start this summer. We have hung out more in my down time, with no school, and just recently I have been getting some murky signals that I don't want to test and ruin a friendship. She is a great mother to a 4 year old son (Now known as ""K"") with a ex boyfriend who still gets the kid every weekend. Dad seems like a decent guy, kind of a goof-up but does well with the kid and gives L money every week for the kid. Im cool with him, we have gotten along the few times we've meet.





-L is kind of ""one of the guys"" if you will. She hangs out with mostly guys, likes hockey, drinks beer, swears like a sailor, only a few close female friends because in her words ""Bitches hate me. I don't get along with other girls"". So we have hung out with our 4 person group (my 2 closest friends, her and I) pretty regularly over the past 7 years and all 4 of us are drinking buddies since I was 21. From day 1 of meeting L I always had a tad of goof-ball flirt going on with her. She is physically a mid to high 8, personality probably a solid 7. I am a 6'1"" big guy, XL shirt wearing lumberjack style, physical apearance maybe about a 7 (my face is symmetrical and i am no hideous c.h.u.d.). So the playful flirting was always just a joke to me, I was trying to level up my 'speech' and started forcing myself to speak with more confidence in any and all interactions. But always a gentleman.





*This pretty much sets the groundwork for why I don't want to let this go on and get hurt (foreshadowing), and also not to fuck up a great friendship.





-About 3 months ago everyone went to the bar and had a few drinks with the group. I drove L because she lives less than a mile from my place and she has no car. We all drink, be merry, I keep it to 2 beers over 3 hours, she had about 6, and I drove us home. She invited me in for a night cap beer. While I am not looking for anything sexual with this girl at the moment... Man instinct kicked in and was out of the car before she was. We had a beer and fell asleep spooning on the couch watching reruns of friends. We wake up like 2 hours later, and she says shes got to get to work in the morning and she is going to sleep in her bed. She said that I could stay the night since it was late and no need to drive home. Im fine with it, and nestle into the couch. She turns back and asks if I was going to sleep in the bed with her. Again Man instinct shot me off the couch and walking towards her and the bedroom.





-We end up spooning and falling asleep. I am a gentleman and did not try to slip any moves more than the spoon, mainly because I knew we both had to be up in less than 5 hours. Though I slept like shit with a wandering mind. She wakes up in the morning, gets ready for work while I sleep in her bed. I leave and her friend drives her to work.





-Another time after that... bored out of our minds the group ended up meeting up at a karaoke bar and whooped it up. I, not the biggest of drinkers anymore, keep a slow and steady pace and finish with water and we end up closing out the bar. L has had many to drink and I again end up taking her home. I follow her in to use the restroom and she changes into PJs for bed. End of the night wind down with a water and watching the TV with her for a min. She is kind of giving me bed room eyes and hinting that she is le tired and going to bed soon. She walks down the hall and our buddy who was at the bar with us walks in the front door. IDK what it was about... but the realization was setting in that I may have just gotten cock blocked. Being the safety mom she is, she offers our buddy a spot of the couch or I offer the empty bed at my house (20 miles closer than his house) because he wasn't really in a shape to drive. We all chilled and I told him I would leave and he would and L could sleep. While we were leaving I was getting puppy dog eyes, a very long hug, a ""Goodnight, love you"", and a ""this-fucking-guy-busting-in-drunk-now-im-sad"" look on her face with a wave goodbye. I txt her back to see if she wanted me to come over... nothing (next morning she found out the phones lost and we recover it the next day).





**[Recent]**

-We have been hanging out and I have tried to brush the encounters off as drunken attraction. But have been hanging out with her and her kid more too. The kid looks up to me a bit I suppose and digs me because we will all play around when I am visiting and he is there. I start to get the feeling that she was testing me hanging out with the kid. I don't mind visiting and having something to do on boring days, so its been welcomed.  And then comes the kill joy. Today my whole family invites K and L to pool party bbq at my aunts house.





-I'm not one to violate privacy, but this was unavoidable. She went to change the kid and I looked down to see her phone buzzing with a txt msg. IPhone lock screen message preview lights up and two msgs display ""pssst"" and ""I miss your lips pressing against mine"". I look away and don't say anything and just kind of was bummed the rest of the day and I don't know why. There was no confirmed status change between us and other then a few nights i slept over nothing ever happened between us.





-I've really wanted to keep this on the DL since we are all going to a wedding this weekend and staying in a hotel as my date. (this wedding is my group buddies sisters wedding, crashing it kinda).  I don't want to ruin anything before hand so I'm biting my tongue until this wedding is over to potentially save from ruining a fun time.





-I am not one to play games in  relationship any more, past girlfriends kind of screwed me over so I try to be upfront and honest about everything now a days.  I am thinking about asking her a few questions about us to see where this is going after the wedding on the drive home.  I mainly would like to get a straight answer about what is going on between us so I don't start getting too attached to the kid and also start developing any other feelings for her on any other level then friends.  





**TL;DR: Been hanging out with long time friend more often, and she has recently been confusing me with her woman signals.  Don't know if I have/had a shot, or she is playing me.  Plan on talking to her after a wedding we are all going to this weekend as not to awkward up a fun time. **

vx6iz,18,2012-07-02,I am a college student looking to get into IT; I could use some career advice,HeyGirlsItsPete,ITdept,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITdept/comments/vx6iz/i_am_a_college_student_looking_to_get_into_it_i/,"Hey everyone, I've been posting all over Reddit about IT stuff recently. I am 21 years old and will be a senior in college come September. I should graduate after this year and I will have a degree in Information Technology &amp; Informatics with a minor in English.

Anyway I've been thinking about careers a lot and looking at jobs (I didn't land an internship unfortunately) and I have a lot of questions about the IT field. If you guys could help me with them, that'd be great.

1. I think I want to be a sysadmin, because I like setting up tech stuff and watching it all work together. I also think it'd be a job where I get to do a bunch of things and learn a lot. However, is this a really viable career where I can continually find advancement in my career and increases in responsibility and pay? 

2. For the sysadmin position, what is the logical career path? I ask this because I don't want to graduate college and work at like a Best Buy or something just to work up at the position as a sysadmin. Are there more common entry-level jobs for sysadmins or is it suggested I start at helpdesk or something?

3. I'm not a really technically inclined guy; I've always liked computers and I'm not necessarily afraid to play around with them, but I'm definitely not a genius or a hardcore PC person. For example, the other day I bought and set up a router for my girlfriend's family and while I understood a lot of what the advanced settings were (ports, DNS, etc), I didn't really know what to do with them. I see tons of people on reddit and even in college that know basically every intricate detail of computers and spend all day optimizing this and installing custom OSes into that and I feel way behind, especially for someone with a technical degree. Will this be a real problem or would the IT knowledge be more on the site stuff? I don't want to be the idiot in the company who doesn't know anything and people have to babysit.

4. My IT&amp;I degree is not very specialized; I have taken a class on Java, Python, I'll take one on SQL, some tech management classes, Oracle, etc. However, nothing really goes in depth there, it's all introduction to IT topics. Is that a bad thing? If it is, is there a way to improve upon a general, ""surface"" IT education?

5. If you had to give one important piece of advice to someone interviewing for their first IT positions, what would you say?



Thank you everyone for any help :)"

My girlfriend and I have been dating for two years. In these two years, we've seen each other almost everyday because we attend the same university. We hung out together on the weekends and were seldom apart. In May 2011, which was roughly a year ago, we decided to move in together.


We've experienced our fair share of fights and disputes that often ended in emotional explosions, but overall our relationship is happy. Although neither of us are super clingy, I want to emphasize the fact that we were rarely apart in these last two years.


Mid-June, I moved to China from Canada to start my internship that will last 2.5 months until the very end of August. We said our goodbyes and we were sad to be apart, but neither of us were super upset. I thought it wouldn't be a big deal initially because 2.5 months is only 10 weeks, which isn't a very long time at all.


It's been 2.5 weeks since I arrived in Shanghai. My girlfriend is doing fine in Canada and we skype and talk every few days. But lately I have been feeling really down. I guess you don't really know how valuable someone is to you until you're away from that person for a good while. I feel like my emotional stability is taking a turn for the worse. The humid/hot weather here, my stressful and often exhausting work and the fact that I barely know anyone in this city makes me awfully homesick. I miss my girlfriend a LOT. Walking back from work today, I found myself tearing up.


I know our current long-distance relationship pales in comparison with some of yours, reddit, but what advice do you have for me to pass the next 8 weeks or so without my girlfriend? How do I cope?


To provide some more context, I'll give you a rundown of my day. I wake up in the morning around 7am, get to work around 8am. I eat lunch at noon and then leave work around 6pm, eating dinner on the way home. After I'm home, I work out while watching TV and then read or browse the internet until I fall asleep. Sometimes at night I talk to my girlfriend, but I don't want her to wake up early all the time to talk to me (she has to wake up at 6am to talk to me). I'm sure that time will pass faster if I make some friends, but the culture and langauge barriers look mighty tall at this point. I'm pretty introverted.


Any help, tips, etc. are appreciated!"

I've all but completed the units required for my major in Criminology (one unit left, whee!), and have my other major in Human Rights Theory and an elective sequence to complete. I would really like to get involved in some kind of internship - partially because I know it will look great on a CV, but mostly because I don't want to wait until my honours year to continue my studies in criminal justice issues. I love this field of study, I want to immerse myself in it as fully as possible and I know this is what I want to do with the rest of my life.

So I'm wondering whether anybody knows of any institutions within Australia that would be willing to offer a student of Criminology some kind of work experience or internship? I know I want to work in law reform or enforcement once I finish my undergraduate degree (and possibly postgraduate qualifications), so anything pertinent to that would be amazing.

While I'm in Victoria, I'd be willing to spend half a year or so saving up enough money to spend some time interstate to work with a relevant institution, because I know it's an investment well worth my time!

Reddit, what should I do?",[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/vx39z/i_have_just_finished_my_first_year_in_college/,"Title says it all. I grew up in the church, a faith-based family, and was very active in my youth group during middle school and high school. Late in my high school years, I decided upon college and my vocation choice. I just finished my first year of college with an intended ministry major, and I have several deep relationships and connections at a very expensive private Christian school. I also have a wide variety of experience in this field, especially for my age. My entire church and family is supportive and excited for my future plans, it'd really stink to go out at all, let alone with the reason that I don't believe in anything anymore. 

On the flip side, I just recently (few months) got broken up with by my long-term girlfriend who also shares my faith values. Am I maybe just going through a phase right now with all that's going on? I would rather I didn't feel like this, and would choose so if I could. However, I know I need to deal with all of this: I just don't know how.

Reddit, I'm lost. Given my ""type"" of friends, I feel there are only a few people I could talk to without feeling judged. Of those few people, I feel that 100% of them would be disappointed in my unintentional doubts. On top of all this, I currently am IN an internship, in charge of discipling and teaching others. It feels wrong, but what else can I do? I feel stuck.

I understand that some of you (or most of you) may not know where I'm coming from or have ill conceptions about faith, but I would appreciate your positive advice in anyway you can give it.

So Reddit, what do you think? Do I stay in school? Switch my major? What would I tell my family and others? Do you think what I'm feeling is a real switch in my beliefs? Or will time wash this over? Or do I need more time to tell one way or the other?"

Some questions (no spoilers... kinda)

- Why does Mackenzie not know how to send an email?

- Why is Maggie (previously an intern from 2 minutes ago?) the one to do a pre-interview for the main guest?

- What is going on with Jim and Maggie? Did they sleep together between episode 1 and 2? Because two people who just started working together don't act like this.

- Why is Neil once again a source of information and comedy instead of being a fully flushed out character?

It is definitely preachy at times, but I give Sorkin the license to be preachy just as long as it's well crafted writing. This episode wasn't. Even by your normal CSI, Law &amp; Order, and Grey's Anatomy television drama writing standards, this episode was all over the place and the characters were 1 dimensional. I really hope Newsroom doesn't go the same route as ['Studio 60'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_60_on_the_Sunset_Strip) did... we'll know for sure if there is a 'bomb threat to the building' episode near the end of this season."

After zero success with my first degree (English) I humbly ask for any and all advice on how best to return to school and begin a new degree, computer science. Since I'm bound by my area, I'd like to attend [Villanova University.](http://csc.villanova.edu/)

There are a few things I'd like to address:

1. **Previous Credits:** I am not an incoming freshman. I'm not a transferring student either. And, since I'm trying for something completely outside of my first major, there's no way I'd go straight into a Graduate Program. How, exactly, does someone apply for a second degree?

2. **Computer Science Major:** I'm immensely intrigued by programming. I see it as its own language, the only one that literally transforms words and imagination into products. It's like talking things into existence. Is my excitement justified, or merely glorified? Could I be on the cutting edge of innovation, or will I likely be shoved onto a stuffy cubicle farm?

3. **Computer Science Job Market:** I hear the statistics. Unemployment is up and corporations are outsourcing. I get it. What, though, could I realistically expect coming out of school? Assuming I intern while taking classes, how good are my chances to land a decent job?

4. **The College Experience:** I feel like I ""missed out"" on something my first round at college. I didn't join a sorority or participate in any of the activities I love, like singing and swimming. Part of me wants to return to school for strictly business, but the other part wants to try these things out too. Mind, I'm almost 25-- would that matter/ be creepy?

5. **Financial Aid:** Since I've already attended a four-year college (and racked up a decent sum in loans, &gt;20k), how likely am I to receive financial aid? How and when would I begin requesting assistance? To those who kept a part-time job during school, was it worth it? Or should someone concentrate solely on school?

vwxrc,2,2012-07-02,Looking for advice on when to graduate,[deleted],LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/vwxrc/looking_for_advice_on_when_to_graduate/,"Hi r/lawschool.  I’m looking for some advice.  I have 14 credits left to finish my degree.  I have been going part time since I started.  My school has an average ranking and my class rank is average.    

I have 2 options and want to see what people here think.  I could just continue part time and finish up next May and take the July bar exam or I could switch to full time and finish this fall semester and take the bar next February.  I see positives and negatives to both options (explained below).

My main concerns are my long term career and passing the bar exam.  I was working in a paying accounting job part time while in school.  My undergrad degree is in accounting.  I left there and have been doing unpaid internships for school credit and to have some legal experience on my resume.  The combination of the legal job market, my school rank and class rank means it is pretty likely that I could be going back to accounting when I go back to working full time.  I would like a legal job, but there do not seem to be many of those around.

If I stay part time, I could try to find another legal job for the fall semester and potentially beyond that.  At this point, I really can’t afford another non-paying one though.  If that doesn’t work, I am fairly confident that I could get an accounting job starting in the busy season in January.  I would have 3 or 4 credits left to take in the spring semester and then take the bar exam in July.  

My concern about this plan is that, if I went back to accounting, I would be looking for a full time job since I would only have those few credits left.  But that would mean I would have to study for the bar and work full time come next July.  I am worried that might be too much.  I don’t want to set myself up to potentially not have the time or be too tired to study and not pass the bar the first time.  I believe that I would have to take the MPRE again if I don’t pass the bar the first time, since I took it in August 2011.

The other way, going full time and finishing in December, would mean that I might not be able to find a part time legal job that would fit into my school schedule.  It would also mean that I would take the bar exam at the end of February.  If I just study for that, then I possibly wouldn’t be able to find an accounting job since busy season would be more than half over.  

I would like to just be done with school, which makes me like this plan.  But I also feel like it could be rushing to finish my credits, take the bar, and then end up not having a job in either legal or accounting next March.  Waiting to finish would also mean that the legal job market might have more time to recover (although I doubt it).

Most of the people that I know that just graduated don’t have any jobs and are just studying for the bar and hoping to find something after they have taken it.  

I would like to know what people think about my options and how much study time they needed for the bar and if they worked full time and studied.  Writing this out has already helped to clarify my thoughts.     
Thanks for taking the time to read it.  Let me know what you think.

vwxj9,18,2012-07-02,"How should I feel about this, KC?",Formaldehyd3,KitchenConfidential,https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/vwxj9/how_should_i_feel_about_this_kc/,"Backstory: I just finished a 4 month internship (granted I've been in the biz for years, but this is my first foray into fine dining). I was just recently hired and put on payroll. It's a pretty sweet gig, roughly only 10 hour days, and we actually get overtime. I've been working dinner crew, which is where I want to be. 

But today the chef told me that I'm being moved to the newly created 'swing shift'. I'm showing up to help during the ass end of the morning shift, doing my dinner prep, and then rocking through service just to leave right as the last table gets their food... My first thought was, ""Fuckin' sweet"" right? The catch is, ""I'm going to need you to soldier up here, you're going to be working 12 hour days, but I'm only going to be able to pay you for 9."" The implication being that the owner is getting stingy, and wants the chef to lay someone off. Me being the obvious choice since I'm, not the newest, but I am the least experienced. He said that I'm needed to get through dinner service during the busy summer, but if he weren't able to negotiate this new position for me, I'd probably have been laid off when it starts slowing down again (I'm not convinced I won't be, regardless). I can't be angry at the chef, because as far as I can tell his hands are tied.

So, assuming I'm getting the whole story, part of me is grateful that measures were taken to keep me on the team, part of me is kinda pissed that while I'm told I'm needed, I'm being made to feel expendable. I'm going to stick it out either way, because this is the best learning environment for me. But I don't know if working off the clock several hours a day (after paying my dues working several *months* off the clock) is a good show of character, or if I'm being used.

Ionno, I guess I'm kinda irritated and just venting, I'm sure it'll all work itself out. But how would you feel?"
vwwy5,1,2012-07-02,In love with GF but feel like she's going nowhere in life fast.  Is this a deal breaker?  Should I go?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/vwwy5/in_love_with_gf_but_feel_like_shes_going_nowhere/,"I'm 24(M) and have been with my girlfriend (24F) for 4 years, going on 5.  In most aspects, we come from completely different backgrounds.  I was raised by a family in which getting a college degree is the norm; it was always assumed that this was the best way to get a job.  My girlfriend would be the first person in her family to get a degree, permitted that she graduates.  I guess that most of my family is middle to upper-middle class and hold down pretty good jobs, while most of her family gets along on minimum wage.  And so forth.

My girlfriend and I started college at the same time.  I graduated last year and have a paid internship at a law firm.  She...has more credits than to be considered just a freshman, but not quite enough to be considered a sophomore.  This is getting ridiculous.  She's not unintelligent by any means, but I would attribute this to laziness.  She misses registration dates because she doesn't look them up, she forgets to do homework (or just doesn't), she barely glances over notes the morning of exams.  She says that she wants her bachelor's degree to get a good job in computer science.  She's going to school part time and working full time to pay bills which is fine, but while she says she aims for a job in computer science, she only applies to jobs like fast food or retail.  Nothing that's going to help her get a career in the field that she wants to be in.

I am completely in love with her, but the way that she's going about in life is increasingly bothering me.  We had an argument about it and she said she's doing the best she can, but now she's saying that she's hurt because it's like she hasn't met my expectations while she believed that we loved each other so much that nothing else mattered.  She says I've done nothing but played mind games with her and that all this time, she's been trying her best.  I wanted to make plans to move in together soon because my boss has indicated that I've done a good enough job to open a position for me, but I'm having trouble with the idea of her not getting anywhere until she's in her 30's.  I have no idea if I'm being a jackass.

**TL;DR Have been with girlfriend for over 4 years.  I love her and hoped to marry her one day, but am getting frustrated because she's not making any progress in life due to seeming laziness.  She thinks I'm being unfair and says she's doing all she can.  Not sure what to do.**"

_____  
A little background.  I'm 20, will be starting my last year of college this fall and graduating with a BS in Electrical Engineering next spring.  I am currently in Seattle Washington working for an Aerospace Company as an electrical engineering intern.  I shed religion around the beginning of the year but decided to never tell my traditional Catholic family and I don't plan on ever telling them unless they bring it up.

Anyway, when my mother found out about my internship she thought it would be great to come and visit me in seattle and spend some time touring the Northwest.  I didn't really oppose the idea since it initially sounded like she would visit (and bring my kid brother) for a week or so and then be on their way through the northwest.

fast forward a few months to mid june.  I am told by my mom that she will be coming up and staying for 5 weeks.  5 WEEKS!!  I figured it wouldn't be all bad so I didn't say anything.  

One week after she got here I've realized I can't talk to her about a lot of topics without sucking it up and agreeing (disagreeing internally).  These are things such as gay marriage, contraception, human rights, religious rights, almost all politics, drugs and plenty of other stuff.  There are things I can talk with her about other than these but they get exhausted quickly and there are many gateway topics that lead to these ones as a result of her religious driving force.

I feel like its starting to build up on me all of this sucking up since now I'm getting irritated much easier than I used to.  I feel like this whole thing has gotten forced on me, I never really invited her to visit me let alone for 5 weeks.  Plus she brought the kid brother who is 4, he's been brought up like a brat and throws tantrums many times when he doesn't get his way.  

I do like my family but damn, I can only put up with so much brainwashing talk.  

TL;DR:  My catholic mom decided to visit me and I need someone/people to talk to and vent.

edit: if you think i'd be better posting this in a different subreddit let me know.

I am all alone in NYC and really, really sad. I honestly don't know how I'm going to concentrate at work, and when I'm done with work I have very little to fill the time with.

I exercise, but that takes me until 9-10pm at latest. I can make dinner and then I'm left to my own entertainment. And I'm so sad that books, TV, etc. are incapable of distracting me. I am losing a lot of sleep. I have no appetite. I just sit there, sad.

At this point, its only been a few days. But I have no friends to distract me. I tried going out to a bar, which in hindsight is an obviously terrible idea, but guys just tried to pick me up which I am totally not ready for yet. I can't really face going out alone to dinner/movies, especially since there are so many people being happy together :(

This is probably the saddest I have ever been. He was a major part of my life. I wanted to be with him for the rest of my life. He broke up with me very suddenly and insensitively (via telephone after not having seen me for weeks). 

I need help please."

vwqke,12,2012-07-02,Am I being unreasonable?,[deleted],atheism,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/vwqke/am_i_being_unreasonable/,"A little background.  I'm 20, will be starting my last year of college this fall and graduating with a BS in Electrical Engineering next spring.  I am currently in Seattle Washington working for an Aerospace Company as an electrical engineering intern.  I shed religion around the beginning of the year but decided to never tell my traditional Catholic family and I don't plan on ever telling them unless they bring it up.

Anyway, when my mother found out about my internship she thought it would be great to come and visit me in seattle and spend some time touring the Northwest.  I didn't really oppose the idea since it initially sounded like she would visit (and bring my kid brother) for a week or so and then be on their way through the northwest.

fast forward a few months to mid june.  I am told by my mom that she will be coming up and staying for 5 weeks.  5 WEEKS!!  I figured it wouldn't be all bad so I didn't say anything.  

One week after she got here I've realized I can't talk to her about a lot of topics without sucking it up and agreeing (disagreeing internally).  These are things such as gay marriage, contraception, human rights, religious rights, almost all politics, drugs and plenty of other stuff.  There are things I can talk with her about other than these but they get exhausted quickly and there are many gateway topics that lead to these ones as a result of her religious driving force.

I feel like its starting to build up on me all of this sucking up since now I'm getting irritated much easier than I used to.  I feel like this whole thing has gotten forced on me, I never really invited her to visit me let alone for 5 weeks.  Plus she brought the kid brother who is 4, he's been brought up like a brat and throws tantrums many times when he doesn't get his way.  

I do like my family but damn, I can only put up with so much brainwashing talk.  

TL;DR:  My catholic mom decided to visit me and I need someone/people to talk to and vent.

edit: if you think i'd be better posting this in a different subreddit let me know.

edit: if you read my post from a few months ago you'll know the whole story of why I don't want to get into it with my family about me not being catholic.  For now thats really not an option, I've decided the best thing to do is try and distance myself from the family without cutting ties.  I do value family relationship and I don't want to end up like my uncle who has rejected the rest of the family and vice versa."

If you've read my previous posts, you know that my S/O had an internship for the summer. Well, due to the storms through that area, they're kinda bogged down with people for specific roles and had to let some go, and she was one of them. She was sad to leave all her friends behind, but now she's going to stay with her sister in Maryland.

My parents are on vacation, it's just my older brother and I, so what did I do? I bought a round trip plane ticket from Indy to Baltimore to see my S/O on the Fourth. It's gonna be awesome. My parents wouldn't approve, but hey, I worked for this money, so I figure I should spend it how I see fit. They also won't know, so what they don't know can't hurt them, or me.

Just thought I'd share the excitement I have right now, and encourage those waiting not to give up! There may be an opportunity like mine which arises! Thank you for you guys' continued support and advice, it's very much appreciated."

So I'll be applying to grad programs this coming fall and and trying to find some decent schools with the type of research I'm interested in.

My GPA will be 3.2-3.3 by the time I'm applying, and honestly that's what's mostly holding me back at this point.  I'm currently working towards what will be my 3rd year of research in a lab where I work with rodents and have alot of technical skills and experience.

Honestly my resume is pretty good, in addition to my research experience, I am the president of the neuroscience club at my school and have had been awarded  internships, research grants, and scholarships.  I'm in the process of studying for the GRE, but assuming I do fairly well, what are some of my best options for grad school?

Ultimately I'd like to do research on cognitive enhancers, but not many people are currently doing that.  If I can't find a lab doing specific research on cognitive enhancers, then I'd at least like to get a strong background in neuropharmacology and/or some sort of cognitive disorder.  Cell culture and human studies aren't really options for me, I'd like to work with animals in a behavioral setting.

Currently my top choices for schools are Emory and UC Irvine, they both may be a bit of stretch, and I know that I'm not going to get into Harvard or anything.  That being said, can anyone recommend any good  second tier schools?  Perhaps some well funded state schools or something along those lines?"

Hey everyone,


I'm going to be a senior in college and I'm applying for an internship right now. I've been a bit more proactive than a lot of kids I know throughout school as far as my work experience and the rigor of my coursework go. I've taken most of the best classes my school offers in the social sciences... would have done really well in them, too, if I hadn't always been so overwhelmed. In addition to challenging classes, I always had a job (or two) the entire time I've been in school. I also tried squeeze 3 internships into the past three years as well.



I'd like to think I'm a pretty smart girl, but I've been struggling with serious family issues for the past two years and even more serious mental health issues for quite some time. It came to a point last Fall when I really couldn't handle at all the pressure I was putting myself under and I finally got some help. So good things are hopefully ahead, but now I've gotta think about where I've been.



[Here's my resume.](http://www.scribd.com/doc/98834260/Jess-Rick-a-Resume) I put this together for a design class, and I'm not sure I'd actually send it places I wanted to work/intern because I don't trust my sense of aesthetics. I might make it more plain. I think the ""Other Skills"" section at the bottom is particularly bad-- worst part about it. But I might need all that bullshit to fill up space when you consider the real issue that brought my resume and I here tonight...



I need to know whether or not you can or should include jobs on your resume that you just stopped showing up to. I just realized that this is the case for 4 out of the 6 positions I feature on my resume. Before my disappearing acts, for each of those positions, I put a lot of my time and effort into my work and took it pretty seriously. And I did some really good work that I can point to and say this like ""Look at this brochure I made...""or ""Read this awesome year-end appeal I wrote..."" or ""Check out this newsletter I put together...""



I feel like it'd be such a shame to leave the experience off the resume... but I could never use anyone at any of those 4 places as a reference or anything. I don't see how I could ever sell my chronic falling off the face of the Earth problem (Aside from assuring my future employer I'm getting all the therapy and medication I need? Not much more appealing.)


Its just really hard for me right now to see past my need to feel like my hundreds of combined hours of hard work and chronic stress weren't in vain! I did learn skills, whether or not I get to list how I learned them on my resume... but it just feels so disappointing. I'm applying for an internship that I really want-- and that I can actually handle in conjunction with 12 credits and no job-- so I wanna get this straight and do the best thing.



**TL;DR Through most of undergrad, I've gone AWOL from jobs/internships that I'd been working really hard at-- is it OK for them to be on my resume? (and when I say ""be on,"" I sort of mean ""be."")**

I apologize about the length of this but I could use some perspective on this situation.

I moved to another state for a summer internship about a month ago. As soon as I turned my car off a pretty big kitten ran out of the bushes and started lingering outside the house. She had no tags and looked pretty healthy. We asked the neighbor and he said that he had been feeding her for the past couple of days but that he thought she was a stray. She started sleeping and hanging out on our front porch and after a couple of days we started feeding and watering her. From then on she was always around.  After a week or so a real nasty storm blew up and she was gone. A week or so later, I was picking blackberries at the end of the street and the cat ran out of the woods and started rubbing on me. Someone had put a shitty flea collar on her that was about 2x too big (four+ inches of excess were hanging off her neck and she couldn't drink water without the collar dipping into it.) I picked her up to carry her back to show my friends that she was alive. I gave her some food and she would not stop eating... she ate around a human-sized portion of roast (I assume it isn't the best for cats but it's the only meat we had). I trimmed her collar afterwards and put her back outside. She's been around ever since. She lives on either the front or back porch and runs inside if we open the door. She spends about 12 hours outside a day but always comes back to our house to come inside. I eventually bought her a litter box so she wouldn't shit and piss on my bed and a scratching post so she would leave the furniture alone. I also bought her some cat food figuring that if she was going to be hanging out with us she had better stop eating fancy meat that was cooked for humans. She has been living like this for the past 2 weeks or so. 

I'm curious as to what you guys think I should do. I want to adopt her and take her with me when I leave, but I don't want to steal someone else's cat. She's young, so she likes wandering around, but if she isn't on the porch when I go out she will run up when I whistle. She isn't fixed, even though I think she is old enough to get pregnant. It doesn't look to me like anyone else is really taking care of her so I want to get her put on meds, fixed, and get her a proper collar and tags.

Thanks for the input."
vwmlp,1,2012-07-01,[Seeking] Stanford Graduate Seeking Help Landing A Job! Save Me!,ineedadrinkplz,mentors,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentors/comments/vwmlp/seeking_stanford_graduate_seeking_help_landing_a/,"I graduated from Stanford a couple of years ago with a social science degree. After taking time off to help my disabled parents, deal with personal matters, and spend several months traveling the world I am eager to finally enter the workforce. Living at home is no longer my cup of tea, and my partner and I would love to be able to really get on our own feet. The situation at both of our homes right now happens to be especially toxic, so getting out asap would be nice! 

My goal is to do work that is socially responsible (humanitarian, non-profit related, etc) but I have absolutely no funds at this point so I would be open to any work that isn't against my morals and can support a decent living. I am open to relocating just about anywhere, as long as it is fairly safe and the job pays enough for me to support myself and possibly my partner.

More on my background: Most of my work up to this point has been  in the non-profit sector. I have worked with children, abuse survivors, city government and academic institutions. I also have a lot of research experience and particularly enjoy using those skills to support humanitarian efforts. Journalism is definitely something I would love to get involved with, but it seems unpaid internships are a necessity and I simply can't afford to do that at this point in time. It's a long shot, but I do really love acting (I have some solid experience) and any chance of getting involved in theatre or tv/film would be amazing!

My volunteer experience is mostly within the realm of feminism, but I have also done a fair amount of organizing and event planning. I have accepted editing and writing gigs in the past, and I am open to accepting that type of work again. 

I am not sure where to start and I am afraid that I am lacking marketable skills and a solid resume. I haven't been in the game since graduating, so I am not sure how to market myself or how the gap will affect my chances of landing a job. I am also contemplating going to law school or obtaining a higher degree in the next few years but for now I would like to work before making that decision. For these reasons, I seek mentorship from someone who can help me figure out how to get on my feet. I am not sure what I can offer you in return, but I am absolutely open to figuring something out!

If you are open, we can communicate more about my goals and interests or whatever information would help you and go from there. This is all very new to me, so we would be starting pretty fresh, if you are open to the challenge! Thank you!

vwm8r,3,2012-07-01,The Smell of Perfume [Part 2],Slythis,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/vwm8r/the_smell_of_perfume_part_2/,"Okay, so I never really thought that there would be a part two to this story. [What happened a year ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/irqnj/the_smell_of_perfume/) never reoccured and I had nearly written it off as a confluence of sleep deprivation, caffine and an over active imagination. The human mind has a way of over-rationalizing, I kept saying to myself ""Maybe I was just over-tired and got right back into the main elevator and rode it back up to the third floor all while think I was heading for the tunnel and that when the light started flickering like they always do at 10:30 my over stimulated mind short-circuited... but I was wrong and what happened this past Friday night has made me rethink some of the other less-than-normal events that have occured in my life.
 
This last year has been relatively calm, nothing that wasn't easily explained away happened. We've been perpetually short-handed and they only just brought in an intern to help fill the gap; a young woman beautiful blue eyes we'll call Sophia who is attactrive enough that several of the guys have been sucking in their guts and trying to act macho... it's all rather amusing.
 
As Sophia was going to be helping me out on 2nd shift I spent most of the week working through the important stuff with her while I took care of all of the tedious crap like checking the lights and delivering the interoffice mail. By Friday she had a solid enough grasp of the job that we were able to split the higher priority stuff and I could finally instruct her in the fine art using a light switch.
 
Around 10:00PM we had finished all of the semi-technical stuff and it was time to show her how to check the parking lot lights, pointed out which lights had been out since before *I* started and what to do if an entire section of the lights were out; all this took about 15 minutes but on the way to the building Sophia kept stopping and looking around. 
 
When I asked her what was up she replied ""Oh, it must just be some weird echo. I could have sworn I heard someone in high-heels following us."" I laughed and told her about how you'll sometimes hear the sound of highheels on the third floor of the north building even when the building is empty. We laughed and headed back inside and down into the tunnel to check the lights in the north building.
 
We had made it about halfway down the tunnel when Sophia stopped and made an odd face.

""Do you smell that?""
""Smell what?""
""Perfume... really flowery perfume. Strong too.""
 
I must have paled a little because she gave me kind of an odd look before I shrugged, too embaressed to tell her the truth, explaining that some of the women are a little too fond of their cheap perfume and how I had broken my nose my freshman year in High School so there was a good reason why I couldn't smell it.
 
At the end of the tunnel I insisted that we take the stairs.
""Sure it's 8 flights up but I could do with the extra exercise."" I lied with a nervous laugh but paused midstep as I opened the door. I could smell it too now; that same perfume from nearly a year ago.
""Uhh... Tell you what why don't you head home for the night and I'll just take care of this tomorrow?"" I suggested.
I could feel her eyes, the blue of robins eggs, on me without even turning around.
 
""What's with you?"" She asked, ""Trying to sneak off to meet someone? And here I thought we had such great rapport.""
She shouldered past me and headed up the stairs in a fake huff that would have been cute if I hadn't been so scared. Sighing I headed up after her, I wasn't going to let Sophia go up there alone and at this point I still hoped against hope that it was all in my head.
 
By the time we hit the lobby the stench of perfume was overwhelming, I had taken to breathing through my mouth and Sophia was snuffling at a runny nose.
""Ugh..."" she groaned. ""Where's the womens restroom?""
I pointed and she headed down the short hall way. The door opened, then closed and Sophia reappeared.
""Lightswitch?"" she asked, her voice given a heavy nasal inflection.
I pointed ""About two inches from your left hand.""
She flipped the switch and gave me a puzzled look.
""Why is it out here?""
""At a guess I'd say it's so that men don't need to go into the womens restroom to turn off the lights at night.""
She shrugged and headed back into the bathroom. A few seconds later she stepped back out and I began showing her the locations of the light switches and mail drops on the first floor.
 
We haded up to the second floor and again I insisted on taking the stairs. As I was repeating the process on the second floor I started bracing myself for the smell to start creeping over from too much perfume to the stench of blood. Sophia seemed to notice it too, she seemed withdrawn, mostly nodding in response to things I said and keeping so close to me as to be in my personal space.
 
By the time we had worked out way up to the third floor the perfume smell had cleared but the air still smelled oddly crisp, like it does right after a snow storm. As we were crossing through the balcony that connects the west wing of the building to the east I paused as I thought I heard someone moving around on the first floor, Sophia most have heard it too as she chose this moment to reach out and grab my hand.
 
I nearly jumped out of my skin but once I realised that it was just Sophia I gave her hand a reassuring squeeze and tried to keep my own hands from trembling. As we reached the west end of the building I glanced up at the clock and realized it was nearly 10:30. I opened my mouth to warn her of how the lights were about to flicker but my mind went blank as Sophia wrapped an arm around my back, pressed her body against mine and started up at me with dark *brown* eyes as she reached up to pull me in for a kiss.
 
My mind spun, Sophia's eyes were blue, not brown. I shoved ""Sophia"" away and bolted for the stairwell on the west end of the building seconds before the lights started flickering out behind me. I all but flew down the stairwell and was nearly out the front door when the sound of someone banging on the womens bathroom door brought me skidding to a halt.
 
I sprinted over to the door and shouted Sophia's name.
""You bastard!"" she shouted through the bathroom door. ""How long were you going to leave me in here with the lights off huh?""
I took a few steps back and hit the lights for her.
""Great... thanks... now do you mind unlocking the door?""
""The deadbolt is on your side!"" I shouted
""Oh of all the..."" I heard her grumble as the door opened and she looked up at me with light blue eyes.
""Where the hell were you!?"" she shouted as she slapped me.
I grabbed her by the arm and started dragging her towards the front door.
""What arm you doing?"" she asked ""Stop it! You're scarying me.... you're *hurting me*."" I let go and she planted her feet in a genuine huff this time.
""Now what in God's name is going..."" The lights went out in the lobby and I grabbed Sophia around the waist, throwing her over one shoulder as I sprinted for the door. 
 
As we burst out into the humid air Sophia screamed, I began to slow my pace but over my shoulder I heard her shout.
""Keep running! Oh god! Oh God keep running!""
I ran as fast as could and did not stop until we were several blocks away in the well light parking lot of a gas station.
 
I let Sophia down and she crashed against me, blue eyes filled with tears. A few minutes later when her sobbing had calmed and the trembling in my hands had ceased I finally asked.
""What did you see?""
""I... she..."" Sophia stammered. ""It... it was me... like we were being chased by my corpse."""
vwj72,0,2012-07-01,"Reddit, this is my first post and I could really use your advice. Thinking about leaving my girlfriend",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/vwj72/reddit_this_is_my_first_post_and_i_could_really/,"hey internet,

So this is my first post. I don't really even know where to begin. I just know I've read countless threads like these, and I see a lot of people get genuine help from them. So here it goes... (sorry if it's boring/long/stupid)

I'm a 23 year old d00d who recently graduated from college and am currently working a steady job doing stuff (not important what.) I met my girlfriend through an infamous dating website, but we realized we had a lot of mutual friends and went to a lot of the same things, just never having met or bumped into each other at those times, so we usually don't tell people that, as it is believable that we would have met in our own time. She is a 19 year old current college student. Our first date we went to a metal show at a DIY spot. Everything turned up Milhouse, and she spent the night at my place. I took her to work the next morning, because I was actually feeling ""it."" She is super cute, has a great sense of humor and is a blast to be around. I fell pretty quickly for her, and pursued things hard.

A sort of a side, it should be mentioned, that up until this time, I was on a 2 year period of not dating anyone, mostly by choice. I had a slew on continuous relationships that I jumped into too eagerly and ended up regretting it, and hurting the other party. However, this was as a direct result of being in a extremely emotionally abusive relationship for 2 years through high school. I felt pretty insecure for years following, and jumped at the chance to be in a relationship with pretty much anyone that would return the interest. After breaking enough hearts, and having mine broken a few times as well, I decided I just need some time to figure out what I wanted and what I needed. 

Anyways, Fast forward a month after we meet, and things are official. This is surprisingly long for me, considering I would usually jump into relationships within a week or so of dating someone for the most part. This took an incredible amount of patience on my part. However, she was expecting to score an internship over the summer, and didn't. She had to move back home as opposed to staying in the city we live in. However, she only lives an hour away, and we tell ourselves we'll make it work. And it has been, or it was. She was making it down about once a week for the first month, and I only saw her twice really in the second month. 

See, when we met, I had just moved to this city. I had already hooked up with a few girls around the area, and felt that maybe I was ready to just go the distance with someone. She was really the first person I felt like I could have a relationship with after the thought occurred. While we text everyday and occasionally will call or skype each other, I pretty much fill up the rest of my free time here with my hobbies (playing music, in a somewhat serious fashion, hanging out with my new and old friends) and work, which takes up way more than just full time hours. I barely have time for myself with her not even in the same town as me. 

And here's the kicker, it feels as if things have just sizzled and my feelings aren't going anywhere. I'm still attracted to her and I enjoy the time we spend together, but as time goes on, I can tell she is falling deeply for me, and I'm just...indifferent. I care for her, and all of this has absolutely nothing to do with her. She's great. And that makes me feel worse. I feel like I should keep trying because I had not felt this way about a girl in a very long time and I was so sure going into this that it would be for a long time. But now, 2 months into it, and I feel exactly as I did the last time I was in a relationship at this period; ready to bail and disinterested. 

I don't know what to do reddit. I don't want to hurt this girl because she's awesome and doesn't deserve that. But she doesn't deserve some dude stringing her along waiting for his feelings to catch up. I also don't want to regret this decision only to find out that this was some sort of mental/emotional episode that ends up passing and I truly did have real feelings for her. 

This make's me feel like complete shit. I'm a super nice guy other than the turmoil and distress relationships cause me. Maybe I'm doomed to be single forever. And maybe that's what I deserve for getting myself into situations like this. 

She's moving back to the city in the beginning of september to start school again. She'll have her own place and her own friends again, but at home, where she currently is, she has no friends, a shitty family, and a shitty 40+ hour/week job at a pizza place. I'm her only haven this entire summer. If I'm going to break up with her, how should I do it? If she comes into town, it's to spend the night with me. Breaking up over the phone or through text isn't an option, but I don't want to break things off when she has no where else to go for the evening. 

Sorry for the wall of needlessly boring text. Just need some help sorting this out. 

TL;DR Moved to a new city. found a girl I liked, after not having dated anyone for a few years, mostly by choice. She moved away for the summer, rarely see each other. 2 months in, and I'm disinterested, but not because of anything she did, or because of her at all.

i have been with my gf for 16 months now, and feel as though i am being put second for everything. she moved 3 hours away for an internship. she was supposed to come see me this upcoming tuesday night because she is off for the rest of the week after tuesday and will be staying with me until then (we are going to a wedding also). now she has moved it to Wednesday because her and her friends are all going out tuesday night.
This past weekend was her birthday, she was gonna come down and spend it with me.. but, her friends told her they wanted to take her out. I was not invited, but it was ""okay because i get to see you on tuesday!"" which has now been moved to wednesday for another party.
I went to visit her 2 weekends ago and the only concern was where we were going to go out, she never wanted to go out with me and my friends. (another story)
basically i am tired of being second for everything with her, i have more examples that i can give but am in a rush... i apologize for the poor writing. if there are any holes feel free to ask. this is the first girl i have actually loved... i feel like an option rather than a priority.. i love her tons... am i being a bitch, or is this something i should bring up?"

I've been caught with pot two times, despite smoking far less than most other people I've known. I got caught in unlucky and stupid situations.

But, that's in the past. I've gotten over the incidents, and have moved on with my life. However, the criminal record still haunts me. I won't be able to get it expunged until 2017, which is far after I graduate in 2014. I'm a Biomedical Engineering major, and while this industry is growing strong, I'm still worried that I'll find it hard to get a job with my record. I don't think I'll have a problem getting an internship next summer because I have a pretty good GPA, but I'm worried that I'm not going to be able to live the life I want to live because of smoking pot twice.

I know I have options, and that's usually the major thing that calms me down. I can go to graduate school. I can expatriate to Europe, where they'll be relatively lenient. Hell, maybe I'll apply for a bunch of jobs in California, where they aren't allowed to ask about minor marijuana offenses. However, it still haunts me and makes me feel worthless that I can't live up to my full potential anymore. I've made so many positive changes in my life since it's all happened, but as far as that *one thing* goes, the world refuses to be forgiving.

It also makes me feel incredibly alone since I've still not found a single person in a similar situation. Everyone else I know with a criminal record is a pretty apparent pothead or whatever, but I'm not the type of guy that people think even drinks that much alcohol. I just don't know what employers are going to think of me when they read that I've been caught for pot twice. I'm an Eagle Scout, my GPA is higher than average, I'm a tutor, and I'm actively involved in various campus locations, but will any of that matter when they read my record? I guess it should also be noted that these are only misdemeanors, **not** felonies. Employers have legitimate problems hiring felons, since they have to pay extra insurance for their employment. For me, it's just how they'll judge me."

vwei8,12,2012-07-01,What's the state of the analysis and generation of sheet music?,Tiomaidh,MachineLearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/vwei8/whats_the_state_of_the_analysis_and_generation_of/,"## Background
I'm a CS undergrad particularly interested in AI, and have gotten my feet wet with ML through internships, Stanford's online AI course, and a job I have at a startup doing simple text mining and less-simple searching (and I'm also learning through osmosis as the software company I have a summer job at just got acquired by IBM's Big Data division). I'm also incredibly interested in 18th-century Scottish fiddle music, and my chief hobby for the past six years has been playing, composing, and otherwise studying it.

I've noticed that there's a lot of patterns in the tunes. The vast majority are 32 bars (measures), there's a handful of patterns that make ~5 unique bars get repeated in such a way as to fill the 32 (one common idiom is playing ABAC ABAC DEDC DEDC twice, where each letter represents a bar). And when playing a tune I've never seen or heard before, I sometimes have correct intuitions about what new content will come next--there's a lot of melodic and chordal patterns whose precise nature I can't quite articulate.

## Project
So as any sensible person would do when faced with vague theories and good data sources, I want to package up several thousand tunes in [ABC notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_notation), cause my computer to do incantations over them, look at the patterns my program finds out of pure musicological interest, and then use them to generate new tunes.

*Now it's time for the question*: do you know of any previously done work on something similar? I've spent a good amount of time trying to find things, but can only find audio-based projects. I'm not interested in analyzing the genre of an MP3 or contrasting the performance style of two artists. Nor am I interested in smashing together several loops of electronic sound and calling it music. This is a strictly sheet music-based project.

## Practical Details
From a logistics standpoint, I'd have a little bit of time this upcoming academic year to work on it (on the side), and if I wanted to I could have about twelve 20-40 hour weeks in the summer of 2013. In the summer and fall of 2013 I plan to be in Edinburgh studying ethnomusicology (yay, domain knowledge). I'm also thinking of applying to the [Singularity Institute](http://singularity.org/) and spending a week or two there in the beginning of the summer--if anyone has any thoughts on that I'd be interested in hearing them.

By asking about prior work I'm hoping someone will link me to a journal article where I'll learn what algorithms other people have used and how (un)successful that was--which would give me a place to start. If that doesn't work out:

## Current Strategy
First I'll create a hierarchy of things I'm interested in. One group might be broadly responsible for the overall structure of a tune, and I'll have one node recording data on length, another node recording data on which patterns of repeated bars are used, etc. Another top-level group might be broadly responsible for figuring out what type of note comes after what, with nodes that keep track of intervals (be it a minor third or a fifth or whatever), chord patterns, relative position in the bar, relative position in the tune, relationship to the key signature, etc. And so on and so forth. This obviously requires a lot of thought, and I'd like to try as much as possible to make things specific enough to be easily findable in the corpus, but abstract enough to be useful in a broader context. Then I'll run the corpus through them to get the actual data, inspect the results, probably iterate on that a few times as I realize what type of information is more valuable than others, and then feed it all to a glorified Markov chain generator for the composition aspect.

-----

I've done my best not to make an imposing wall of text, but...I wanted to make sure you had all the information you might want. The main question is about previous efforts, but anything else you'd like to add to the discussion is very welcome. Does this seem like a reasonable project? Any words of warning? I'm aware that even if everything goes perfectly according to plan and I have an automatic traditional tune spitter-outer the usefulness is questionable (not much of a market to monetize it with, and it seems a bit out there to go the academic route with)...it's purely for personal interest, pragmatism be darned.

Thanks!

I'm starting to have second toughs about my choice. I don't know if i should change my orientation, if i do, i'll probably pick mechanical eng. But don't get me wrong guys, i LOVE what the mining engineers do, all the challenges to overtake, all the drilling and blasting, the planing and optimizing, but i feel like i'm gonna miss opportunities, miss the city life and most of all miss my family, working in remote places. 
i still haven't had any internships yet. but i'm planing on having one next september. i've already visited an open pit mine before (that was eye opening, thrilling and terrifying).

Is there any mining engineers on reddit, if so i would love to hear your stories. is it worth it to go to remote places. i'd love to do what i like, but not at the expense of my family time (yes i want it all, and i'm probably asking for the moon). finally, is there a way to work as a mining eng. in the city?

Not that I totally agreed, but it did prompt me to think about how art is displayed in museums and how we all read it.

When I talk about how we ""read"" it, I mean how we associate with it or relate to it. Sometimes I feel that being confronted by a painting on a big blank wall can be overwhelming or maybe even not that exciting. After having spent some time at the Barnes Foundation this summer, which just moved to downtown Philadelphia, it amazes me how the arrangement of artwork on walls can do SO MUCH for a viewing experience. I would like to hear a little about what other people think and maybe share some museum experiences? My dream is to be a curator someday so discussions like these are insightful for me.

vzlwl,1,2012-07-03,Not sure what to do... advice needed...,[deleted],Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/vzlwl/not_sure_what_to_do_advice_needed/,"Sorry, this will be long, but here is goes...  I've never been a phone person or an overly expressive person. I was shy, quiet, semi-antisocial, reserved and quite a smart ass growing up. My parents are extremely negative people, nothing ever seems to work out for them and it rubbed off on me over the years. I realize now that I was really depressed in high school probably middle school too. 

During college I met someone (now boyfriend) that has truly changed my life. He showed me how negative I was and I made it a mission to change all that, because he seemed happy, optimistic and things just went his way. I am now an independent adult and an optimistic and happy person. During college I've tried to distance myself a bit from my parents as I realized how toxic their negativity is to me. I spent an entire summer back at home because it was close to my internship. I became really depressed again. As soon as I was gone from the house I returned to my happy self. 

Prior to the internship I knew how far I'd be driving every day and that I would probably be driving quite far for the second one, so I decided it was time for a more fuel efficient car. Somehow decided on a new car. I had half the money ready to put down, but my credit score wasn't quite there. My mother already told me she wouldn't co-sign because they wanted a new car (still hasn't happened 1+ year later). Anyways, I called up sobbing saying I couldn't do it without a co-signer. She caves and drives out to sign. This is important later promise.

After that summer I moved 5 states away for another internship. It was something I really wanted to do. My mother is pissed that I spent the week before I left with boyfriend and his family at the beach and didn't spend the time with her. I was just home all summer. Anyways, while away my mother is diagnosed with cancer. Le sigh. Now on top of her regular craziness this. I try to be supportive, make it about her, but it isn't enough because I'm not there. 

Internship over I come home spend some time with her, but again not long enough. So, I return for her last day of treatment to be supportive, again she gets pissed because I didn't take a picture with her or something. Fast forward. It is now several months later the week before mothers day. I decide to go home and spend some quality time. It seems to go well, I managed to not piss her off, she writes me a letter about how I'm an awesome daughter yada yada. I end up going home again for mothers day to drop off a gift and be there with her. Again goes well. The following weekend, however, it supposed to be a relay for life walk which she really wanted me to go to, but I had just done the 1.5 hr drive each way twice to visit the weekends before and I need to prep for my summer class on Monday, so I decided not to go. I knew she'd be pissed, but I'd probably piss her off whether I went or not. She just gives me the don't worry about coming your dad has been supportive and the walk is really just for survivors and caretakers anyways. Yep, pissed.

So, now the real problem. My father calls me on my birthday to wish me well and my mother joins in later. Apparently, I pissed them off by not being social enough. From my view, it's summer, there isn't a whole lot going on, and I don't need to relay every detail of my life anyways. The phone call ends abruptly because of this and I receive a text later.  Apparently, I didn't sound happy on the phone (never do) I'm a couch-potato, they no longer are going to call me and they wonder what happened to the daughter they used to know.

So, I call my father, because he is normally on my side with her craziness to sort it all out. He blasts me too. Saying how they spent all day signing papers for my car, didn't eat dinner, and then drove all the way back for work at 8am. (they picked the day to come) He also talks about how I'm young and should be out doing things and going on vacations to the beach. (sorry not wasting my money when I have $25,000 in student loans and $6000 left on the car) I haven't taken their 'advice' in a long time because they handle money poorly in my mind and haven't made the best of decisions, but they won't make any change that could potentially make them happier. Anyways, he says they are going to sell their house move and probably not leave a forwarding address because they are done with it all. His words, I don't call enough to check on my mother and see how she is doing, I only call if I want something. Which to their point I call like twice a month, which I find to be sufficient because the conversations drag on for hours. Every time I call a make a point to ask about my mother and let her vent or whatever. 


So, that was long, but believe me I cut out a lot.  I really could use some advice. Am I truly a bad daughter or is my mother completely off her rocker? I've tried to be supportive and help them out (dad lost his job and money was super tight), but all those things seem to have been ignored and my mother gets pissed really easily. I've tried to repay the kindness of my mother co-signing my car. "

- Good transportation system ( Streetcars, metro, biking culture...)

- Great nightlife

- Different friendly neighboorhoods

- Multiculturalism

- Many outdoor events and activities ( Sports, festivals...)

- Massive student populataion

- Green-oriented city

- With no feeling of insecurity

- Cost of life not too high

- Manageable size (a lot within a walking distance)

I had just run a school-year length campaign for them, and we are all pretty big DnD geeks (and geeks in general). 

They had decided that they were going to ask me to run a one-shot, spontaneous DnD session that night. I thought it sounded like a lot of fun, so went for it. I had about 30 minutes of planning as I ran home and grabbed my dice and laptop. I started the players at lvl 10, ignoring skill points for sake of time.

We wound up with the following setting:
- The eldest son (PC; elf sorc, the leader) of the recently deceased Don of the city's mafia has returned from his world travels, with his new friend/bodyguard (PC; minotaur monk, the tank). Meeting up with his cousin (PC; dwarf fighter I think, the dumb one) and the family's operations leader (PC; human wizard, the brains), he went to his father's funeral and tried to decide what to do with his life.
- The session basically followed the story of this criminal family as Brother #2 tried to take over, forging a fake will to make himself the new Don. Brother #3 was basically #2's lackey while #4 was the one successfully running the family's legitimate businesses. In the course of the game, they found the actaul will, which said that PC son should be the new Don, else #4 if PC refuses, they found out that #3 was brokering deals with the other crime families, allowing them to move in on the family's turf, and that #4 was dating the daughter of the Don of the rival family (these last 2 they never fully figured out, but started learning). They wound up killlng #3 and the rival crime lords, finding the real will, killing brother #2, and PC son stepped down and let #4 run the family while the PC's went off on more world adventures. 

This campaign was one of the most fun I'd ever ran or participated in. The unplanned nature of it really forced all of us to roleplay and storytell to the best of our abilities, in order to flesh out the world and make it more interested. The players finished the main plot, but there were loads of other plot hooks that were presented, but not fleshed out, leaving it very open for a return campaign.

So tell me fellow redditors and Dnd nerds - have any of you ever run a spontaneous, unplanned session like this? If so, what were your experiences with it?"

As a Northern California native recently displaced to the District, I've been looking forward to this series since the schedules were announced. Our teams are both in first, pitching like nobody's business, lots of young talent, etc. Due to multiple, poorly timed relocations in the last few years, I also haven't seen the Giants play in the last 3 years (before we won the Series!).



I have tickets to Thursday's game, am unable to attend tomorrow, but am having trouble tracking down (reasonably priced) seats for tonight. So I come to you in a last minute plea. My girlfriend (another Bay Area expat) and I are desperate to see Timmy try to get his shit together against Harper and the rest of the Nats. So...if you or your friend or mother or your coworker or dog have an extra pair you wouldn't mind parting with, PLEASE let me know. I'm definitely a poor, debt-saddled intern, but am willing to splurge at least a little bit for good seats considering it's been a while and the only time I'm likely to see my team this year. Even if you don't have any but know of any good tips/tricks/secret websites to check out, I'd love to hear them.



Like I said, definitely a last ditch effort here before I resort to scalpers (*shudder*), but I thank you kindly for your time. Here's to a good series!

I've always wanted to learn to program, and have been involved with computers since I was ~7 (Now, 20).  I roughly taught myself VB/Java when I was around 14/15 and was involved in making some programs in a tight knit community online.  Loved it.  Fast forward to where I am now - the last 3 yrs of my college career I've been focused on Investment Banking, and breaking into the industry.  As it stands, I've gotten internships done so far at a few investment banks and a one bulge bracket (think JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank, BAML) doing PWM.  I'm pretty well set up for a career in the industry, and know I will have no problem getting interviews for that type of job.  However, I'm a transfer student and got all these opportunities on my own at a local school getting an Associates in Math.

I've been accepted to 2 schools as a transfer student for the fall - an Ivy league school majoring in Finance, and Georgetown, where I could undertake a BS in Math, or, if I can handle the senior year courseload of ALL CS courses (I haven't even taken Intro), I can get a BS in CS.  The problem that I feel, however, is that GTown is not a big CS school, and as such, I won't really be considered for top jobs in the CS industry and will most likely be looking at IT...  Also, I'm going to be a junior and I fear if I start from scratch now with CS, I won't land a notable internship next summer as I won't have the skills necessary down pat by then, whereas if I went Ivy, I could realistically expect to get a Summer Analyst position at Goldman Sachs (not far out of my reach...).  

What is your take on it?  What should I do?  I enjoy finance, and am heavily considering just accepted the ivy, but CS has been a love of mine since I was young and it would be a shame if I gave it all up for something I might not want to do wit hthe rest of my life (Investment banking wears you out...).

Any ideas?  Thanks!"

* College student, let's just say I've been in school for around 3 years now and have at least 2.5 more to go.  I'm attending an out-of-state state University with a pretty good-sized scholarship that will expire in around 3 years.

* I am currently interning at a reputable company founded in the 1960's for a ""newer"" division that makes software.  I love this job and have no complaints, other than a lack of benefits (due to being an intern).  In addition, I am (in theory) only on a summer-long contract, though I stated in my interview that I was looking to continue during the school year.  My manager has maintained that this is the current plan, depending on the ""needs of the business"".  I do not have a formal contract end date at this point in time, other than ""September"".

* Someone I worked with in 2008 is now the hiring manager for a roughly 10-year-old company.  He wanted someone with my skills.  The work is roughly the same as my internship, but the pay is better.

* Company 1 (my internship) seems better in the longterm if it turns into something, but Company 2 is offering me great pay in the short-term that would - in theory - continue into the long-term.

* I require some thoughts and guidance.

Company 1 (Older Company/Lower Pay/Temporarily Worse Benefits) | Thoughts
:--|:--
**Management** | My manager is a very savvy programmer.  I have a crapton of respect for him, and he respects me as well.  He's very knowledgable about his job - not just as a manager, but also as a mentor and a developer.  He's also very approachable.  However, I've also only known him since I began interviewing in February.
**Company Life** | Most of the people in the company are contractors, or began as contractors and were later hired on as full-time.  Out of my team of around 9 people, at least 4 are contractors and they are trying to hire at least 2-3 more contractors.  Benefits are great... if you are already a full time employee.  They are crap if you are a contractor, depending on the contract company you are hired through.  It's very close to where I live.
**Working with school schedule** | I'd have to lower myself to 20-30 hours a week during the school year simply because I'd only be able to work Monday/Wednesday/Friday due to class schedules and no real ""hour"" flexibility as far as arrival time.  They have not stated yet how they plan on working with my schedule, other than they would ""try"" (assuming that by this they would expect me to be able to work an adequate enough amount of hours for ""needs of the business"")
**Equipment** | I try to not judge a company too harshly by their equipment, but as a software engineer, I find it is important to me to try to work for one that tries to give their employees adequate equipment that may not be enough to run Skyrim on high settings, but doesn't get in the way of working.  My box has 3 gigs of RAM, and a dual-core i3.  Also, Windows XP, which has a tendency to freeze/crash once a day.  That's definitely a ""ding"", but not as hard because they are trying to roll out Win 7 machines to development currently.  As an intern, I am last on that list.
**Benefits** | This is the sticky point.  They absolutely suck.  I make around 16/hour with no option for overtime (though my overtime pay is stated as 25.50.  I know that if I'm hired on I'll make the industry standard for a software engineer with a few years of experience, but I can't even say if that'll be the 90k/year the company claims their developers make on average or the 70k/year that most other companies pay in the area.  Hell, I can't even guarantee I'll be hired on after college.
**Short-term thoughts** | While my pay is more than enough to cover my expenses, I'm still having to pull out loans for college.  This  puts pressure on me to finish school - which is good in the sense that I'll finish sooner, but bad in the sense that I may not do as well due to anxiety.  In addition, I have to consider the expense that managing my ADHD costs on a monthly basis.  Also, I know that there's no guarantee that I'll continue to receive a paycheck once school begins.
**Long-term thoughts** | This is the kind of company I'd like to work at in the long-term.  The company that owns them is a not-for-profit vision care company; however, the specific portion of the company that I work for is a for-profit.  When I was approached for a summer internship, I was very upfront that I wanted to continue working after the summer.  I was told that this would suit their needs as well, and was also their preference.  I'm also very impressed by the community involvement.  Usually I hate vision care companies, but this one provides vision services (free glasses and checkups) to certain disadvantaged areas (the city I am in has a LOT of poverty).  In addition, it's a 5 minute commute from my house, they server **AWESOME** food that is bought from local farms, and they reward people who spend time volunteering.  You can see why I am loath to leave during September.

Company 2 (Newer web startup/better pay and benefits) | Thoughts
:--|:--
**Management** | The guy who is my manager is someone I've known personally since 2008.  I schooled him in all things graphics, and he helped me get a leg-up in figuring out what to do with XML documents.  He's the kind of person that I can drop an F-bomb and some sort of unprofessional racial slur, and will laugh it off (obviously, I don't have a tendency to do this, especially NOT to people who write out my paychecks)
**Coworkers** | 3 out of 5 developers are people I have worked with before and I know that they are very capable programmers and great teachers.  We've all worked together before and know each other's ""style"", per se.
**Working through School Schedule** |  Working from home would make 30-40 hours easily doable for me (I've worked full time while attending school for 3 years now; it's nothing new to me).  I could work late into the night, and then sleep until I have to go to class if I wanted to.  Or, work, go to class, and then go to bed.  Or whatever I wanted.  It wouldn't require me to be on-site, other than for possible company events - which I've been told are few and far between (one of their senior developers lives in Europe.  Thought that was worth noting as far as their flexibility).
**Equipment** | Obviously that's dependent on me.  I'd be working on my own machine.  Which, I love my computer, so no complaints
**Benefits** | They seem pretty standard.  Standard medical/emergency that the company subsidizes, dental, as well as the profit sharing.  However, they'd cover my ADHD, which is pretty big for me.  Also, pay would be determined by how my first month goes.  At the end of the first month, I was quoted at their average developer making 60k, but that could also be up to 80-90k depending on how the company performs.
**Short-term thoughts** |  I think that this job would suit me very well for the short-term.  Being that I'm still in college, I'm in a position where I can still take calculated risks.  I'd be able to pay off what student loan debt I currently have (around 40k after this year, but if I keep on my current track I will graduate with around 60k).  The flexibility is also very nice in that I could choose to stay where I am, or choose to move back to Las Vegas if I wanted (though, realistically, I'd prefer to stay where I am).
**Long-Term thoughts** | I don't think that this company would look as ""good"" on my resume as the one I am currently with because it is very niche and isn't as ubiquitous as the one I am with.  In addition, I think that long-term they are comparable if I were to take it from the optimistic perspective of saying that I'd get full time offers from both - this one would simply occur sooner.

TL;DR:  I'm with a company that would work really well long-term if things worked out perfectly, but I have an offer for one that would work out well in the short-term and possibly long term - it's just that the second company would not look as good on my resume as the one I am currently with.  I'd like to hear your thoughts and experience."

It has both improved my view of some denominations and lessened my view of others, all the while giving me better insight and empathy to other walks of faith.


You're probably wondering: what is ""Molinist?"" Well, my friend, Molinism is a take on predestination which lies in the middle between Calvinism and Arminianism. It is not a denomination per say, but more so a ""lens"" or ""filter"" in which we view God.


For some reason, Molinism is not a very well-known theology, but I feel most people who wouldn't say they're Calvinist or Arminian would probably fall as a Molinist in the spectrum (unless they're Open Theist, of course). I will try to explain the theology very briefly without a lot of technical jargon so it's easier to understand:

Basically it's this: Not only does God know everything about the world he created, he knows everything that will happen in it and knows everything that could happen (counter-factual) if he or any of his creation acted differently then it is going to. God could have created (or actualized) any world, however, he chose to limit what he was going to create to worlds in which humans would have *free choice* (Arminianism), but also preserved his *sovereign control* by choosing which of these possible worlds would be actualized. Here's an easy way of looking at it:

* If *God created you* in Colorado, you would *choose* to go skiing a lot.
* If *God created you* in Texas, you would *choose* to ride horses a lot
* If *God created you* in Iowa, you would *choose* to go hunting a lot.

In each of those scenarios you freely chose to do any of those activities, however, from the start, it was God's sovereign choice to set up those scenarios.

This is only a super brief overview of Molinism, so I encourage you to check it out in full before making a judgement on it.


**TL;DR**


Molinists believe God chooses your free choices. I.e. God *deals* the cards (Calvinism) and you *choose* (Arminianism) how they're played.


But this is ""Ask Me Anything,"" right? Here is a little non-Molinism things about me.

I grew up in a fundamentalist, dispensational Baptist (SBC) church in which my Dad was the pastor. I was also influenced heavily by charasmatics growing up. Currently I'm attending a private Baptist school in which I'm studying Public Relations. Upon finishing in the Spring I plan on going to Truett - a moderate Baptist seminary. I act like I'm twelve years old and I play in a [Christian metalcore band](https://www.facebook.com/MaranathaTX). I work as a Jr. High intern at a big Bible church where I teach, preach (super occasionally) and slap the bass for worship.

OK, guys. That's about it. Have fun with this! I work today, but I'll try my best to answer as many questions as I can while at work, but most will probably answered in the evening. God bless!"

Got fed up and wrote this as the cover page for the questionnaire I was supposed to create.




'Questionnaire                                                                                                                                                 xxxx xxxx

   
The real fucking objective is to find out about your client’s investment needs and his investment choices. Why the fucker actually invests and how much experience investing he/she has and why in fucking God’s name he wants to invest with a certain bank. Analyze the shit out of this fucker and make sure that nothing is left to chance. Complete anal. 

Basically find out how long he has been investing, how much experience he has with certain products, whether he is investing on-shore or off-shore, and if he is investing on-shore ask if the fucker knows about off-shore and if he is investing off-shore ask him why in fucking God’s name that motherfucker invest in the place that he does. What influenced the cunt to invest with a certain bank? What is the most important thing he thinks he needs in his fucking banking life? Put the fucking jurisdiction question with the off-shore shit because bitches love off-shore shit. Amiright? No fucking shit I am. Should I ask the relationship manager question? Why the fuck not, it seems like it is fucking important.

Fuck this shit has been dragged on for ages, is it my fault? Maybe. So I just sit here like a dry cunt and wait to finish this God awful project so I can move on but every fucking time I seem to start again and again. It’s like whenever I feel like I have actually taken a step forward I get pushed back at least 5 extra steps. It’s bullshit. 

Anyways, back to the fucking questionnaire. I have to change number 4 because it doesn’t seem to make sense, so I’ll fucking combine it with some other shit like the ‘Are you aware of off-shore banking’ shpeil that I am supposedly going to write about.  If I remember correctly, which I most likely do not, I also have to get rid of number 6 because it is shit and not worthy of anyone’s time and space.
Try to fucking remember that this is not the kind of questionnaire that will be handed out to customers or clients but instead will be filled out by you as you talk to the faggots. So make this shit easy for you to fill out yourself, no need to be a fancy shmuck as long as it is efficient and worthy of someone’s time and space. I would write more but as it is this is the most work and satisfaction I have gotten out of this internship so far.'

",squireofrnew,writing,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/vyrxr/critiquefictionbeginnerbeginning_of_a_possible/,"**Author Statement**

Hey! I'm a novice writer, and I've always wanted to put a full length novel together. I have written several short stories and a full length play that made absolutely NO sense (Har har...). I have no publishing history, and I have a B.A. in communications.  

I have a confession to make... For the past couple of years, I have been addicted to theatre. I have worn the hat of the actor, director, playwright, stage manager, every back stage crew position possible, set designer, make-up artist (probably my weakest point), technical director, master carpenter, and who knows what else. I was a glutton, and I now want to feast on the art of building worlds and ideas. 

I am not as well read as I would like to be, but I am improving that! I live and breathe George R.R. Martin, Hunter S. Thompson, and Michael Crichton. Reading has been my muse for the past couple of months, and I hope to fill my void with some good stuff. I recently finished an internship at a local theatre, and I am now searching for a job.

**Intentions for the Work**

Please give me a general impression of the story. Do you care about the characters? Do you want to find out more? Does it seem like the story can sustain itself for an extended period of time? How is the rhythm? How is the word choice? Is there a moment that you do not buy? Those are the kind of questions I would like answered.

I would like to publish the work if it is capable, but that isn't important right now. I just want to find my voice and characterization at this moment, but either than that, any and all feedback will be taken graciously. I submitted this piece earlier tonight and fudged the guidelines, so here I am again! Thank you so much everyone, and I hope you enjoy the introduction to...

**Charlietown**


There's a huge crane off in the distance. A hundred and fifty feet of steel extends from its yellow base. Puffs of black putrid smoke billow from a lone nostril as it struggles to lift a container of goods from a small barge. This place gets so hot in the summer... Even the U.S.S. Yorktown agrees with me. I can feel her gears aching to turn. Her poor old bones wishing she could propel herself out into open sea and away from her watery tomb.

I wonder if she wants to go back to the fight. If she would mix well with the U.S.S Ronald Reagan. Probably not. The men who built the ship had substance. It'd be like oil and water for sure. She'd probably sail to Jamaica, or Costa Rica. Fire a spliff. Let the worries of this cruel year melt away so she can rust in peace. Rust isn't so bad, you know?

The woman overlooking the bay has the right idea. Find some shade. Bring a book. Let the world sail away and enter a new one. It's that simple, and not everything's that simple. Standing on top of a rail lining a dock wearing stilettos like that model over there isn't that simple, but people do love their photo ops. People love their memories. More importantly, people love pretty women. Even pretty women love pretty women.

I wonder what would happen if she were to fall. Teeter to one side, she might bruise a wrist. Sprain something perhaps. Teeter the other way, she might lose some dignity. Her dress. Her life. Maybe a nail as well. I guess that's the gamble. Pain on one side, humor with a chance of death on the other. It's a balancing act. Either or.

Out across the bay, there's a little rinky dink fort hovering above the water. It's probably far away is all, but it looks silly. I see no flag heralding its allegiance. You'd figure there'd be something. Stars and stripes. Palmetto and Crescent moon. Red Rebel. Something. Maybe some poor fool stole the thing, and now it's his new shade tent. Who knows... Maybe my eyes just can't see that far.

Or maybe the war started somewhere else. Off in some back alley basement somewhere, with coffee and crackers with little bits of cheese.

I would very much like to visit that house if it ever existed. To smell what those poor souls smelled before they made that pact. It probably smelled like fear.

The crane is now suspending a lone pole in the middle of the sky. The men guiding it to its final resting place look like children about to climb a tree. A tree with no arms or leaves, twists or turns, but a tree nevertheless.

The woman reading the book sits down on the opposite side of my bench. I fumble internally.

""What're you writing?"" she asks.

I chuckle nervously.

""This? Just a little exercise. I like to come here and empty my brain for a bit. No structure. Just... purging I guess.""

I flourish a smile, and look in her eyes. She has pretty eyes. I turn away and gaze upon the Yorktown.

""Can I read it?""

""Um... Yeah. Sure""

I hand her the black composition book speckled with white dots. She begins perusing the penmanship of a four year old. Chicken scratch and squiggly lines.

""I can't really read this.""

""That's because it's in code.""

She laughs at that one.

""You want to go for a walk?""

""Um...""

I look from left to right, almost as if we were making a transaction of illicit substances.

""You don't have to. I'm just moving down to the next park. Better view over there.""

""Maybe I'll catch up with you.""

""Yeah. Maybe.""

""Yeah.""

""Well. See ya. Good luck with the purging.""

""Yeah. You too.""

Up she goes, out of my life."

Both of our families will ultimately be supportive, but it's going to be a tough transition for them, once they find out.

I've done pretty well in school (GPA is 3.9something) and have been lucky enough to have 2 (1 ongoing) summer internships with 2 great companies.  I'm currently applying to GE's [Edison (EEDP)](http://www.ge.com/careers/students/eedp/index.html) program as a career path after graduation.  Quick Summary of EEDP: Four - 6 month rotations which allows one to experience different technical job roles, while taking technical training courses and working towards a Masters degree (which can usually be finished in a year after the program ends).

I know that both GE and the Edison program are amazing opportunities.  I've talked with several people about the program and I know that it's an extremely prestigious, tough, stressful, yet worthwhile program.  It's supposed to be extremely technical and time consuming given the curriculum.  You work full time (with a pretty good starting salary), and can get your Masters paid for, so to me it seems great (albeit difficult).

Here is my concern. If I was offered a position within this program, I would have to accept/decline it sometime in August...before I start my final year of college.  While it would be great to not have to worry about what I'm going to do after graduation, I would not be able to explore and/or consider other opportunities which could be better.  Additionally, EEDP is a 2 year commitment, and I believe you are expected to stay with GE for a certain amount of years afterwards (I've heard 4-5).  Now I'm not saying I would want to leave the company, but it this turns a 2 year commitment into a 6-7 year one which concerns me.

Needless to say the time frame for this is pretty condensed, and as much as I would hate to pass up such a great opportunity, I'm worried about locking myself out from anything else that comes along, especially this early in my career.  

TL;DR: Is a 5+ year commitment to a prestigious program a good idea before exploring other options? All advice/questions are welcome."

However, given my workload to pay ratio (I'm working 9 hours a day for just enough to get into work) and their slightly unsavoury reputation, I'm thinking I should line up another job and move on when this internship is done. I don't want to find out they were just using unpaid labour over a short period and want rid of me, or that they have no plans to move me to full time.

I'm looking for almost anything at this point. I've done work in music journalism and had a few articles published. Any job which involves a lot of writing pretty much sounds incredible to me. However, I also make a mean coffee and am okay pulling pints. Minimum wage bar work would be fantastic after this.

I just finished uni. My confirmed degree comes through in two weeks but it's a predicted 2:1. I half and halfed media and English, so I have experience with both technical media tools like Adobe Everything and have decent reading and writing skills. Most of my previous roles have been proofreading/copyediting creative work, research, SEO/social media output, customer service and marketing. Speaking straight, I'd love to stay away from another marketing job if possible. Unless it's creative. I've also worked bars and shops, but almost completely informally.

I'm not entirely certain how to word the about me section seeing as I've kind of written it all over here. I'm a graduate of a decent university. I can edit, write and read at a pretty quick pace. I can make movies and take photos. I can tell you how Bender from Futurama is an existential space for human anxieties. If you know of anyone who could pay me for any of those thing or any of the things I listed above, I would like very much to work for them.

I'll try to be as fair and objective as I can be about the conflict.

My brother (25) has been busting his ass for the last 5 years in Law school. He's been getting top marks, and got this great internship at a top firm which if he performs well in he'll get a graduate job offer.

I recently deferred my course to start my own business.

Because I'm working for myself, I keep my own hours. I've become fairly nocturnal. I like a certain sport which is played mostly in another timezone at really inconvenient times like 3 AM to 7 AM. As a result, I work a lot during the early hours of night, watch my favourite sport, keep working till 10 AM and fall asleep, rinse and repeat. I see nothing wrong with this, I have an alternate type of sleeping pattern.

My brother is an extremely light sleeper and apparently I wake him up. For my part, I really try hard to tiptoe around when he's sleeping. I close my bedroom door, I keep any volumes at a sound that cannot penetrate my wall (let alone his), and I will only get up to use bathroom and get food/drink when absolutely necessary, always trying to tiptoe as much as possible.

Inevitably, however, some sound will wake him up and he'll blame it on me. And that's when it starts. He gets into these borderline-psychotic moods. He becomes violent and starts screaming and yelling at me. That I'm waking him up and that he needs to sleep or he won't be able to concentrate at his internship.

It was almost fair enough for the first few times he did this. I -was- probably waking him up. So that's when I started to make as many considerations as I could, as I listed above. I'm trying as hard as I can to accommodate him. But I feel like he's being absurdly draconian. And while I'm really trying to be respectful of his lifestyle, I don't think that means I should give up the one that I enjoy. 

But he is still waking up. And now he's started yelling the most disgusting things like my life is shit and everyone hates me and that I'm going to fail and have a shit life and I'll deserve it.

All because I'm ""waking him up"". Stuff like ""Why can't you sleep at normal hours?""

He claims that his internship is more important than my ""failure of a business"", and so I should change to conform to him.

The problem is, he's my brother, and I just don't know how to reconcile it. I have so many conflicting emotions. I want to hate him, and at the time I'll get just as angry as he is and try to give as much back to him as I can. Sometimes I'll just yell out ""whatever you say, it's all true, now please stop screaming"".

But it's all so disturbing. Stuff like ""It doesn't matter how much you try to tiptoe you're such a fat fuck you'll always make a noise walking up and down stairs.""

Where does that sort of vitriol come from? I don't even know how to respond.

The fuck do I do? Should I really just conform to his sleeping pattern? I want to move out, I really do. And that should be feasible in about half a year, but starting a business is hard.

My parents are currently overseas and will be for another month or so. I refuse to bring them into this. They've worked too hard and too long to be troubled by this shit on their vacation. I wish my brother held the same view.

More insults he flings:

- My friends are all freaks
- My girlfriend is only with me because I'm the bottom of the barrel and so is she

**tl;dr: My brother is making me try to change my lifestyle to suit his. What I really want is advice on how to get him to just shut up. Any silver bullet ideas?**

Do you guys have any suggestions I could try?
Ideally it would be a furnished room with no down payment, but I'm open to anything that isn't renting a flat. I've looked into hostels, but its too expensive (Nearly 22.500 SEK for 3 months). I contacted the student accommodation to see if I was elligible for that seeing as I'm a student in Scandinavia (I'm Danish), but apparently you have to be a student of the university in Skövde to be elligible.

I don't really need to at all, but i'd like to get ripped. 
So I weigh 136lbs, 5""10, and i'm nearly 20. 

If I had to guess my body fat, it'd be around 16-18% based on the FAQ, haven't got the calipers to check. I'm not very muscley, but if I flex all over and suck in my stomach a bit, ab bulges are visible, and I get a nice bicep/delt definition which I like. 

I guess my goal would be visible abs without flexing and to just look a bit stronger all over. So i'm guessing that'd be around 10-12% body fat?

Here's what I did today, woke up, turned on my pedometer, had a cup of green coffee (in a rush not to be late), had a turkey 6-inch sub from Subway (healthiest thing I could find without preparing), bought a seed/nut/dried fruit bag to eat at my desk through out the days, went home, grilled some chicken breasts with a side of peas, drank only water throughout the day and I did some back exercises with some dumb bells at home.

Pedometer said I walked 4800 steps which I worked out to be roughly 290 calories at my size. According to my BMR, I need 1600, I calculated that I ate around 1200 today, and with the 290-, makes it around 910 calories.. 

At this rate, combined with some upper body work at the gym on the weekends, will I see the desired body fat over time? And if it isn't too much to ask.. how long would it take if I kept this up?

Side question: Is the seed/nut/dried fruit thing a good idea? Or am I adding unnecessary calories? I figured it'd raise my metabolism throughout the day without a huge calorie intake.."
w1khx,1,2012-07-04,Question about Ion-Mobility Spectrometry from a Legal Intern Who Knows Very Little About Chemistry/Spectrometry.,[deleted],chemistry,https://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/w1khx/question_about_ionmobility_spectrometry_from_a/,"I am doing an internship in civil forfeiture law this summer and have questions regarding IMS. Part of the evidence that is often used to get money we seize forfeited is proof that the banknotes have more cocaine on them than the normal ""casual contact"" level of the area from where the money is found. We use [something like this](http://www.smithsdetection.com/IONSCAN_400B.php) to scan the money confiscated and then have money from a bank scanned to determine the casual contact level. We then compare those levels to determine if there is more of the illicit substance on the seized cash than the quantity from the bank. 

From what I have read, it is difficult to obtain precise quantitative results through IMS. Is this true? If so, can you explain to someone who has little understanding in chemistry why/what implications this has? Also, does this mean that it is meaningless to compare levels of illicit substances from different samples?"

Basically I'm a year out of college, and after stalling out at home I moved 1300 miles away for an extremely competitive long-term internship. Having a pretty good time of it so far, although due to the fact that I work about 50-70 hours a week, I don't get out to socialize with many people outside my job.

One of these people is a girl who works part-time here. She caught my eye pretty early and we got along great. Lots of flirting and I was seeing alotta green lights. Including instances when she told me she wanted to show me around more and take me out and about, since she's a native to the area and I'm from so far away.

Anyhow, this continued for a couple weeks while we were waiting for a day when we were both free to hang out. When the weekend came that we made plans, I found out that she was actually dating somebody else at our job!

Here's where I get pretty damn confused.

I am:
* 23 year-old guy
* Pretty good looking (at least from what I've been told, haha)
* Good sense of humor, love making people laugh
* Really laid-back and down to earth, easy to get along with


She is:
 * 22, really gives off that sweet, innocent, classy good-girl vibe
 * Has like 4 college degrees
 * Told me repeatedly that she doesn't like all the smoking, drinking, swearing that goes on with a lot of the other people we work with

Her new b/f is:
* The consensus office creep (as has been confirmed by other girls)
* **31 years old, living with his parents**
*  Has made $8/hour for the last 4 years and has no chance to climb the ladder in his dept.
*  Smokes, drinks, swears like crazy, belittles other people
* Has two DUI's and can only drive to work and back to his parents' house

I mean this is a guy who used to brag about having a ""super hot g/f"" that he had never met but only knew from this super shady web-video-chatting program on his phone. 

It was just really devastating to find out that I lost out to this guy. This girl and I seemed like such a good match, but I lost out to the creepy jerk. Here I am busting my butt to make ends meet on my own and thrive in a new overwhelming environment, and I lose to the guy who still relies on mommy to cook him dinner.

At this point I'm over the initial shock, but it still leaves me pretty confused."

I'm a senior Computer Science student currently working on internship at a large sequencing/genomics cancer research facility. I'm also doing a directed study with a professor at my University. 

The directed study is broadly termed 'Distributed Databases' but I've generally been looking into NoSQL technologies - with an emphasis on biological/medical data.

I need to do an implementation project for the course some-how related to distributed databases, this can mean implementation of a database or use of (data mining) a database. 

One idea I had was looking into [bio4j](http://www.bio4j.com/) to see if there are any cool visualizations or something neat I can *mine* for. 

I don't have a lot of biological background so I was wondering if anyone here might have some ideas that I could look into either for using bio4j or something else related. I'd like to attack this more on the computational end of things.

If some one has I particular project that may be of use to them I'd be happy to work on something like that too. 
Or if there is a student of biology/bioinformatics that is lacking in computational skills but has some ideas I'd possibly be happy to collaborate.

During the procedure, she moaned and cried out, squirming and kicking while I attempted to hold her still enough to drill my pin accurately.  

The ED attending who was managing her sedation repeatedly told the 3-day old intern (who looked queasy from all the noise) that ""*It's okay, because she won't remember any of this*.""

**""The patient won't remember"" is *never* a justification for causing pain.**  The justification is that the patient is *injured* and needs to be *fixed*, and causing pain acutely is a part of the price that we pay for relieving pain later down the road.

If I go to a party, lace a girl's drink with Rohypnol, and rape her, it's not ""okay, because she won't remember it.""  

It honestly makes me feel ashamed to see a physician or other hospital staff member attempt to use the same broken precedent as justification for causing pain.  If you are one of those people, I sincerely hope you take a moment to reflect on that thought process, because your ethical compass could truly use a small bit of realignment."

There could be an intro of the coming to earth long ago and has since been kept locked up by S.H.E.I.L.D. It has been lonely, nearly dying. It is found by the main villain (lets say Mysterio, but Chameleon would work too) who is looking for information in the hangar that it is kept in and it accidentally escapes. Peter finds it in an alleyway or something and it begins to cozy up to him and be friendly. Peter takes a liking to it and decides to study it. 

Along the way, Peter needs to find a job. Skilled in photography, he becomes a freelancer at the Daily Bugle (re-cast J.K Simmons as Jonah and Jennifer Lawrence as Betty Brandt (she can be an intern or something to make to age more believable)). Peter enjoys freelancing, but he is thrown of by rival photographer Eddie Brock (Lex Shrapnel, AKA Hodge from Captain America). 

Eventually, when Peter is leaving the house as spider-man, the symbiote tags along and attaches itself to Peter when he is in trouble with Mysterio. 
Mysterio begins taking out his plan (not sure what) but his motivation is gain respect from the city as their first (official) super-villain. He claims to be the first because he considers Curt Conners to be an unintentional villain. Not sure about casting but perhaps someone unknown would work best. 

Spider-man fights Mysterio throughout the film, and eventually he fights him with they symbiote on. Once he kills many civilians and such, the rage of the symbiote almost takes full control of Peter and in said rage he sees the only way to stop Mysterio is to kill him, which he does. Disgusted with himself, he retreats to remove the symbiote, but has a hard time getting it off. He eventually removes it and stumbles home. Not sure about an ending, but it could involve Gwen Stacy and Peter making up over a fight or something that happens earlier in film.

Post Credit: Eddie Brock is walking and find the symbiote in an alleyway just as Peter did, setting up Venom for Amazing Spider-Man 3. 

tl;dr: Venom set up with symbiote. Main Villain: Mysterio. Peter studies and develops mild friendship with symbiote. With symbiote on,  Spider-Man kills Mysterio in the midst of taking out his master plan. 

New Casting: 
Lex Shrapnel-Eddie Brock
Jennifer Lawrence- Betty Brandt
J.K Simmons- JJ Jameson
Unknown Casting- Mysterio"

(x-post from r/dating_advice)",[deleted],AskMen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/w15eu/confusing_relationship_with_a_coworker_can_any/,"**WARNING: LONG POST, but I think it's mostly relevant.*

*Background:* I'm F21, he's M22. We're both engineers and are interns for a large, well-known company for the summer and are going back to school for our final year of undergrad in the fall. We are both single and have been for a while, as far as I know. He's mentioned ex-girlfriends before in passing, so I know he's not gay.

So - there's this guy (we'll call him M), and we've been hanging out all the time this summer. We met a few weeks ago at a 5k mud run, and since then have hung out every single weekend except one where he claimed he slept the entire time and didn't do much.

When we first met, I actually barely remembered him, since he wasn't super talkative right off the bat. A few days after the 5k I remember he sat down next to me at lunch while I was talking to a mutual friend, and I thought it was weird how much this guy kept looking at me, but at that point I only vaguely recognized him from the 5k and didn't actually know his name. Then, the weekend of that interaction, we pulled an all-nighter together (with 2 other friends - 1 male and 1 female; the female has a serious boyfriend) camping out for a sale. 

After that, M started going out of his way to say hi to me, i.e. tapping me on the back, saying hey and making small talk if I wasn't even facing or paying attention to him, etc. I liked him as a friend so I didn't think much of it and was happy to engage.

One other thing I have noticed are that his feet are almost always pointed towards me when we're around each other, which according to every women's magazine is a tell-tale sign of attraction (though I'm not sure how much I can trust that).

Then this past weekend is when things started to get weird. A bunch of people from work organized a trip to a nearby city to visit a theme park, and we both signed up to go. The first night there, M forgot his ID, so he, I, and two other people went out and explored the city instead of going to a bar with the rest of our group. At first, he and I just talked as we were walking, and asked about each other's childhoods and the cities we each were from. Later we ended up jumping into a public fountain with our clothes on (might have been illegal, but anyway, not the main point of this story). I had a waterproof camera on me, so we were taking some pictures in the fountain. At one point, he yelled at me to come under a waterfall with him and take a self-picture. So...I duck under the waterfall, and for a second we're both just sitting there wet and half-naked, and we're staring into each other's eyes for like 5-10 seconds (it felt like forever, but that's probably my best estimate). I seriously thought we were going to kiss or something, but when nothing happened I just turned around and took the picture. After that, I think I started to realize I was into him, so I began paying more attention to things and making more of a conscious effort to hang out with him.

Then the next morning, when we were checking out of our hotel, I called him to see where his room was in the process. My room was probably the first to finish with everything, so we were just sitting around hanging out for a while. When I called M, he asked if he could come over to hang out with us, so I said yes and he did. (I'm not sure how significant that is other than that he seemed to be very interested in hanging out with me a lot, but I figured I'd include it.)

Then, we went to the theme park, and my car somehow got separated from the rest of the group for the whole day (we went in the wrong entrance or something). At the end of the day when we finally met up, it was because I called another guy (S) in his group and spoke to him really briefly before M grabbed his phone and started talking to me. (Note: just minutes before, a guy in my group had called S, and that time M hadn't done a thing...though that may have just been chance.) When we finally found each other, he jumped off the bench he was sitting on, held out his arms for a hug, and we literally ran at each other like we hadn't seen each other in years. We talked for a few minutes about how we wished we'd gotten to hang out, and then the group went to dinner.

At dinner, I might have been imagining things, but it seemed like he made a conscious effort to sit across from me. Throughout the meal, we kept catching each other's eyes randomly, and when we did, he'd either laugh softly and look away, or we'd wink and make funny faces at each other. We'd also agreed that the group of 4 people that had gone to the sale 2 weekends ago would take a class that was offered as a livingsocial deal, but since out of the two weekends it was offered, I couldn't make one, and the other girl couldn't make the other, we decided to go in groups of 2. As soon as I mentioned this, M quickly mentioned that he was ""free the 21st if [I wanted] to go."" (That was the weekend I could make.)

On Monday at work, he waved at me from across the cafeteria at lunch (we work in different divisions, so lunch is usually the only time we see each other), but I wasn't feeling very well (food poisoning from something I ate on Sunday or something I think) so I left pretty quickly after sitting on the opposite end of the long table he was at (think 20+ people). I could be imagining things, but I could swear I saw him steal multiple glances down the table while I was sitting there. Before leaving, I went to let the guy sitting directly to M's right know that I wasn't feeling well and was going to go get some antacid if anyone asked where I was (that guy works directly next to me in my office). When I came over, M said hey to me enthusiastically, and when I mentioned I wasn't feeling well, asked what my symptoms were, talked briefly about the class we were going to take on the 21st (I'd emailed him a confirmation that morning) and then said he hoped I felt better just before I walked away.

Then on Tuesday, I texted him in the morning (around 7 am) to see if he wanted to go rock climbing in the afternoon since we didn't have work on Wednesday for the 4th of July, and a group of people had already asked me if I wanted to go. A few hours later (around 10:30, which I later learned was shortly after he'd woken up, since he works different hours than I do), he called me to talk about something totally irrelevant (visiting my building on Thursday with his family, since without giving too much away we'll just say that my branch works on some cool stuff), then casually asked about rock climbing and mentioned he could probably come.

At lunch, we ran into each other again, and I sat down after he'd put his stuff down at the long table but had gone to the bathroom. When he came back, he saw that I'd put my stuff down one seat away from his, so he moved over next to me (causing the guy to his left to feign offense, since he left an empty seat between them by doing so). I mentioned something about how I needed to get in touch with my ride for rock climbing later, and he said he'd be happy to give me one instead...so we decided to do that.

In the afternoon when he picked me up from my building to give me a ride to rock climbing, we talked a bit in the car, mainly about our days and what we really do every day at our jobs. It actually made me sort of nervous how much he kept making eye contact with me when we talked (since he wasn't looking at the road enough while it was happening). When we were almost to the rock gym, he mentioned that he needed to stop at home to change and get all his gear, so he asked if I wanted to come in with him. I said I was fine with that, so I went into his living room and sat down (after being ambushed by his two dogs, who according to him really liked me). Before going to change, he picked up a book from the coffee table about rock climbing (which is sort of his life - on the car ride there, he mentioned that he actually hates climbing in gyms because climbing on real rocks is so much better) and told me to read it while I waited because it was his favorite book and he thought I'd like it. When he emerged from his room, he brought a huge collection of rock climbing hooks with him (and I mean huge - that thing must have been like 100+ pounds) and showed me what all of them did, even though I'd never really asked. He then offered me some ice cream before we left, so we ate and headed over to the gym.

At the rock gym, we met up with some other co-workers who mentioned they were planning to hang out later tonight at the complex I live at. I asked if M wanted to come, and he said that he would after taking a short nap after climbing.

Later that night, I met up with the rest of the group at my apartment complex, and got a text from M saying that his alarm hadn't gone off but that he'd get going soon. About an hour later, he was there, but the rest of the group was leaving to go to a movie that neither of us had any particular interest in, so we just hung out by the pool and hot tub for a while, had a few beers and talked.

Where this whole thing gets confusing to me is that I feel last night should have been the perfect opportunity for him to make a move, but he didn't. I gave him multiple opportunities to (i.e. sitting really close next to him in the hot tub and even on his lap briefly in a pool chair, though I had to move after a minute when they closed the pool at midnight). At the end of the night, we ended up in my room watching How I Met Your Mother on my bed, where I blatantly cuddled up against his shoulder, but still nothing. At 2am, he decided he'd sobered up enough to drive home, so he left, and said that he'd see me Thursday since he was probably spending the 4th of July with his family. We hugged goodbye, and that was it. (He asked if I needed a ride to get some food, since I'd mentioned I hadn't eaten that much that day and was pretty drunk as a result, but I declined.)

I'm not entirely sure what the point of this post was, but I suppose I'm worried I may have made things awkward last night if he has no interest in me. Opinions?

**tl;dr:** Guy acts like he really likes me, but doesn't make a move when we're alone. What's up with that?"

So...I duck under the waterfall, and for a second we're both just sitting there wet and half-naked, and we're staring into each other's eyes for like 5-10 seconds (it felt like forever, but that's probably my best estimate). I seriously thought we were going to kiss or something, but when nothing happened I just turned around and took the picture. After that, I think I started to realize I was into him, so I began paying more attention to things and making more of a conscious effort to hang out with him.

Then the next morning, when we were checking out of our hotel, I called him to see where his room was in the process. My room was probably the first to finish with everything, so we were just sitting around hanging out for a while. When I called M, he asked if he could come over to hang out with us, so I said yes and he did. (I'm not sure how significant that is other than that he seemed to be very interested in hanging out with me a lot, but I figured I'd include it.)

Then, we went to the theme park, and my car somehow got separated from the rest of the group for the whole day (we went in the wrong entrance or something). At the end of the day when we finally met up, it was because I called another guy (S) in his group and spoke to him really briefly before M grabbed his phone and started talking to me. (Note: just minutes before, a guy in my group had called S, and that time M hadn't done a thing...though that may have just been chance.) When we finally found each other, he jumped off the bench he was sitting on, held out his arms for a hug, and we literally ran at each other like we hadn't seen each other in years. We talked for a few minutes about how we wished we'd gotten to hang out, and then the group went to dinner.

At dinner, I might have been imagining things, but it seemed like he made a conscious effort to sit across from me. Throughout the meal, we kept catching each other's eyes randomly, and when we did, he'd either laugh softly and look away, or we'd wink and make funny faces at each other. We'd also agreed that the group of 4 people that had gone to the sale 2 weekends ago would take a class that was offered as a livingsocial deal, but since out of the two weekends it was offered, I couldn't make one, and the other girl couldn't make the other, we decided to go in groups of 2. As soon as I mentioned this, M quickly mentioned that he was ""free the 21st if [I wanted] to go."" (That was the weekend I could make.)

On Monday at work, he waved at me from across the cafeteria at lunch (we work in different divisions, so lunch is usually the only time we see each other), but I wasn't feeling very well (food poisoning from something I ate on Sunday or something I think) so I left pretty quickly after sitting on the opposite end of the long table he was at (think 20+ people). I could be imagining things, but I could swear I saw him steal multiple glances down the table while I was sitting there. Before leaving, I went to let the guy sitting directly to M's right know that I wasn't feeling well and was going to go get some antacid if anyone asked where I was (that guy works directly next to me in my office). When I came over, M said hey to me enthusiastically, and when I mentioned I wasn't feeling well, asked what my symptoms were, talked briefly about the class we were going to take on the 21st (I'd emailed him a confirmation that morning) and then said he hoped I felt better just before I walked away.

Then on Tuesday, I texted him in the morning (around 7 am) to see if he wanted to go rock climbing in the afternoon since we didn't have work on Wednesday for the 4th of July, and a group of people had already asked me if I wanted to go. A few hours later (around 10:30, which I later learned was shortly after he'd woken up, since he works different hours than I do), he called me to talk about something totally irrelevant (visiting my building on Thursday with his family, since without giving too much away we'll just say that my branch works on some cool stuff), then casually asked about rock climbing and mentioned he could probably come.

At lunch, we ran into each other again, and I sat down after he'd put his stuff down at the long table but had gone to the bathroom. When he came back, he saw that I'd put my stuff down one seat away from his, so he moved over next to me (causing the guy to his left to feign offense, since he left an empty seat between them by doing so). I mentioned something about how I needed to get in touch with my ride for rock climbing later, and he said he'd be happy to give me one instead...so we decided to do that.

In the afternoon when he picked me up from my building to give me a ride to rock climbing, we talked a bit in the car, mainly about our days and what we really do every day at our jobs. It actually made me sort of nervous how much he kept making eye contact with me when we talked (since he wasn't looking at the road enough while it was happening). When we were almost to the rock gym, he mentioned that he needed to stop at home to change and get all his gear, so he asked if I wanted to come in with him. I said I was fine with that, so I went into his living room and sat down (after being ambushed by his two dogs, who according to him really liked me). Before going to change, he picked up a book from the coffee table about rock climbing (which is sort of his life - on the car ride there, he mentioned that he actually hates climbing in gyms because climbing on real rocks is so much better) and told me to read it while I waited because it was his favorite book and he thought I'd like it. When he emerged from his room, he brought a huge collection of rock climbing hooks with him (and I mean huge - that thing must have been like 100+ pounds) and showed me what all of them did, even though I'd never really asked. He then offered me some ice cream before we left, so we ate and headed over to the gym.

At the rock gym, we met up with some other co-workers who mentioned they were planning to hang out later tonight at the complex I live at. I asked if M wanted to come, and he said that he would after taking a short nap after climbing.

Later that night, I met up with the rest of the group at my apartment complex, and got a text from M saying that his alarm hadn't gone off but that he'd get going soon. About an hour later, he was there, but the rest of the group was leaving to go to a movie that neither of us had any particular interest in, so we just hung out by the pool and hot tub for a while, had a few beers and talked.

Where this whole thing gets confusing to me is that I feel last night should have been the perfect opportunity for him to make a move, but he didn't. I gave him multiple opportunities to (i.e. sitting really close next to him in the hot tub and even on his lap briefly in a pool chair, though I had to move after a minute when they closed the pool at midnight). At the end of the night, we ended up in my room watching How I Met Your Mother on my bed, where I blatantly cuddled up against his shoulder, but still nothing. At 2am, he decided he'd sobered up enough to drive home, so he left, and said that he'd see me Thursday since he was probably spending the 4th of July with his family. We hugged goodbye, and that was it. (He asked if I needed a ride to get some food, since I'd mentioned I hadn't eaten that much that day and was pretty drunk as a result, but I declined.)

I'm not entirely sure what the point of this post was, but I suppose I'm worried I may have made things awkward last night if he has no interest in me. Opinions? (Particularly male ones...)

**tl;dr:** Guy acts like he really likes me, but doesn't make a move when we're alone. What's up with that?"

w0ubt,3,2012-07-04,Masters/Certificate + Job Issues (An European Designer who wants to study/work in the USA),[deleted],graphic_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/w0ubt/masterscertificate_job_issues_an_european/,"Hey there reddit, let me tell you about myself a little bit, I'm studying New Technologhy in Design (Basicly Graphic Design) in a very old and famous art school in Milano, Italy. I think i have a good resume, i did my internship in a very big agency who works for Nike, Zara etc. (When i was doing my internship, i took place in the poster works too) and for a well known publisher here. Then I worked in a company like GROUPON (not groupon, but alike)(which is offering deals daily). And i have good skills on Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, After Effects.

My questions: 

1) I know a topic is going on about Masters vs. Certificate program about Graphic Design, but i will ask the same thing. I'm graduating on June 2013. BTW I Have to study to get my OPT/Work Permission in the US, so not studying is not an option for me, and no matter if i study masters or certificate, i'm getting the same work permit, but my real question is: ### The Masters Degree in the USA? OR a degree from an Italian art school + certificate from UCLA Extension + a good resume/portfolio with good work/intern experience. Which will help me to get the job?

2) What about the wage? Since i'm not an US citizen, i know that they won't pay me the average-gooddesigner-wage. And i have no idea what is the pay rates over there, but if i talk about Europe, starting wage is like 1800$ a month. But i bet it's better there for a graphic designer. And i know that i will need a contract/sponsorship to get an H1B visa, so is there something like: ""Hey, you need us to get the sponsorship, and we need you because you are good, and we are not gonna pay you 30$/hr, what about if we pay you 20$/hr + and we will do your application for your H1B Visa!"" Is it common? What are my chances to get that sponsorship?

3) Job opportunities. I'm very curious about it, but when i check the job searching websites, from craigslist to monster, i see 20-30+ jobs adding everyday for a graphic designer, which gives me a hope. I'm thinking like, if i apply to 50 agencies/companies, at least 1-2 of them will hire me. What do you think?

4) Is there anyone here who owns/working for a big/normal company/agency and have an international colleague? Do you have any idea about hiring an european guy who needs a sponsorship by your company? (who has 1 year work permit)

Bonus : I have a very interesting resume, like big championships in big events (about video games;FIFA, about music;SENNHEISER) and lots of other stuff. I'm telling it because in Europe, it's kinda important, because they are looking for people who has many talents/interesting sides when they hiring a guy for creative department. Is it like this there too?


I'm so interested in your advices/opinions, especially from the people in this business already. What steps should i take, what should/shouldn't i do, any tips, anything.

Thanks!"

It was a very unstable relationship and we had a few big breakups, but we always ended up back together. This is mainly because we were both truly in love, and couldn't move on. All of the general aspects of the relationship was fine, except for that fact that as we grew up, we realized that we were two really different people. 

In highschool, we had the exact same interests, loved to go to parties, and loved to play games. Now she always wants to stay at home to watch movies and play starcraft/diablo with me, while i've lost all interest in anything that is counter-productive. You could say that within the last 6 months, i found myself, and i really want to live the world with no regrets. I want to make alot of friends, go on alot of vacations, party alot, build relationships, network, work on my car, workout etc.  However, I feel that she is seriously holding me back from enjoying my life. I like spending time with her, but i like having my own time more, or even just spending time with my friends. I hate being unproductive, and she's always complaining to me about not spending time with her.

She dropped out of college and is working part time as a waitress until Fall comes. While I am in a very difficult program in a prestigous college and working my ass off to get good internships. I honestly don't mind what she's doing with her career, because i know that I can support a family but it's just that I seriously want to make the most out of my life, and she's holding me back. She's holding me back from enjoying what i want , she doesn't respect my dreams or my goals, and just wants me to make her happy. Basically she's sooooooo unmotivated with her life because her life goal was to find a good, caring, succesful husband and she found that guy (sorry for being a tad obnoxious), while for me, my goal is to be the very best i can. I can't help but feel that she's holding me back because she just wants to spend time with me day in day out.

Oh the most annoying thing is that she was so reliant on me to give her happiness. Anytime i was busy or away, she'd text me about how sad or lonely or bored she is. I am always her source of entertainment or happiness, even when i'm super busy with my own life. 

Anyways, recently after a big fight, i just couldn't stand it and realized that I'm not happy being with her. However, she called my selfish because i only care about myself and not her, that i'm willing to break her heart for my own happiness, which is entirely true.  Now i just feel like shit and it's 2:30am and i can't sleep.

Honestly, this was more of a vent, but i would love to hear your opinion.

**TL;DR Girlfriend just wants to spend alone time with me everyday, I have goals and dreams to be the best I can and feels that she's holding me back. Am i selfish for not wanting a relationship?**"

 Other than my own design instincts, I know nothing about what an industrial design engineer would do, what are the necessary skills (artistic, software, etc.), and what do I need to know in order to get a job (likely an internship to start given my lack of knowledge on the design side).

So right now I'm an intern at a mid/big sized agency. For the past 5 weeks I've been able to work on an account with another intern and a few supervisors. The account is split between 2 teams and each of us have our own technical ""supervisor""s but we work on a lot of stuff together. I'm a rising 4th year in college so I'll be heading back after the summer ends, while she just graduated and is looking for a job.

So far it hasn't been too much of a problem and i've just been brushing it off, but today it really got on my nerves. All summer long my partner has been making sure she's the one submitting our finished materials to our supervisors and always going behind my back. I've just been trying to side step this and seek out work from my supervisors to do on my own, so she's not constantly trying to take the credit for it.

Today really knocked me off though. I had a bit of insight that I had found and shared during one of our internal status meetings to the team. They told me it was good stuff and to feel free to look more into it and let them know. I had assumed it was just a casual suggestion and decided to gather more information and just send it to our supervisors (since they were the ones who mentioned it), then less than an hour after I sent it, She takes that insight repackages it, sends it out to our entire team with a ""let me know if you have any questions!"" and doesn't credit me at all.


I understand that maybe she's desperate for a job, but seriously?? Does anyone have any suggestions on how I can go about handling this? I'm worried that my supervisors see this and assume that i'm not doing much work and being lazy. I'd like a good recommendation since this is my first real internship, but I'm afraid that she's taking all my hard work and making it out as her own..."

Twitter Founder Serves All Male Intern Staff Sandwiches With the Crusts Cut Off

By: Erin Gloria Ryan

After cofounding Twitter, web entrepreneur Jack Dorsey got busy building Square, the web company of the future. Square will allow mobile devices to accept credit and debit card payments. It will also feature an entirely male staff of interns, and all of the interns will eat sandwiches with the crusts cut off and chocolate cupcakes for dessert and it will be the No Girls Allowed club of every boy's childhood dreams. Like a treehouse for future tech millionaires!

Dorsey tweeted a picture of Square's intern staff earlier today, and the reception was, er, mixed. Anil Dash called Dorsey out on it right away, and Dorsey affirmed that, there were no female interns ""in this batch"" but that he'd love to find some. Dash suggested that Dorsey best keep his nose clean because not having any female interns at a tech company in the year 2012 is kind of a big deal, and, to his credit, Dorsey said he'd look into it. Right after he and his bros eats their crustless sandwiches.

Anyway, later tonight they're going to stay up PAST THEIR BEDTIME playing video games and watching karate movies and eating pizza and Flamin' Hot Cheetos. Best club ever.

I have really good grades and I've gotten interest from various companies, so I think I will have a pretty good amount of choice over where I end up.

Now don't get me wrong, I will still be basing my job search on practical things. But I would still like to know the answer to this question anyway. I spent college pretty much as a nun to focus on getting good grades.

I would like to know which medium to large-sized companies in the Silicon Valley are best for meeting great single guys in their 20's.

""Great"" for me means that they are smart, friendly, have varied interests, and good social skills. Don't have to be glued to a screen 24/7.

I'm interested in guys who are culturally similar to the average young educated Californian. Don't have to BE American at all, just looking for people whose lifestyle/outlook wouldn't clash. I did an internship in a big company in Campbell where at least half the young guys there were only planning to stay in the US long enough to save money to return to their home country, and marry the local virgin chosen by their family.

Many thanks for reading my question!"

I am on 1-2 10mg tablets of adderall per day and have been for the past few weeks. During my first day on medication I was much more focused and ended up cleaning my room and doing my laundry [detail post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/usc45/is_this_what_being_normal_is_like/)

Since the last post I have started my summer internship and things are going amazingly well. I am exceeding everyone's expectations for what I am able to accomplish, as well as the speed and quality of execution (They were already pleased with my work quality before meds). I have been told that I am awesome by everyone I work with on a daily basis, which is great.

Even more, as of now I have two pending job offers, both with the potential to start before I even get my bachelor's. 

What's even more:

* I go to sleep at a reasonable hour, meaning I get enough sleep.

* I am so much less stressed and actually enjoying myself at work. 
* I am much more able to nap if I need to due to my thoughts not racing as much.
* My ability to articulate my points has improved.
* I even look better. When I am on medication, my sinuses are less clogged, which helps with allergy-related eye puffiness.

The only downsides I can think of are having to drink more water to stay hydrated and, if I forget to ask for decaf in the morning, I feel uncomfortable. I basically feel like everything is buzzing. It is weird because caffeine on it's own makes me tired and adderall on it's own makes me calmer and slightly more subdued. 

TLDR: I feel like I am finally becoming the person I want to be."

I also know that getting an entry level in the gaming industry is very competitive and the job itself is not what most people think it is, but I am still very interested in getting into the field.

I graduated from UNC Chapel Hill with a BS in Psychology and am currently unemployed. I did work study as an IT in which I helped the faculty and staff with technical problems such as moving data or removing viruses. I only took one introductory course in JAVA but am teaching myself C from Carl Herold's ""Higher computing for everyone"". I know that these will probably not be good enough to appear attractive.

w0e4m,2,2012-07-03,What should I do with my 20g and 55g tanks?,Scyerline,Aquariums,https://www.reddit.com/r/Aquariums/comments/w0e4m/what_should_i_do_with_my_20g_and_55g_tanks/,"So I'm having a bit of an indecision problem and I was hoping reddit could help me out. I am a college student who recently moved into an apartment. Now that I live off campus, I've been able to get back into aquarium keeping. I currently have a 5g (planted with betta), a 10g (planted with betta), a 20g high (heavily planted with 5 male guppies and 7 cardinal tetras), and an empty 55g. I originally bought the 55g with the plan to make it a reef tank, but I've realized that setting something like that up in an apartment that I'll be in 2 years tops would be a terrible idea. Help me choose a back up plan?


Notes:
-Even when I move, I will be staying in the same city, as I already have a pretty good part time internship that has been offered as a full time job when I graduate... so a tank would have to travel &lt;2hrs in my large car.
-I already have a protein skimmer, 2 75g filters (sump isn't going to happen for now),  and two powerheads for the 55g. I do not have lights yet.
-All of my other tanks have been stocked for about 6 months. No medications have ever been used, and there have been no casualties or water quality issues so far.
-I have always wanted a SW tank, but I can wait. I also have always wanted to keep a tiger oscar and a flame angelfish (loved them ever since I was 4 years old). 


Plan A: Make the 55g a FOWLR tank. I feel like a non-reef would be easier to move. 


Plan B: Keep a young tiger oscar in the 55g tank, then move him to the 120g tank in my parents' garage when I have a more permanent residence.


Plan C: Move the fish from the 20g to the 55g and move the betta from the 10g to it (he's pretty docile and has been in a community before). Use the 10g for some dwarf puffers. Convert the 20g into a nano reef. It already has a proper fixture - I'd just need to buy some reef bulbs.


Any other suggestions? Thanks a lot!

Some background information: I'm 21f, left home to study at a university 1000km (ish) from home 3 and a half years ago. First year I got really sick, second year I moved in with the ex and got so heartbroken I failed an important part of the year. Third year I moved closer to home (500km away) but was doing a really terrible internship. After the internship (september last year) I came back home because there was nothing left for me in that city. Other than that, I had a fantastic time, met lots of wonderful people and loved making my own rules and being independent.


I have been home ever since, and while it's been nice to not have to pay rent/have any adult responsibilities, I miss my independence. I have been ready to leave home again (am still studying) for 5 months, but here is the problem - I am guilted by my mother to stay home every time I try to leave! I have an SO now, and it is very serious, which also plays into it. Basically all the arguments I have with my mum are her calling me lazy, selfish, stupid, saying I have no idea what i'm doing, that i'm going to waste my life, that i'm taking advantage of them, that I don't care about them, that I'm just going to run off and move in with the SO and start having babies (that was weird), etc, etc. I TRY to have a normal conversation but we are just too hot headed and together we clash a lot.

It has gotten to a point where I just CAN'T take it any more. It's been 5 months of this, and every time I back down because I feel very guilty about wanting to move away. Today I said I was thinking of moving soon and it all happened again. I fell like i'm back in high school and 15 again T_T


Let me just say that my parents are very supportive and only want the best for me, BUT my mum has this idea of how my life should go and i'm obviously not sticking to her plan.


I am like every other 20something year old - some know what they want to do with their life, I still don't. I've yet to finish my degree, but I've discovered that it might not be what I want to do forever. I didn't even want to finish my degree at all, but I got almost 'bullied' to finish it by my parent (I see why they did it, but I still regret sticking to it - the awful internship left me with no work self-esteem and I still can't see any work that I do as a job well done, but that's another story). That, and the fact that i'm very serious with my SO, must be too much for my mum to handle.


I can't keep living my life based on what my mum wants. I'm usually very independent, but we're a big spanish family, so family is very important. Where do I draw the line? How can I talk to her about my limits?
I've tried everything I can think of, short of just getting up and leaving! I've talked to her directly, used my dad as a mediator, tried to find out what it is she's worried about, talked to her about how supportive the SO is. It seems that every time I try to talk (and the only way we 'talk' is by shouting, nothing else gets through) she says 'oh, sorry, i'll back off' but two days later it's back to square one. She genuinely thinks i'm going to throw my life away! Sure, i've made mistakes, but i've learnt from them and not in a hurry to repeat them.


I'm at a loss, any advice/personal stories would be very useful, i've thought about this so much that it just doesn't make sense in my head anymore!

...

This is going to be long.
Brace yourself.
(Apologies in advance.)

Hi!  I'm new to the Philadelphia area.  I don't live exactly in Philly, but I live about 30 min. away in a suburban area, I think.  I'm a college student from elsewhere, but I'm in this area right now for a co-op (a longer internship, basically)

Sorry, trying to stay vague for obv reasons

I'm waaaayyy new to the area but will be here for a few months, due to work.  I've been stalking reddit for a while now, guess it was time to succumb.  Plus my older brother is a redditor and recommended that I explore the subreddits to meet people.  I've been hanging out and making some frands with co-workers but am trying to reach beyond them to anyone interested in seeing The Dark Knight Rises at midnight.  Not many co-workers want to since it's a late Thursday night before an early Friday morning of work.

I'm undoubtedly going to see this movie at midnight even if I have to be a forever loner, but if you have a group already going and/or wouldn't mind meeting someone quirky, let's see this epic movie.

A little about myself: I'm a female; still in college but can legally drink so you do that math; straight; don't mind hanging out with any race, sexuality, gender, etc.

Okay, this is really long.  I'm new to all of this reddit posting.  Yeah.

Hope to hear from ya! WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**EDIT 1:**
AHHH, I am the most indecisive person ever!
I think the KoP theatre would be best because it's a part of a mall everyone knows of, so it seems like a neutral meeting place for a first-time movie gathering. Hopefully we could go see movies/midnight premieres again, and they could take place at some of the other mentioned locations. 

Last night the tickets at KoP were sold out, but they must have opened another available showing:
12:01 AM showing: [http://www.fandango.com/uakingofprussiastadium1626imax_aaoqp/theaterpage?date=7/19/2012](http://www.fandango.com/uakingofprussiastadium1626imax_aaoqp/theaterpage?date=7/19/2012)

Before you buy your ticket (and you better!), is anyone interested in doing THIS?? 
[https://www.fandango.com/transaction/ticketing/redvines/ticketboxoffice.aspx?row_count=2823899236&amp;mid=156401&amp;refreshdate=7%2f19%2f2012&amp;tid=AAOQP](https://www.fandango.com/transaction/ticketing/redvines/ticketboxoffice.aspx?row_count=2823899236&amp;mid=156401&amp;refreshdate=7%2f19%2f2012&amp;tid=AAOQP)
(seeing the first two Batman movies starting at 6:30 PM and then seeing the midnight premiere of The Dark Knight Rises)

If someone/people are interested in the latter, I am so up for it, and then we could meet up with the redditors who are only interested in the midnight showing

Let me know what you think!?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**EDIT 2:**
Talk about a code-filled last week! (Or was I the only one following that?....)
Anywhooo... okay, procrastination got to me again (damn.) and I guess the Batman movie marathon of all three movies (from 6:30 PM - 3 AM-ish) got sold out at KoP before I could get a ticket :'(. The midnight showing at the IMAX is sold out too, but the regular movie screening at midnight is not (thanks, jello562)

I REAALLYYYYY want to see the marathon though. Sure, I could pirate the movies and watch them for free before seeing the midnight premiere of TDKR, BUT, when is the next time I'll ever get the cinematic atmosphere of viewing all three of them in a row?

Exactly.

Not everyone has a personal home movie theatre, &lt;insert any celebrity's name ever&gt;

So, I just now bought a ticket for the marathon at the Warrington Regal. Seeing as this is last-minute and not well organized, I'll probably be trudging through the marathon alone. However, if you are also interested (or at least want to see the midnight movie together), PM me and we could go from there! Here's the movie ticket link: [http://www.fandango.com/regalwarringtoncrossingstadium22andimax_aanja/theaterpage?date=7/19/20129http://www.fandango.com/regalwarringtoncrossingstadium22andimax_aanja/theaterpage?date=7/19/2012] (http://www.fandango.com/regalwarringtoncrossingstadium22andimax_aanja/theaterpage?date=7/19/2012)

Thanks for everyone's interest and feedback. I would totally drive to a farther away theatre except that this movie is really friggin' long (almost 3 hrs) and I do still have to be at work by 8 AM on Friday. If I drove back from a theatre an hour away after the movie finally ended, I would be sleeping near sunrise (which is less than ideal)

For whatever the next midnight blockbuster is and for any other cool activities coming through (concerts, fairs [do they do those in Philly?], festivals, etc.), I'll be sure to
A) Truncate the fuck out of these messages
and B) Make a more concrete, organized plan

I'm not even from PA, but I've realized/learned that saying, ""Hey who is seeing this movie around the Philadelphia region?!"" will bring forth many different locations and responses.

Join me if you'd like! Have fun at your respective showings if not! I really cannot fucking wait to see this movie!!! Been waiting long enough...

Until next time-"

I'm a third-year Chemical Engineering student from Queen's that has been looking everywhere for an internship. My interest mainly lies in Oil and Gas as well as Mining, but the search has so far turned up nothing. I've been using sites like Indeed.ca, Monster.ca, SimplyHired.ca, my university's career website and scouring company websites.

One of the problems is that I have only a Learner's Permit for driving (soonest I can get a probationary Class 5 is in February), which has restricted me from field work in places like Fort McMurray and that I am not from Alberta, which according to my Calgary friends makes it much harder to find a position (apparently they would want to interview someone in person but don't want to pay for someone to fly in out-of-province).


So, as position openings become less and less frequent I am at the point where finding a new and potentially useful internship posting resource would be extremely helpful.

First a little bit of background I am 22, a graduate in history from a top 30 UK university and I came to the decision over 18 months ago I wanted to be in the wine trade. I have made some what I feel are good steps since then. I started working as a barman in a gastro-pub while doing this I was working at wine tastings of a local wine merchant as a pourer and waiter I then progressed to helping them with some shop and admin tasks on my days off from the pub. This meant a fairly punishing schedule of very few days off finishing late at the pub and then working office hours before being back at the pub to work the evening weekends etc but I was happy as I felt I was getting the most of the opportunities offered to me. After more then 6months I felt this wasn't really going anywhere I felt they were never going to offer me a full time job but were happy to pay me minimum wage to stack their shelves and do incredibly boring admin. 

Anyway. A job came up at a smaller merchant to work as they got busier in the lead up to Christmas (2011) there was also a possibility of it lasting longer as they had recently expanded and were making big gains (33% rise in annual sales) so I took it and it was great for a couple of months I worked on tasting notes, served customers and started studying for my WSET Advanced with the help of the very supportive owner. Alas the build up to Autumn and Christmas were very poor as growth shrunk in the UK economy and so on the 23rd of December I was let go they were really nice about it and gave me some nice presents, stay in touch, no hard feelings.

Anyway, so I took Christmas to create a new battle plan I felt what I should do was get qualified (to an extent) and get some hands on experience. I took my meagre savings and enrolled in the WSET London head office Novice to Professional qualification (by the way I nailed it, Merit for the written and Distinction for the tasting) and through a contact I'd made last year I got an Cellar Hand Internship in Australia so I got on a plane and went to work a vintage. Had a fantastic time met some truly lovely people and will never forget those 11 weeks. Unfortunately this has left me penniless as I didn't get paid in Australia and couldn't receive any welfare. I am back in with Mum and Dad (lucky they took me in) on the condition I found work asap. Luckily a local hotel restaurant was hiring and I got a job there. This isn't what I want to do, I spend more time polishing cutlery then doing anything with wine. They have asked me to write some tasting notes for their wine list and provide some basic training to other members of staff which is positive.

The problem is I feel I have done well to get some good experience, off my own back with some lucky offers and chance meetings of the right people. It's just I am at a bit of a dead end now. I have applied for every job I have found going all I get is friendly but still demoralising letters/emails back saying you've done well but not the specific experience or enough experience for what we need. I appreciate this the economy is squeezed and they need to make the best possible hire but I can't be a waiter forever.

My question is short but possibly not simple. What would be your move from my position?

Thank you in advance.

TL;DR - Gained some solid experience in the wine trade - bar work, worked at tastings, worked in a shop as a trainee advisor, got WSET Advanced Level 3, worked a vintage in Australia but am now struggling to get further. Advice?"

Apparently I ended up babbling away :) please skip to the bold text for TL;DR.

I can't really tell you how I ended up here. It all started when I got involved in internet communities as kid, leading to moderating forums, leading to cultural studies while helping out develop start up online projects and ended up getting internships in internet marketing and SEO.

I have been working as SEO marketer for an e-commerce company for a few months, I was led to believe that I would assist owner as he was an SEO expert but he wasn't really and employed black market tactics. I believe I will lose my first full time job after only a few months due to the fact that I can't keep up with his weekly artificial backlinks quota, nevermind the rest of the things I have done for the website such as blog posts, organizing online events, optimizing website and user interface, etc.

Now my question is, what should I do from here? I have a lot of solo experience because of my hobbies and have been researching, reading up, following updates online. I believe I can do well by myself with basic analysis, optimizing, producing content, etc. 

**However, what I want is to work with fellow SEO experts to learn the ropes of data gathering, data mining, the deep SEO stuff and most importantly, how the information is organized, how the reports are written for the bosses of the companies or clients (if agency)**

Unfortunately, I go to a school with a pretty awful art program that offers literally no design courses–the University of Chicago. This summer I've been working as an assistant for the creative team within our business school's marketing department and as an illustrator/graphic designer intern for a small company in Chicago, and it's helped me realize that I would like to pursue a career in graphic design. As mentioned though, I am unable to major or even take coursework in design; I'll be likely graduating with a double major in mathematics and economics. What can I do to pursue a career in graphic design? Do I attempt to build up a portfolio/experience? Try to apply to a master's program in graphic design after I graduate? Any advice is appreciated, thanks!"

**Edit 2:** Taking into consideration the amount of time this post has had on this site and the rate of attrition for new posts, it's fair to say I can expect there to be no more new responses. So, with that said, I'd just like to give out my acknowledgments and thanks to those of you who have responded. 

Thank you aimeelee252 and ElysianBlight for your perspectives on childcare. I still have great admiration for your field and may, possibly, someday even pursue a career in that field, if I can't break through in my original passion: writing. If I do follow through in childcare, however, I think it's fair to say that I will be moving to Australia to do so. I've always had a love for that country anyway. 

And thank you greshh, esq. for sharing your passion with your internship in law. Quite a bit of new information learned in your response and, for that, I thank you greatly. 

I wish you all good luck in your respective careers and many bright and happy future days. "

The project has almost no over-site(and is apparently fairly low priority) and they have left it up to us(the 5 interns) to work through it.

My problem is that 2 of the interns, both from the same school don't do anything at all. Me and the other 2 interns have done 98% of the work(97% of the first program 100% of the second).

I am a grown ass man, and I wasn't hired to babysit my fellow interns and I don't really feel like I should have to. I am however the most experienced programmer(not saying much) in the group, and have had several leadership roles in the past so I have sort of taken on the role of project manager. I tried to help them with stuff to do, but nothing ever comes of it so I have stopped bothering to even talk to them at this point. 

The last task I asked one of them to do, was brought back to me an hour later with no solution and a declaration that they are going to go back to what they are working on before(which is ????? I couldn't tell you).

We have a supervisor but he is busy with his own shit and I don't feel like it's my job to keep tabs on if my coworkers are working, so complaining to him almost seems petty to me.

any suggestions? 

One of my thoughts was to talk with the internship coordinator at my school.

I'm trying to teach myself VBA for a job at work (they give the interns the VBA stuff...), and I'm getting stuck on the simplest of things.

I am trying to make a bordered table that is three columns wide. The amount of rows in the table has to be based on the amount of inputs the user has. In my crappy code, that is the value given for ""Count"" by the user.

My issue is that I have no idea how to select the range I need. The only way I know how to select a range is using:

    ActiveCell.Range(""Top left cell:Bottom right cell"").Select

If it were from A1 to C8, how do I make that work? I wish it would just work like:

    ActiveCell.Range(""A1:C(count)"").Select

This is what I have so far:


    Option Explicit

    Dim Count As Long

    Dim CFLArray() As Variant

    Sub TableCreation1()

        Range(""A1"").Select

        ActiveCell.FormulaR1C1 = ""Time (days)""

        ActiveCell.Offset(0, 1).Range(""A1"").Select

        ActiveCell.FormulaR1C1 = ""CFL (measured)""

        ActiveCell.Offset(0, 1).Range(""A1"").Select

        ActiveCell.FormulaR1C1 = ""De (estimated)""

        ActiveCell.Offset(0, -2).Range(""A1:C1"").Select

        Selection.Font.Bold = True

        ActiveCell.Columns(""A:A"").EntireColumn.EntireColumn.AutoFit

        ActiveCell.Columns(""A:A"").EntireColumn.EntireColumn.AutoFit

    
        ActiveCell.Offset(0,1).Columns(""A:A"").EntireColumn.EntireColumn.AutoFit

    
        ActiveCell.Offset(0,2).Columns(""A:A"").EntireColumn.EntireColumn.AutoFit

        ActiveCell.Select

    End Sub



    Sub FindRange()

        Range(""A2"").Select

        Count = InputBox(""How many pairs of data do you have? "")
    
    End Sub

I taught myself VBA a day or so ago using a book my work had, but I couldn't find anything along these lines in there. My internet searches failed as well. The worst part is I know it's going to be incredibly simple.

Also, if my code is awful, it's probably because I have zero programming experience before this, haha. Sorry.

Thanks for your help!"
w3g9s,1,2012-07-05,"Waiting to see if I'm still hired or fired from my internship, under a boss who's, for lack of a better term, a derp and a jerk. Advice / similar stories, Redditors?",cherrytinted,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/w3g9s/waiting_to_see_if_im_still_hired_or_fired_from_my/,"I currently work at an advertising firm for my internship. I make $13/hr and one college credit for working this summer. That's the good news.

Now comes the bad parts of my internship. My boss is a scatterbrain and treats me like I'm a freak. He trained me three weeks before I finished the school year to enter the job, and then expected me to remember everything. When he trained me, he trained me in parts, so when I did my work, I'd at least miss something and he'd alert me to it too late to fix it. Then there's the matter of getting help -- whenever I'd ask for it, he'd seem pissed that I was interrupting him, in a ""how dare you not know this"" type of way, even though he's done nothing to help me get on the right track. I was left alone to figure out programs that I had never heard of before, and search the company site for forms on my own (literally, it became ""Print out blah blah,"" and then I have to figure out the ridiculously huge, search-engine-less site to find it). He also has a habit of expecting me to remember things that he doesn't even tell me, or doing five things all at once and not giving me the quick minute off from a current task to write things down. If I forget something or make a mistake, he'll just brag in my face about how proud he was of his last intern, who apparently had to be Miss Perfect, because she never fucked up. One of the worst parts: I'm a digital media student (animation, 3D design, etc.). He wanted digital media students, but I think he wanted something closer to a comp sci or business major, because I'm doing nothing creative. NOTHING related to ANY aspect of my major.

Two weeks ago, he called me and told me that he has to consider whether or not he wants to keep me as an intern. I've apparently made tons of mistakes (which he hadn't alerted me of until that morning), he's not willing to/can't train me more, he doesn't trust me to make decisions on my own, etc. Meanwhile, I was the one who had to remind him many times to get his butt out the door to head to his appointments. Anyway, he said his vacation ended on the 9th, and that I'd find out then.

So I've been out of work for two weeks, applying everywhere I can while I wait on him to give me his verdict. At this rate, the higher pay means nothing to me, and I don't need the credit because I'm practically done with college and this internship will give me nothing to help me flesh out my portfolio. I've been gypped out of over $500 in pay, forced to sit there and twiddle my thumbs while I wait for him to remember to call me. I'm supposed to be learning, but he's unwilling to teach me anything or ""waste his own time"" on me.

My question to you is: should I quit now? The pay's not worth it if I'm under stress and then just made to feel guilty about innocent mistakes, but that's the thing -- I DO need the money.
Another one is: Ever have a similar situation?"

I guess what I'm asking is if I should name the github repository I use something related to my name or a common internet alias. I feel like using my name would be better, because then the rest of my internet footprint (I don't know of anything negative, but there are certainly political/religious views espoused) separate from an internship application. But I still find myself wanting to use my alias because I'm used to it and I feel like I'd be more a part of the github community if it didn't look like a linkedin profile.

So what would you guys recommend?

w3a2c,0,2012-07-05,I have too much confidence. Its becoming a problem. Need advice.,confidence_galore,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/w3a2c/i_have_too_much_confidence_its_becoming_a_problem/,"Made a throwaway for this because a lot of you will burn me for saying this but here it goes.

 I'm 23, male and i've always had a lot of confidence. Mostly because of the way I was raised. My dad always used to make me walk straight, head high. Our family has ""good genes"" as we always said and I was raised to believe I'm capable of anything.

Other people don't seem to like that. Friends, some of my family, co-workers are all appalled by my confidence. Even my girlfriend tells me to tone it down. People around me tend to feel insecure and ""less than me"" which is of course never my intention. 

To be honest I have my insecurities, but the confidence just masks that and noone notices. I also realise that it is kind of a luxury position; lack of confidence is way worse than what i'm displaying here but hear me out. 

Its really becoming a problem for the people around me. My ex-gf developed anorexia (not entirely because of me but I can't shake the idea that i somehow imposed an inferiority complex), my current GF is super confident and of course I'm the only one that made her feel insecure ever. People at my internship are interpreting it as arrogance and a ""wrong attitude"", making it a problem for me as well. 

Note: My confidence is always limited to what I can do. I do not boast about being able to do stuff that I can't and I'm always willing to admit if i'm incapable of things. I just know i'm capable of great stuff and so is everyone else. I try to convince my gf that she can do anything if she just puts her mind to it but she just shrugs it off and becomes annoyed.

I don't know what to do, how to change this, where the problem lies. Is it wrong for me to be too confident? I don't want to bother other people but I don't want to be less confident about myself because I know how lucky I am.

Any advice, Reddit?

I graduated with a finance degree this year and I'll be working for a mid-sized life company in New England.

During the application process I really didn't think my chances were that great. I had a 3.0 gpa, only one exam, and one internship from last summer. What I think did work for me, however, was good communication and interviewing skills. 

I took a lot of time drafting my cover letter and I think that had a lot to do with landing an interview in the first place. My opinion is that while later on in one's career, cover letters tend to be more professional and formulaic, it's acceptable and sometimes effective to add some tasteful flair if you're just starting your career. I felt that by taking the time to address certain weaknesses on my resume and by demonstrating enthusiasm in a genuine way, my application received more attention from HR than if I had put in less effort in those regards. 

In terms of my interview, I think I succeeded by guiding the discussion toward areas I'm strong at. One of the main points I emphasized was my problem solving skills. My interviewer ended up offering me some brain teasers and case studies to work through. The advantage here was that by doing so, both of us were having fun and the time slot was filled so that I didn't have to answer too many awkward questions like ""what is your biggest weakness?"" or ""describe that time you really screwed things up."" If you have interesting and relevant things to say, say them! Also don't be afraid to make some basic small talk (without going too much off track) to show that you'd be a fun person to work with. 

I guess what I really want to get out there is don't worry if you happen to be in a situation where your exam progress or grades don't reflect your abilities. If you have the ability, there's always one way or another to convince employers. Play the numbers game but also play it well. "

Another event, in the September during my last semester in college (I graduated a semester early), I approached a professor about an internship. She was awesome, the 'career guidance person' had me filling a resume up with bullshit buzzwords and crap, and this IT professor took a look at it and approached me about it where I admitted that I didn't like it but took their advice on it. After we re-wrote it, I had 3 interviews by the end of September, and started working there first week in October. Flashfoward to the end of the semester, I approach my boss asking about full time employment. He informs me that they don't have space for another salaried member but could stay on as an intern (always was paid) and could probably expand my hours. He said if a spot opened up I would be the first he would approach.  On the way back to the office from the conference room, a co-worker walked up to the boss and gave her 2 weeks notice, he turned to me and offered me the position.

We kicked him out once, and then he ran back in as soon as the door was opened again. I went down to the door and told him he needed to leave. He started being rude, so I told him, ""Get the fuck out of my house before I call the fucking cops."" He started to walk out the door and then said, ""Fine, but who invited the fucking lesbian?""


I'm not gay, but I have a lot of friends who are and the fact that he was trying to insult me by calling me a lesbian made me so mad! The nerve of this guy! Just because I have short hair and I'm not afraid to stand up to some douchebag that's a foot taller than me? What I should have said is, ""Even though I'm not gay, I bet I still get more pussy than you do,"" and then slammed the door in his face. Too bad I thought of that comeback an hour too late. Instead, I just glared at him and shut the door.


I've never experienced anything like this before. I'm living in a different state this summer because of an internship. Back home, I would never have a party where some random person would be capable of coming in, but that's a little harder to control in a college town where that is the norm and in a house where 5 other girls live.



**TL;DR: Some guy calls me a lesbian, should have said, ""Even though I'm not gay, I bet I still get more pussy than you do.""**"

w2tqw,2,2012-07-05,What does it take to get a job in web design? Am I one of those rare web designers that has to go to grad school?,[deleted],web_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/w2tqw/what_does_it_take_to_get_a_job_in_web_design_am_i/,"I've been applying everywhere and can't seem to find anything. Even the internships won't take me. What am I doing wrong? Is it my portfolio? I have mostly student work in it, though I do have one website that was launched and is used by the general population. Is it my resume? I don't have much experience, which is probably why I'm not going anywhere.

Really, any of these reasons could be why I'm not getting a job, but I just want to know if this is normal. I did go to college for web design, but the school wasn't anything special, and I know that it's the skills, portfolio, and experience that are far more important. 

Anyway, I've been applying since January, graduated in June, and have only received two phone calls from employers, and none of them have followed up with me. I at first thought it was my disability that is scaring people off, but now I believe it's my portfolio. I've applied to anything that is entry level that requires less than two year's experience. That means that I've scraped the bottom and found nothing.

My plan is to apply for a few more months and, if I don't get any bites, go on to grad school. I know that a master's degree isn't ideal for web design work, but if I haven't gotten a job, I'm going to assume that it's my portfolio. While I'm in grad school, I'll do an assistantship so I don't have to pay for tuition, work assorted internships and jobs if I can get them, and work on getting my portfolio up to speed. 

Is this a good plan? What am I doing incorrectly? I've even tried networking (complete with business cards), but nobody seems interested. I plan on going to a few conferences to try and see if I can get a job at one of those places, though I'm starting to get discouraged. 

Sorry if this seems like I'm complaining, but I'm just curious as to whether or not this is normal. Do most people have this much trouble finding their first job? I would have posted on /r/jobs, but you guys are more familiar with the specific business. 

Edit:

Here is a screenshot of my (incomplete) portfolio. [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/WNmZd.jpg) link. (Does anybody know of a better photo uploading service? Imgur converted my link to .jpg for some reason. It was originally .png.) There is also a mobile version as well, of which I'm currently taking a screenshot. The site design is responsive, though some of the older pieces in my portfolio aren't. Some pieces are missing, because they're either being renovated, or, in one case, accidentally violated Android's terms of use (long story associated with that one – essentially, I was allowed to use the Droid font before, but not now, so the site needs a complete redesign). I can link directly to most of those pieces if requested, however. 

Edit2:

Again with the .jpg! Anyway, here's a screenshot of the mobile site: [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/ThwDQ.jpg). It's not perfect, but it does show that I can do mobile sites.

By the way, I am doing some freelance, but nothing that is good enough to be on my portfolio. It's mostly through places like elance.com, because nobody else seems to want my work. "

He had a small internship at a local store designing shirts, flyer, and even silk screening shirts. He was really passionate about being a designer. As a student he won two national competitions and had high hopes for his future. After graduation he spent the year reworking his portfolio and taking on multiple jobs to raise money to buy silk screening setups, large format printers an many other machines. ( he can basically run a print shop! ) He has been pulling all nighters sending out resumes and cover letters but things just haven't been going his way. I feel that he is amazing at what he does but he is really starting to doubt his skill now and has even talked about looking at a different trait. I know the job market is tough but I really think my brother deserves a chance or at least some words of encouragement. I feel that if you guys can check out his website and send him an email about his work he would really enjoy it, I really think that is the spark he needs to really get him back to that passion he once had

Would also like to work on my (horrendous) Spanish.",payco,penpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/penpals/comments/w2h9m/23maustin_tx_looking_for_pals_from_all_over_the/,"Howdy! My name's Matt. I graduated from Texas A&amp;M last year with a bachelor's in Computer Science, and have been working as a software engineer in Austin ever since.

I guess to start, I should say that I have a slight preference for snail mail, for its sheer romanticism (and to work on my handwriting!), but e-mail is also fine. I'm a fast typist after all.

Anyway, like I said, I'm a programmer, and love tinkering with computers. I'm a pretty big Apple fan, but not really what people would call a fanboy--I complain about the choices they make on a regular basis, and am nitpick the products I own to a pretty severe degree, but at the end of the day their products seem to be the tools best suited for my use case.

I was born in New Mexico, moved to Houston when I was eight, and have yet to get used to the heat and humidity out here. Thankfully it's not so bad at my current location. I used to hike a lot in New Mexico, so I was pretty happy when I got to intern in Albuquerque for a couple summers!

I love reading, particularly a well-crafted fantasy series (I absolutely love the detail that Tolkien put into his world in LoTR) or science fiction. I love reading and thinking about how technological advances can improve society in coming decades, but it always seems like the dystopian novels end up touching me the most.

I'm also into finance and economics; for a long time there, I was managing my money via double-entry accounting, but I gave it up for a budgeting app I really like...

I don't have cable, so I only watch what's on Hulu or Netflix. My favorite current shows are Doctor Who, Community, Futurama, 30 Rock, Castle, and Modern Family in that order. I also love ""classic"" sitcoms like Friends, Frasier, Cheers, and Arrested Development. I enjoy movies as much as the next guy (although I'm having a really hard time getting excited for The Dark Knight Rises... Bane just isn't a compelling villain to me).

I love cooking; since I got my own place, I've been experimenting with a lot of ""essential"" recipes and working my way up through complexity. Lately, I've been trying out recipes that don't need carbs; my mother has Celiac's disease, so I like passing her recipes, and I've been trying the low-carb Keto diet anyway. I also love a good cup of coffee (I use an aeropress) and a good pot of tea (Earl Grey with a touch of cream).

I'm sure there are details I'm forgetting, but that's what our correspondence will be for anyway! I'd love to hear from people all over, so feel free to PM me your address, physical or electronic!"

I really do like the look of it, I'm just worried about the pain during and after...especially after, because of the heat wave = sticky = no A/C in my apt = super fucking hot = GROSS = sore and infected ear. I also heard the healing time is long - but how long? Does your ear still hurt after the 6 month period, the 1 month period, etc.? Can you take showers without much pain?

As far as my piercings go, I have 3 - two on my left lobe and one on my right (the second one on the right closed up - planning to get that redone in the winter). It didn't hurt very much getting those two done, but I have gotten them done with a gun at the mall. So in comparison to the gun piercing, where does a helix piercing done with a needle rank?

I'm also worried about looking unprofessional for job interviews and whatnot - I'm still in college and plan on looking for internships in about a month (for the school year). Obviously, if I do choose to get one, I can't remove it so quickly. 

Also, my parents wouldn't be very happy with me, but eh.

So help me, r/piercings! What should I do?

Figuring that this would be an excellent opportunity for me to obtain field experience before applying for med school – I accepted the job.

This is where my gaming problems commence… Because I’m living in Shanghai, I’ve had to use a VPN to bypass the Great Firewall so that I can continue accessing Youtube, Facebook, Twitter, etc. Because of my VPN usage, Blizzard bans my Diablo 3 account because different IP connections are obviously suspicious. I have no complaints here; this shows at least they take their security seriously. My nightmare begins when it’s time to contact customer service to get my account UNBANNED. Because I’m living in Shanghai, I have to either wake up super early to call US customer support, or sleep really late due to the time difference – neither of which is appealing due to my busy work schedule. The 3 times I tried to call, I was put on hold for more than FOUR hours without ever hearing from a representative. A message played over and over while I waited reminding me that my problems could “most likely” be solved by submitting a ticket to battle net. Sick of the endless waiting, that’s what I ultimately decide to do.

In my ticket, I clearly outline my current situation and provide proof of my identity including screenshots of my account after login with an authenticator, login of my email, login of the Paypal linked to my account, AND a screenshot of the VPN service I was using with a list of all the IP’s I’d used to connect thus far.
The message that I received a few days later was short and concise – “We have reviewed your case – please call customer service to have your account unlocked” ….
Ok, no problem I’ll call again.

FIVE hours later, I finally get a representative from the UK to answer my call and in five short minutes the helpful chap unlocks my account for me and tells me that he white listed all my ip’s so that my account wouldn’t get locked again. He also apologized profusely for the excessive amount of time I’d spent waiting for the call.

One day later, my account is banned again. For the same reason.
What have I done to anger the gaming gods?

Tl;DR Account banned – finally unbanned after excessive waiting – immediately banned again for same reason

I've heard plenty of people on both sides, and the people who say it doesn't matter always talk about how much more practical experience matters. I would agree, but these people always talk as if the person asking the question has fifteen years of relevant experience when they are applying for jobs, when the demographics of this site suggest that many of those people asking the question are or soon will be looking for their first ""real"" job. 

As someone who falls into the category of soon-to-be college graduate, I feel like it's important to get a straight answer to this question: When I am applying to entry level career positions, and I have no experience beyond a summer internship (nearly all of my fellow applicants will have no more than that amount of relevant experience), will my GPA be considered both as a selection tool for granting an interview, and as a selection tool for offering a job? I don't see what other information besides my GPA and interviewing skills a recruiter could use when interviewing ten people on my campus for a position. If you could, please add your industry in your response so readers can get a feel for the differences in various areas of work.

Edit: If you could, please elaborate just a little on what exactly you were judged on, if not, or in addition to, GPA."

Now that I've gotten some extra cash and that I'm working, and finally getting annoyed with all my fanboyish friends who complain whenever the word Apple is so much as uddered, I really need an upgrade to my laptop that isn't 10 pounds.  I'll be commuting soon, so that will probably mean I'll be at the school for most of the day.  It also seems as if ever since I've started working in an IT internship, Macs are, in a poor way of saying it, retard-proof.  Which is good, because I need something stable that will work.  Anywho to my real questions at hand...

1) How often do MBPs break or have a part go bad in your experience - how durable are they?  I'm looking for the ""it just works"" the most here, because if I'm using this every day, I don't want to deal with problems.  I'm optimally looking for a laptop that will carry me through the next five years (I do have a pretty nice gaming set up - I'm just sick of swapping out something at least once a year, and that's more expensive for laptops)

2) How well does Boot Camp work?  Will I be able to run VS2010 without problems?  Can I have both a Wndows 7 and Linux partition along with a Mac partition?

3) Which model is best?  I'm looking at the April 2010 refurb, October 2011 refurb, and buying new.  The 2011 refurb vs. buying new seems trivial for what you're getting for $200, and I keep seeing people having driver issues with HD Graphics 4000, but maybe someone knows different.

4) Is AppleCare worth it?  A $300 or whatever it is warranty seems a little ridiculous when there are no Apple Stores within an hour and a half of where I live, just ""Apple Certified Repair Centers"" AKA Best Buy whom I don't really trust with PCs after having an incident with their Geek Squad in which they were trying to scam me.  Do they tend to have the same great Apple customer service I see talked about, or would a warranty from SquareTrade be fine?

5) How well do they game?  I'm not largely concerned about gaming on the go, I have my desktop for that.  I would love to be able to play at a steady framerate: Team Fortress 2, Counter-Strike: Source, League of Legends (in Bootcamp of course), as my old laptop can barely do that.  I'm not sure what the real answer is due to grossly different things shown by YouTube videos and benchmark results online.

Sorry that I have posted a LOT of questions.  I've done a lot of research online but these are the main questions I'm interested in and personal answers are best to me.  I've always been a diehard Windows person, but my god it seems to become less reliable and if they're going to try being shiny with their UI, I might as well go with the most shiny UI."

Part of my duties included being sort of an internal help desk guy because my co-workers found out I was smarter than the average bear with computers. It was easier to call me than the firm we used for tech support. Also, I knew the tax and accounting software better.

Anyways, one time we upgraded my boss' Palm Treo 700p to a Blackberry. Our tech support firm set up BES on our Exchange server, we got the Blackberry registered and everything seemed to be set to go.

One problem: one habit he developed was relying on AutoComplete in Outlook basically as his address book. Because Blackberry doesn't use ActiveSync like Palm OS did, there was no way we were going to get that functionality on his Blackberry. Also, we're talking about hundreds of e-mail addresses, so it was infeasible to import them into his Address Book.

No matter how many times I tried to explain that to him, I would get called into his office every few weeks and get the whole rundown again about how it wasn't suggesting e-mail addresses like it does in Outlook or his old phone.

Eventually the firm decided to hire one of the interns and lay me off because my billable hours were low due to all my computer work, so the problem eventually went away.

I love Spider-man, and went into this movie with an open mind. I came out upset and disappointed. Let me breakdown the aspects of the movie. 

Peter Parker – I don’t blame Andrew Garfield, as I believe he did the best with what he was given, but I did not like this version of Peter Parker. Peter is not some skateboarding hipster. He is a science nerd. I would never be seen in class doodling or not paying attention. He would be sitting in the front row taking notes intensely. He may have been a social outcast, but he was never mopey, or sad. He enjoyed his schoolwork, and going to science exhibits. This version of Peter felt like he cared more about how to make his hair go just the right way in order to make it seem like he cared, but not really. His teachers and faculty adored him. The real Peter Parker would have applied for the internship with Connors without having to sneak in to investigate him. Also, he is shy and respectful and would never be as abrasive as he was towards Captain Stacy at dinner. He would be the type of guy to arrive in his best suit to dinner with his girlfriend’s parents and try to make a good impression. 

Spider-man – I don’t know what it was, but his humor and wit didn’t really seem right here. My like a smart-ass jerk than witty and playful. He assaulted police officers. Not really something Spider-man would do. The action sequences were fine, but I never really felt like he was in true danger. None of the lizard fights were really memorable. They fought 3 times and nothing remarkable happened during any of the battles, except for the lizard breaking the web-shooters, which was actually pretty interesting. That’s one thing that is unique about this movie. The mechanical web-shooters are a big part of the comics and they worked well here. But the movie should have done a better job of explaining why he needed them. He seemed to be doing fine without them for the first part of the movie., but then he just decides he should swing around like tarzan? At least he in the original movies it was part of his powerset, so he decided to make use of something he already had. 

The Lizard/Curt Connors – The Lizard has always been a great villain for spidey because Curt Connors was such a good friend of Peters. Curt Connors is a good man. He is not a take-over-the-world type. The Lizard and Curt Connors are essentially two different characters. This movie tried to combine two and show how the lizard was influencing Connors, kind of like how the Green Goblin and Norman Osbourne started out as split personalities in the first movie and then combined into one true villain by the end.  I would have preferred if Connors had stayed transformed as the Lizard and then Peter has to find a way cure him and save the city. Also, one of my biggest complaints also would have been one of the easiest to fix. The Lizard’s labcoat. It is basically his supervillian costume. How hard would it have been for the creators to just have him leave his labcoat on while he fighting spidey. Its such an iconic part of the character and such an easy thing to include. 

Gwen Stacy – She felt like a brainy, blonde Mary Jane as opposed to the Gwen we’re used to. Gwen was always more innocent, and shy. Mary Jane was the brash, rebellious one. I have no problem with Gwen being a smart nerd. Just look to spectacular spider-man. She filled the role quite well. But there needs to be more to distinguish her from Mary Jane than being intelligent. Emma Stone did a great job, and definitely looked the part, but the character needed more time to be fleshed out. I actually thought she was one of the best parts of Spider-man 3, even in the short amount of screen time she had. 

Captain George Stacy – In the comics, he was actually a big fan of spidey and Peter. Here, he doesn’t like either of them. He acted as a second father figure to Peter after Uncle ben’s death and encouraged the romance between Peter and Gwen. In fact, he even deduced that the two of them were the same person. One of the biggest stories of spidey’s history was the death of captain stacy. It was very meaningful and tragic. Captain Stacy did not die fighting a supervillian, or buying spidey some time to stop some big threat. He died pushing a child out of the way from some falling debris. This is significant because it outlines the kind of man he was. Willing to sacrifice himself to save one life. He was an average man with an extraordinary heart. I think the movie missed out on a big opportunity to keep him as a supporting character and give his death more meaning later, especially since Dennis Leary did such a great job with the character. 

The Origin – This was a little annoying. He walks into a room full of hundreds of spiders, bumps into something, and one of them bites him. All of a sudden, he’s spider-man. Are we supposed to believe that nobody in the 10 years that these spiders have been here, that nobody else has been bitten by one of them? Then we get the scene on the subway. This was supposed to be funny, but instead was just frustrating. Parker is actually the bad guy here. He beats up a bunch of innocent guys trying to protect a woman that Peter assaults and then rips her clothes off. Gee, that’s somebody I want to cheer for. And the Uncle Ben death scene was really poorly done as well. It felt like they needed to squeeze it in, and rushed it. A store own is really going to get upset over two cents? And because of that Parker lets the guy get away.  Also, the creators felt like the line “With great power, comes great responsibility” was too overplayed and decided that it wasn’t that important to the origin, but they have Unlce Ben say something nearly identical, but without the exact phrasing. That’s down right disrespectful. 

Gwen/Peter Romance – This felt really awkward and forced. Peter has a crush on this girl he has never talked to. Ok, been there done that with MJ. But then she falls for him because he stands up to Flash Thompson? It all seems very rushed and forced. They hinted at some brainy rivalry between the two, and if that was expanded on, then maybe this would have made more sense, but as it were, it just feels like it came out of nowhere.

Flash Thompson – Flash was always a jerk in the comics, but seeing him physically beat Peter was too much. Sure, Flash would shove, and trip him, but seeing him punch and kick him angrily seemed way out of character. I did like how he came to Peter later and tried to comfort him on his uncles death and this is something that the character would do. He is a stereotypical jock, and makes fun of Parker all the time, but he is a hero and a genuinely good person. I liked how they even referenced his love of spider-man at the end, but then they cheapened it by saying he was just doing it for the ladies. In the comics, flash was spidey’s number 1 fan, and this made for an interesting dichotomy between peter and flash. 

Misc – The design of the Oscorp tower was fantastic and I liked that they didn’t make Osborn the villain right away. I like him better as a Lex Luthor mastermind type as opposed to just the Green Goblin, but I really think he should have at least made an appearance. The score for the movie was also pretty under-whelming. The original trilogy had wonderful, impactful music that set the tone. It was music that could be identified without the context of the movie. This time, it just seemed to be there. Nothing remarkable about it. 

TL;DR – The movie was pretty forgettable and does a good job of alienating comic book fans. Sony could have done something spectacular with this, and they dropped the ball on multiple accounts.

I can think of no interest that I could turn into an actual career. I had a brief web development internship which I came to hate. The only potential valuable qualities I have are that I like to put things together and make them work or repair things (I have a huge santa sack of legos).

A career assessment test done by my university told me I am suited for engineering and technologies or natural science. My dad lost his job so any investment into education will have to be completely backed by me and I don't want to be in debt with another degree that is worthless to me.

This is a somewhat pivotal point in my life so any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading."

I just found out that I got an internship at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab over the Fall semester. It is likely that my girlfriend has gotten an internship as well. Myself, her and our two kittens will be flying in between August 14th-20th...and were hoping to do some exploring before we have to go bust our asses at the internship.

We are either looking to rent a room in a house or sublease someone's apartment for the Fall. We'd like to keep our monthly expenses hovering around $800/month give or take.

If anybody has any leads, please let me know as soon as possible. Feel free to message me!

So, I linked to the publisher directly because I just started as an unpaid intern working for them a few days ago and this is the first project I've been working on. I figured maybe I could reach out to reddit to let you know about these books and hope that if some people are interested I could go to my boss and tell him how I got the word out.

Anyway, I've looked through these books and they're pretty cool. There's lots of little notes and letters the two musicians wrote to themselves or to family or friends, and I found them really interesting (coming from a guy who doesn't know much about Pete or Woody). So, if you like these books and want to help out a small press - and to make a brand new intern look good - check em out and leave a comment. I'd really appreciate anything you guys have to say.

And if this doesn't belong here, downvote me away and I promise not to post this kind of thing again."

She is in High School, but won the spot in a process that weeded out over 95% of applicants.  This isn't an answer the phone, file the papers and sit there quietly type of internship.  It's a full immersion, fun and extremely educational internship.  Oh, and I'm a guy.

Anyway, the nature of the work had us in a satellite work site for a few hours while we waited for a meeting that was to take place in a different town from the main site.  One of the women from the office shows up several hours before we were expecting her and pulled me out into the hallway.  She explained to me, in a very concerned manner, that we need to adjust the intern's duties to ensure that we are, at no time, alone in the same room together.  Because she was young, and I'm a guy.

This pissed me off.  I didn't show it, because the intern was right there, behind the door and we went right back inside.

This got me thinking a lot about our society.  I have a penis (yes, I confess, I am a man).  Due to this one fact, I am automatically assumed to be a possible threat to any female.  Not necessarily by the lady who ""intervened,"" but by a society that sees a reality that requires that intervention.  As a result, the project I was to have the intern work on never happened.  She was pulled off to do other things, that had significantly less value to her and the organization I work for.  

I am pissed, sad and disappointed.  I just wanted to get this off my chest.  Thanks for reading.

w588x,7,2012-07-06,How much easier is it to get accepted to a masters as opposed to a PhD?,agator2,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/w588x/how_much_easier_is_it_to_get_accepted_to_a/,"TL;DR - What is a masters program looking for in an applicant, I have plenty of information on a PhD? I am leaning more towards a Masters degree at this point (may change as most things do).
----
I am a student at UCSD in bioengineering: bioinformatics (a top school in the field) looking to apply to the top schools for a masters in biostatistics or bioinformatics. I have a 3.7 GPA, years of research experience and a few strong letters of recommendation. This is with 1.5 years to go (5 year plan: math minor).

All of the advice I see online is for a PhD. For PhDs they say that industry experience doesn't help on your application. I work for a bioinformatics start up and am interested on how it would affect a Masters application. Similarly they say for PhD recommendation letters from industry matter less. Is this true for a masters?

My 3.7 seems low for my ivy league dreams in a PhD program, but for a masters is it reasonable? I have done research in two different labs and will be publishing (hopefully) within the next few months in my current one. I have had a research internship at Harvard university and a public health intership in Uganda. Also for PhD programs they say that your extracurriculars can work against you and shouldn't be on the app unless it supports a research focus. Is this true of Masters?

I can only compare any of this to the curricula that I have seen for PhD programs where this would be common place. How does this fair for a masters? Could i get into a top 5 program?
sorry for the length."
w580e,15,2012-07-06,Opinions before smoking trees?,donnieb2991,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/w580e/opinions_before_smoking_trees/,"How has weed altered/solidified your views on it's legality and morality?  I know personally I grew up learning in school and DARE and whatnot that all drugs were terrible and would lead to my imminent imprisonment and/or death.  I must admit for a long time I had no reason to argue...most kids I knew growing up that smoked were and for the most part continue to be burnouts or into a whole mess of other shit.  They gave me no reason to have an open mind or stray from what had been hammered into my head for years.

And then, I first toked with my roommates my freshman in college three years ago, and have literally been opened to a whole new world since then (even outside of trees).  I often wonder how much different I would be today had I not taken that plunge and ignored my roommates' wise words.  The thought would be quite chilling at a solid [7], but then again I can rest easy knowing I'm happy with trees in my life.  I've managed to stay a productive student and member of society (even successfully passing two drug tests and holding two separate internships the past two summers), so how could I not be?!  Plus weed has brought me to the mystical and magical land of the ENTs, where anything is possible and the internet still has a soul.

So r/trees, entertain me with your own thoughts as I sit at work at a [0] for another hour on this wonderful Friday, wasting away my last summer before the real world smacks me in the face.

w54hf,2,2012-07-06,How do I break up with her?,[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/w54hf/how_do_i_break_up_with_her/,"I met her a month ago. After two and a half weeks, she has basically been living at my apartment except for two days that I was out of town.

I'm all kinds of conflicted. I lost my virginity to her - and that gives me a soft spot for her. Well, and of course I like her.

Except, there are far too many cons to dating her than there are pros. I'm more stressed than I've ever been. I feel extremely responsible for her well being and her happiness. She's very negative, has a lot of health problems, and refuses to go to the doctor to get treatment even though she's covered under her dad's insurance.

She complains A LOT. I spend almost 24/7 with her because not only does she always hang out and live with me, she works with me now too. I work as a contractor for a large electric company and got her an intern position making 25/h over her last job which is Subway at 8/h.

She won't quit Subway, and that just makes her that more stressed out and unhappy. When she's unhappy, it makes me unhappy.

She refuses to self improve. I've told her she doesn't need to make enormous changes, but if she could wear more than a guy t-shirt when we go out in public it would be nice. She doesn't do her hair, no make-up, no lip-gloss, no girly shoes, nothing. Even a tank top works, which on a few occasions she's worn - and it's like a 30% improvement up from like 30% on a scale of 100%.

She also has a bit of weight. I don't even need that to go anywhere - a little chubs doesn't bother me - but she doesn't even eat well. She's barely eating at home and when she's at Subway alone and when we're at her parents house she eats whatever she wants.

I might sound shallow wanting some of this out of her, but I'm the exact opposite. I go out, I have on my dark wash jeans, a nice striped shirt, converse, my hair snazzy, face shaved, and cologne (which she doesn't use perfume either).

I don't expect her to wear anything brand name crap or whatever, just to actually dress like a female. And she has some girly clothes! And I've also offered to buy her clothes if she doesn't like what she already has.
She makes me feel pretty fucking guilty when I don't do what she wants. Except that I stop caring, because sometimes she's really adorable and I guess I don't mind doing what she wants. She also always makes a comment to make sure I get left feeling like it's my fault.

I've asked her in return what she would like me to improve, and she says nothing! I'm perfect the way I am, and yada yada yada.

I ride a motorcycle, and she bought $500 of gear to ride with me. Her parents also spent like $200 on me for my birthday. Not only that, she just came with me to my birthday, where I introduced her to my entire family. And this Saturday, it's HER birthday party. Her real birthday is Monday.

She's been saying she loves me since day four of knowing each other. Obviously it doesn't carry much weight to me because that's not something you can know that quickly. I'm not a real believer of love at first sight. Granted, I'm the first boyfriend that she's ever had over at her house. Her parents have taken us out to lunch and dinner four or five times. I guess I'm the first guy that isn't a deadbeat and treats their daughter right.
She's also has a suicidal history. She was in a ward for three months when she was 17. She's a lot better now, but she's made comments like ""I don't know why I'd live without you"". Stuff like that scares me, and raises enormous red flags.

And it's her god damn birthday. What the fuck am I? The most evil guy right? I get this girl that loves spending time with me and I just can't deal with it. My stomach is in knots. My throat feels like I'm full all the time. My appetite is all screwed up. I've been eating worse because of her. I've stopped doing as much physical activity because of her. I don't SLEEP well because of her. She basically wraps herself around me.

She was also molested as a child. The perp is in prison so yay for that. She has NOT been able to have physical contact with guys until me. I've talked to parents, friends, people who know her, and she was just plain scared of guys. For whatever reason, she felt really comfortable around me because I kissed her day three and it has been sex every two or three days since.

But I can't. She does not want to improve. She won't even try. I need my space back. And I've told her. Nothing happened. And yes, I think it's fair that I ask for those improvements. I put a lot of effort into bettering myself. And she agrees, but still does nothing.

But I don't want to leave her right before her birthday...and even though she's already made like 2grand from the job I got her a few weeks ago, I still feel fucking awful about the motorcycle gear she bought and now has wasted money on.

And of course, I have no idea how she'll deal with this. I feel like I'm asking advice on how to abandon a kitten.

Edit: She has also said she wants to marry me in the future, and that I'm the ""one"". 

I realize you might like to jump to the conclusion I'm just the biggest ass on the planet, but try taking this without a biased view and try and fit into my shoes. And, she's my first girlfriend. "

I'm not texting back at this point, as I told him I'm going through a rough patch and need some time to get things sorted out. He continually asks me why we're not sleeping together, tells me I'm deliberately ignoring him to make him feel bad, and asks to stay over, showing up at my house unannounced which pretty much crossed the line for me. At this point, I'm realizing that I don't really like him at all and completely regret ever getting involved.


If we didn't have mutual friends, I'd have no issue entirely cutting him off, and telling him straight up that I'm not interested in him any more because I don't like him. The fact is that I don't want to make my life worse by losing an entire group of friends, nor do I want to hurt his feelings.


How do I break up with him? He seems far more attached to me than I am to him, I really just want to hit reset on the whole thing and go back to being acquaintances.

* **1 project manager** - made sure business goals and deadlines were met
* **1 engineer manager** - made sure engineers had what they needed
* **1 designer** - designed look and feel, mockups, also worked with marketing dept
* **1 UI/IA/UX person** - architected app flow, ran usability tests, wrote copy
* **1 database admin** - architected and maintained DBs
* **2 software engineers** - wrote api interfaces to the databases in PHP
* **2 front end people** - wrote the HTML templates and javascript
* **1 intern** for QA, bug filing

This team structure worked well for us, but **I'm wondering how common it is**.  The company I consult for now, sort of chuckles when I mention things like ""designer"", ""usability"", ""QA"", and even ""project manager""."

(story in subtext)",Chancholoraq,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/w4zsw/reddit_what_misunderstandings_have_you_had_with/,"A couple days ago, I was coming home on the bus from my internship at a summer school program. A woman boarded the bus and sat in a seat close to where I was standing. She looked around her 40's-50's and exhausted but shocked. I noticed she was giving me some frequent glances and stares, but I didn't take much account into it. It was not until she was about to switch seats when she walks by me and slips two one-dollar bills in hand.

I froze and made a confused face as the woman sat back down, indifferent to the event that had just transpired.

I cautiously and nervously approach her saying things like, ""uh, excuse me?"" ""Miss?""

No response.

I tried speaking spanish to her, as she looked indigenous, ""Perdoname?""

She turned around, glanced at the money, and started rejecting what ever I was going to say or propose to her, without allowing me to begin.

But she then says, broken and muffled, ""Shoo tal. Mi shun.""

I was still curious and tried to speak as clear and slow as possible, my spanish not being as fluent as I had hoped. ""I-don't-want-to take-your money...""

She kept repeating what she said before with her previous gestures, but being more coherent with her words as she spoke.

""Ju tall. My jun. No englis pleas...""

As I was about to plead some more, with a faint idea of what she was insinuating, somebody sitting behind me interjects,

""I think she is talking about her son. You look tall like him and you remind her of him. He probably died or is somewhere else and she wants to thank you for reminding her of him by giving you money.""

Ow. My heart dropped as a glanced at the woman, mouth agape. She finally said and turned straight ahead.

""Your-tall. Like my son.""

I held a blank stare towards the ground, dumbfounded, befuddled, uneasy. I was conflicted but I knew what had happened. I just didn't know what do to at that exact *moment.*

I missed my stop. Then the next one. Then I finally got off. Then I did the thing that I felt like I needed to do when I was on the bus. Or maybe is was just out of impulse.

I cried. I felt aimless, worthless, and touched. I thought about how this lady probably didn't own a lot of money and she was willing to give me her two dollars because I reminded her of her beloved son.

But I didn't know if I would even be worthy enough to be her son. I felt wrong and disgusting inside, as anyone should even come close to consider me as similar to one of their cherished ones.

But, I think I made her happy, and that's all that counts.

Well, today my boss surprised me and said I would have my final evaluation and I would be done. During the eval, he mentioned how I didn't have the required integrity for his department. I flinched and wondered what I did wrong. He pulls up my reddit page, massive red flag, and reads off a post from /r/circlejerk. A post I made about him, outside the office. He was pissed. I explained that it was supposed to be a joke and apologized that he didn't interpret it that way. ""I know it wasn't a joke so just stop."" was his only reply.

w4ufz,7,2012-07-06,I love this city and it's time to move up. Looking for job opportunities.,movin_on_up_kc,kansascity,https://www.reddit.com/r/kansascity/comments/w4ufz/i_love_this_city_and_its_time_to_move_up_looking/,"I'm in love with KC and am ready to make a move, geographically and career-wise. I'm looking for jobs in the area.

My real specialty is management, training and development. I have seven years' retail management experience combined with experience working with higher education, not-for-profit, financial aid, and even call centers. As a 2009 college grad (business management &amp; psychology), I've spent the past three years working hard and paying my dues to show why I should take the next step up the ladder. I spent my time throughout college in leadership roles with management, advertising, a human resources internship, and of course customer service. 

Alas, it is not to be where I am now. I'm with employed by an upstart floundering in its fourth year. Advancement opportunities have withered, my bonus has become perpetually sketchy, and the experience and skills they taught me have made me far more marketable elsewhere.

Strange as it sounds, I'm most at home in the call center world. Supervising, training, educating, and workforce management are my strengths and interests. I'm beginning to realize that there's a real niche for those who, like Liam Neeson and myself, have a particular set of skills. (Mine aren't nearly as cool as the movie ""Taken"", but they make me a great hire for non-black ops jobs.) My experience with nonprofit, higher education, and financial aid make me a good fit for jobs in that sector, too. I'm also qualified for education and development jobs such as training new employees, and I have the experience to back that claim.

I currently live 30 minutes from KC (Kansas side). I bought a new car last year, so commuting is not a problem. I have planned to work for 90 days commuting and then permanently move to the area. If there's an opportunity on the MO side, I have friends who have offered me a room during the work week. Again, I'd keep with that arrangement temporarily and then move up within the first few months after hire.

Like many graduates of my generation, I've put in my dues at jobs without the best advancement opportunities. This has taught me a huge amount of patience, optimism and acceptance. I have had to look at work in terms of getting more out than money. As a result, I have a very positive, professional and deliberate demeanor in everything I do. I'm definitely very driven to succeed, but I turn that ambition outward by supporting teams and coworkers to keep a very positive work environment.

If anyone knows of any opportunities, call center or otherwise, for someone like me, I would truly appreciate the information. I am more than happy to relay my resume and more information to anyone interested. I am just ready to make KC my permanent home and make a good career move to accompany it.

Thanks /r/kansascity!

w4qvm,0,2012-07-06,Higher education (or career) options for a writing undergraduate?,MrJeef,writing,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/w4qvm/higher_education_or_career_options_for_a_writing/,"I'm wrapping up my undergrad degree in the next year or so and starting to fret. I'm currently in a comprehensive English writing major and have hopes to go to grad school. My question: based on your experiences in the writing community and your own various professions, what would a smart graduate program be? Both as far as writing interest and job opportunity go. 

I realize that grad schools are expensive, but also an investment. Right now I'm at a pretty cheap university, and I'm not sure how well its name is received. I have a 3.7 GPA that should hopefully turn into a 3.8/3.9 in the next year and a half. I'm in an English honors society and am trying to get an internship at a local newspaper (just for the resume; journalism hasn't sparked anything within me so far).

I chose the writing undergrad basically because I know I can write well and that I love to. I also figured that it could segue into pretty much any grad program (beside things like med school, etc). I know that I have an interest in languages and linguistics, but I'm dreadfully unaware of what I could decide upon without prior knowledge. I can't make that kind of leap of faith. Maybe when you're in your undergrad and jumping from major to major, but in my mind you should have a plan in mind past that. 

I guess I'd also take some advice against going into a graduate program.. or any advice on careers in the e-book world (as it seems this is where publishing resides these days)."

________________________________________________________
I feel like a spectacular bottle-rocket whose fuse was a dud. And I'm hoping that isn't reality.

I feel bad for feeling bad, because my life is great by all indicators. 

I just graduated from the University of Colorado with a degree in English-Lit. I am well clothed. I am well fed. I have an awesome dog. I have fresh water. I don't have cancer. I don't have AIDs. I have amazing parents who are willing to support me while I figure out my shit and get a job/compensated internship in my field of study or interests.

I feel like I'm not doing anything good with myself though. Sure, I'm growing food to send into the city schools in Memphis. But, it isn't paid, and I'm quickly realizing that money is a lot more important than I thought it used to be. And that makes me feel stupid.
I want so so so badly to be on my own and living in an apartment or house or tent where I don't have to have my parents caring so friggin much about me all the time, because when I was at college, I really bloomed into being introverted and not always having a support system. I'm not used to that level of care. It almost makes me feel like a caged animal. 

 I also turned into an atheist, casual pot smoker, and very independent thinker. My parents raised me to be Christian, not a pot smoker, and to trust church authority. I'm also active in my local Kink/BDSM club, so hiding that from the parents is hard as hell, and tense at times. I can't even bring a girl home to make out, much less do all of the fun sexy-time things that I like doing.

I want to get into the green living/small scale agriculture scale of things, so I want to get an internship on a farm somewhere and learn how to do that. I want to be more connected with the world around me, and never get into the rat race.

I also feel like I should be adventuring while I'm young and without children, and frankly, still can before I go into the farming thing. But I don't have a job because of my internship right now, and don't know what the fuck to do with myself. I want to see Montana, and ride a motorcycle, and try and flirt with pretty girls at bars, and see all that America and the world has to offer me. But how the fuck am I gonna do that right now? I'm not gonna just travel around the country on my parents funds. For one, that would make me a douche-nozzle to the 100th degree, and for two, my parents already paid for my college and did so much for me already that I can't possibly ask them for anything more even though they love me so much that they would probably do that for me.

I miss Colorado. I miss Boulder. I want to wake up and see the mountains every morning, but all I see is the dismal, muggy, urban reality of Memphis and its shitty racial division. I wish that I had tubed on the Boulder creek, just once. I wish I had hit on one girl at a bar and gotten over my shyness and introversion. I wish I hadn't told my best friend at school that I was too tired to go out, when really I just wanted to be selfish and enjoy some time to myself.

I wish that I could have my lady friend sleeping by my side right now, when in reality she is still in Boulder and not coming to visit for another 12 days. I wish that when she got to Memphis, she and I could sleep in the same goddamn bed, but we wont be able to because my parents love Jesus just a little too much.

I wish that I could run away, but I feel like I can't just run away, because I don't even know where to run away to. I feel like a goddamn compass with a rusted out, bent needle, and I'm just so fucking tired of it.

I feel like a spectacular bottle-rocket whose fuse was a dud. And I'm hoping that isn't reality.

Any advice, whether it's just ""hang in there, kid"" to ""you should do X, Y, and Z"" to ""quite being an entitled little brat"" would be appreciated. I feel like I'm at the end of my rope, and that just makes me more depressed because by all indicators, my life is awesome, and I shouldn't feel that way right now. "

The first time I actually paid any attention to some of the posts was a few weeks ago after the girl I was planning to ask out (who's also a co-worker, sort of... she's still in college but is working full time over the summer and part time through the school year for the company I've been a part of for about 8 months now) eventually had left for London with her grandma. My plan was to wait until after she came back to ask her out because I felt that starting a relationship and then almost immediately putting it on hold wouldn't work out too well. The first day of work when she was gone, though, I got rather depressed and started browsing this subreddit when I got home.

After she got back, I never found a chance to ask her out because her intern friends were always lingering and waiting to walk out to their cars every day, and I wanted to keep the relationship on the down-low just to play things safe. Last week, she ends up working a lot with one of the interns who's also tall-ish, skinny, and somewhat nerdy and I start getting suspicions but think nothing *much* of it. Then, on our company outing to a local annual rib fair leading up to U.S. Independence Day, I mention to the guy how the lemonade is awesome and he reaches for her cup of lemonade and takes a sip. My heart instantly breaks and, because I've been lurking here, I immediately begin thinking about women's features and how maybe things would be better, or maybe I'd just never get a girlfriend. It's probably the hardest depression I've *ever* felt, though only these past two depressions have ever been closely related to my gender identity. Previous ones have only ever been about not having enough time to play games or missing friends that I realize I'm not likely to ever see again or at least not see again for a long, long time.

So, the moment I get home, I crossdress in some of my little sister's clothes that she doesn't use anymore and, aside from a bit of a gut, I say to myself, ""Yeah, I've got a decent figure for if I wanted to transition..."" Other than that, I sulk most of the rest of the afternoon away hugging one of my fleece blankets, then the evening is spent trying to cope by playing computer games. The next day, I do laundry and sneak one of the dresses up to my room to crossdress again later in the evening while playing games. I again end up sulking for most of the day, putting on a good face for my family (I've been pretty good at that all my life for the most part), then do the crossdressing thing. I'm a lot taller than my sister (she's 5'8"" or 5'10"" and I'm 6'4""), but other than the length effectively being micro-skirt length and the slight tightness in the waist, it helps maybe a little to keep me focused mostly on the game (or I was just hell-bent on indulging this CD side of me).

Fast forward to today where, right around mid-afternoon, I'd been going over how coming out would be like and a bunch of other stuff, which of my family and friends would likely be supportive and which are questionable, and I was all gun-ho about my research the previous day on who to look into as a local gender therapist after seeing if insurance would cover it. However, on the drive home, right at the end, Rio by Duran Duran comes on my playlist and I start singing because I really love that song and it's right in my range. I then go crossdress a little more since nobody is home and get stuck in one of my sister's dresses (maybe it was more of a slip-dress..? I honestly don't know) since it has a side zipper only at the bust level instead of a back zipper as well as these three criss-crossing straps that hold it up and also ended up holding me in for a long time. I started panicking trying to get it off, hoping that nobody would come home or that I wouldn't have to cut the dress or ask for help. I eventually calmed down after getting to my room and locking the door, inching my way back out of the thing.

Anyways, after that, while pacing trying to figure out what to eat, I sit down at my family's piano (since mine isn't set up) and end up going through my piano+vocals solo arrangements of Plush by Stone Temple Pilots and December by Collective Soul. And then I remember again that I'm in a 90s alternative band where I sing backup vocals (I'd wondered about it briefly in the previous two days of sulking and basically coming to terms with my likely Transgender-ness, but had mostly thought about just hiding it from them as long as possible).

And I then got somewhat confused. I was basically ready and happy with the idea of going through with at least going to see a gender therapist if not transitioning not 3 hours before. I wasn't sure what I was going to do about work if I went through with transition, but hopefully that's what the therapist would be able to help me get some insight on. However, I love singing practically everything I listen to. From Paramore, Lacuna Coil, Nightwish, and Pat Banetar to Collective Soul, Stone Temple Pilots, Three Days Grace, and Dishwalla. I've got a decent male voice for singing – it's definitely good enough for backup vocals – and I like singing the male stuff because I don't have to work so hard to make it sound good, but I think it'd be weird seeing a girl who sings with a distinctly manly voice, especially whenever our band gets around to doing gigs. Also, if I were to transition, I'd want to be able to sing with a passably female-sounding singing voice, too...

**Other background info**

So, perhaps the most telling sign to those reading this would be the following pieces. Ever since I was little, maybe 3 or 4th grade, I've had some fantasies of those garden arches magically turning me into a girl, and thus wanting to avoid them to avoid cooties or just being flat out afraid of change. However, my favorite television episodes at the time were always ones where there was a body or mind swap of some sort, like the one in Chip and Dale: Rescue Rangers or the one in Aladdin the Animated Series. Then, 5-6th grade, I'd have some fantasies about using a bath towel to rub off my chest and genitals kinda like the biblical story where Jesus' face is rubbed off and then trade with my childhood crush's corresponding places. 7th grade was my first foray into crossdressing, but nearly getting caught having my mom's pantyhose on after one shower made me stop for a long time.

Starting high school I finally had my own room, but the most I really did with that was taking a bunch of these sock-slippers and rolling them up to be boobs held to my chest by a Survivor buff, using my old baby blanket or extra socks to add hips, and tucking before going to sleep (not necessarily in that order, things progressed throughout high school). The tucking ended up giving me wet dreams, and I was most often a guy in those cases. However, after maybe one or two nights of doing this gender-bending, my mind would be satisfied or bored of it until another 3-5 months later. Also through High School, I was slowly building up a huge collection of website bookmarks to TG-themed-at-the-time webcomics (notably El Goonish Shive, Misfile, and a small storyline near the end of It's Wally!) and other such websites. This is when I found out about Ranma, too. However, I eventually diversified to regular webcomics that were linked by those TG webcomics or recommended by my friends. During the gender-bending sessions, I'd often fantasize and even wish that I had some sort of magical way to understand what it's like to be a girl by turning into one, example methods being a machine in my closet where I'd select which parts to swap, or two people sitting on the respective toilets in the two upstairs bathrooms would just suddenly swap, or a lightning bolt would strike while I was taking a shower and leave me in the body of my longtime childhood crush (it was a long crush).

Before I continue about gender stuff, this is a good point to mention that I've never actually had a girlfriend. My first attempt was with said childhood crush, but I asked the slightly childish version, ""Would you like to be my girlfriend?"" after leading my way into it, rather than, ""Would you like to go out with me?"" She'd just broken up with her previous one, and she felt that we were going in two different direction in life, so she said no. Then, during my senior year in high school, I went to two dances with this one junior who was kinda cute and also liked playing Magic: the Gathering. After the second one (a Turnabout dance), she'd driven me and my brother home and I told him to go inside. We talked for a long time about stuff that probably mattered to a relationship, and then I finally got up the courage to ask if she'd ""like to be my girlfriend"" (again with the more childish terminology, IMO). She ended up saying no, pointing out that she was Wicken and into having sex early in a relationship while I was still holding tightly to my Catholic background even though my family had stopped going to church as often. She gave me a peck on the cheek for my trouble, but when I blogged about it I got teary and went to cry in my room.

There were a few girls I noticed in college, and one I was considering asking out who was older than me and sort of my mentor for being the pianist of the campus' only show choir (think Glee, and that was us in a nutshell, drama and all, but in a college setting), but I got beat to the punch by the show choir's drummer (see a pattern to the original story?). My mind I guess must've turned off looking for a girlfriend at about this point, because while I saw plenty of pretty ladies, I never had the heart to ask them for fear of being rejected again like I was with the two high school girls.

Anyway, I continued to randomly crossdress when my sister finally got to the point where she was tall enough for me to fit into most of her old clothes, but this was around my time in college so I'd only really do it during the summer and during the Thanksgiving, Winter, and Spring breaks. During this time is when I actually discovered masturbating, though I didn't realize that that was what I was doing (and what I was effectively doing way back when I was getting the wet dreams) until Sophomore year, by which time I was doing it anywhere from 1 to 3 times a week. Junior year, it escalated to every other day once I was in an apartment with two of my friends from my hometown. Senior year, daily, sometimes even twice a day (only ever twice in one day at the earliest every 3 months), after which I'd scold myself for doing it so soon and causing my dick a little pain from rubbing so much.

Many of my fantasies during college and to this day have come from stories on Fiction Branches or CYOC.net, plus a few that are built off of those. I don't need a picture, just words, and to imagine it happening to me. The only thing about many of those FB and CYOC stories that I *didn't* like were ones where the changes involved an immediate mental change (often to a bimbo or slut) that made them not want to change back, or else it was something that was impossible to change back by the laws of a particular magic. Some stories, particularly ones dealing with the Medallion of Zulo, made a permanent change plausible to me, but only recently has a permanent change been a potential on my mind.

**### Summary ###**

I've been constantly curious about what it's like to be female, what boobs and a vag feel like from inside a female body, yet I've mostly felt comfortable with my male body (until maybe a bit recently, but mostly from getting a gut) and seem to mostly not like the idea of a permanent change. If I was forced to be a girl, particularly through some car accident where a brain transplant were the only way to save me, I wouldn't really care as long as I can identify as myself and retain my current likes and dislikes, +/- a few to fit a female lifestyle like clothes shopping.

I'd probably be a Trans Lesbian with mostly male-dominated hobbies like computer/video gaming, tabletop gaming, programming, playing piano (and potentially picking back up violin), and singing. One thing that is somewhat enticing would be more form-fitting clothes; one of my shirts used to actually hug my torso – which is rare for a tall, skinny guy like me even shopping for Big &amp; Tall – and I really liked that shirt because it didn't engulf me like most of my shirts. I also feel like I already have a lot of female mannerisms (trying to take up as little space as possible, crossing legs at knee or ankle or both [only really at my desk, though], ), but I don't think people notice them or just think of me as eccentric or whatever because I've never really considered them anything than me being me. I otherwise have mostly male mannerisms.

However, the things keeping me back that seem more unique to me than things I've read while lurking here are:

* Every time I go on a crossdressing binge (which mostly only come around every year or every other year now) lately, I end up getting stuck in smaller clothing for a bit and begin to panic that I'll be found out in some fashion, then after getting unstuck I feel perfectly fine in my male body (aside from fantasies helped along by TG Fiction websites and what's becoming more of a monthly gender-bend binge where I just sleep with the rolled up socks in a Survivor buff or hanging over my neck);

* I like singing in my male voice;

* I'm *very, very* hairy all over my body, including (and in addition to the standard pubic hair areas) around my nipples, ears, shoulders, lower back, and a lot of my nether regions;

* I'm relatively lazy. If I'm motivated enough to do something, I'll go out of my way to get as good as I can at it, do as much research as I can on it, etc. This also means that, currently, the most grooming I do is 1.) getting a buzz cut whenever it gets long enough to have that short bit of hair by the ear that never stays tucked behind it; and 2.) trimming my full beard down to 1-3 mm thick when a large portion of my mustache hair touches the goatee-area whenever I roll my lips in.

* I think I'm a very empathic person, to the point where I'm easily influenced by the personalities of people with whom I enjoy their company and start taking on some of their quirks. Perhaps it'd be more accurate to say I'm a mimicker... It doesn't happen as often anymore because I've had a relatively steady group of friends for years now, but I have some doubts that these feelings I've been having are actually me and not just me reading everything from lurking around here like some freak/stalker or whatever...

* I'm currently still living at home with my family because I care a lot about them, and it ties into the laziness above of not wanting to bother with moving unless it's absolutely necessary (especially after I convinced my separated parents to upgrade our home internet from DSL to Cable so that I can have mostly uninterrupted internet while gaming while my siblings stream Youtube or other recorded videos from online). Plus, my home is only a 10 minute drive from my place of work (though construction makes this more like 15 now).

* A lot of my cousins are still rather young (I'm the oldest not only in my immediate family, but my extended, too; 25 here, youngest is ~9), and I'm still a bit of a role model for at least one of them if not all 3 of my dad's youngest brother's sons, and while I don't particularly like my middle uncle's wife because of the particularly hurtful things she's inadvertently said about my sister to her daughters (""She's a *special* girl [because she wears pants sometimes and not skirts/dresses *all the time*]"", almost implying that she's butch or lesbian just for wearing pants when she's cis-hetero, though she did go through a pseudo-goth phase in high school), I don't really want to have to teach any of them about this whole other side of life that often gets squelched if only because of the relatively low population compared to cis-gendered.

* I don't like the smell of dozens of sweaty women... Had to experience that one day when I was working at a local Dairy Queen... The coppery smell/taste I'm pretty sure made me gag a bit... Maybe that'd change if I myself gave off a similar smell, but then I still wonder if maybe I'm just asexual because of that (I definitely dislike being touched in any remotely sensual way by a guy... One guy started massaging my back at a huge club event for which I went back to my old university to catch up with my old friends and it still mostly felt awkward to me. One of my friends is also very touchy-feely, mostly just with my size-3-buzzed hair or sometimes my shoulder or a bear hug, and all of those times were also uncomfortable for me, too).

* My dad's side of the family has an addiction problem. My paternal grandparents were alcoholics before I was born, and still smoked up until my sister was little. My dad's brothers stock plenty of alcoholic drinks, though I'm pretty sure that having families makes them only drink at every birthday party they hold for their kids. The reason I say this is I'm pretty sure I'm addicted to masturbation (though, from what I read from lurking here, T might partially be to blame for this), and the way I get off is thinking about becoming a girl, but I don't ever think much beyond the ""become a girl"" part and have never really planned anything out beyond a few months in the future, maybe up to half a year for conventions or family gatherings.

**### TL;DR ###**

Latest attempt at getting a date getting thwarted caused gender dysphoria, but realizing I also like my life achievements of being a pianist &amp; (male) backup vocalist in a rock band and finally getting my first occupational job just in November and not sure how transitioning would affect those. Also, my lazy nature and the fact that I have a lot a lot of body hair make me wonder if the extra grooming work would be too much for me, even though I do care about how I look to some extent.

I want to know what boobs and a vag feel like from inside the owning body, but except for most recently up until I'm writing this, I also think I'm rather content with my body as it is right now (minus the gut).

What am I..? Please give me your best guesses/opinions..!"

I got my hands on a friend's address, but now I'm questioning whether that's a smart tactic in my situation.  I'm employed right now (internship), so I think it's going to be fairly obvious that I don't live locally when my current job is listed halfway across the country.  But I feel like my skillset matches what they're looking for really well, and I'd love this job/location, though I'm sure they'd prefer someone local especially since it's entry level.

*Also should note it's not just my current employment that lists my halfway across the country, but also my college and all of my 2 internships and 3 part time jobs

So what do you think?  Fake it til I make it or just list my actual address?  *Also, assuming things work out and I got to an interview, do I continue lying and say I'm a native of that state?  At what point do you stop lying?

""You, in the green."" She said, ""You're standing in the middle again. You have to pick a line, right or left."" Who knew that such a simple decision would end up defining so much of you. I made a quick check at who was in what line. Left line: Big guy with blond hair, big black guy, biiig girl with black hair, skinny Asian dude. Right line: Average blond guy, skinny black guy, red-headed girl. I took a quick step to the right. I was definitely a defense kind of guy. Then the red-head spun round and kissed the hippie looking dude behind her, and a few people ahead of me. Quick step to the left. Who was I kidding, nobody wants to play defense. 

Outside of the hallway was a large cafeteria with a banner stretched across the support beams. It read “WELCOME TO THE SUPER-HERO INTERN PROGRAM” in large red font. It was technically the “Super-Hero Intern Program” but most people just called it Sidekick School. There was a surprisingly large amount of classes available for it being such a hidden school. They had tons of one-semester classes like “Fire-rescues” and “Bomb-diffusing”. They also had longer classes like “Hero Ethics” and “Identity Protection”. Most of the learning was done on the field though. At first a student would be grouped up with 4-5 other students along with a alumni or senior student and they would go to the streets and fight crime, or more often, observe their instructor fighting crime. This being my first year I had the basic classes and an elective. My schedule looked like this.

-8:00 Martial Arts 101                                 Tim Baker                     
-9:30 Hostage Protection                             Amy Turner

Interviews were interesting, turns out that being able to absorb audible energy isn't considered an “Offensive Ability” but because this was my first year and everyone takes pretty much the same classes that it didn't matter. The tests were a pain, literally. As a sort of punishment for going in the wrong line the administrators insisted that I go through the offensive tests rather then the passive or defensive tests. This meant that rather then protecting holographic damsels in distress I was tasked with going toe -to-toe with holographic robots and fighting hordes of ninjas. It can be accurately said that I am terrible at fighting hordes of ninjas. Actually, I'm terrible at fighting pretty much anything. It's like, oh look a horde of stealthy assassins, watch as I make them even more quiet. If I could do something with the sound energy that would be cool too, but from what I can tell the most that happens when I use my powers is that I sometimes get a little energy buzz, like drinking a shot of espresso. Then again, I lived in the middle of nowhere so I guess I was never really around that much noise to absorb. "

All of the advice I see online is for a PhD. For PhDs they say that industry experience doesn't help on your application. I work for a bioinformatics start up and am interested on how it would affect a Masters application. Similarly they say for PhD recommendation letters from industry matter less. Is this true for a masters? 

My 3.7 seems low for my ivy league dreams in a PhD program, but for a masters is it reasonable? I have done research in two different labs and will be publishing (hopefully) within the next few months in my current one. I have had a research internship at Harvard university and a public health intership in Uganda. Also for PhD programs they say that your extracurriculars can work against you and shouldn't be on the app unless it supports a research focus. Is this true of Masters?

I can only compare any of this to the curricula that I have seen for PhD programs where this would be common place. How does this fair for a masters? Could i get into a top 5 program?

I lead a “high intensity life.” I’ve spent the past 4 years starting a family, busting my ass to get into a top law school and busting my ass to get good grades once I got into that top law school. I’ve worked highly competitive, high responsibility, high stress internships each summer. A few times a year I hit a slump. It’s not a mental crisis and it’s some sort of breakdown. For about a week I’ll shirk all responsibilities and just lay around while shit piles up. Professors, employers, and my family don’t know what to make of it and I don’t either. I’m not depressed; I don’t feel sad or hollow. I just completely lack the motivation to do what I need to do. When I sit down to work I won’t be able to focus for more than a few minutes. Then I’ll go watch a movie or read a book or something enjoyable.

I want to lead a focused life. I can’t imagine Socrates or Cicero lazing around, not fulfilling their responsibilities. I know what I need to do. That’s the thing. I always know what I need to do, but I don’t do it. If I start doing it for a day, or a week, or a month, eventually I’ll crack and go into some unproductive vegetative state. I know the right things to do, but I just don’t have the self-control or the will to stick to a plan unwaveringly. I can make set priorities, but I cannot stick to them.

I have goals, big goals. I want to be a good father. I want to be a good husband. I want to develop myself intellectually and socially. I want to succeed in law and politics (defined broadly). These goals aren’t unique, but they aren’t trite either. What’s sad is I believe I have what it takes. I’ve accomplished great things under adverse conditions. But now that I’ve worked myself into a position to succeed, I don’t know that I have the will to.

What should I do?

p.s. I'll answer questions and actually read or try things that you suggest. I'll report back as well. I'm the perfect test case for all the knowledge you've been accumulating.

I've been depressed for the last two months, and even more severely depressed for the past week. I wish I could go to sleep and not wake up, because I can't find a way to deal with my problems. I've been withdrawing from my friends and life in general, which of course only serves to depress me further. I'm scared and I don't know what to do with myself.

Back story time I guess? It's long, and you can skip to the end, but it makes me feel better to write everything out.

I've always been a lonely child. I was abused physically and emotionally by my father growing up. I've spent most of my adult life trying to fix myself one step at a time, but I'm still far from healthy. I was extremely depressed and isolated in high school, and contemplated suicide, though never seriously.

When I left for college life improved dramatically for me. I began to cut contact with my father as much as possible. As of now, I haven't spoken to him at all in four years, and haven't communicated on any subject of importance in six years. I was able to become my own person and though I had a lot of scar tissue, at least I was able to start healing. I still speak to my mother occasionally, though I feel I will never trust her completely.

I got a job across the country right out of college and moved to a completely different city. I was lucky enough to know a bunch of people there from an internship the previous year, so I had friends and people to hang out with. This included one of the most amazing girls I've ever met, and we started dating that year. This has been my only serious relationship and the happiest time of my life. Two years later we both quit our jobs, her to go to law school and me to go to grad school.

After three years together, there were problems in our relationship. To me it seemed that we had reached a point where the only next serious step in our relationship was marriage, something we agreed neither of us were ready for. It also didn't help, that while she had a ton of relationship experience, this was my first. I was learning and changing as we went through our relationship, while she already knew the lay of the land so to speak. This wasn't fair to either of us. I started getting 'grass is greener' syndrome; I couldn't accept spending the rest of my life with her without any experience of what else was out there. I know she wasn't entirely happy either, she had to deal with my stupid behavior. Things came to a head when I drunkenly kissed a girl at a party she wasn't at. I broke down and confessed two days later. She was extremely mad at me, more so because she knew my feelings and where this had come from. We made up, but the next night she went to a party and made out and slept in the same bed as a guy at law school she had a crush on. Long story short, we made up again and continued our relationship, and tried to work on things.

I couldn't imagine my life without her, but I knew that I was sabotaging the relationship with my thoughts of what else might be out there, and how this was only my first relationship. I didn't see things getting any better so we broke up about 4 months after that. I brought it up but it was a mutual decision, and an amicable breakup, we hoped to remain friends. The first two weeks were alright I guess, I went out and partied, slept with a couple girls.

Since then I've been miserable. I lost the love of my life and my best friend at the same time, and it was all my fault. I miss her every day, and all I can think of is the contrast between now and how happy I was when we were together, even at our worst. I haven't been this depressed since high school, and then at least I didn't know how happy I could be. She's started seeing the guy she had a crush on, and doesn't seem to be having any problems, which only makes me feel worse. I'm now the only one of my friends that's single and I have no one to hang out with. I've been withdrawing from my friends, and they have made no effort to hang out with me. I'm unemployed, waiting to start school and everyone is working so I have nothing to do during the day. I've become a borderline alcoholic to try and deal with the pain. I'm supposed to move to a new city for school in a month, where I know nobody and have no connections. I have no safety net and I'm worried about paying for school and if this the right thing to do.

Bottom line I'm scared to death I can't handle myself right now and I can't even imagine how much worse things will be in a new city where I won't know anybody. I have no one to talk to and I feel like no one cares. I don't know how to fix this. I want to go talk to her and try to figure out how she feels or get some closure. I know better than to beg for her back. I feel like I need to know how much of our bridges are burned though and how she feels, if I can get any closure."
w413h,0,2012-07-05,Bummer Summer Internship,Bummer_Intern,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/w413h/bummer_summer_internship/,"This past spring I was able to land what I thought was going to be an amazing summer internship for a large multinational manufacturing company which is based in the US, I'll call it Company X.  The interview process was very difficult and competitive (Multiple interviews on campus as well as on location which pitted you directly against other students).  I had heard from friends and other students that if you were lucky enough to get the job, you would love it and learn tons. During the interview process they had shown presentations of past intern's work and various projects (all of which seemed interesting, engaging, and a good test of skill for a newly developing engineer). I was excited to say the least when I learned I was one of approx. 35 kids who were chosen out of thousands for the internship.

When I got the job all I knew was that I was going to be relocating from the far North-East to the South-West and would be working on improving some of their manufacturing processes; great I thought!  In between my time of hire and actually starting work I had steady flow of how great Company X's internship program was from their Corporate HR people and am still contacted by them fairly often.

On my first day of work I learned that at my specific location had no engineers on site, no engineering techs, no engineering anything, not even a maintenance department.  It was just a small manufacturing facility with a few supervisors and a small workforce of skilled &amp; unskilled laborers. If anything went wrong, they called in outside help.  Not anything like what I had be sold on, but I thought to myself, ""I could work with this; just more room for improvement to make myself look good.""

This is where my problem starts, when I met my boss he had said I would be doing time studies my entire summer.  ""Eh, not the best job,"" I thought, ""I guess I am just one of the interns doing grunt work."" The time studies I am required to do could literally be done by a 3rd grader, no real analysis is done other than the average time it takes a laborer to build a part. After a month+ doing solely time studies I contacted some other interns (none are in my area most are at Corporate many hours away) and asked about their summer assignments. I found out that they all have similar assignments to what was advertised during the interview process. Some are going on site to learn how a product is installed/used, and are actually working to improve the product, manufacture of said product, or installation of it. Others are learning actual lean manufacturing methods and applying that knowledge. They are even leading teams working to improve a product or research new technologies. This isn't sitting well with me, and is making me feel like I am getting taken advantage of. It's not that their jobs are ""cooler"" than mine, it's that mine involves zero amount of engineering; literally nothing. I met with my boss and asked if I could work to try and improve some of their manufacturing processes (I have two previous internships as a Process Engineer for other manufacturing companies) and he simply directed me to the suggestion box. I also found out that I am required to give an end-of-assignment presentation in front of the ""higher ups"" and other interns at corporate and fear I will look like a fool because of my mundane assignment compared to everyone else's assignment.

What should I do? I am currently sticking it out and trying my best with this brainless assignment and am not learning anything let alone contributing to the extent of the other interns. Should I go behind my bosses back and contact the HR people from Corporate and bring this to their attention? Should I meet with my boss again? I don't want to be seen as a person who complains *or* a slacker/moron/ect.

w403t,2,2012-07-05,Student Looking For Guidance,albenesi,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/w403t/student_looking_for_guidance/,"I'm a Computer Science major with 3 semesters left of school before graduating. For the first 5 semesters of college I was actually a Graphic Design &amp; Illustration major. The reason for the change was mostly due to my search for the right career. I didn't actually feel like I would enjoy a career in straight-up design, even though I was actually quite good at it (compared to the majority of my peers). I knew I was good at programming and the Computer Science way of thinking due to high school classes, and I knew that there were more opportunities, as well as more profitable opportunities, in that major. Plus, I enjoy programming!

Here's the thing, though: I just started an internship at an internationally recognized company that I'm really proud of, but the bureaucracy might be slowly killing me. It pays great, and it offers a really good employment opportunity after I graduate, but I just don't think I can do the grey cubicle thing... at least I'd rather not. 

I don't think I made the wrong decision in switching majors. I've enjoyed my last semester (the first in CS) enough to entirely justify the switch. I do, however, miss the creativity of design. I really think I need to find a career path the lies somewhere between Computer Science and Design. I've always been interested in web design (as well as the general idea of ""user experience"" but I'm not sure how to approach something that abstract). I know the basic web languages like HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP, but I've yet to use them in a scenario outside of class. I also know a whole lot about design and creating a good experience for a user. 

My question to you, Reddit, is how do I mesh my too passions successfully? What do I do know? Where do I go? Where do I start? I've never really been that great at learning things on my own but I'm a whiz in a classroom or business environment. I really hope to get an internship in a smaller, more creatively focused company next summer. But until then, does anyone have any suggestions?

Sorry if this is too lengthy to generate valuable responses, but thanks to anyone who read through and to anyone who might give me some guidance!

ALSO: I'm fairly new to Reddit. Is it in bad taste to repost this in the ""User Experience"" subreddit? I feel like I'd really value that input as well."

I would would appreciate any and all advice concerning these two career paths!  

About Me:
This upcoming semester I will be a junior at PSU working towards a double major of Cmpsci and Mathematics, and I will be attempting to minor in MIS if I can get the classes to align.  This year I was accepted to the Schreyers Honors College which grants me some serious research power for an undergrad.  Naturally, I'd like to incorporate one of these two topics into my project, but my lack of experience in both subjects leads me to believe I would be biting off more than I can chew.  Aside from classes and working as a TA, I really have no other experience with computer science.  I was unable to find an internship in my area this summer and for various reasons, traveling was not an option (it will be this year however!).  

So, what exactly is a career in each option like? What can I do/read to bolster my knowledge of each topic? (I've tried to read journals and other subreddits but it is another language thus far)  Where can I look for internships in these two fields? And finally, any ideas on a research project? I have a few, but the more I analyze them, the more I think, ""Jesus, how the hell could I complete that by myself in two years with the knowledge I have?!""

This was one of the most soul crushing experiences of my professional career. I can't even imagine how he felt. He is fresh out of college and was so excited about the job. I felt so terrible all I could say was how sorry I was and that I didn't know what happened.

Faith in humanity = depleted.

What I would love is to help him network to find a job. In his portfolio he had a few manga drawings so he specializes in this type of artwork. It also included layout work and he has Photoshop experience as well.

If you know of a job opening in the NYC/Long Island Area for a graphic designer or an internship and would like to interview a nice, eager college graduate, I would love to pass along the information to his friend who still works with us (got him the job) so he can get a chance somewhere else.

I know this is a long shot, as the move date is two months away and I am currently across the country, in New York, but it doesn't hurt to try.  I have a BA in English and am interested in pursuing a career in copywriting.  I understand that I will have to start out with an internship or in an entry-level position and work my way up, since I have limited relevant professional experience.  I have done writing/editing for an art publication, and am confident in both my writing and creative abilities.  


I'd be a great hire for anyone who is willing to take a chance by giving me an opportunity.  I am from New York, so I definitely have that ""get things done"" mentality.  I take great pride in any work that I do.  I have plenty of professional references who would be delighted to speak on my behalf.  I can send a resume, and interview via email, phone, Skype, or any other method you can think of.

Thank you so much for your time!

**Krystal**

Edit:  Correction, I am leaving NY in September, but will arrive in SD in October--visiting family along the way, since I will not have another chance to do so (for a while) once I start working.  If anyone is interested in keeping my resume on file for potential openings, please do not hesitate to send me a message."

I have been employed (internship but whatever) as a programmer. I have worked with all the major operating systems. I make sure to have real time antivirus, a firewall, and updates.  I am so careful, that when I got a virus and got my password + credit card stolen. I did a virus scan, found the virus, and decided to low level format my computer just to be safe. I do not trust any sort of password storage, I use CCleaner one a daily basis. I also not the type of click on anything phishing emails/links. I dont even click on links, I just type out the url character by character even if it looks safe. I am borderline paranoid.

So today I get an email from Gmail (legitimate email) that says:
Someone recently tried to sign in to your Google Account, __________. We prevented the sign-in attempt in case this was a hijacker trying to access your account. Please review the details of the sign-in attempt:

Being super cautious, I bypass the email and scroll to the bottom of my gmail where I click on details to see login history and sure enough, someone with an IP address from India tried to login to my computer. (It definitely was not me via my phone/proxy because I was fast asleep at that hour)

So I run the full scan on both my computers (Microsoft security essentials) and come up with nothing. I do a virus scan with Norton on my android phone, nothing. I then install Malwarebytes on both computers, full scan, and come up with nothing.

Now I changed the passwords using an itouch I got for my birthday but never even opened (the guy who gave it to me regifted a brand new first generation itouch, I thought it was hilarious), so I know my new passwords are safe. But I am scared to use my current computers for anything.

 Its like living on an island with 50 other people, finding out there has been a homicide, and then being told ""police scanned the area, didnt find anyone, carry on"". Well then how the hell did it happen? 

Based on your opinion which one of these options would you go with:
1. One of your devices is infected, keep looking. (In which case HOW to keep looking would be nice to know)
2. Your password was probably leaked months ago when you went on a friends computer to check your email (To the best of my knowledge I have never done this and certainly have not been on a friends computer for at least a couple months, let alone to check my email. 
3. Something I havent thought of.

My boyfriend [23/m] and I [21/f] got together last September during the beginning of semester at university. He was a transfer student from a different school.

Last night I wanted my BF to meet my two best friends. I've been meaning for him to do so, but he was at an internship over winter break. We finally set up time for all of us to get together. 


When I introduced them, I found out that they all know each other, but through separate occasions (we live in the same area. I never met my SO in the area before college, big coincidence). He had to leave a bit early for sleep today for work. After he left, both girls told me that they had slept with him, but on separate occasions. They did not know about this until today that they slept with the same guy. Now I'm sleeping with the same guy they slept with at one point. So I'm a bit pissed at this, but I feel I shouldn't be; I didn't know him. 

I confronted him about it earlier today. He explained that he hooked up with both of them the summer before school, and in the same week. I asked him why he never told me this, and he said that sexual history isn't important and he didn't know that I knew them. I got kinda pissed and went off on him. He hung up on me and texted me saying he'll talk to me when I'm more sane. Now I'm even more pissed at him. 

I dunno, I feel lied to he didn't tell me this, despite that he didn't know I was friends with them. We haven't talked since this afternoon. I dunno how to approach this. I know I should let it go, but it's eating me up, and it's irrational of me, I know. What would you guys do in my situation?

TL:DR - Me and two of my best friends slept with the guy I'm currently dating at one point; no one was the wiser. "

After graduation he spent the year reworking his portfolio and taking on multiple jobs to raise money to buy silk screening setups, large format printers an many other machines.

We weren't really planning on getting a new dog, but my sister had a friend who's neighbor was known to be abusing a relatively young dog (&lt;1 year old) so she offered to adopt it, and we unofficially ""rescued"" the dog into our home. This was about 10 months ago, after our first dog had died, but while the second one was still alive. 

Whenever I was home from school, I noticed that the dog was weary/cautious of me. I always figured it was because I was still some stranger (between school, work, internships, etc, I was usually only home from school for a day or 2 at time, sporadically).  

Indicators of his fear:

* If I walk by too closely and too suddenly, he urinates on the floor.
* If I get too close, his tail is down
* If i try to pet him, he starts shaking/shivering

It's not just me, it's men for the most part he's afraid of. But he's significantly less afraid of my dad than myself (my parents think it's because I'm significantly ""taller"" and still a stranger). I have done NOTHING to harm this dog in any way. I know he had a rough puppy-hood and since he's still uncomfortable around me, for the most part I try to stay out of his way just because I feel really bad for him.  It sucks because I used to be really attached to our old dogs, and now I know this one is terrified of me. I recently moved home, and we've made *slight* improvements. He will now cautiously accept food and table scraps if I offer it to him.  However, since the dog and I see each other everyday, it's kind of difficult to just ""give him space.""

Since neither of us is going anywhere anytime soon, what can I do to make this better?"

In 2007, my family lived with my sister and her then-boyfriend. I was going to school at a community college. My family didn't have money, and it was when I won a state scholarship and notified of a Pell Grant that I started college in 2005. I have 3 disabilities that I couldn't afford to get diagnosed (Central Auditory Processing, dylexia, and ADHD...I don't give much credence to that last one.) No diagnosis meant zero accommodations. At the time, I was okay with that.

Sister kicked my brother out, while also taking what little paycheck I earned (federal work-study at a community college - low-wage) and didn't provide much in the way of food. I got hot dogs while she and bf got steak 3x/week.

The boyfriend revealed himself to be a nazi; apparently his dad was Hitler youth, and he thought it was 'rad.' 

My sister assaulted my mom that July and kicked us out shortly after. When the police were called, they could not determine who started the fight (sister walked away with only a black eye). No one got arrested and we had to leave.

I was very lucky - a friend I barely knew talked her family into letting me and mom stay with them. Mom was there until the day before my birthday (Dec 10). She got sick and I had to send her to my grandmother. That was its own headache. The short version was that she was terribly mistreated.

During that initial period, I was accepted into University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC). This wasn't my first choice, it was merely a choice that got me out of Harford County. My major was political science.

UMBC wasn't too bad. Exceptions include the admissions office that couldn't verify where I lived, and threatened to expel me for lying on my admission application (I used a UPS mailbox), the professor who insisted that the Department of Agriculture had the most federal employees and that Judicial Review came from ""Plessey v. Maryland,"" and the ""Christian"" fraternity that had a person nearly die from alcohol poisoning and successfully did not get kicked off of campus.

While at UMBC, I was able to get a little cheap therapy (though it took me nearly all day to use the bus to get to the Loyola psych clinic, no regrets though). I also got diagnosed, so that was good.

Honestly, I would have accepted being a transfer student with almost zero scholarship support (grades are good enough), but in August 2009, my entire financial aid package was pulled with ZERO explanation.

I busted my tail and was accepted into American University. I majored in Political Science and [CLEG](http://www.american.edu/spa/gov/degrees/BA-CLEG.cfm). I graduated without TOO much difficulty. I had to take whatever work I could get, much of that was 'under the table,' but I couldn't afford to do a free Capitol Hill/WH internship - I needed the money: mom was still sick and was not getting help from her family. Dad couldn't (or wouldn't, I'm not sure) help me - I know his wife freaked out every time he bought some groceries. Point is, I couldn't do the one internship every PoliSci student essentially needs to do when you go to school in DC.
Upon graduation, a friend let me stay in her empty apartment while I worked out a housing solution. I tried looking for other options, but I couldn't find anything. The apartment was in Towson, MD, and my work was in Ft. Belvoir, VA. That equates to a 4-hour commute EACH WAY.

The original agreement was 10 months in that apartment. She kept winding back her agreement, and the deadlines became March, then Christmas, then end of November, end of September, then September 1, then GET OUT. This was mostly due to her deteriorating relationship with her crazy boyfriend.

If she had been patient, I would have been out of her hair in mid-August. Instead a fraternity Brother allowed me to stay two weeks with him. I now live in north VA.

The Ft. Belvoir job was with Defense Logistics Agency's Equal Employment Opportunity Office. I was hired as a disabled student. Over my 16 weeks there, I was given maybe 5 assignment by my boss. Then barred anyone else from giving me extra work. She used my 'lack of productivity' as a reason to not hire me permanently.

I was jobless from October until this May, when the Workforce Recruitment Program got me a post with Defense Contract Management Agency. It took 3.5 months to get me in (not complaining, just a fact). Even though I am a receptionist, I liked the job, despite it being completely mind-numbing. I like a challenge.

Until a new GS-09 arrived. This woman is mentally slower than molasses in January, this woman openly called me 'retarded,' and the boss spoke to her - which is really all you can do in government for a first offense. Since then, she consistently reminds me that she makes a bunch more money than I, and insists that her degree in Business Administration from University of Phoenix is better than my degree, and I can't say anything to shut her up. The Boss already wants NOTHING to with this situation.

My problem is that my Boss wants to make me permanent. He has given that task to the woman who called me 'retard.' There will be no hope for advancement past GS-07 for at least a year, but there is no guarantee I'd get the first position made available. Additionally, he likes me as a receptionist because I'm good at it (personal philosophy: do a job, and do it well, and do it well the first time if possible).

This job bores me to tears, I'll be stuck taking care of my mother at an unideal salary with little hope for advancement. I have no official job duties - which essentially makes me the office's 'donkey.' 

I don't want to work in an office where I am regularly dressed down, but I'm darn lucky to even have a job.

NOTE 1: I already complained to the EEO office about the situation. Because I'm WRP, it goes to the agency contact for that program. This gent is slow to respond in general and has not addressed this complaint...it's been 3 weeks.

I'm hoping redditors have some input for me. Help?

tl;dr - Terrible last 5 years. Finally have job. Senior employee is discriminatory. Staying is bad, leaving would be worse."

I recently ended a 16 month rleationship with a girl I felt smothered by. She is 2 years older and there was an underlying pressure to move the relationship along: Build a future, make a strong commitment (engagement), discuss children, etc. For the most part this did not bother me because I was very much in love with her, and her family. Over time, as I worked through school and now a very demanding internship, the pressure wore away at me. She was also involved in a long process with her own work, offering very little time for each other. Our moods were, at times, volatile. Additionally, I smoked a lot of pot and just wanted time to myself to play videogames, which I found made me irritable when she would demand so much of my attention. Finally, I sunk back into a porn habit I kicked earlier in the relationship, and hung out with friends of mine she didn't particularly like. She was very overbearing, we were both stressed out, and my reasons for ending the relationship was simply to take the pressure off and be happier. 

2 months later, we are much happier people apart. I indulged myself, but when the happiness of instant gratification wore off, I started to feel awful about my life. I have since quit pot, porn and really turned down the hours I would spend vegging in front of a screen. Her job ordeal has ended, and now she has more time to do things to make her happy and works in a more positive environment.

So,

We have both since been out on dates with other people. 
We both still have feelings for each other and are in close contact after almost NO contact for a month. 
I feel like we are both in a better place mentally, but we are very leery about giving it another shot. Her, worried that I would break her heart again (and that I'm reacting to her dating, which I did do.) and me, worried that all of my changes to my lifestyle won't change the way I felt about her over the long term (emotional, dramatic, overbearing).

TL;DR: Ended relationship over pressure and irritation. We both cleaned some bad stuff out of our lives and are faced with a decision to take another shot.

What say you, Reddit?"

I was working as an intern in a company for about 6 months. The itnernship period ended and I left with a letter of recommendation and generally high praise for the work I did. 

I received an offer for a position in the company, I had an itnerview and everything seemd to go great, they're not even considering another applicant for the position and the position needs to be filled by the 16th. However the salary they're offering is too low for what I consider an acceptable minimum. The reason they're offering that salary is ""lack of working experience"", I told them I would need to think about it.

1. I have the option of staying for 2.5 months, or 4.5 months. The coordinators don't need my answer yet. However, I have heard that upon entry, I will have to prove I am leaving within 90 days with plane tix or a travel itinerary. Is there any way to get around this? Not trying to do anything shady... I just wanna be open-ended.

2. Do you have any advice on getting a cell phone? I've heard I can't unlock my phone because it's Verizon. I don't need a smart phone anyways. Should I get a cheapo one here before I go?

3. Any other random tips you'd offer? I've traveled abroad alone quite a bit, but never in Latin America. Is there anything I might forget to pack? I am pretty low-maintenance in general."

Our problem is that he has no proof of income, so he can't be issued a loan without us cosigning on it. Right now, our plan is to cosign it with him (including having the title in our name and his), have the car in our name for insurance purposes, make the payments for the next year, then hand all the responsibilities over to him next summer. 

So my question(s) relate to liability. Sometime in the last year, we found out he had been possessing marijuana. Neither of us has any issues with marijuana use other than the standard ""not in our house, not while driving a vehicle, don't let it affect your academic performance, and be aware of the legal consequences you may face under any circumstances at any time"" spiel. 

If he were to be caught with marijuana while driving (say he gets pulled over for something unrelated like speeding or a broken tail light), what are the legal ramifications for me and my wife as co-holders of the title and sole-holders of the insurance coverage? Assuming I refuse to cover any of the consequences he faces directly, what indirect consequences could I face if this were to happen?

Is this the best I would be able to do? If so, it would make a lot more sense to drive my car out there, even though 3-4 days of straight driving sounds a little daunting. Are there better deals out there that I just didn't find? Or perhaps other options, like month-to-month leasing?

I'm writting here today to share what happen to me and to sort my thoughts.

I was with this girl for 6 and a half years, and it was the best. She wasn't perfect, she wasn't very social and didn't like any of my friends, and her sex drive was significantly lower than mine. I wasn't perfect either, i kept promising her to lose some weight for 6 years and never got down to it, and I watched porn behind her back.

But we shared the same idea of our futur together, and we could talk for hours, thing that I've never done with anyone.

Every thing started falling appart one year ago, when she discovered I was watching porn and when I was planning a six month internship in australia. She took my leaving for australia really hard, but finally accepted and decided to even come with me for 3 month. Then the porn crisis happened, and we nearly broke up, but decided to stay together. And for a moment, her sex drive even picked up.

I didn't go to australia, because I was missing one grade for my bachelors degree and so we took some vacation together instead. We went for one week under the sun during wich we never had sex. And that's when I had a relapse with porn. From there on, everything went down hill.

She and I got a job and an internship, and I noticed that she was changing. It was her first job, after her masters degree, and we thought it would be the perfect occasion to move in together.

We've been sharing an apartment for six months during which we only had sex 3 times, at her initiative, for I was tired of being rejected when I tried to initiate sex and had stopped trying altogether.

Meanwhile, she was getting more and more social,going out with colleagues of hers. And she was making friends of both sex, when she had been the most jealous person I've known and wouldn't let me hang out with girls before. I knew she was geting along well with her coach, but when she told me she was going to a concert with him, without even asking me if I wanted to go before-hand, I started suspecting something, or rather, my suspicions got a foot hold in my mind.

Her self esteem wich had always been medium-low was through the roof, and she was getting more and more distant. That's when we went for a road trip of three weeks from San francisco to Las vegas.

I thought things would be better, that being together would show us how much we enjoyed each other company. But nothing happen, we went to sleep each night without cuddling, and I cried myself to sleep.
But still, I never found the courage to talk to her.
Then my birthday came during the trip, and all I got from her was a ""happy birthday"" and nothing else, no kiss, no hug.

We came back and things got worse, we stoped talking alltogether. I had one week still before going back to my internship, but she had to work right away. So I was all alone with her computer during the day, and I finally remembered her password and went snooping on her facebook account.

My heart stopped, there was a conversation between her and her ten years older coach that looked like the kind of conversation we used to have, telling each other how much they cared about each other, how she was afraid of acting out, because she hated being alone and was waiting for him to prove he was committed, saying that her (ours) relationship was dead the day she started flirting with him. 

I cried all day, wondering where things have gotten so ugly (i realize now) and when she came home that evening, i confronted her, telling her I suspected something was happenning with someone else. She denied every accusition with such ease, I never knew she could lie like that. Thats when I told her I had seen the conversation.

We talked all night, she told me she still loved me, but nothing was happening between us anymore, that it wasn't normal for a couple our age to not have sex (sigh) and that she was envious of all her colleagues who always had something planned after work (I had tried to take her to the restaurant or cinema, but every time she told me she wasn't motivated to go out after coming in). She told me she saw us as roomates.

I said that I wanted to work on our relationship, that I didn't want to throw away the best 6 years I ever had. But she said she wasn't sure, she didn't think she knew  how to live without me in her life, but she had feelings for the other guy too. She didn't give me a definite answer, but I can guess what it's gonna be.

It has been a week, the worst week in my life. The more time passes by, the more I realize it's over, I've started searching another apartment, possibly shared with other people since I've never experienced that and that I need to meet new people.

I feel numb, a decreasing portion of my mind is still hoping she will come running and begging me to stay with her, but I know it won't happen.
Even if she told me nothing physical happened between them, and can't stop imagining them fucking on our bed. It's especially hard because I know he is less attractive then me.

I've started working-out, already lost 11"", and I hope this time I will go through with it. I've been seeing friends, they've been supporting, they all told me it was for the best, that they always thought she was no good for me, too materialistic, hell bent on her studies and career and that I would always have come second (which is too true).

I really don't know what more to do, I've never been as happy as when I was with her, I don't meet people easily and I can count on one hand the people that I really liked and could stand for more then a few hours. I don't know how to meet women, and I don't want to actively pursue someone, I want it to be mutual. I'm scared because I never meet a girl who shared my vision of life beside her.

I know things will be all right, and writing this down helped me a lot to sort my thoughts, but still, in my head, I wonder, if I hadn't taken her for granted, and if had had the courage to talk about our problems, if things could have been different.

Thank you for reading the biggest wall of text I've ever written.

**TL;DR**: there isn't one, sorry but I mainly wrote that for myself, I don't say I wouldn't appreciate some input, but I cannot summarize the last year of my relationship.

Edit: oh yeah, and I decided the stop porn alltogether, I've realized It gave me an unhealthy outlook on sex since I knew that I wouldn't want to do what I was looking at with my girlfriend. It made it hard for me to come when we were having sex and she always felt raw afterward and wondered why I couldn't come as quickly as her."
w60h1,0,2012-07-07,I'm a recent college graduate that is interested in obtaining a consulting position for one of the Big Four auditing firms.  How do I get to there from where I am today? (lengthy post),big4consulting,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/w60h1/im_a_recent_college_graduate_that_is_interested/,"I'll begin by stating that due to the fact that I'm currently employed, I'm not comfortable with discussing some specifics about my work history (i.e. post a copy of my resume).  I have suspicions that my supervisors frequent Reddit, and although I do not want to stay in my current position long term it still provides a decent temporary paycheck while I look for something better.

I became interested in the consulting industry about a year ago when several of my friends from college were recruited for various consulting firms.  Although I'm cognizant of their perpetual travel - coupled with their long work hours - I am drawn to the profession due to the opportunity to quickly establish a formidable level of business experience.

So why am I on Reddit asking for help?  Well, a few months ago I utilized my network of college friends in order to obtain an interview for a consulting position with one of the Big Four auditing firms (I decided not to focus on MBB because, due to factors I elaborate on below, I do not believe I have any realistic chance of landing a position with any of those companies).  Unfortunately for me, I was not selected for a second round interview.

Although there were some external factors about the interview which I could not control - for instance, each of the other two candidates I was competing against had MBAs while I only held an undergraduate degree - I would prefer to focus on the factors which I can either control or compensate for.  I have identified two major factors working against me:

1.  The consulting industry assigns particular importance to a candidate's GPA.  In principle I don't necessarily disagree with the use of this metric - companies are often hiring entry level employees for their inherent potential rather than experience.  In my case, however, I do not believe that my GPA accurately reflects my potential.  Due to my stubborn refusal to accept that I was ill-suited for the engineering degree I initially pursued in college, my cumulative GPA of 2.5 is extremely low in comparison to the level of scholastic achievement expected by most consulting firms.  Although I eventually admitted defeat and decided to pursue a Finance degree, my major GPA of 3.06 is still nothing to brag about.

2.  I have minimal work experience.  I had one internship at a well regarded company where I developed general business skills that I believe can be positioned on my resume to make me an attractive candidate for consulting, but the remainder of my work experience is in the political sphere.  My academic experience is stronger - I have substantial experience in the advanced use of Microsoft Excel for demand forecasting and regression analysis, programming experience in several languages including JAVA, investment experience using simulated trading platforms, etc. - but most businesses (quite logically) do not value academic experience as much as actual work experience.

So what am I doing to overcome the hurdles I've experienced so far?  From my perspective, there isn't much I can currently do about my GPA, except for continually practice and refine my interview responses on the topic.  Going to business school for an MBA is a potential medium-term solution to this issue, but for the sake of this post I'm going to focus on what I can do in the short-term.  Here's my general plan of attack for the next 6 to 12 months:

1.  Build my resume.  Although my current position is a fairly menial entry-level white collar position, I've volunteered to develop and implement a SQL database for my employer in (mostly) my spare time.  I'm also in the process of convincing my company's IT professional to allow me to help work on our company's ERP and CRM systems during my lunch break each day.  My hope is that this combined experience will elevate my current position into a stepping stone to the consulting world.  In addition, I'm contacting my former colleagues in the political sphere to obtain access to their fundraising data, for which I will analyze and build a model which (might) enable more efficient fundraising.  Doing this should enable me to position my political experience in a more business friendly way on my resume.

2.  Network.  I'm reaching out to recruiters and hiring managers at each of the Big Four companies to both garner advice on my career path, as well as to plant seeds which will ideally blossom when they recruit new employees this fall.

3.  Prepare.  I'm fastidiously practicing for the interviews, primarily by reading [Case in Point](http://www.amazon.com/Case-Point-Complete-Interview-Preparation/dp/0971015864/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1341637297&amp;sr=1-1) and working through case studies.

Now that I've outlined my entire life's story, what is the point of this post?  Basically, I'm just looking for feedback.  I want people to poke holes in my plan.  I need suggestions for anything I might have missed, or improvements that I could make to my approach.  If I have no legitimate shot of actually pulling this off, and all of this work will amount to tilting at windmills, then I suppose that would be good to know as well.  Thanks!

Flawed but ambitious college graduate wants to obtain a job with a Big Four auditing firm.  How does he make that happen?"

w5wyg,0,2012-07-06,A little help with Second-Year Degree Choices. (Please read-respond if you are in either sciences or computer science). Thank You in Advanced. ,labeebk,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/w5wyg/a_little_help_with_secondyear_degree_choices/,"Hi Reddit, 

I am a Student who completed first year Life - Sciences at a well known University with a decent B+ Average.

For my Electives, I took two extra math courses (in addition to my calculus I course I was required to take in sciences) Because i am passionate about math, and have always been.

So for your better judgement here were my grades:

Biology (1 and 2) : B+ and B
Math (Calc 1 and Calc 2) A and A
Math (Linear Algebra) A
Psych (Behavior and Neuroscience) A and A-
Chem (1 and 2): B- C+

(yeah i suck at chemistry, dislike it too)


So lately I have been thinking a lot. Getting a job in science is practically impossible. I did my research, asked around. Nobody gets jobs. (Post-undergrad or co-op jobs). And I'm a person who has been working since I was 12. I love the idea of being in a work environment and making money. My grade 12 Job was a personal trainer (obtained through networking) after completing the Canfit Pro. I loved it. 

Now its been a year later, and I have not worked. - note I am 19. 

Not only that, but when you graduate, finding a career in the field is also very difficult. Most would require some research/work experience, in which the next four years in science, i would see myself unable to find one.

I tried hard. I really did. I called up everybody i possibly could. Every doctor in our university hospital, every firm who could hire, and even recruit interns! I called up my family who are in similar fields hoping for a positive response. Nothing.

So its not something where I'm ""assuming"" i can't find a job. Ive seen the difficulty first hand.

Now lets look at a few more things before the question is proposed:

I am currently taking 2 math courses over the summer term (for fun, love math). Linear Algebra II, and Diffrential Equations.

Now I also live with 6 friends who study engineering, whom all have nice jobs. In addition, my brother and cousin are both in computer science. They both are also on co-op at the moment. Brother making 25$/hour, and cousin making 35$/hour (cousin is in year 3, brother in year 2). 

So you can get a nice idea on where my influences are coming from. The pressure from lack of work + the pressure from all my friends having jobs. Now that seems very immature to say ""pressure from friends"", but it really does get to you. When your holding onto the last $100 you have in ur bank account, while watching ur brother take the family out for dinner, or cousin buying a $1500 computer.


Lets keep going. Almost done. Thank you so much.

Now in my university, first year is very general. You take general courses, preparing you for specific degrees you can go into for second year.

I applied to two that really caught my attention.

1. Biology and Mathematics

- I love biology, and i love mathematics. This seems perfect for me. But again, considering the lack of jobs, I've been slowly shying away.

2. Mathematics and Computer Science

- Math? Yes! But Computer Science? Everybody who studies computer science tells me its amazing. I have very little experience, but I do work with python sometimes. Make myself short fun codes (taught by my brother). They seem interesting to a certain extent. 


So i got admitted to both, and now i have to make my choice. Math and Computer Science is a program that involves co-op. So I would be working in-between semesters. Now I'm not sure what to do. Im leaning for math and computer science only because (math is there, so I'm safe with interest), and money is good during my undergrad.

I don't want to take on a huge amount of debt and end up struggling to get a job. 

So please reddit, let me know what you think. Feel free to share your opinions. I would love it if some science and computer science post their opinions so i can have a better understanding of both sides of the story.

Thanks Again!"

In any case, I've had the idea of starting an independent online newspaper. Has anyone done this? Any gotchas I should be looking for?

Also, any ideas on how to generate content since it will just be me until I can afford to hire some reporters? I've thought about looking at some interns from a local community college but I believe that because I'm a startup they wouldn't think I'd have any credibility.

Sophomore year in college, a group of my friends rented an off campus house.  I was hanging out there, and ended up leaving all my N64 games at the house for everyone to enjoy when I wasn't there, and for us to play together when I was.  My best friend (friend A), and his other friend, who I never really got along with (friend B) had a huge falling out, and when they were packing up, friend B threw away all of MY N64 games, thinking they belonged to friend A.  I never mentioned anything to friend B about this; he and I were never close, and he started acting malicious towards me for being close to friend A, so I simply stopped associating with him at all.  Anyway, my little siblings are pretty pissed off about this.  The games I lost were all the best ones I had collected for years; both pokemon stadiums, all the mario games, goldeneye, and basically, all the classics.  I recently looked online to try and rebuy some of them (all the videogame stores around me have gone out of business, and even if they didn't, I doubt they'd have N64 games on stock), and the prices from online stores are really high.  It's about $30 a pop for the dozen or so games I lost.  I'm a broke-ass college student working at an unpaid internship; I can't afford that, and I really don't like the idea of buying on eBay, since after shipping, it's not much cheaper, AND I don't know if the game will work or not.  So, I'm asking:  does anyone in the RI/MA/CT area have any of the classic N64 games they'd like to get rid of for relatively cheap?

w5rol,14,2012-07-06,"Is ""Asian parenting"" a negative societal influence on Asian-Americans?",qzbky,SRSDiscussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/w5rol/is_asian_parenting_a_negative_societal_influence/,"Refer to this post for a summary of stereotypes about Asians:

http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/nzfh9/effort_sidekicks_menaces_and_whitewashing_the/

We should add ""Asian parenting"" style to the list of bad influences.

http://www.pgbovine.net/asian-parents.htm

I think the more ""traditional"", ""strict"" parenting styles make it worse through encouraging Asians to perpetuate stereotypes (be submissive, a good worker, don't have any ideas, please your superiors)in order to make their parents look better---they're throwing the next generation under the bus like the boomers, but in more of a social / psychological way. It might work fine in Asia, where there is much more structure to society, so much that one can really treat someone as a means to an end perhaps, but not in America, where the ""norm"" is to figure out what you want to do with what you've got, and go do it. I was wondering if anyone shared this perspective or had a directly opposing one.

My story: I'm Asian (male, 25) and I'm not trying to be a 'special snowflake,' I had overbearing parents who made a huge deal about doing well on academic entrance exams, hobbies like piano and tennis that they never really cared about, etc. Now I'm in grad school and doing a summer internship at a great company in a field that I claim to have interest in, and I'm just realizing, truly, how much damage that did. 

Sure, I'm surrounded by good influences---people who encourage me to do what I find interesting, friends who listen, etc. The missing part is, basically, me. Encouragement to do what I find interesting falls flat if I don't, on a gut level, actually find anything interesting. Friends listening doesn't work if I don't trust my (claimed) ""closest"" friends (who come from more privileged backgrounds) and can't help but think they're treating me like a doormat and subtly manipulating me, or if they don't intend to manipulate me but it's the convenient, default choice when it comes to interacting with people like me so they do it.

So I'm not in a very good place mentally. I'm extremely depressed, thinking of leaving, and maybe even committing suicide, since I have no idea what I want to actually do and every moment spent not doing anything awakens me more to how much emotional development I never went through and how the default for the rest of my life would be to work at shitty, unfulfilling programming jobs for people, often from more privileged backgrounds, and letting the resentment build until I do something that might actually hurt someone else. 

Basically, through overbearing parenting on one side and constant pressure to perform and be a good worker (not an innovator or leader) on the other, I end up feeling like I'm a means to an end, a robot to propagate the status quo. 

No matter how much I try to fake myself into the world view of ""I'm my own person and I make my own choices"" it never feels genuine, since I always feel like it falls under the framework of being a slave to or rebelling against parents / white people. 

What was lost somewhere along the way was ""because I love to."" I think in large part due to this treatment, I've become incapable of loving anything. I can never trust my own instincts as I feel they've been corrupted at a basic level. All I can do is watch myself perform actions that vaguely seem to be willed by myself, and at times obviously because I've been trained to be a doormat and concede to others. 

I actually think it's not just me, but most Asians in America feel this way at one point or another, this lack of having an identity. So, I'm wondering if you've seen anything similar through your observations of other Asian-Americans---the few who called attention to themselves, that is---that they've been rushed through the system, and end up being treated in the workplace as glorified robots, and invisible in other settings. Do you think they got stunted as human beings more due to the influence of their parents or the people around them?

Asians who are ""dominant"" or ""warm"" (!) are more disliked among peers than whites exhibiting the same personalities -

w5qz5,11,2012-07-06,Just got dumped via skype. Kittens please.,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/w5qz5/just_got_dumped_via_skype_kittens_please/,"So... Literally minutes ago, my boyfriend of 1.75 years dumped me over skype. It's excusable, though, as he's out of state doing an internship and didn't want to wait until I picked him up at the airport to tell me in person, and I agree that would be worse form.

But the thing that kills me is that he'd been thinking about this for a while. He said he wanted to give it 6 months, and it had gotten better, but not better enough. He's in law school and therefore very busy, and we had grown apart to some degree simply because of those circumstances. I still loved him immensely and thought that it could really last and was worth working at... Guess not. So I guess I feel kind of lied to. Like if he had this in the back of his mind for half the past year, what did all of his I love yous mean? What about the sex? I dunno, perhaps it's better than if he had expressed his uncertainty, as that would have given me all kinds of doubts.

I know people get dumped every day and I'm no different, but still, it just majorly sucks. I need a hug and some kittens.

**Update:** Since the initial shock left me without much to say during our conversation, I sent him an email that really made me feel a lot better. I'm realizing that this was probably inevitable--if he wasn't willing to work on things as hard as I was, I'd be picking up the slack to keep us together, and that wouldn't last. And in the end, I want someone who wants me back just as much. But we did have something really great, and since it was my first serious, adult relationship (I'm 21, he's 27), I learned a whole lot. So here's what I sent him:

""I had no idea what to say earlier, but now I've got a few things. First, I wanted to let you know that while I'm obviously upset, I'm taking it better than I expected, for now anyway. Second, I wanted to thank you for the past (almost) two years. The good parts were nothing short of amazing. The bad parts I learned and grew a lot from. I still love you and probably will for a while, but when I eventually stop, I'll still care about you as a deeply important and formative part of my life. Third, I don't know if I can be friends with you down the road after I move on, or if you'd even want to be friends, but if you do and I can, I'd like that. Last, I really do wish you all the best. I'm still rooting for you to do well in law school, your future job, your house-building adventures, and I hope you find everything you seek."""

Throwaway account here. So I've recently scored an IT internship at a financial corporation in NYC. However, they said they would need to complete a background check. 

Normally I wouldn't get scared especially since I haven't done any felonies, crimes, or anything that would get me in trouble with the police. However I have had a history of identity theft from my father which is still in the midst of being cleared up - police report filed, etc.. 

It's pretty bad, about $4,4XX on one account and $14,XXX on another account - which I think is awful.

Will this corporation deny me due to bad credit or is this considered discrimination?

EDIT: I have consented to a credit/background check during the application process - which was a check box I believe."
w5os3,7,2012-07-06,"SO, mountain biking has found a new way to embarrass me...",[deleted],MTB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MTB/comments/w5os3/so_mountain_biking_has_found_a_new_way_to/,"Recently my boss started riding with me and and another coworker who ride together every saturday and it's been a blast. His old bike (circa 1994) had a Rock Shock Judy that went absolutely caput sometime in the last 10 years or so of storage and the LBS found the issue when he brought it in for a tune-up the other day and so they ordered a new shock that just came in yesterday. It was going to take until mid next week to get the bike back so I said ""I've swapped out forks before; let me do it and then you can still ride with us tommorrow."" He was hesitant but I insisted, repeating how easy it was, I can totally do this, etc...

Fast forward to today: he brings the bike and fork into work and I get started. First, the fork is an economy model and the steerer tube is not pressed into the fork: it slides in and then you have to tighten down two stainless bolts that clamp it in. No biggie, I put it together, tighten the first bolt then move on to the second. And proceed to twist the head off of the second bolt leaving the rest of it embedded in the fork... I tell him about it, tell him I'll take the bike home and drill it out and replace the bolt: ""no big deal, I can fix it.""

Moving on, I measure the old steerer tube, mark the new one and cut it down. The interns are all amazed: ""wow, where did you learn to do this stuff, etc. etc."" to which I answer ""I've always been mechanically inclined, always fix my own cars and bike, I'm kind of a big deal, yadda, yadda, yadda.""

I set the star nut, set the race from the old fork on the new one, then start putting it all back together. While I have it open I grease the bearings which are pretty scummy and tight but still, functionable. I get the spacers on, put the stem on and then tighten everything. Then I install the v-brakes. While doing that I realize the handlebars won't turn very well. I decide to loosen the bolt on the stem so that I can loosen the Headset bolt a bit. Of course I feel my wrench slip and immediately know I've just stripped the effin' head of the bolt...

Just then he comes back and see's the bike together. He decides to spin the front wheel and one of the pads is seriously rubbing. I could have gotten them sorted given a chance but I could tell he wanted to help and let him have a go. He spends a little time trying to adjust it when he notices the steering is very ""tight."" I explain that the bolt needs to be loosened a bit but that I stripped the bolt head. And that I can fix it, I just need to take the bike home because I don't have the tools with me that I need. At this point I think he begins to suspect I couldn't wrench my way out of a wet paper sack. He's very cool about it but says he is going to run it to the LBS and see if they can adjust the brakes - I go with him and tell him I am going with him and will cover the cost of getting the bolts removed... Of course he won't hear of this even though I have cost him more than he would have saved by me doing the work. So he's out money. I'm out my pride.

So, in short, going OTB on a simple 20 inch slope for no particular reason, with your friends behind you, is embarrassing. Getting passed on the trail by a pack of gray-hairs after gloating with your friends about the great time you are making is embarrassing. Getting mixed up on a trail you think you know and going the wrong direction? Embarrassing. But acting like Billy Bad-Ass Bike Mechanic in front of a half a dozen people and screwing up big time is VERY embarrassing..."
w5njw,4,2012-07-06,Should I press my parents for the money they owe me or let it go?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/w5njw/should_i_press_my_parents_for_the_money_they_owe/,"I'm 21, currently live on my own. For the record, I'm still on my parents' cell phone plan but I take care of everything else (my rent/utilities/college tuition/food/etc.)

So over the past year or so, my parents have asked to borrow about $1200 from me that I'm beginning to think they have no intention of paying back. 

The first $700 was part of a down payment on a new car, intended to be my younger sister's to drive once she got her license. Part of the reason we decided to get the car before my sister actually turned 16 was because I was living at home for 3 months doing an internship in my hometown and I needed a car for the commute. (I no longer live in that city, but my parents suggested I move home for a bit since it was a really good opportunity.) When my parents asked for the money, they said the loan was just until the next payday and they would pay me back. Since I needed the car myself, I happily offered up the money for the down payment. I paid for gas, oil changes and maintenance on the car while I used it, as well. 

That was about a year ago, and I haven't seen any of the $700. It's somewhat frustrating because it's not even my car -- it's my sister's, and she hasn't paid for any of it. I don't ever drive it, as my parents live about 400 miles away. 

Earlier this year, my parents suggested that I set up my bank account so that they could easily transfer money to me if I needed it. I later checked my bank statement and saw a $500 withdrawal that I had no idea about. I freaked out and called my mom asking for advice, and she said that it was a bank error from when she tried to transfer $500 into *my* account. She claimed she had talked to the bank and they were already putting it right. 

Fast forward about a month or so, my mother calls and says that I hadn't gotten my money back because they needed to make an emergency repair on the house with it. Okay, fine. This was about six months ago and after asking a few more times about it, I've sort of given up on asking. I'm wondering if my parents lied about it being a ""bank error"" in the first place.

I feel like I might be acting spoiled by being cranky about this, since my parents obviously spent 18+ years dumping money on me and they still pay my cell phone bill. They bought me some nice Christmas presents this year. I really don't want to seem ungrateful or selfish. But sometimes I struggle to pay my rent and for me, $1200 is a good amount of money. I wouldn't even feel wronged about the down payment on the car if I hadn't been assured so many times that they would pay me back. 

I know my dad makes six figures (not sure exactly how much) but I have no idea what their financial situation is (my youngest brother has had some health problems and they live in an expensive area of the US). I wonder if they're having money problems, but they would never discuss that with me. I love my parents and would never want to make them feel guilty or ashamed by nagging or calling them out. 

Looking for some perspective here. Older redditors, be honest: Am I spoiled for wanting this money back? Should I just let it go? 

TL;DR: My otherwise lovely parents owe me $1200 dollars and I don't think I'm getting it back. Should I let it go?

Edit: Thanks guys, I think I'm just going to count the $1200 as a loss and (quietly) remove their access from my bank account next time I go to the bank.

I'm new here.

I'm home for the summer away from all my college friends and most things interesting. I think it would be pretty neat to have a movie night on Saturday and hang out and get to know you guys. 

[](/b30  ""I joined a live stream a while ago and everyone already seemed to know each other already and it was kind of awkward for me."")

I'm not great at introductions, but here goes. I'm a college student studying electrical and computer engineering and currently in an internship right now. I started watching MLP in December (almost half a year now!), and it's sort of changed me from someone who does almost nothing except study to being more aware and valuing the other things (while still doing well in school). My username comes from the book The Dying Earth by Jack Vance, an amazing fantasy book from before The Lord of the Rings that inspired a lot of Dungeons and Dragons. My favorite pony is Twilight Sparkle because she is very similar to me and we both share many of the same struggles.  I've been learning how to draw, spending most of my time at home from work on it, and I'm still not very good but I'm improving, and I'm pretty happy with my progress considering I started drawing period this summer. I listen to Black and Doom Metal, though I don't present myself as a metalhead, and Dubstep (as in the original stuff from the UK).

Ooohh... I should join the IRC channel.

Anyway, here is the movie I suggest. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f6f_kfp1Z8
I watched this recently on my own and I was blown away by how awesome it was. It's one of those movies where you can't help shouting out and you're on the edge of your seat the whole time. I think this would be a perfect movie to watch with other people, and it would make me so happy to watch this with you guys! 

[](/a25) I'm not really around anyone who wants to watch this with me

If another movie is planned, does anyone know what it is??

I wouldn't be able to stream it, since my upload speed is less than 1 mbps."

I am a CC student who intends to major in Aerospace E, and who will probably end up attend grad school for a PhD in Astronautical E. My ultimate goal, as naive and absurd as it is, is to work for NASA (or at least something in exploration). I'm only a year in so far, so I'd like to pin down as much as possible while I'm stuck at CC finishing off the transfer requirements to UCI.

I'm trying to get an internship at an aerospace corporation/facility. Until I get more experience, NASA internships are effectively out of the question. The vast majority I've seen request fluency in multiple programming languages, and until I'm able to clear a class for one, I'm dead in the water.

There are several aerospace corporations here in Irvine, CA. In fact, there are multiple corporations -- EADS North America, Parker Aerospace, Panasonic Avionics, and a few others -- literally down the street. 

So what I'm asking for is advice on how, where, and when to get an internship. Any tips would be greatly appreciated. As it stands, I'm contemplating calling these nearby facilities and asking if I can walk in to inquire about an internship.

If it helps, here is some additional information. Please tell me if any of this is redundant or otherwise useless.

* I have more than proficient knowledge of AutoCAD and Solidworks. Anything from modeling to gear assemblies/linkages.

* I'm also an alumnus of NASA NCAS, a program directed at CC students entering the STEM field. I maxed out the points on the qualification portion of the program, and was sent to NASA JPL, where I led one of the four teams. Our team came in second by a narrow margin, although our rover was by far the most successful. I have all of the research papers relating to the program.

* I'm the president of my campus' Phi Theta Kappa chapter, the honors society for CC. I can also request recommendation letters from a few in-field engineers, a NASA JPL contact, my Astronomy professor (who is worth noting), and a few other professors."

Reddit, what have you done to get through tough situations?",TheIntegralRadical,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/w8myh/i_was_transplanted_to_a_new_city_for_the_summer/,"Background: I'm 18, and just finished my first year of college. I got an awesome internship in a city I've never been to before. It was too good to pack up, so this summer I found myself moving into an apartment with 3 strangers in a city where I knew no one.

My relationship is now long-distance. I have no teammates, no family, nobody here. I have tried to make friends, but my work group is a tight-knit bunch and the other interns are total jerkwads. My roommates already have lives here and are less than wiling to incorporate me into them. 

At first, things were OK. Then, the roommates started teaming up against me, blaming every mess on me and leaving passive-agressive notes about the way I put my forks in the dishwasher. The other interns started intentionally not inviting me to their get-togethers. 

I went home for the 4th, and the whole time I was there, had panic attacks about the thought of having to return. Now, I'm back, and I'm back to my routine of work, working out, and watching reality TV. I'm usually a social person, but I feel so smothered and out of my comfort zone here that all motivation to make friends or pursue my usual hobbies is  gone. 

I'd love any advice on making friends. But even more, I'd love advice on accepting loneliness rather than pushing it away. I've never not been surrounded by people - how do you do this? 

tl;dr: I'm in a new city for the summer and am crippled by loneliness."

I'm coming to strangers for advice/comfort since I feel like a childish moron when I bring up this stuff to people I know better. I'm a 19 y/o American female. 

The struggle I keep facing is ridiculous. Trying to explain it makes me wither up inside because I feel like every explanation I give doesn't work or that I screw up some part of it. First, I'm split between a few different versions of myself and I can't tell which one is true, and every single day it drives me crazy, with all of the voices battling one another when I interact with people. One is overconfident, vain, cold/distant and emotionless, one is overemotional, insecure, worrisome and clingy, and the other that often mixes in with both of these is aloof, endlessly curious and distracted, eager to learn everything and understand but unable to act. One version is an emotionless animal that has no attachment to anyone, not family, not friends or anyone, that works as a pick up artist, puts on a facade of emotion  and humors people to keep them happy without actually giving a shit. That version doesn't care that I continually seduce and sleep with more and more people (purely for the game) and manipulate others under the cover of a sweet and chipper personality, and doesn't care what nastiness life throws at me or what rock I end up under. This version is arrogant and prideful, and the 2nd version of me chastises this first version the whole time. When version one gazes at a room full of people and thinks ""Wow, these people are idiots"" or ""I could do their job/talent/whatever better than them and work half as hard"" the other version of me whispers ""Wow, you're the most arrogant jackass ever. Why don't you get over yourself and accept that these people are probably all doing better than you ever will"".
And then version three jumps in. The peaceful, all-accepting version that is aloof and always trying to understand, and she whispers ""You don't know these people. Don't judge anything about them before you know them. Be open.""

I went to a lot of counseling last semester, and though I wasn't ever able to fully express myself, after going through about six different counselors/doctors they told me I had bipolar disorder. Except for I don't know if I believe that. There is NO history of it in my family, and I don't ever unleash extreme anger upon people or get into uncontrollable moodiness. I don't see these qualities in my parents or other members of my family (I mean they're slightly dysfunctional but pretty average members of society). I try to figure if maybe this is hormonal or my youth, and I watch myself fall into these episodes that I can't climb out of. During school it becomes near impossible to work because I get so lost. I keep telling myself that I will calm down eventually, that it will go away, but even as the highs only get higher, the lows only get lower. The lows aren't angry, really, they're more like excessively introverted and not trusting of anyone. I don't want to be medicated and I also don't want to sound crazy or like I'm pining for attention, I get so scared to talk to anyone about this stuff because I don't even know which angle to go from. Do I turn cold and regard all the events in my life as equal, none being better or worse than others? Do I whimper and cry about my insecurity and how I feel that nobody cares about me, even though it's me (well, version 1) that pushes people away more often than not? Or do I sit and do weird breathing exercises and keep telling myself I""ll be all right, I don't need to have ascertainable goals, I can just float on and seek happiness from small things? 

In terms of how it affects my life goals, I'm all over the goddamn map. The trouble isn't that I lack interest or motivation in things, it's that I want to try everything. I love interacting with new people and learning why they love what they do. So I have this grossly spread out conflict of interests, constantly. And they're always in a whirlwind of change. Music or Spanish or Dance or Science or Psychology or Writing or Philosophy or Computer Science or Theater or Art...all this random shit, all this stuff that doesn't match with the other stuff I like, because I like all of it. I want to learn all of it, and for some reason that's not allowed, people have to be super specialized in one thing. And it upsets me because I feel like my life is enriched by variety...I dip my toes into these things, find out I love all of them, and try to find ways to do all of them, but there's never a way. And I'm sitting here crying because I can't figure out if I'm happy that I like so many different things, or hating myself because I know I'll never be able to do all of them without sacrificing  quality of my work. 

My family doesn't know really anything about this, because we don't have that kind of relationship...but it turns up in waves sometimes, a little bit of me sneaks out that's not supposed to and they see it. I'm really paranoid about my relationship with them though. 

A lot of nights during school when I start to get anxious I put myself into intentional sleep deprivation. I don't go to sleep on purpose. I won't let myself. I'll just stay up and walk around or go to ihop or the 24 hour coffee shop or find someone awake, like my homeless friends, because I have this drive to keep thinking, to keep exploring, to keep wondering what life is for. I'll go a couple days without sleeping sometimes, or average a couple hours a night. On purpose. When I crash, I crash hard. It's not that I can't sleep, it's that I won't. 

I'm enthralled with life, but when I look at other people I don't know if I""m doing it right. These people with their internships for science and their connections and successes...when last month instead of doing anything 'productive' for my career I decided to volunteer on a farm in Canada. I loved it so much, and found a million more things I loved and appreciated. But I don't have a job, in fact I never have, I've just volunteered places. That's another soft spot for me, that even though I'm mostly on scholarship at school, my parents are helping me pay for school and sometimes they cater to me too much and I hate it...I don't want them to spoil me, I constantly am awkwardly refusing money and help because I want to make sure I learn its value on my own...but because of all my random volunteering/trips in the summers I'm always gone too long for a summer job and then I feel bad because all I end up doing is teaching piano lessons for $10 to kids or whatever. I feel awkward when I tell people I'm a music major becacuse that's not 'practical' to people....why do I have to be practical, huh? Why does everybody in my fucking family pressure me to be a fucking doctor or a scientist when all I want to do is learn about other people's lives and gather pieces of everything imaginable into my own? FUCK. Sorry this is so long...ughhhh  

The trouble is...sometimes, deep down I find a happy pleasure inside from the way I get...because I know most people aren't so topsy turvy like this (at least, from the way people don't quite understand what I'm talking about whenever I reveal part of myself to them) it makes me feel special, like I get to have this cool crazy experience in my life that's with me all the time that nobody else will ever get to see. God dammit, I'm re reading this post now, and it's so long and so ridiculous I bet hardly anybody's read this far, I sound like a nut. Whatever. Also I probably forgot something, but I'm too drained now to even bother trying to think of it.

TL;DR: I would really appreciate it if someone did read all of this, just to get an outside perspective. Basically I'm troubled by a severely conflicting personality that interferes with the way I handle my life, and in addition I can't get over my fascination with life to do productive work a lot of the time, and I'm just...really stuck? Hard to abbreviate this. "

I am currently a computer science student at a pretty well known college. I am doing a year long internship at the moment before I go into my final year. 

Comp Sci wasn't my first choice. I switched plans many times. Then I took an introductory programming class, and I was good at it, so I decided I'd go into comp sci.

However, over the last 4 years and now in my internship, I have found that I do not enjoy programming. It's mind-numbingly dull for me, and it terrifies me that I am setting myself up to this for the rest of my life. The reason I find it boring is because I feel confined to my desk. There is limited social interaction, since programming is largely solitary. Sure, you have meetings to discuss features, but then you sit behind your computer for a few more hours, wondering what the heck the guy who programmed the program before you was thinking.

I know I want to finish my degree. I've worked too hard at it not to, and I wouldn't be able to afford more years of college. But I also know I do not want to do this for the rest of my life. But I don't know what else I would or could do. I enjoy photography, but mostly nature and landscapes, which don't provide a lot of job opportunities. I like travelling, but fat chance I can make money with that. I do want to teach abroad for a year after graduating, though. I also like writing, and I'm good at it if I take my time; this post was made in about 10 minutes, so some grammar might be off.

However, I have no long term plan right now. Everyone in my program has their plans of going straight to work after school, and coding for the rest of their lives.

It's a small state government department, not something any of our interns would ever hope to apply for out of school. I'm not her manager, not her supervisor, do not review her performance, and most interns have minimal interaction with my department, if any. 

Still, I am a salaried employee here while she's an unpaid volunteer trying to get legal work experience, so there is a bit of a power imbalance.

I have kept things entirely professional, and even rebuffed (gently &amp; subtly) an earlier come-on. However, she recently set up an appointment with me to help her, ah review some material. After a few minutes it became quite evident that she was interested in just having a chat about life. She suggested that we'll have to continue next week, since we ran out of time.

I've dated enough to recognize attraction, and it is mutual. She's in from out of town, only here for a few more weeks. I'd be interested in seeing if this could turn into a summer fling.

First of all, it's a PR agency, I don't think it will translate as well as I hope when I'm trying to get into the ad world. I feel like I spend most of my time doing warehouse work/bitch work than actually writing.

Then I'm writing press releases and sending them off to publicists who are barely older than me - and subsequently can't give me a ton of feedback other than how ""they would do it.""

So the bottom line for this internship - its something to put on my resume (I have that already), I have to spend 9 hours a week driving back and forth to this place, and my stipend isn't enough to cover all the gas. Plus I got a speeding ticket the other day driving there - so the stipend is technically even less now..

And as you can see from the title I am back. 

I went 57 days through my first try and caved when I had a move, new job, and was just plain lonely. What is interesting to think though is if I hadn't gone that 57 days I wouldn't have had to move in the first place. I busted my ass and finished my Junior year of college semester off with a 3.75, landed an internship in a big company, and moved out for the summer to work.

I was pretty content with where I had gotten, and looking back I realize to an extent I achieved this because of all the energy I had built up abstaining from PMO. I have been PMOing for the past month and a half and I feel like I am a shell of myself from when I entered the summer.

I noticed before I 'reset' that I really had a genuine interest in women, and I was actually more actively engaging them just for fun compared to now where I am back to seeing them as objects of satisfying my sexual desire. It is really interesting personally for when I reset to how nothing much would satisfy my desire, but then to see how quickly I escalated back to my old self. 

I will not lie when I reset I doubted NoFap... I saw all these guys claiming because of X, Y has happened. To some extent I see it, and don't. NoFap really brings some confidence, and pride back in to yourself (as it did for me) because you are almost setting something for yourself to achieve. If anything I love pushing myself to limits, it never is necessarily about results but the sheer fact of achieving the goal I set myself. My first time through I never really believed in the 90 days but for someone like me, I think I may require more time to really reset myself and snap out of PMO.

I apologize for the really scattered post, but this is a timestamp for me to really re-commit myself to something that was such a positive experience in my life (No I never got a girlfriend, but I realized how much more energy I had every day not wanking it every night, how much more of a push I had to just do things I normally wouldn't have been interested in, and seriously you become more appreciative of everything around you.. especially the gorgeous, real ladies around you.).

John Jay is significantly more research based than The Chicago School and I have been told would be better to apply to Ph.D programs with a degree from there. The Chicago School offers Psy.D programs.

I am torn between which school to go to and need to make a decision very soon.

We got to the hospital by about 12:20. Sat in triage until just after 3:30 'cause tweedle-dee and tweedle-dumb (my interns) were all kinds of clueless. Finally got back to a delivery room. They tried to start Pitocin the moment  set foot in the room. I wanted none of that nonsense. They agreed to give me a couple of hours to see if I progressed. Fast forward 2 hours- contractions were actually FADING, despite walking, using a ball, and a hot shower. Kiddo's heart rate was a bit sketchy, so I let them give me a single unit of Pitocin every 10 minutes. There as an IMMEDIATE change. Within 20 minutes, I went from all kinds of hunky-dorey (watching The Walking Dead and joking with the staff) to crying in pain with every contraction. I accidently dislocated hubby's thumb :( Pain went from bad to worse. I ended up begging for an epidural, since I was way too far past the point of getting IV painkillers. We got as far as swabbing my back with iodine, but I couldn't hold still for the needle. Outright could not force myself to stop writhing. Meditating through the contractions was a lost cause by this point. Luckily, the moment the anestesiolotist left, I started feeling this horrible pressure. Kiddo decided that just the THREAT of an epidural was enough! Gods all bless, they call it the ring of fire for a REASON. I scared the piss out of 2 brand-new interns with my howling. Got nasty as hell with the one who kept trying to give me the mirror- I just wanted to push. I didn't give a single fuck about watching! Within 10 minutes of pushing (or so I'm told. It felt like an eternity), the little one finally made it into this world. Her lungs are better than MINE!!! I ended up with 3 very minor tears due to her rapid entrance. Still sore as hell, but I'll live

TL/DR: Alexis Bailey was born at 8:56 pm, no pain meds whatsoever :D"

w7q7i,4,2012-07-08,I am all out of options. How do I pay for college?,rslarson147,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/w7q7i/i_am_all_out_of_options_how_do_i_pay_for_college/,"I am in a utter loss.

I currently about to start my second year at Iowa State University as a Computer Engineering major.  I love everything about the school except for one thing, my tuition bill.  I am attending as an out-of state-student due to the fact that the state I live in is shit broke and the University system is suffering from it.  That being said, I have to pay around 31K a year to attend.

About me:  I am a white, middle-class, male.  These three attributes make it nearly impossible for me to receive any real federal aid.  Now many of you may be thinking, ""Why can't your parents pay for you?"".  To this I have a very simple answer, my dad is an asshole and my mom is not financially able to.  Oh, and f.y.i, my parents are divorced which makes things that much harder.  I know this does not make me special, it just make me apart of the majority (sadly enough).

What I have done: A HUGE expense for any undergrad is living expenses.  Last year is cost me around $1000 a month to live in a dorm.  Yes that number includes food, but still.  After looking at this number, I decided to get an apartment for the upcoming school year.  In doing so, I was able to find a place for around $500 including utilities which the only variable would be food.  So I have been able to cut down my living expense nearly by half.

This probably should of been said first but I do not care.  I do not have good grades.  I fucked around a lot my first year making it that much more difficult to receive aid.  Since returning home, I have talking with a company that would like to hire me as an intern (just because I fucked around does not mean I am an idiot) and hire me after I graduate.  This internship will solve all my financial worries; they are willing to pay for my tuition, housing, and on top of that, they were going to pay me a yearly salary.   The only requirement I do not meet is my GPA (I need at least a 3.0).

Now I have come to my problem.  Since I fucked around to much this last year, I do not qualify for federal aid.  I really want this internship, so I have been looking at private loans.  Remember when I said my dad being an asshole?  Well, like most students I needed a cosigner for my loans.  So I reached out to my father.  I told him my predicament and basically told me that I should drop out and go to a CC since he will not cosign.  Let me tell you something about my dad, he would rather buy a BMW then help his own son.  Since my dad will not help me and my mom can not, I have been asking my extended family for help.  Everyone on my mom's side is more then willing to help me out any way that they can.  My dad's side, nothing.

Sorry for ranting, but this helps me vent my frustrations.

Down to the questions.  Has anyone been in a similar position, and if so, what have you done to pay for school?

I am not looking for handouts, just advice as to where I should look next.  Ideally I would like to find a place where I can get a student loan without a cosigner but I know that is unlikely. 

tl;dr I need help paying for school and I do not know where to look."

I'll start... ,iamataco,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/w7olz/reddit_whats_your_biggest_blown_opportunity_ill/,"Hi everyone, First post! I've been a daily lurker since 2007... I've never had anything to contribute until this popped into my head last week. I hope you like it. So here's my biggest blown opportunity:

In early 2006 I was a senior in Broadcasting @ San Francisco State University. I had just discovered Youtube (right before they became huge) and I sent a joke/love letter to the contact field on their site explaining how I was so glad I finally found a video streaming/hosting site and if they ever needed anything I would be glad to help. I thought nothing of this and continued my day. So.... 45 minutes later I get a call on my cell phone and it's Steve Chen (co-founder of Youtube). He got my email, really appreciated the positive response and wanted to know if I could come in to talk. OF COURSE I DID! So I put on my nicest clothes (which as a broke college student was an old Brooks Brothers suit that I think my mom bought me at a thrift shop...) and jumped in my old beat up truck to downtown Burlingame (At the time, Youtube was located over a pizza shop and had I think about 10 employees)... So I came in, met Steve and talked about how awesome their site was and how it was going to be huge (understatement of the decade). I also met Chad Hurley (other co-founder) along with a few other peeps when they came back from their lunch. So we continued our conversation and Steve offered me an internship. I asked if it was paid... It was not, as they only had like 10 employees and 1 other intern from Stanford and couldn't afford anyone else. I said that I needed the internship to be paid if I was going to take it as I couldn't work without pay...(Keep in mind that I was putting myself through college, already had 2 part-time jobs, another non-paid internship, 15 college units and 30k in student loan debt) So... He thanked me for my time, and gave me a youtube shirt. I went home, promptly lost his card/didn't save his number and didn't think too much about it until youtube blew up and became a multi-billion dollar part of Google about 12 months later. I then realized what a HUGE FUCKING MISTAKE I HAD MADE.

**TLDR**: Offered an internship @ youtube before they were cool, turned it down, got free shirt instead. :(

w7o5u,9,2012-07-08,Would a career in web development work for a person with a rare sleep disability?,hopefulnon24,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/w7o5u/would_a_career_in_web_development_work_for_a/,"Hi there. I'm not sure if this is the appropriate sub-reddit; but I've been lurking here for a while so I'm just going to post here. It's a long background story, but I'll try to make it quick. 

I won't bore you guys with the details, but I suffer from a constantly moving sleep cycle called [Non24](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-24-hour_sleep-wake_disorder). Basically, a genetic disposition makes me sleep an hour later every day, I can't stop it; and at this point it is incurable. 9-5 jobs are impossible, night shifts are impossible...any job with an unmovable shift is impossible, without severely affecting my health. I didn't know enough about my disorder in high school/college, so I followed practicality and got a degree Biochemistry thinking I could work a normal lab job. Turns out I can't work like that without getting sick(compromising my immune system) from serious sleep deprivation. I already have a few health problems resulting from extreme sleep deprivation. I can't put my body through that anymore. 

Now I have to learn how to live with the disorder instead of fighting it. I have no other option. I'd rather be homeless than sick. That means any career in biochemistry/biotech, is out the window. I've tried to get jobs in the field, but they are very unforgiving about this type of disability and won't accommodate. I can't really blame them though (well yes I can, thanks to the disability act, but whatever), its a hard disorder for any company to accommodate; since its so unpredictable in a sense. 

I've researched every type of job imaginable that would work for a person with non24. And, really, there aren't any that work well with it. After spending a year exploring, testing, ruling out different career plans, this brings me to where I am today. I want to try pursuing a career in web development. 

Thing is, I have no previous web development experience, I'm completely new to this. So far, I love everything I am learning about this field. I love how this field marries together art and technology, specifically with design and programming. I used to want to be an artist, but I gave that up in favor of science; thinking it would be more stable for me (jokes on me thanks to non24). Anyways, I spend most of my time recently doing tutorials, watching videos, and practicing html/css on Notepad. It's just really refreshing for learning to actually be fun to me. It's way more fun to me than learning biochemistry was in college. I know it can get pretty hard and sometimes frustrating when learning these skills, but I really enjoy being challenged in this way. We'll see how much I like it when I get more into JavaScript though. And I know its going to take me a while to get used to the terminology and lingo; but I'm definitely up for the challenge &gt;:]

But..I *know* I shouldn't get my hopes up. If I don't have a chance getting a job in web development that works with my non24, there really isn't any hope for me in this field. I really don't know how this field works. I know the biotech field pretty well, but I think web development is a bit different. I really need a brutally honest opinion from people in the field. Seriously. If you don't think I even remotely have a chance, tell me. 

So here are some general questions I have. 

1. Would an employer look down on me for having a degree in biochem instead of Computer Science? Does a degree really matter if I can get the job done?

2. I know companies and employees all have different ways of operating and managing their business. What are your experiences with full time jobs in web development? Are most employers in the field really rigid with working hours, or do they not care as long as the job gets done? Do you think any companies would accommodate someone with a sleep disorder, or do they generally not like doing that?

3. I know there is an option for freelancing, where I could make my own schedule up to accommodate my non24, but is there really much of a demand for freelance web developers? How is the competition? Do I have a chance of making a living as a freelancer if I work hard enough? 
Would anyone want to hire me without any on-the-job experience?

4. What do employers want to see on a web developer's resume? Do they want to see internships, on the job experience, a portfolio, websites they helped to develop? 

I apologize if these questions sound dumb or redundant. I just need to know if I even have a chance. If I know there is even a little bit of hope for me in this field, I will put all my effort into doing what I need to do be a good web developer. I will make it happen. I really hope this type of job works out for me...because I really like what I'm learning so far and I don't want to give up. 
Some girls that I know tell me that I should just take the ""easy"" route with my non24 and get knocked up by some guy that will pay for my basic needs. But I'd rather live under a bench selling whittled tree branches on the street than do that. 

Thanks for your help. "

I wanted to bring some attention to something that many of us may be neglecting in our daily lives due to various other reasons: financial investing. 

I'm no expert at it, and I started ahead due to my education through both my family and academically of course. So claiming that I'm the Phoenix and rose from the financial ashes would be a complete lie. 

A little about me: I'm 28, getting my phd in electrical engineering this Monday after defending it at 4pm. Due to scholarships and working while undergrad and research assistantship while I was a grad student I am getting out of school without any debt, and in fact with some cash in my pocket. 

If you are in college: 

* Apply for scholarships. There are a lot of them believe it or not. I was a chapter president of a national student organization and I kept telling the members to apply for the scholarships and it turns out our chapter got almost 40% of all the national scholarships available because nobody else was applying.

* Get good grades and actually understand what you're learning in class. Getting good grades will get you a scholarship probably, but knowing your stuff will land you a great job with a greater possibility to go higher in the ladder.

* Invest in networking! Student organizations and group projects are great. I may even land a job through a friend of mine that I did senior design with. 

* Internships!!! Yes reddit is great and summer is fun but an internship during summer will mean a lot more than a few extra thousand you'll be doing once you realize that all the companies that are hiring, are actually prioritizing their interns since they know them!

**General rule of thumb:**

**Don't spend the money you don't have.**

This doesn't mean ""Don't ever get credit cards"". I love credit cards. So many of my friends are against them thinking it's not their money they're spending with credit card, so they should go with cash to see how much they've got left for the week/month etc. I on the other hand use credit card in almost everything (except for mom and pop shops) and follow my transactions religiously through ** Mint.com.**

* Register for mint.com and download the  app to your phone and have the widget on the home screen constantly updating your financial status! You'll know how much you've got.

* Don't buy something just because it's on sale and you don't really need it(God, my dad does this often)

* You can only get ahead by buying something cheap, not while selling it. There's always a market price for an item. Let's talk about cars. You can almost never buy a car, use it and sell it and get even or profit UNLESS you bought the car for way below the price for some reason. There will always be tons of people selling the same or similar car for the market price but occasionally there will be someone who's selling it because he needs cash and he needs it now. Just wait for those opportunities to show up. I bought a 3 year old Honda CRV for 10.5k (he needed cash immediately). Used it for 3 years and sold it for 10.2k which was about the market price when selling. 

* Start reading economy and finance related sites. Check out yahoo finance and register for fool.com . Both beautiful sites. Start understanding the basics of stock market investing because that's where your money is going to be when you actually put money on your IRA. At fool.com you can pick stocks and say over / under perform and see how your predictions are. You can see what others are doing and read the comments, news etc. It doesn't hurt to watch the podcasts of CNBC's Fast Money even though you may not understand anything for a few weeks, and Mad Money just as a beginner since he's both entertaining and educating for the novices (it doesn't mean buy whatever he's saying the next day). 

* Put some money on the side in another account (savings/stock market/another checking) in every paycheck and learn to live within the means of a less paycheck.

* Consider being a small scale slumlord around college campuses. Cheap condos (Less than 40k) have great return on investment. I'm considering one. 

I'm aware that the post is not structured well but I'll eventually do it and add more content. Please share your suggestions as well. Agree or disagree? Please let me know. I'll change this post based on feedbacks like I just did :)"

I graduated with a degree in psychology about a year and a half ago. I'd like to get a job in human resources. So far, my only post-college job experience involves working with people who have mental disabilities -- an internship at a state psychiatric hospital and then I became a job coach at a government-funded non-profit, where I am currently. However, I believe that I am a much stronger candidate than my resume looks. About a year ago (after graduating), I underwent a huge transformation and went from being a lazy bum who was fine with a mediocre job to someone who is highly motivated and aggressively seeking to advance my career. I am quite knowledgeable about businesses. My mother has owned a small business for as long as I can remember. I read the WSJ every day and I actively manage/research my stock portfolio. I know a lot about public policy, but nothing very specific to workers' rights, etc. I work very hard. I believe that these things give me a solid base for learning and an advantage over other applicants.

The problem is that my resume reflects the lazy bum from before and not my current self. I have some impressive volunteer work from college I guess, but no awards, honors, or real job experience in business. I realize that it's my fault, but how do I make the best of this? See a job recruiter? Come across as competent/knowledgeable in the cover letter (without being tacky of course)? 

Thank you."

After that entire spiel about how wonderful I was at math, the interviewer asked if I could send my unofficial transcripts through email. I sent my actual transcripts which in great detail show how I am in fact horrible at math. Have taken all Calculus courses and a few upper level math classes but probably had to retake about 2/3 of those classes and passed with all c's. 

Turns out they sent me an email setting up an appointment for an in person interview BEFORE they saw my transcripts. Now I know they've seen them and they know I lied and I don't know what to do. 

I honestly feel horrible about lying, I didn't think before I spoke and I feel like a complete moron. Getting poor marks in math has always been a touchy subject for me.

I intend to turn this into a 6 issue a year series and I had a inker/colorist but they seem to be missing in action so I have to find another one.


Lemon Lass and the Lesson Learned


Dublin, Ireland 1940 

Scott Lawson was a bartender at a local pub called McDaids. He had worked there since 1935 and been a steel worker in Dublin before that. In the entire Republic of Ireland, and especially in Dublin, it is not difficult to find pubs’ rich in character and history. Even so, the pub known simply as McDaids stands on its own as one of Dublin's most colorful pubs, both literally and figuratively, having once been a favored meeting place for cutting-edge Irish writers. Scott enjoyed working there and was well known by his customers.                                                                                           

He was a burly man with red hair, rosy cheeks and a full red beard and he laughed a very hearty laugh. He was the sort of fellow that you could trust but also have fear and respect for. He stood well over 7 feet and was nearly 300 lbs in Scottish muscle. Yeah, it’s true, a Scotsman working in a pub in Ireland. He had moved there because he had fallen in love with a girl named Eileen 0’Sullivan. They had met because they had a mutual friend named Danny MacLaren associated with the clan MacLaren, a very influential family at the time in Dublin. Danny had been a news correspondent for activities overseas, especially involving, a hero named The Great Guava who hailed from America in a place called Citrus City. Ireland had recently had a real interest in the activities over in Citrus City and even had a few super powered individuals of its own to help fight crime in Dublin. Scott Lawson was secretly one of them. 



He called himself “Buffalo Red” and wore a costume that looked somewhat like a cross between a red bull and a brown buffalo. He only fought crime on the streets late at night donning his costume not even an hour after his shift ended at the pub. Eileen was very concerned about his activities late night and wanted him to stop and settle down and have a family. She was a small and slender Irish girl who had blond hair and blue eyes, was a farmer’s daughter having grown up outside of Dublin working on her fathers farm until she met Scott.  He was so in love with her, but he just felt he had to continue and fight as a masked hero. He even considered moving to America to help The Great Guava with his fight against the up and coming Nazis in Germany who seemed to be threatening the world and gaining power each day. The Great Guava was a well-known hero in Citrus City.

On May 1st 1941 Scott Lawson was in an alleyway just outside the pub and met for the first time, a villain who was beyond imagination. He had the image of a spider on his chest emblazoned in green and wore what seemed to be a cross between a military uniform and some dreaded dark cloaked woodsman. The figure stepped out of the shadows and barked “Lime Lord does not like heroes…your death will prevent her birth! ‘Red’.  It’s time to for you to die.” He began to cast a magic spell that left Buffalo Red helpless and unable to move. The Green Figure leapt upon him and began to crush him while his life essence was slipping away. But just then another figure stepped out of the shadows but this one was glowing with an aura so bright she seemed like an Angel. Her name was Madame Medallion. She was one of those new heroes that everyone was talking about in Ireland. She was a defender and a healer with a gold metallic body. She seemed very tall and ample almost like a Goddess.





It was rumored she was granted powers by some sort of mystic cross found in a cave near Killakee. The cross was fabled to have had the ability to repel all evil, no matter how strong the source. It was also rumored that it had healing powers as well and it had been lost for centuries and once belonging to Vlad The Impaler. She began to cast what seemed like a golden yellow glowing aura from her body which then began to heal Scott in a way he’d never known before all of his power began to return and he leapt up to his feet and sent the solider flying with a haymaker attack and it literally knocked the soldier out in one blow. He had wondered how he got so strong all of the sudden. Madame Medallion looked at him and smiled “Oh that, well I gave you some extra buffing to your power…I have the ability to enhance peoples strengths and heal their weaknesses to a degree. So your Buffalo Red, hmm I can see why.” she giggled. “I have heard a lot about you. I was flying overhead and I saw that green thing. Something I have never seen before here in Dublin…seemed out of place somehow.” 

Scott was amazed “Well M’lady I am very glad that ye decided to save me sorry butt. I think I was getting a bit Cocky for my own good. Maybe I will take up my wife’s offer to leave here and travel to America before this place is overrun with those spider things, barley look human. I am starting to think having a family sounds a lot better right now.” Madame Medallion Chimed “Well it’s not any better there right now as far as high powered villains go but surely you would get a lot more training and skills in Citrus City…that’s where I’m headed to right now actually, America to go and live in Citrus City. I hear it’s a great place for an up and coming hero or heroine to live. You should go there and work on your skills.” Scott looks down at her and says “That sounds like a fine plan for sure…I’d hate to leave this town and the pub…they are all good people here but If I am to continue my career as a hero I think I could use some help.” 




After the incident with The Green Figure, Scott Lawson and Eileen O’Sullivan move to America where they get married at Stanton Island just before becoming citizens and then in August of 1941 moved to Citrus City.  Scott continues his adventures there and becomes trained by The Great Guava himself and even helps The Great Guava later on overseas in 1945 to battle against Leidenschaft,  which was The Great Guava’s alternate universe self as a Nazi. After some time Eileen O’ Sullivan had decided to become a schoolteacher, had a Master’s Degree in science and education, and was teaching biochemistry and chemistry to high school students in Banana Bay, one of the many suburbs in Citrus City. 

In 1959 they had both reached middle age and had lived a good life in Citrus City. They decided it was time to have a baby. Or at least try having one.  Eileen was now 40 and Scott was 47 so they had thought at one time they’d never have children but now with the comfort they experienced in their townhouse in galaxy city they knew it was just right to have a child. In April of 1959 Eileen became pregnant and Scott was overjoyed. A few Heroes came over to celebrate and this included statesman. Yeah, Scott Lawson and Kevin Cole (known as The Great Guava) had become good friends and by this time “Buffalo Red” was a household name in Citrus City. Nine months later Eileen gave birth to a bouncing baby girl. She was very small like her mom and had a little bit of blond hair. Her father looked at her and said “My aren’t you a wee lass!” He was so happy to be a dad now and Eileen was exhausted from the day’s labor.  But before she fell asleep she said to Scott “Let’s name her Linda after Madame Medallion…you know….her real name! It makes so much sense Scott…after all we would have never made it this far had it not been for her.” Scott considered it for a second and bellowed out “Well how about Linda “Lass” Lawson, How does that sound M’lady?!” They both smiled and laughed and so it was that Linda Lass Lawson was born. 





Linda grew up well rather slow it seemed at age 5 she was no more than 2 feet tall and 65 lbs. She had wavy blond hair from her mother and green eyes from her father. Her mom’s Blue eyes however seemed to chime in there as well giving her some eye changing abilities more like an ocean color. She was a smart girl too and by the time she was age 9 had already been in high school where her mother got to teach her and found that she was ahead of her class. At age 10 she was beginning to grow into a beautiful yet still small girl. Her hair was shiny and seemed to glow a sunny yellow color. She had so much energy and was full of awe and wonder at nature and anything to do with science.  At age 13 she graduated from high school and she was receiving all sorts of offers for college. She had a hard time deciding which one to take. She had been a lot like her mother and even considered teaching students like her mother.
Part of her desired to do what her father did every day. But she never let on to those desires to anyone. 

She got a letter in the mail during the summer of 1975 from a new company called “Livingston Industries” which was famous for its bio-tech and a newly formed agricultural research center code named “Frost Freeze” which was supposed to be conducting some very high tech and bio-organic methods into increasing food production. In the letter it was touted that Linda Lawson was known for her intelligence by Countess Clarissa Van Livingston the current President of the industries.  The Countess was a very high society woman and intelligent to boot. She had walked into the money by marrying the man originally in charge of Livingston Industries. She was a petite woman, but strong and had black hair and wore a lot of blue.  The Countess had signed the letter with a personal invitation to work as an intern and eventually acquire a position at Livingston Industries as a well paid and funded researcher for “Citrus Orchards” a subsidiary in Plum Park part of Citrus City. Linda thought about the offer and after talking it over with her parents, she decided to take the internship and went to “Livingston Folly” to meet the Countess. Immediately the Countess was impressed with Ms.Lawson’s ability to conceive new ideas from out of the blue. 

Even surpassing most of the researchers there in raw intellect and ability to solve problems to formulas they’d been working on for years. Over the next few years and at the age of 16 she was placed in charge of “Citrus Orchards.” In 1980 at the age of 18 she was the youngest scientist in the field of biochemistry and organic science. She had developed countless organic/chemical compounds that increased food production and quality and resistance to diseases and insect damage. Citrus City had been blessed with marketplaces rising up that were fed by a countless growth of farmers who used the formulas that Livingston had created with the help (generous help in fact) of Linda Lawson. Of course Countess Livingston being the high society figure she was took most of the credit. This didn’t really bother Linda so much as she was more than happy with her work and how it had begun to see even a world wide impact on crops and the ability to withstand destruction. For the next 10 years she worked hard and even became rich enough to move into a townhouse of her own. 

Her father was getting along in age now as her mother was starting to as well and they were retired and living in a new part of town called Pineapple Falls. They had bought a high rise there with the help of Linda and her new found monies that Countess Livingston had given her for such a bug successful venture for the company.  So now Linda had finally blossomed from being a “wee lass” to a 5 foot tall drop dead knock out. Linda was very buff and tone and she accredited it to all the workout sessions with her dad at the local gym. She was very interested in her father’s crime fighting and wished she had at sometimes been a tanker like her father had. She had some of his strength and mass but was still a shorty. “Blame it all on mom, I guess”, she mused. But Linda Lawson was very much a great find for any guy and had even started dating a fellow named Lance Livingston. She thought that it was funny he had an alliteration name like hers where both names begin with the same letter. 





Lance was the son of Countess Van Livingston, but he was just a reckless party going rich boy. His father Count George Von Livingston had died in 1978 so he decided to let his mom run the company. Well honestly it was a mutual decision as Clarissa felt that her son needed some help or some sort of rehab or something. So she was funding him money to live in an apartment in Pineapple Falls the high society neighborhood in Citrus City. He is a handsome fellow with brown medium length hair and a polo player build with teeth that could light up a room. Very tall and a somewhat muscular build. He hated his mom lately for some of the ways she’d been handling the company. He started dating Linda Lawson when she was 18 and he was 24 at the time.  Linda loved his party boy attitude. He would buy Linda extravagant gifts and ravishing dresses straight from the best stores. Linda was moving away from being a smart Goth girl to a high society scientist.  

On July 1st 1992 at 10:05 Pm in Pineapple Falls near the entrance to Banana Bay, Scott and Eileen Lawson were walking in the park enjoying the scenery when just below there feet a green glowing pod appeared. Sort of like a seed and it seemed to engulf them. Nearby citizens said they saw what looked like a glowing light and two citizens being engulfed in the light. Then a little boy looked and said “Mommy isn’t that Buffalo Red”?  He recognized him, as Scott had since given up his secret identity and people knew what he looked like in and out of costume. As the mother tried to answer, Scott and Linda were transforming into what looked like a green lime with teeth and a flying green bat. They crowd before them shrieked in horror. This was the 2nd time they’d seen a citizen or hero for that matter turn into one of those lime earth creatures. This was a new thing though…no one had ever seen anyone transform this way before. After there transformation they ran to the gate of Banana Bay where apparently they went to “Serve the Lime Lord” as they were screaming out just before they left. The next day the paper told of the strange yet sad occurrence.
 


Linda awoke and went to work that day not knowing what had happened until she walked by a news-stand and the headline read “Buffalo Red transformed into lime earth!!” She knelt down in front of the newsstand and began to cry.  She knew her dad and mom were gone and this meant that they were dead to her now. Lost victims of a strange force that she had just been barely aware of. She was numb and still, the wind beating at her like a cruel master. She began to shiver and then fainted. She awoke in the Hospital of Banana Bay to find The Apple Aggressor, The Great Guava, Sister Star Fruit and Coconutter by her side with solemn looks on their faces. “Hello Linda…welcome back” said the Great Guava.  Coconutter chimed in and said “Hey there lass…I saw what happened to your parents but I was too late to do anything. It was horrible…God I’m so sorry.” Linda began to cry again…but was relieved that her friends had shown up to comfort her…out of all the heroes in Citrus City these ones felt like an extended family to her. 



They had all known her growing up rather well as Buffalo Red was a reserve member of The Core Commanders. He was quite often called to duty. In fact The Apple Aggressor had taught him how to make the most of his “brute strength” without actually becoming a brute. “Yeah my wife and I are just torn up about all this…he was a great guy…so was your mom…they both had a love for this city that was the best thing about them. I…am sorry Linda.” After spending a day in the hospital she went home to rest as per orders of Countess Livingston “Take some time off Linda…don’t worry about it production is still at 99.6%. You can make up for it when you get back.” So after about a month she vacationed in her favorite getaway destination Apple Island. She had traveled to there to visit her old friend Danny MacLaren who by now was 98 years old and living in an apartment near the Heroes Arena. He went there every day to watch heroes battle and train for battle. Linda was more than happy to attend them. She spent some time sailing and saw some of the monsters that had taken over her parents in the distance in Banana Bay. 


She had enough of those jerks. Linda wished she could do something about them. She began to feel a lot of hatred for those monsters. But also pity because a lot of them had been human before. She wasn’t sure what to feel. After returning home in August she went to work the next day. She arrived at work to find that they had been working on an experimental additive for citrus trees. It was labeled “BX-9-Livingston”. It had instructions not to allow the substance to be placed near any electrical powers sources and it had a data sheet that explain strange chemical resequencing when coming within a foot of electrical current. This was the best additive yet combining ingredients from Linda’s previous work but containing some ingredient that was classified “data info for Countess Livingston’s eyes only” Linda was puzzled.

What is this all about! She was furious and called The Countess on a video phone.  “Clarissa!!, what the hell is going on here why is there a new additive with and ingredient I cannot know…how the hell am I supposed to work on that and run tests on it?!”  “Calm your voice dear” Countess Livingston said. “You’ve been through an awful lot lately and I will excuse your tone of voice…but as you know I am the head of this project and you are considered the scientific head and it is at my discretion to decide what my employees get to see as far as that goes. I trust you recall the contract you signed with us the day I gave you a job here?!”  Linda was about to speak again but she realized the Countess had seemed to shift her tone of voice from pleasant as there conversations had always been, almost like sisters in fact, to a very cold and angry bitter woman who was getting angrier by the second. “Yes I know it seems it a bit much dear…lassy poo…but you trust your Clarissa don’t you, Linda?” “Oh now she is tormenting me!” Linda thought. She remembered that Countess Livingston tried to act like a mother to her because when she started she was just 16. In fact they had spent a lot of time together.  And Clarissa was very well of her relationship with her son Lance.




Sometimes it seemed like the Countess had more than just intentions of being a friend. It almost seemed like she wanted to push Linda’s own mom out of the way keeping her at bay. It was strange but she put up with it. Now however she was not going to take it. Linda, under the pressure of her parents dying snapped, “Listen here, you cold hearted wench….you never liked my parents so don’t try to act like them! They are dead now thank you and you pull this crap on me and try to cut me out of a project…why don’t you rot in Hell!” Clarissa looked at her with steely eyes through the video monitor and simply stated “You’re fired” and then shut the monitor off. Linda took a step back and yelled out loud to no one in particular “You can’t fire me….you…you…can’t….I am Linda Lawson…I’m the daughter of Buffalo Red…the greatest hero ever”, she started screaming and crying….”The greatest hero ever….and mom…mom…..MOM!!!!” Just then two Livingston Lords…the enforcers of the company used as sort of a personal security ran into the room to see what the commotion was. They saw Linda screaming and crying and cursing the Countess at the same time. 


They then heard orders over their intercom to escort Ms. Lawson from the premises and have her things boxed up and sent packing with her. One of the protectors started gathering the items that were hers asking the co-employees to point them out for him. The other one, a female, moved towards Linda and said “Time to go dear…your services are no longer required here!” Linda tried to fight her off but after a quick whack in the head she went unconscious and lay limp in the protector’s hand. The other one a huge male protector started putting items in a box. But he accidentally placed a vile of the “BX-9Livingston” into her box…as he was trying to hurry up and help his partner carry Ms. Lawson out of the room. 




Eleven hours later Linda groggily awoke with a splitting headache and was somewhere near the entrance to Plum Park and she had in her hand a box of all the stuff the Grey Gaffers let her have as it were. Just a few notes, pictures of family and a small vile. She perked up “”Huh, what is the bx-9Livingston serum doing in the box…Oh my God; they must have put it in here by accident. Oh my God what if they find out its missing and they think I stole it out of spite…well I might have done that anyways…God what do I do now!” She looked around and stood up and said “Oh my head…gosh did they have to hit me so hard. I mean gees…that’s like totally, not cool.” She heard herself say the words but was a little shaken. 

She was starting to talk like she did when she was a Goth girl back when she was 16 and just starting to work for the Livingston and had sort of grown out of the Goth look over time. But as soon as the feeling came it passed. “Well that was certainly odd…I wonder why I talked like that…oh well it seemed to feel good I guess ha-ha” She started laughing out of control and then felt her brain hurt again. Then she had a flashback of memories come flooding back. She was being escorted out of the office when she was told to wait by the lemon orchards in the field while they get her papers. She thought ‘Wait, didn’t they just whack me in the head what do they want with me now…not that I could do anything to them anyway, as strong as they are.’ 

They came back and told Linda that Countess Livingston was a bit hasty and decided that if Linda would experiment and use the serum on a nearby tree and take the risk of using such a highly dangerous serum she would be given grace and allowed to continue employment there. Linda thought about it for a while…she had seen this before…in fact The Countess  had fired her numbers of times and re-hired her after realizing what an asset she was for the company. But it had almost seemed this time she would really stay fired. Now Clarissa was playing games again with her it seemed. She agreed reluctantly to test the serum. Linda opened the vial and poured the contents into a sprayer and then proceeded to water a lemon tree. As the mixture hit the tree it began to grow ever so slightly but noticeable to the human eye…after about 5 minutes of application the tree had grown 5 feet and produced new blooms. But the older fruits had also reverted back into blooms by some strange process. And the new blooms then became Fruits. 

It was an odd reaction at best. The Countess seeing this over the cameras bellowed out over the intercom “Bah…a failure….sorry Linda but I think this time I’m going to actually fire you…your formulas have gotten sloppy” Linda shouted “But you’re the one who tampered with it and changed it…its not my……not my fault…whoa look at that!!”  Overhead a storm was brewing and very fast...too fast for a normal storm...everyone looked up to see a bolt of energy blast from the clouds zap the lemon tree and Linda Lawson at the same time….she fell to the ground unconscious and yet something was happening to her body it was being infused with energy and it glowed a most golden yellow like the sun. Linda snapped back to reality after her flashback and looked down at her body and said “Oh my gosh…I’m like totally 16 again…this…this rocks!” She was wearing her Goth garb somehow and it seemed her costume was living too it seemed to mimic her. Whatever “her” had become. 

Her mind was swimming from memories of the past, like somehow she was now 16 and felt as if she was the Linda Lawson from the past and at the same times her self today. She noticed her hands were glowing and that she smelt like lemons. I mean like really powerful lemons. Something else smelt her lemon scent too. And it was growling and coming right for her. It was a lime beast!  It  leapt at Linda and she put her hands out to protect herself and a power bolt of yellow energy came from both her hands and zapped the poor creature 20 feet back and left  him on the ground shaken. She started in disbelief and said “Oh man….how did that happen….Totally Frickin Awesome….I’m a girl with superpowers. Hey furry boy…come over here and play catch” the  beast howled and came charging again. She felt  a burst of energy building up inside of her and she started to glow a lemony yellow and as the creature approached let out a nova of power. It  consumed the beast and he fell to the ground arrested. She somehow instinctively knew how to use these powers but that last attack left her drained and she collapsed again. 


She awoke in the hospital again but this time she was greeted by Danny MacLaren and he smiled and said “Well it looks like the wee lass finally got her wish and has powers like her father.” Linda croaked” Hey how do you know I have powers?” He smiled and said “Oh well I saw what you did…I just happened to be passing by on the tram and saw you fighting out the window of the subway. Quite impressive it was. I might have to say that you even seem stronger in a blaster sense than your father was. Quite impressive indeed! I think we should get The Great Guava to take a look at you and help you train those powers of yours.” Linda Lawson left the hospital and went to see Great Guava and Ms. Mango in Banana Bay. “Well I can’t believe it….Linda Lass…all grown up and with powers no doubt…how did this happen” asked the Great Guava. Linda replied “well I got hit by a bolt of energy at the same time while it went through a tree that I well….was reluctantly applying a serum to by orders of Countess Livingston.” Linda went on to explain to Kevin Cole the events leading up to the battle. 


The Great Guava went blank for a second. “You mean to tell me you got your superpowers thanks to the Livingston’s? Rather sounds like what happened to Fig Fox in an offhand way…he was subjected to experiments there to that’s why he has his speed powers now. But from what you’ve told me that only furthers my belief that she’s up to some strange stuff there and we are looking into it now. I also heard that they have had some battles with the lime earth recently and we think there’s a tie in to why your parents became Lime!” Linda was taken aback by this “Are you serious statesman…the Livingston’s and Lime Earth are connected?” 





Ms. Mango chimed in “Yes dear, the Apple Aggressor and I have been working with Coconutter on finding out why. After all you’re a friend of the family Linda….boy you sure smell like laundry….in fact this whole room smells like lemons because of you lass.” Kevin and Danny both gave a chuckle “Well, now there’s a name….Lemon Lass….ha! It would sure suit a wee lass such as you hahaha” Danny bellowed.  Danny MacLaren had just walked in to greet Linda. The Great Guava agreed “Yeah I like that, it fits you so well…especially considering you don’t appear to be 30 anymore…now its like how I knew you back then…a 4 foot lass…yeah Lemon Lass….harnessing the very essence of lemons.” 

Now Linda thought about it some time and decided to use the moniker Kevin and Danny had so graciously given her. She even realized that somehow her costume had already made itself and it too was alive, somehow infused with the same kinetic energy she also possessed. She now fights alongside of many other heroes and also as a reserve member of The Core Commanders with the goal of stopping Countess Livingston and the Lime Earth until the city is safe again. She does this with the might of the very maiden that saved her father’s life long ago…and keeps the hope that someday she can rescue her parents from the grasp of being devouring earth. And Thus begins the adventures of Linda Lawson aka Lemon Lass!

Origin of Powers
Working for a remote district in Citrus City for Livingston Industries, She was a scientist working on an experimental additive for citrus trees. One day, while working on a lemon tree, a bolt of electricity from an approaching magical storm (or so it appeared), shocked her through the tree and thus through the solution. The Chemical/Energy Mix caused a strange chain reaction in her cells and gave her the power to harness ""lemon energy bursts"" essentially earth based powers that even exude a lemon fresh scent. She now uses her powers against evil in Citrus City

First day finally not lurking. :)

Basic Information About Me:

-Rising junior at Bard College (well-known liberal arts college on the East Coast)
-BA in Political Studies and International Relations, History (Minor)
-BS in Economics and Finance, Business (Minor)
-Cumulative GPA: 3.48

This summer, I'm taking Econ/Finance classes at Northwestern, currently getting As in all three.

I'm in Chicago for the summer and interested in going into Finance after college, but I'm not sure where to start, in terms of looking for a job, or internship.

I've sent out emails to people -- usually writers on the ""Financial Times"" or academics whose writings I've enjoyed -- and talked to my Career Development Office, which has put me in contact with a few helpful alumni.

I'm wondering what the job prospects seem to be for someone with my qualifications, and if anyone has good advice on job / internship hunting. I tried to find one for this summer, but most places I applied -- in NYC, at least -- told me to come back next summer, when I'd be a senior. 

Also, if you're in Finance / Econ and in the Chicago area, I'd love to take you out to coffee and hear about your job! :)

I also have a question on interviews. I had an interview with a financial analysis firm in NYC, and we were casually chatting about Finance, Econ, and school. I told them I was taking Behavioral Economics, and was currently learning about flaws in the EMH.

The interviewer asked me what I thought of the EMH, and trying to be neutral, I said something about how it certainly has its flaws, but is mostly reliable (when I actually think it's crap). The interviewer responded with a laugh and told me, ""If the EMH held, our firm wouldn't exist!""

Long-story short: How honest can I be during interviews, especially in Finance? I find myself to be quite Left most of the time, and know Business / Finance is quite conservative. What's the balance between honesty -- ""being myself"" -- and wanting to impress / get the job? 

Thanks for all your help. I look forward to finally contributing to this community!

Also, I cannot believe this username was not taken. I am so proud."
w78fr,14,2012-07-07,People of r/DIY! Lend me your ideas! I need alternatives to bedroom doors!,Dinos_ftw,DIY,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/w78fr/people_of_rdiy_lend_me_your_ideas_i_need/,"Background Info: Moving into a new apartment with my boyfriend and my best friend. The apartment was designed with two small bedrooms, and a living room (and a hallway, bathroom, and kitchen). The living room and the bigger bedroom have a closet. The three of us decided that my boyfriend and I would take the living room, and my best friend would take the bigger bedroom. However, the living room has no door, just an opening (there was never a door there, so no frame or anything).

My boyfriend and I looking for a way to:
    **a)** keep the airconditioning in the bedroom, not the apartment.
    **b)** minimize the level of sound that enters and exits the bedroom (he's not a very social person, so he'd appreciate not having to hear drunk friends of ours if we have a party, and we're two consenting adults if you get my drift).
    **c)** have some privacy.

We were thinking about setting up some sort of heavy fabric curtain thing... but any ideas or thoughts? I can sew, so that's not a problem... but we're lost on other ideas / what fabric to use.

Oh yeah, and he's switching jobs and I have this amazing internship ... that doesn't pay my anything, so the cheaper the better (and we're both college students).

**TLDR;** No doorframe, need advice on finding a way to enclose a bedroom without breaking the banks.

Thanks in advance!"

And then stopped everything. Life got crazy, I got a little crazy having never had anything to drink prior to my 21st, and I unceremoniously fell off the bandwagon.

I am temporarily moved to Colorado for a summer internship, and after a long process of settling in and waiting for the nearby forest fires to get under control, I picked it up again.

Now, much of Colorado is at high elevation, and my residential area is at 7000 feet. And high elevation makes running harder. I worked my way back up from week 3, doing one day of week 3, one of week 4, and then week 5 day 1. I had to make two attempts to succeed at w5d2, but today it was a much cooler day than normal, I had been well rested, and honestly I was bored out of my mind because my boyfriend was out of town.

In the morning I did an 11.5 minute mile, around noon I successfully did w5d2, and then later I went for one more mile run and shaved 10 seconds off my time.

I feel really proud of myself, and I just really hope that I get a good rest the next few days so I can do w5d3 for the second time on Monday!"

I have a C++ background myself so C# wasn't the strangest territory, but I've never put an overview of an entire language together before.  I'm thinking about presenting the language through its differences to C and Java, but I'm worried I may miss some features I haven't had time to discover yet myself.  I know that these are experienced programmers and theres a lot of material they probably already know (probably better than I do) that can make it into my presentation.  I'm just not sure which ""fat"" to trim.  How would you go about presenting a language to experienced programmers?"

Earlier this year I took my first steps into game development for a game dev contest with a pet simulator called [Mini Morphs](https://www.pokki.com/app/Mini-Morphs) (think tamagotchi, but for the pc with active badge notifications and such such)

I was given the really awesome opportunity to intern at the company that held the contest, and for the past two months, have been working on my game to increase the scope of my game -- ultimately turning a little tech demo into something that was actually, you know, fun (games are supposed to be fun right?)

This community really helped me out during development and onward, giving me pointers, suggestions, bug testing, you name it and the people here didn't even think twice about spending their time on me. For that, I say thank you all.

[Here's a direct link for PC users who want to play my game](http://cdn.pokki.com/download/Pokki_Mini_MorphsSetup.exe)

What I really wanted to talk about though is expanding your game, and knowing when to add to new features and when the strip stuff away. As I said before, I only began coding and such earlier this year and because of this, am very limited in what I am capable of. The problem is that I have so many ideas for my game, I tend to get wrapped up in features that take much longer to develop than initially planned.

**How do others deal with this?** Is there a good sort of method for knowing when to add on that extra month of development in lue of spending the time bug fixing and polishing? Even now I am still incredibly dissatisfied as to the level of quality to my game. 

I remember listening to a speech given by an EA games dev who said that games we play are almost always wood versions, compared to the gold versions we have in our head. Does this ring true with everyone else, and if not, how do you ensure that your game is at a level you are happy with?

I know this ended up being a bit longer than I intended, but these were just some things I've been thinking about over the past few months of development. If it just seems like incoherent ramblings, then I apologize XD

**TL;DR: I built a ""game"", but it took a while to make it fun at all. How do you keep yourself satisfied with your game, and not constantly adding new features and content?**"

Here's what I hate: I'm a terrible engineer.  I'm a great student, but an embarrassment of a person.  I've done no research outside of classes.  I've gotten no internships.  I don't even really like engineering.  I'm in  a place in my life where I'm really trying to figure out who I am and I know I don't deserve to be put on stage as ""the ideal engineer.""

waixy,0,2012-07-09,2 years,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/waixy/2_years/,"I graduated from college just under two years ago, and in that time, I have had 2 actual in person interviews for a positions in my field. One was in a group interview setting to work 80 hour weeks for 36k, not bad, but not great; the other turned out to be for the chance to be the obnoxious person on the street trying to get you to donate to starving children for 10 dollars an hour. Which might be fine for some, but I find utterly reprehensible. I've also been offered two internships/fellowships, one for an unpaid internship in NYC, the other is a 500 dollar a month stipend in Boston. 

So in the meantime, I'm an older than average college graduate, continuing to work bottom feeding jobs, making just enough money to live with other people in their spare rooms while I try to figure out what to do next. 

I currently work full time at a small independent business who can afford to spend nearly a grand on new furniture for the business, which is more than I make in almost a month, even with tips. I am looking for shared housing or apartments, but my income is such, there's almost a negligible difference between whether I live with someone else or on my own.

At this point, i'd almost take a leave/resign this position, if one of my friends back home needed a house sitter or had a free room available, just to work on my writing skills, other practice of skills that may one day...potentially...result in a job that pays more than nothing per hour.


At this point, it's a daily internal battle not to say fuck it, drop everything (not that I own anything besides books, and a computer obviously), and just throw my dogs on my motorcycle and drive across the country and sleep under the stars, I guess. But that's basically because I've put about 60 percent of each paycheck for the last six months into savings, and tried to live like a pauper on my minuscule income; and my options at this point are: sign a lease or rent a room and spend about 50% plus of income on rent and bills, and use remaining savings for buying a new bed, etc. Or just saying fuck it, and finally, truly , not giving a fuck.

**TL;DR** I'd call my life a shit sandwich at times, but bread's probably out of my budget, it's more like a bowl of ramen noodles."

So far, I've read into week 3 (terribly behind unfortunately) and I'm kicking myself for not reading the material before I went on all my job interviews.

3.4 GPA and not much real experience in labs, only from several lab based classes.  

Honestly I don't know what to try to pursue next.  Because after not making it in to pharmacy school I'm at the point were i just want to go find work, but i don't even know where to begin or if that is really much of an option.  Are there Jobs? How do you find them? other school options to try? Internships to gain experience? whats a good route to even attempt."
wafwd,8,2012-07-09,Not exactly a designer; what to change on personal site so that I can get a job? ,morkhabur,design_critiques,https://www.reddit.com/r/design_critiques/comments/wafwd/not_exactly_a_designer_what_to_change_on_personal/,"First time posting here; so following the rules + answering questions!

1. **My work:** Graduated last year with a Masters in HCI; I've been trying to break into the UX field since then. I don't consider myself a designer, per se, but when I talk to other people in the field they say that I am one. *What exactly, do I do?* User research, wireframing, (a few) mockups - then my wireframes get sent off to development and front-end design. Depending on the setting, I sometimes test iterations for usability and other design issues.  

2. **My audience** is anyone that works in UX or tech. The positions are all over the place - developer agencies (use UX to lead the process), design agencies, financial institutions, IT consultancies, and tech companies.

3. The **purpose** of my entire site is to showcase my strengths in research, IA, wireframing - and that I've utilized all those design concepts I've learned and applied elsewhere in internships and even tangentially related jobs I've had on consulting. I also have other experience (social media, cognitive research) that bring the ""diversity"" factor. 

4. **I'm coming to you guys** because I'm not a visual designer by trade, and I need some design eyes to tell me if there's something obvious that I'm doing wrong. I'm not terribly confident in my front-end abilities, but I have fixed designs and made designs work. Also, I've been working on the current version of my website design (it's on top of Wordpress) for SO LONG that now, I find I don't like it at all. 


Here's my [website](http://morgankb.com). 

The message thing on the site works; so you can talk to me if I'm around or leave me a message there if you like (goes to my email); in addition to responses here. 

Thanks!

So, here's the backstory. I'm 16, and over the summer I'm working as an intern with my dad's college friend learning some programming stuff. Now, my dad had warned me that this guy is super Christian, and I was aware of that. He's very nice and very smart, and you wouldn't know it from a conversation with him, but I also fairly recently found out he's also a young-Earth creationist. He wears one of those iamnotashamed.org bracelets from Answers in Genesis, the group behind the Creation Museum. He is *very* religious. For example, when I was in kindergarten, we had to go to Europe for a brief period of time for my dad's work. This was only a couple months after 9/11. He and his wife came over in tears because they thought we would die over there and were concerned because we hadn't been saved (I of course wasn't aware of this, being 5, but I've heard the story). Essentially, as my dad put it, ""Our friendship works just fine when we don't talk about religion.""

So today he asked if I would like to come to lunch with him and a female coworker. I said I would, and I did. Then he told me why. He had to have lunch with the woman for business reasons, discussing some stuff. He told me that as a principle he doesn't have lunch (or do anything) alone with a woman out of honor to his wife. Now, I'm all for respecting your marriage. But does that not seem a little excessive? And it seems to me that just the, I don't know a better way to put this, implication might seem offensive? It's hard to put into words, but am I wrong in thinking that that seems wrong? That he thinks it somehow immoral to be alone with another woman? Please leave your opinion, I want to hear what others think of this.

wacwn,4,2012-07-09,[For Hire] A.A. Film Graduate Looking To Get His Foot In The Door. [Atlanta Area],Bwelchka,forhire,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/wacwn/for_hire_aa_film_graduate_looking_to_get_his_foot/,"I've recently graduated with an associate's of arts degree in film. Clearly, this was supposed to be a stepping stone in my path towards a university, but I was dealt a bad hand. The university that I applied towards denied me in state tuition even though I've lived here for 5 years, and have worked. Their reason? I didn't earn enough money to be considered independent, therefore, I did not pay meaningful taxes. The worst part? I'm 1 year over being considered dependent in the eyes of the University System of Georgia. So I have to file as independent.

This is where you fine ladies and gentlemen of reddit come in. I'm currently working part-time at a retail store, and this will undoubtedly not pay enough to be considered independent. I'm looking for a company that is in the media industry. A company where I can learn on the job, grow, and eventually move up in position when I finish my degree.

What kind of position am I seeking? Almost anything. If you need office support, I can give office support. If you need a hand at production, I can do that as well. Personal Assistant? Would you like cream with your coffee?

What I don't have is a reel. Yes, I know this surprises you. Why don't I have a reel? Well, I've been working and I've been busy with school. I also don't have editing skills. This is embarrassing, but when you've been busy with juggling school and work you don't have any time to do these kinds of important things. My college didn't prepare me for production as this degree is used to transfer into a university.

I do have a resume, and if you want to see it just toss me a PM. I've sent out over 75 resumes through mail and email. I've only gotten back a few responses, but they never went anywhere. I get that most companies are looking to hire very skilled employees that know how to edit using every piece of software imaginable, and has experience with RED cameras, but I'm looking for a type of internship that I can grow into.

If your company is looking for a motivated, quick learner with an enthusiastic attitude then I'm your man. Film is my passion, and I want to keep it that way. 

And get the hell out of retail."
waa4v,3,2012-07-09,My girlfriend [19/f] and I [18/m] have been in a relationship for 3 years and potentially have 3 more in a longish-distance relationship to look forward to before careers move us apart. What do we do?,utanapishtim,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/waa4v/my_girlfriend_19f_and_i_18m_have_been_in_a/,"My girlfriend (19) and I (18) are 3 and a half years into our relationship. We are both going to separate colleges, about 2 hours apart, and are just entering our sophomore year. Last year we saw each other about every other week. We originally chose to go to separate schools to avoid compromising the rest of our lives for each other, because we are both very competative in our respective fields. Despite the fact that we won't be able to spend many summers together and we are both studying abroad for a semester (at the same time), we seem to be sticking it out so far. The big problem is that out relationship has been so beneficial. She convinces me to do things that are good for my career, and I push her to do things that are good for hers. For example she convinced my to accept a research position that may be enough to give me my pick of grad schools and because I am in an internship across the country this summer, she took up volunteering in our home town. Even with this, we still support and love one another this summer- dealing with distance hasn't been much of an issue so far.


The problem arises because we are both so serious about our work (which ironically is why we love each other). She will very likely get into our in-state med school and attend because it is one of the best med schools and very cheap for in-state students. I will very likely get into the very top grad schools on the East and West Coasts, as well as the in-state school that is a tier behind. It doesn't look like either of us will compromise our potential for a romance and attend anything but the best school we get into, so after undergrad our time living in the same state is up. Even after that she will want to go back to our home town to work, where I may not be able to find a good job.


So Reddit, I ask you this: what in the world should we do?

wa81o,3,2012-07-09,Best Credit Union(s) in MD-DC area?,chulk90,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/wa81o/best_credit_unions_in_mddc_area/,"First off, I owe you gratitude because I've learned so much from reading your advice and Q&amp;As threads. My family's been a customer of Bank of America for decades; naturally, my mom opened an account for me when I enrolled in college. I think it makes monetary transfer between her account and my account more easily.

However, I've taken your advice and would like to switch to a Credit Union. I'm currently looking at credit unions through [Credit Unions Online](http://www.creditunionsonline.com/credit-union-locator.html). My zip code is 20742. **However,** Washington, D.C. is only 7 minutes away, so any CU with a branch in D.C. would work for me, too.

My best bet so far is Northrop Grumman Federal Credit Union (I used to intern at Northrop Grumman), which offers [1.5% cash back and ""surcharge-free currency conversions"" when using their MasterCard credit cards](https://www.ngfcu.us/loans/mastercard.aspx), as well as 0.25% APY on regular savings.

My current employment is with GE Capital and GE has a credit union, too. But this one offers... pretty *shitty* rates. And it doesn't have any ATMs or branches in MD or DC.

Another CU I'm looking at is PenFed, but looking at rates, I think this one's become not as good recently. Its branches are quite conveniently located, however.

To give some background, I'm currently a college undergraduate, and my deposit fluctuates between $18k and $3k (I earn about $8k from summer internship and $10k from [scholarships - tuition]; I pay ~9.2k for on-campus housing rent and spend about $500 every month).

wa6lf,0,2012-07-09,Ever have a fellow intern act like he is your boss?,[deleted],work,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/wa6lf/ever_have_a_fellow_intern_act_like_he_is_your_boss/,"So I think this may be a cultural thing since the other intern on my project is Indian, but whenever I ask the boss a question during our meetings (we are a tiny team of 3), the intern will look at me and nod along with the boss as the boss answers my question. Then he will repeat what he said to me, with his arms folded, like he is explaining it to me as if I'm too stupid to understand. I am trying to a) have a dialogue about our project, and b) ask the boss for his perspective. This intern's attitude is like, ""oh yeah that? I know that."" even though we don't even have the same duties or skills at work (we do totally different stuff) so he shouldn't even be concerned with the content of my questions as I am the one who has to work on the stuff, not him. 

Anyway I wanted to say, ""hey hang on here, I wasn't asking you. I was asking him [our boss]"". But that would be an explicit confrontation and would make me look bad. This guy hasn't been in the US too long so maybe that's it, but it really ticks me off. He's the same level of the heirarchy as me, and if anything I've been on the project longer and I'm older and more educated but I don't hold that over him, so at the very least he should act like a fellow intern.

What is a civil or effective response? I want to avoid long drawn out discussions with him on the topic because that would make everything awkward and he likely would still not understand; that is probably why he is doing it because he is unaware of how arrogant it seems. He just doesn't get that asking questions is a sign of engagement, and I'm just being humble, but that doesn't mean I don't know what I'm doing. I imagine he is acting like a know-it-all in the hopes of impressing our boss I guess. "

after my 1L year (i am attending a T-30 school in NYC) - i still want to work in public interest and do the kind of work that I did before, as a lawyer.  I am also part of the school's public interest program.  however, as fall approaches, i can't help but wonder if i should do what everyone else is doing and participate in OCI/Early interview week.  I talked to upperclassmen in the public interest program, and all of them are saying that it'd make sense for me to go through OCI just to see what happens - and they all recommend that i go to a firm for my 2L summer and after graduation for the money and experience at a firm.

what should i do? Right now, i am leaning toward focusing my energy and time on researching about fellowships after graduation and finding P.I. internships - since I still want to experience working at other PI organizations before i graduate.

I was the only IT in the company. We have six locations, and will soon have eight. I attempted to make the case a few times, that we needed another full-time IT person to help with the day-to-day user issues, if they want me to keep working on all these projects for all the departments.

The CEO decided to hire his friend's son for the position of IT intern. He went to college for some business degree, has no computer experience outside Facebook and a technology class he took in college, and is only really interested in the job because he had a hard time getting a job after his college baseball career tanked. He has been with us for a few months now. I've given him some simple maintenance tasks (taking care of medical thin client carts mostly), but mostly, he's been kind of my ""remote arm"" for taking care of things at other sites. He does things I can't do remotely, under my instruction, so we can cover more ground faster.

The CEO wants him trained up to be full-time, now that they've finally realized we need a second IT, and the status of his internship has come into question. They've sent me skills checklists from other departments, such as secretarial, to use as a template for his training. What I'm really wondering here is, can IT skills be taught with a checklist? It's not like it's a field where we have very specific, routine duties (outside bi-monthly desktop maintenance, or server maintenance that I definitely would not trust a padawan with). We fix things as they break, have several dozen applications that have all kinds of problems that are interrelated to other applications or operating systems. PC, networking, and computer troubleshooting all require a soft skill that I can't just teach with a checklist.

Because of the nepotism that goes on around here (in all departments), I don't see them letting the intern go. Have any of you had to train a layman from the ground up? I mean, the guy needed my help installing Adobe Reader."

We dated for 4 years and had a mutual split when he moved to a different continent for the next few years for graduate school. He plans on moving back to the same city after. We tried no contact for a few months, broke it, and immediately went back to no contact. There are just some thoughts. Its a wall of text without a tl;dr but I would greatly appreciate any thoughts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I don't know why I always feel compelled to write you letters detailing how I feel. I just felt that our last interaction ended with the usual dysfunction: we connect because we miss each other - We hear each others voice, and reality sets in - we get unsure(I get upset) over trivial issues- We disconnect. Sometimes I think the pain-to-happiness ratio calls into serious question whether the whole endeavour is worth it. I mean when it comes down to it, we don't owe each other anything. We're both single--and we live on different continents. I don't want to repeat this cycle until it becomes meaningless for one of us. But, that being said, here I am. 


I feel like I'm just going through the motions. The thing is I don’t even really know that I’m going through the motions until I hear your voice and it wakes me up. Only when I feel alive do I realize I had spent the past few months sleepwalking: I go to work, I go to the gym, and I meet people that I soon forget.  Along with this wakeup comes a myriad of emotions that I much prefer keep buried under the surface comfortably coated in denial. This is why it hurts to talk to you—I don't think I had the vocabulary to explain this concept properly when we spoke, and I wanted to explain myself fully.
Here lies the alternate scenario (that I am terrified of). When we had started dating and (I think?) started falling in love, your ex came home for the weekend, I remember you went out of your way to reconnect with her, and I brought it up saying I thought it was weird and inappropriate that you kept in touch with her. Now, I realize what I was feeling was that being that girl (or being part of that friendship) is a sad prospect. I don't want to be part of a couple clinging on to the past (even if it is with the best intentions) when one of the people has moved on.


Another thing I replay in my mind is the position in life our words come from. Although the syllables and sentences that come out of someone's mouth are important, equally as important are the actions and context that both guide them and define them. Let me elaborate. It isn’t difficult to tell someone you miss them and can't stop thinking about them when you are living on the other side of the world. Rejection would be at worst over the telephone; and a safety net of friends, amazing experiences, and parties with millions of prospects would be there to soften the blow. I'm not, however, trying to cheapen what we say. I just want to explain why I stay silent on those topics for the most part. It is because I don't feel like I can say those things and that you would actually believe that they mean anything. Does, “I still think about you all the time” really mean anything in this context? It is our actions that define us, not our words. How does saying “I miss you” and I “want to be with you” mean anything when neither of us are willing to commit or take any real risks. I could have found an opportunity in Europe for the summer just as easily as you could have returned home for a four-month internship. Instead we play this game of cat-and-mouse and the underlying message of our actions is ""you are not important enough for me to take any real risk"" but until something better comes along I will tell you I miss you. A big part of our sadness comes from our stubbornness and the unwillingness to potentially get hurt. 


Maybe I sound crazy, maybe I am thinking about this too much. But what we have is very important for me and I think for the first time in my life, I don't know how to act. I have a internal moral benchmark (that I cannot shake off) that dictates my thoughts and interactions when I'm dealing with a break up. I’m breaking all my rules and its freaking me out. I'm not afraid of being vulnerable but I'm afraid of being stupid. As I reread this email for the millionth time, I realize how negative it sounds and that’s not what I hope you take from this. It’s just when the same miscommunication happens again and again and maybe it is worthwhile to take the time to understand what the underlying feelings are—so that maybe we can fix it? Or at least you have a better understanding of why I am distant when I want nothing more than to tell you I love you.

With a stroke of fate, the printer could not work there anymore, so I was offered the position. I took it, and have been making shirts ever since. 

Other than this, I have no experience with textiles. I have figured out most of the stuff along the way, but I have a few questions!

**How do you keep ink off of everything?!**

Fucking plastisol. When I arrived nothing was clean. All of the ink containers had multi color goo on them and I have never tried to get all of it. I end up using gloves to mix and handle ink. I am covered in it as I leave. How do you keep everything nice and not greasy? 

**What kind of tape do you use?**

I have this shitty tape that splits in half when pulled away from screen. Usually I spray it off with the emulsion remover. Any suggestions? 

**Do you have a decent bar light exposure unit?**

If so, I am curious if you have problems with detail. We have a horrible DIY one with black light bars. Sometimes screens will just not expose in certain areas, or detail will not be picked up. With the new equipment for the next shop, we have a nice (still bar'd0 exposure unit. How does it do?!

w9uup,7,2012-07-09,For all those who made tough post-graduation choices on doing something risky or taking the safer route please help! Should I stay in South America or head back home?,itsturtletimebitches,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/w9uup/for_all_those_who_made_tough_postgraduation/,"Posted on AskReddit and got no love haha. Long post, sorry in advance. 22 years old, from the beautiful state of Colorado. I left the state to attend a top university on the east coast. I studied international business and Spanish. After my junior year, I got an internship back home. Worked through the summer, liked it decently, did well and was offered a job. Unfortunately they required an answer by November, and through parents and others’ advice I took the job offer, thinking that if I wanted to I could find something later. In this economy, it’s hard to turn a job down. Start date is mid-August. After graduating this past May, I decided to do an internship program in Chile working as a financial research analyst in an investment bank. Reason was I wanted to travel, I wanted to improve my Spanish fluency and I wanted to try a finance position. Been here for about a month and it’s been an amazing experience; I really like my job and the culture. The problem is that in August I have to make the decision to either return home or stay and continue working at the bank, where I know that I will have a position. At this point I literally cannot make up my mind. I’ll give a rundown of the pros and cons of both.

Pros of staying in Chile: * Spanish minor in university, the best way to become fluent in the language is through immersion * It’s a great opportunity at the bank to learn a lot and gain experience * I love the city/people, met a girl who I just started seeing who seems to be really cool and I’m into her, she’s helping teach me Spanish and it would kind of suck to cut it short

Cons of staying in Chile: *The city is expensive as fuck and my projected salary would not be close to what I would earn in my job at the states *Sick of living off my parents dollar and want some independence; not sure if I can live completely separate from the parents w/ staying down here *I would have to go through the awkward process of declining my job offer a few weeks before I start, the company having thought that I would be working there for months now

Pros of coming back home: *Colorado is an awesome place to live, and its hard being away from family and friends and certain aspects of the States (music, food, great weather, Chipotle! ect.) *Good paying job at a good company, could save/make a lot more money there 

Cons of coming home: *My job isn’t something I see myself doing for a career, don’t see much upward mobility *A big corporation, and not sure that type of thing is for me to climb the corporate ladder *Not sure if I would get a realistic chance to come back if I leave, I’ve got no responsibilities now

This is just a quick overview of the different aspects of the decision I am struggling with. I know that I am extremely fortunate and blessed to even be in this situation. My grandparents paid for my education and I am almost completely debt free. At the same time, I am a very motivated and dedicated person, and I am trying to not take these opportunities for granted. Please any opinions are appreciated. Both options for me seem like good choices and just need some help clearing my head. Thanks to all.

w9t3t,1,2012-07-09,"I'm a 20-year-old College Sophomore with dreams of becoming a consultant after graduation. What can I do this summer to put myself ahead of my peers, and increase my odds of career success? (x-post from AskReddit)",Pure_Ambition,business,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/w9t3t/im_a_20yearold_college_sophomore_with_dreams_of/,"Some info to help you out: 

Like I said in the title, I'm 20 years old. I just got accepted for transfer admission for the University of Texas at Austin's Business School - one of the biggest (and most trying) accomplishments of my life so far. Currently, I'm interning in the maintenance department of a Chemical plant. After graduation, I'd like to work as a Consultant with a company like Bain or McKinsey for a few years before (ideally) attending a school like Harvard for an MBA. After that, I'd like to continue consulting or pursuing other career opportunities until a point where I've saved up enough money to start my own business and increase my personal wealth. 

I've been very involved in leadership so far in college, becoming President of the Business Council at my first-year school, as well as being the co-chair of another organization and member of their Honors College, etc. My GPA was exceptional last year, but it resets now that I'll be attending a new school. 

Other than my experiences, I have no real marketable skills that would help me to become a consultant. I've looked into and thought about becoming proficient in the Microsoft Office suite and perhaps Photoshop, but don't know where to start in obtaining any kind of certifications. I'm also planning on introducing myself to the President of UT as well as the Dean of the Business School towards the beginning of next semester. 

I know there are more things I could do this summer and over the next few years to get a head start on my career goals, but I can't think of many - besides the obvious ""get good grades, get involved, and get internships."" I'm hoping the Reddit community can help me (and perhaps help others who may read this post). What do you think? 

**tl;dr** - See title. "
w9s9l,1,2012-07-09,"I (23M) like a girl (22F) who just became single, but I don't know how to go about it due to a couple snags.",feignedapathy,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/w9s9l/i_23m_like_a_girl_22f_who_just_became_single_but/,"I really don't know what to do for the title of this. It's a rather sticky situation.

Me: M23; Her: F22 (First off, I really hope this girl isn't on Reddit and doesn't see this post. She seems like she might be the type to be on here).

I met this girl last summer, thought she was awesome, but she had a boyfriend. Basically pulled a Mosby on her by telling her I loved her that night after she told me she dressed up as Link for Halloween, which I think is reasonable.

I found out her boyfriend didn't go out much and he didn't like to party. He played D&amp;D a lot and spent that night in leveling up his character. I play D&amp;D too, but ignoring your girlfriend for it? Too far... I knew this was doomed to end at some point, and even if not, she was cool enough to hang out with as friends.

We hung out occasionally. She had 21 credit hours at school that semester and didn't have much free time. But we still hung out. Comedy club, darts, mostly bar stuff. And every time we hung out, I would ask her where her boyfriend was. He was always doing something not with her, so she and I just spent the time together. Which was pretty cool.

Then they broke up in February. I don't know why. I tried to continue hanging out with her (for obvious reasons) but found out that despite her only having 19 credits this semester, school was kicking her ass much more than she expected. I kept trying. Special events came up, there were cookouts, parties, all that fun stuff. But she was never available. And then in April or May, she got a boyfriend. I lost all hope.

Now, she doesn't have a boyfriend. I don't think it ended well due to the immediate removal of all pictures of him and her together and one of the Facebook statuses she posted. And today she posted a status saying ""Boyfriend auditions starting soon. Well-qualified candidates only, please. :P"" Sure, it's a joke, but it kinda puts in my mind that she doesn't already have a guy on the line like before.

And here's the pickle... I'm trying to get a job with the police, but the city I'm trying to work with is five hours away. I would be leaving in December or January if I'm accepted to the academy. I see her as the type who would be cool with long-distance dating, but I fear that if it came to it, she wouldn't be willing to move to my part of the state. And if I have a career there, I'm definitely not leaving it.

I really like her and I'd really like to try dating her, but I don't know if it would be fair to her (or either of us, really). I don't know what to do or how to respond to this status or anything. She's out of state right now for an internship so I have a little time to figure things out... but I suck at this stuff. I always either come on too strong or I just friendzone myself.

If you can't offer advice, at least this can be my sounding board. Because honestly, I don't know exactly what I'm asking for either. Any good-intentioned advice would be extremely welcome.

**TL;DR:** Met a girl with a boyfriend, thought she was awesome, she broke up with said boyfriend, tried hanging out with her, got a boyfriend again, which didn't last long, and now she's single again. I still want to date her but I may be leaving for a career in the next six months. Boy this TLDR makes this all sound retarded."

What do I do?",questionedaccount,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/w9rqv/fresh_out_of_college_and_totally_worthless_what/,"This question came into my mind when I saw the “Colbert on Colleges” post. (http://i.imgur.com/Ka9Pr.png) .  I realized that I am not the only individual who is experiencing this problem.  Some backstory, if you please.

I graduated six months ago with a degree in English Education for High School.  I did well in my courses and my student teaching process went well. I enjoyed working with the students to a degree. However, since graduating and completing my internship I realized one terrible error to my entire college experience… I don’t think I like or want to teach. 

I like working with people and I love taking leadership roles.  I was in marching band my entire student life (high school, college).  To those of you who don’t know, marching band allows students to step up and take leadership roles with their various sections. I interviewed for those roles and I achieved them and succeeded at them. I truly enjoyed my time working with people and an organization.

Everything in my resume says I should be great for teaching. I am resistant towards it and frankly, there are no teaching positions available to me in my area. I look every week and I get more and more depressed when even the janitorial positions start disappearing.  

Now, with a degree behind me and no teaching jobs ahead of me- I am at a crossroads. I’ve dabbled with the idea of going back to school, getting my masters, and looking for a different job.

My question is… What would you do?  What should I do?  If I go back to school, how ill that benefit me other than putting me in more debt?  How do I go about finding another job with my skill sets?  I’ve navigated Monster.com with absolute failure. I have no idea what I am qualified for or not… I’d like to try my hand and writing, but where does that lead me?

What would you say to us college graduates who are sitting around going, “Well, fuck…. What can I do now?”

Sorry if this is confusing, ranting, raving, bitching, moaning or whatever you perceive. I just saw what a vast expanse of knowledge Reddit has to offer and I figured I’d pick your brains for help.

Thanks!

Tl;dr: You got me, I am long winded. I graduated college for teaching. No jobs available. Do I go back to school? How do I find other jobs? What should I do?

Edit: As someone mentioned, I think I am at the point where I want to re-evaluate myself.  What else do I want to do and how do I do that?"

How do you handle people like this?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/w9pro/i_have_a_brother_who_lives_and_argues_like_bill/,"I've tried absolutely everything. Fighting back, ignoring it, staying calm and trying to rationalize, literally nothing works.

He lies, steals, exaggerates and picks a fight about absolutely everything. He plays the victim in nearly every situation and can't go a single day without bringing up how unfair everything is because he was in the army and how dare we treat him like shit? He blatantly lies during arguments, stretches facts and covers it up by just screaming at you after he asks (screams at) you to explain yourself. 

The minute you try to talk back, you get told to shut the fuck up and that you're wrong. He uses middle school playground tactics and even goes as far as teasing like an 8 year old might. He's a huge hypocrite and, somehow, REFUSES TO SEE ANY OF THIS. He says straight up ""I'm right, you're wrong, I don't care what you say"".

He's in his mid twenties and lives at home, hasn't had a job since he left the army (3 years ago) and is above getting one (""I'm not working at a fucking McDonalds, I was in the army."" [while simultaneously bashing people like Wall Street protesters for being too proud to get a job at McDonalds, supposedly]), hasn't EVER held a job for more than a month, refuses to get one because he gets unemployment money (which he spends on drugs and expensive shit he doesn't use, all the while never paying our parents back for money he's stolen over the years) and is ""above"" minimum wage, sits in his room all day playing video games and watching movies with the door shut and screams at everyone else for all the shit ""they're doing wrong"".

I work a 40 hr/wk unpaid internship right now and go to school full time, I'm highly involved at a million things at school, I have a lot of interests and I'm really active throughout my day every day. He still finds any way he can to tear me down and call me worthless, and that anything I do doesn't really matter because he was in the army and I wasn't. We could be arguing about whether peanut butter or jelly goes on a sandwich first, and it would inevitably end with ""YOU WOULDN'T KNOW BECAUSE YOU'VE NEVER STOOD UP FOR ANYTHING IN YOUR LIFE, I DEFENDED MY COUNTRY AND THIS IS WHAT I GET?!"" Then, he'll take to Facebook and twist, mangle and completely fabricate anything I said and put it up in a status in hopes of garnering sympathy from his army buddies.

It kills me because our parents did everything for us. They passed us off in hallways when we were younger while they worked opposite shifts, but still tried to give us absolutely everything in their power. My father is one of the most incredible, giving and selfless people I know, and all my brother can do is fake having daddy issues and start monstrous fights with him while making him feel worthless. My father will never say anything back and is absolutely miserable lately. Neither of my parents deserve this.

I know everyone knows someone like this, but this is to an absolute extreme. He's tearing the family apart. He has gotten into physical altercations with both parents and been told to move out, but somehow everything is slowly forgotten about and I seem to be the only one who remembers and stays angry (which he then flips out about).

I'm not looking for sympathy, I really genuinely want to know how you deal with people like this. Nothing works and I'm going insane with frustration. I feel like I see WHY he's acting the way he is and that it's incredibly predictable, but nobody else seems to want to do anything about it. I feel alone on this.

TL;DR: My brother is a selfish, arrogant, lying, hypocritical waste of space who is ripping my family apart and it feels like there's nothing to be done. At the end of my rope. Those with experience, please help.

Edit: I know the obvious answer would be ""Don't talk to him"", but as I mentioned above, I have already tried that and all it does is send him into a rage where he'll stand outside/pound on my door screaming condescending things about me until I come out."

Like I said in the title, I'm 20 years old. I just got accepted for transfer admission for the University of Texas at Austin's Business School - one of the biggest (and most trying) accomplishments of my life so far. Currently, I'm interning in the maintenance department of a Chemical plant. After graduation, I'd like to work as a Consultant with a company like Bain or McKinsey for a few years before (ideally) attending a school like Harvard for an MBA. After that, I'd like to continue consulting or pursuing other career opportunities until a point where I've saved up enough money to start my own business and increase my personal wealth. 

I've been very involved in leadership so far in college, becoming President of the Business Council at my first-year school, as well as being the co-chair of another organization and member of their Honors College, etc. My GPA was exceptional last year, but it resets now that I'll be attending a new school. 

Other than my experiences, I have no real marketable skills that would help me to become a consultant. I've looked into and thought about becoming proficient in the Microsoft Office suite and perhaps Photoshop, but don't know where to start in obtaining any kind of certifications. I'm also planning on introducing myself to the President of UT as well as the Dean of the Business School towards the beginning of next semester. 

I know there are more things I could do this summer and over the next few years to get a head start on my career goals, but I can't think of many - besides the obvious ""get good grades, get involved, and get internships."" I'm hoping the Reddit community can help me (and perhaps help others who may read this post). What do you think? 

**tl;dr** - I want to become a management consultant and I'm wondering what steps I can take now to make that happen. "

At this point, it doesn't matter to me if the total bill was 40k or 20000000k or how much the insurance covered. Those guys play their games professionally. What matters to me is what I am paying in the end. Right now I make enough to cover rent. My internship ends in a month and then I will be unemployed. I simply cannot afford the payment. What should my next steps be? Should I contact the hospital (Sutter) and explain my situation? I also got a bill from an anesthesiologist, which seems to be just a small clinic. Not sure they are going to have any financial assistance programs, so I think I am going to have to shell out their money regardless.

FYI: this is for people whos PiF ratios are positive. it can be 1:0, 20:1 10:9, i dont care, just positive. Anyone who enters who isn't positive: i  will ignore.

I recently got this game from someone at the place where i intern at, she sent it my way because it was on sale, and i had been workin' hard. So far i have gotten a little into it, and i really love it a lot. It is a great game, and so here it is again for someone else to experience. 

[LA Noir](http://store.steampowered.com/app/110800/) is very GTA-esque, as it should be since it is made by Rockstar. But the feel of things is much different. It is set in the 1940's, and you are a detective, like heavy rain. 

&gt;Amid the post-war boom of Hollywood's Golden Age, Cole Phelps is an LAPD detective thrown headfirst into a city drowning in its own success. Corruption is rampant, the drug trade is exploding, and murder rates are at an all-time high. In his fight to climb the ranks and do what's right, Phelps must unravel the truth behind a string of arson attacks, racketeering conspiracies and brutal murders, battling the L.A. underworld and even members of his own department to uncover a secret that could shake the city to its rotten core.

&gt;Using groundbreaking new animation technology that captures every nuance of an actor's facial performance in astonishing detail, L.A. Noire is a violent crime thriller that blends breathtaking action with true detective work to deliver an unprecedented interactive experience. Search for clues, chase down suspects and interrogate witnesses as you struggle to find the truth in a city where everyone has something to hide.

To enter, comment here with a number between 0-649 (yes 0 is pick-able) 

Numbers that are NOT IT: 420, 69, 42

One extra chance at entering though. For the chance at picking 2 numbers: Tell me a good (Non superhero) comic book to read. Just finished The walking dead, and want more to read on my tablet, but am not into the superhero scene. I don't mind odd things like monsters and magic, and shit, just not superman/spiderman/the like.

For every non entry that recommends a comic to me, i will cancel out a number from the list. 

If you post 2 numbers and don't offer up a comic, i will go with your first number. 

If you post a number that has already been submitted before you, or is on the NUMBERS THAT ARE NOT IT list, i will just ignore your post, normally i try and remind people, but come on guys, you can do it yourself.

We were only seeing each other once or twice a week, due to her extremely busy schedule, but we communicated via text almost every day in between. 

Everything was going great, until a week and a half ago. We were poised to meetup after she got out of class one night, when she texted me that she likely wouldn't be able to meet up because of the amount of work she still had to get done. This happened somewhat often, but I said okay as always, as I understand what it's like to try and juggle work, class, and a internship as she was doing. 

I messaged her back, saying okay, but asking her to let me know when she was availble next. She never responded. This was a Wednesday night, and I knew she had some big plans over the weekend with a volunteer project she was wrapping up. It was the last week of her commitment there, and we expected to have much more free time after that weekend was over, as we'd often talked about it.

I waited a few days, until that Sunday, before deciding to try contacting her another way than via text, and I tried messaging her on Facebook. The next day, I received a message back on Facebook, from my girlfriend's account, which basically said:

""This is her friend, she asked me to let you know she had a relapse and was in the hospital. She's okay and at home now with her family, but doesn't have access to her phone. I assume she'll contact you when she can. If you have any questions, feel free to text me at xxx-xxx-xxxx""

Now, a few weeks prior, she'd mentioned that she has battled depression in the past, and had even attempted to commit suicide once or twice before, the last time being about a year or two ago (I don't remember the exact time-frame she said, as we'd been drinking at the time she told me).

So I texted her friend, asking what had happened, and a few hours later her friend responded saying that she (my girlfriend) had been cutting and purging again. She insisted that my girlfriend was okay, which was my main concern at the time, but that she didn't know anything else other than what she had told me.

I texted my girlfriend again, leaving a message saying I knew she wouldn't see it right away, but that I was there if she wanted to talk, and not to worry about being out of touch with me, as I knew the situation now. 

The last time I'd seen her in-person was a week before that Wednesday she'd canceled on me, and at that time, there were no marks of any kind on her body. I know she'd attended the event over the weekend, as pictures were posted on Facebook by her friends who were there, so I'm assuming this all came to light that Sunday. 


Basically, since then I've been stuck here twiddling my thumbs, wondering what's going on, if/when she'll be back, etc. Honestly, I don't even know if she'll still want to continue our relationship or would rather focus on herself, which I'd completely understand; It's just killing me being completely in the dark, and I'm feeling quite frustrated by it.

Really, any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Because of my parents relationship (its rocky at the moment) my mom is afraid to co-sign a loan because if they get divorced she'll probably have to sell the house and get a new one and she'll need another mortgage and she doesn't want the loan to show up as debt. My grandmother just got out a bankruptcy so she can't co-sign. I have no credit history so I can't sign my own loan... probably should have put that first. I have 6,500 saved up but obviously not the 10k i'll need for this first year alone. What are my choices? Should i just not go to school and beg for the job back?

I'm living at home and hoping to graduate in May with my masters and start looking for a job in my new career. 

Problem is...my finance' is not ready for any of that. He's had a pretty bad streak of unemployment, and probably hasn't worked in 3 years now. He's always had random jobs with friends, but has since lost his friends and lost his connections. He hasn't been able to find a decent job since he has been unemployed for so long, and lacks experience. He graduated with a degree in History and Communications, but decided he didn't want to teach anymore. 

The thing is...once I finish graduate school...I'll be ready to move on in terms of starting to save money, get my own place, get married, have kids, etc. Any time I mention to him my concerns with him not finding a job or working, he gets very defensive. 
He has a lot of anxiety, which contributes negatively to his daily life at times, so I'm sure this is a factor in not finding a job either. He says he's applying for jobs, but I'm always seeing him watch tv, etc. 

I tried helping him along for awhile, by sending out cover letters, his resume, etc. No calls. At this point, I'm not sure he feels very hopeful for himself. 

On the plus side, he's the most supportive person I've ever met, who knows me as well if not better than I know myself. He would walk to the end of the world and back for me, and he's my rock after all these years and after all we've been through. I tried giving him an ultimatum, but he keeps reassuring me not to worry and that he'll find something. 

So, what do I do? I can't imagine spending my life with anyone else at this point, but I don't know how much longer I can wait. I have a lot of resentment built up. I feel like I know the answer for myself already, but am either holding out to see if things change, or just looking for some extra guidance. Thank you guys...

TL;DR Fiance' hasn't worked in 3 years and has a pretty unstable enployment history. We're great together, but I want more. Now what?"

What I was hoping you all could help me out with is I am looking for any number of things which will help me navigate a community which I am entirely unfamiliar. To give you a little background, I went to school in Chicago studying Architecture and the Ideal position would be to work for an Architect who does aesthetically focused sustainable design. I am 24 and I have very little experience so even if it means getting coffee for people just so I can be around the office and absorb what they do I am willing to do it. With that said, I am willing to pursue and possible lead which can get me in contact with someone who would be interested in my services. So what I am asking from my fellow redditors is if you can answer any number of these questions I will be enourmously thankful and probably buy your a beer or two when I get there.

Do you know anyone that works in the field of architecture and would you be willing to send me their contact information?

Do you know of any architects or architecture firms who practice sustainable design where I can look for contacts?

Are there any arts districts, or places with high concentrations of galleries where I can begin to look for people who have connections in the design community?

Can you give me any intern seeking websites, or message boards where I can find contacts?

Do you have any general advice in locating the right people Cape town?


Helping my out would allow me a lot of a relief because I am feeling particularly helpless in the matter right now

I've been toying around with the idea of weaning my self off the two dead-end jobs I hold down and take the plunge. I've read the right books for this sort of thing, and I've been holding off on a major commitment (hours of labor, a real website, mailers, etc...) because I'm afraid the market for budding illustrators is god-aweful, and I'd be wasting my time. 
Specs on me:
My background is pretty diverse. I was a full time community college student (five years riding off of one scholarship to another) trying to figure out the path to take. I was a journalism major for a year, creative writing, then an art major, film and now animation. I kind of love everything way too much to single out one thing. I had an internship with Bent image lab which taught me a lot about pragmatic business practices. I failed to get hired on, which was kind of a giant speedbump for me. The hiccups kept coming and I couldnt secure any media job so I had to beg for my old job back. In the mean time I am currently writing and drawing a graphic novel. I'm trying to finish it before I start CALARTS in a year, where I plan to turn it into a pixar style inspired dark comedy animated feature....if I don't screw it up to bad. (fingers crossed) and sorry for writing the whole life story bit.

I decided to take a stab at illustration because it seems the easiest and most pleasurable thing for me to do, if I had to pick one thing. It's also really hard to do long hours. It feels....idk, almost like what I imagine house arrest feels like.

wcm6o,1,2012-07-10,"Reddit, what are your most memorable internship stories? ",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/wcm6o/reddit_what_are_your_most_memorable_internship/,"I'll start. For a few months, I had landed an internship in a German company amongst their finance department. One day, one of the higher-level employees (who was on maternity leave) had to come back to the office due to her presence being absolutely mandatory at a meeting. On account of this urgency, she had brought her 5-month old son along and assigned me the responsibility of taking care of him while she was busy, and gave me strict instructions to not disrupt the working environment. Now as an intern, I am inherently expected to agree to any demand, no matter how ridiculous it is. I quickly agreed. 

Little did I know, this was the beginning of an entire shitshow (spoiler alert: *literally.*) The baby, disturbed by his mother's absence, started crying profusely. I had temporarily habituated ourselves in the quiet copy room to avoid disturbance, and did everything in my power to stop his crying. I tried performing hole-puncher &amp; stapler theater by gluing paper eyes on the two office supplies and pressing them repeatedly. Even went so far as to confuse the copier so it would make silly noises. For future reference: babies are terrified of loud noises. Obviously this increased his crying tenfold. 

By now, the other employees were starting to get irked by the constant crying so I took the baby and dashed to the safest spot I know: bathroom. And that was when I smelled it. Kiddo had executed a dangerous performance of number 2. And being someone who is absolutely poop-phobic, cleaning up his mess was horrendous. On top of that, he manages to shoot pee on my hair. (In hindsight, quite an impressive trajectory for a kid his age.) 

On the bright side, cleaning him up did the trick. He happily played with me for the next hour (and to my surprise, thoroughly enjoyed my rendition of office-suppies theatre.) I never really garnered much financial experience that day, but it taught me a thing or to on how to be a mother.


TL;DR I was asked to babysit an employee's 5-month old son who ended up inconsolably crying until I fixed his diaper mess"

wckk2,1,2012-07-10,"A letter from a customer to Express Clothing in Tysons Square (DC) , detailing a shameful and disgusting Racial Profiling experience. ",[deleted],racism,https://www.reddit.com/r/racism/comments/wckk2/a_letter_from_a_customer_to_express_clothing_in/,"To Whom It May Concern:


On June 23rd I was visiting Tyson Corners Mall located in Tyson Corner Virginia. It was my birthday weekend and I was very excited to go shopping in the mall that I had not visited in over 10 years. I own clothing boutique in Richmond Virginia and it is very hard to get off of work so I was looking forward to my little vacation. I was staying at the Hilton Hotel and I rode the hotel shuttle to the mall. I arrived there at around 7pm. I made purchases at MAC makeup, Forever 21, H&amp;M, Bebe and a few other stores before I came to Express between 8:45 pm and 9:15 pm. I was told prior to my shopping visit that this particular Express location was having a huge dress sale and that I should stop by. I have been shopping in Express since I was 15 years old, so I knew that I would be able to find some wonderful designs for an affordable price.

I walked into the very busy store. I was not greeted or told about the sale by any of the sale associates. I walked around for a minute until I finally found the sale dresses. The dresses were not in order, so it took me a minute to find the right size in two different dresses. I’m 5 foot 2 inches tall, so I was standing on my toes trying to reach the dresses on the high display rack. Once I had the dresses in hand, I walked to a fitting room near the register. The store was in disarray. In my opinion, there were not enough people working to handle such a heavy load. There were shoes all over the ground and the line was out the door. I waited patiently by a fitting room for about 5 minutes. After no one came I assumed the fitting rooms were closed because the store was closing in 20 minutes and I was in clear view of employees working. I walked around for a minute then walked back to the fitting room and waited even longer. Finally a female associate named Huma Ahktar approached me. I told her I had two items and asked if she would like to hold my bags. She told me I could take my bags into the room. I was in the fitting room for about 2 minutes. When I walked out the room, the sales associate Huma Ahktar was standing directly in front of my fitting room. I was surprised that Ms. Ahktar did not ask how the items worked out, which is routine for any retail store clerk working the fitting room area. Even though the sales associate did not ask, I told her that both items fit great and that I would be wearing one of the dresses that night, as I had a birthday dinner planned and the mustard dress was going to be perfect with my new shoes from Aldo.

The moment I walked out of the fitting room area, I was greeted by another sales associate, William Lewis. Mr. Lewis informed me that he had heard his manager Huma Ahktar, the woman who I thought was assisting me in the fitting rooms, announce on the headset that there was a “shady girl in the store that needed to be watched because (said shady girl) looked like she was about to steal something.” I was completely shocked by Ms. Ahktar’s words and behavior. I had spent over $400 dollars in that mall within the last hour. Not to mention, I was clearly carrying bags from stores that I had made purchases from. I was dressed casual wearing a pair of vintage shorts and a vintage Levi’s denim jacket with cowboy boots. I was carrying a wallet, in my opinion there was no reason to suspect me as a thief. 

I don’t understand where the idea that I would steal was coming from. Clearly being of African decent and a 27 year old Woman was enough for me to be followed by the store manager. Mr. Lewis told me that he was “sorry” repeatedly. Mr. Lewis admitted that he overhead his manager on the headset and had no idea that they could be talking about me. He saw the shock in my face and said he understood if I wanted to put back my items and leave the Express store immediately. Mr. Lewis also let me know that this has happened before while working with Huma Ahktar. Mr. Lewis recalled that on at least one other occasion, his store manager had specifically asked Mr. Lewis, a young man also of African American heritage, to watch or follow other African Americans because they had immediately been profiled by Ms. Ahktar as potential thieves. 

I was frozen with shock and could not believe I had been racially profiled in such a way by Ms. Ahktar. I am a very hard working Woman. I own a successful clothing store, “Rumors Boutique” which is located in Richmond Virginia. My store, Rumors Boutique, has a prime location on the campus of Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU). We are very involved with our city. Weekly we donate over 20 percent of our sales to non-profit and student organizations. I have built, owned and operated Rumors Boutique for over 5 years. I have had over 40 interns and I have 14 employees on my payroll. I speak at the local college on a regular basis and work with the city on youth behavioral programs. I know how to properly manage a store and how to treat customers and people in general of all races and creeds with respect when they come into my place of business. The profiling which I experienced at the Express store in Tyson’s Corner Mall situation would never happen in my store. If any of my employees behaved as Huma Ahktar behaved on June 23rd, 2012, it would result in immediate termination with no severance pay or referral.

I was reminded on June 23, 2012, days before my birthday and the 5th anniversary of opening my store, that it doesn’t matter how hard I work, how much I give to my community and my city because the rest of the world looks at me and decides I am a shady woman who is a thief based on the texture of my hair and the color of my skin. Another associate, Rueben Castellon, was incredibly nice and understanding he apologized profusely for the behavior of his manager Ms. Ahktar. In that moment I sincerely appreciated Mr. Castellon’s compassion for the discriminatory situation I had just been placed in. I told Mr. Castellon, that it was indeed not his fault but I appreciated his gesture of condolence. After speaking with Mr. Castellon and Mr. Lewis, I decided that I would still purchase the dresses. But I asked Mr. Castellon not to give me a discount, because I did not want nor need a price break on something I could afford. At no time did the Manager come out to talk to me or deal with this situation that could have been handled by the time I had reached the register to pay for the items. I assume that Ms. Ahktar was most likely in shock that someone like me, a “shady black girl” would be acquainted with an associate who works at the Express store that Ms. Ahktar manages. 

This whole situation has weighed heavily on my soul. I am the daughter of parents who fought for civil rights in America. My father and mother were Secretary and President of the NAACP in Bingham NY. My parent’s have instilled me with values that taught me to fight for what I believe. They taught me, that not only I am equal, but that my hard work and ambition will win overall. This situation has showed me there is still a lot of work to do.

Express is a good company. I know several people who work at the Express in Richmond Virginia and I’ve been treated with nothing but respect from the staff at the Express locations in Richmond Virginia. The Tyson Corner Express is one of the largest and most successful locations on the East Coast. Any of your employees could be potential managers of different Express stores around America. You do not want bad management to reflect your company. You do not want a mistake to become company policy.


Growing up in Manassas Virginia my friends and I loved to visit the huge mall and see all the designer stores. Our parents would pack us in a Van and we would spend hours visiting every store, buying wonderful items to wear to school to impress our friends. We tried on dresses at Jessica Mcklintock for homecoming and prom. We visited Delia’s when it first opened and spent every penny we had. I think when it opened I went there at least 3 times a week. Ending the day at La Madeline’s eating strawberries and fancy French food. It was one of my best memories growing up and I will miss those good times. Yet today I am writing to inform you that I no longer feel comfortable shopping at your mall. What was once a wonderful memory full of laughter and teenage innocence has been replaced by a painful memory of racism and discrimination. The manager of the Express location, Huma Ahktar should be terminated as soon as possible. Ms Ahktar behavior has tarnished the shopping experience with her prejudice and use of racial profiling. In my opinion, as a retail business owner, Ms. Ahktar should not receive any severance pay or package upon leaving. Ms. Ahktar should not be referred or re-located to another Express store or any affiliated store. 

Upon receiving my letter I would like to be informed, in writing, how Express will be dealing with Ms. Ahktar and the racially motivated situation I was unfairly placed in. Since this incident occurred on June 23rd, 2012 I have been speaking with a wonderful woman from Express HR Tereese Harris. Ms Harris has assured me that both, Ms. Ahktar and the habitual use of racial profiling at your Tyson’s Corner location will be handled properly. Attached to this email I have included 5 or so articles written about myself and my business partner. From these articles, the success, impact and community involvement of our store will be more than evident. I was saddened and humiliated by Ms. Ahktar and I hope that you will be able to rectify this situation, swiftly and professionally without the need for me to seek legal counsel. 

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely, 

Marshe Wyche 

Owner of Rumors Boutique, Richmond VA"

Not really anyway, I'm really bad at continuing the conversation, I run out of anything to say beyond the logistical stuff, not that that stuff's even good to begin with.  At one point, I think I fumbled the name of her company and had to ask her like three times in a row what it was because I couldn't make out the name of it (it was something hard to pronounce).  Then moved on to stuff about how she was liking the city and what she's been doing... from one generic topic (where you from, what do you do, etc.) to another (what do you do around town, etc).  I just get nervous around beautiful women.  It got a little more awkward as time went on and as we kept walking; especially that there was some silence now between conversation topics as the awareness of the awkwardness became clearer.

But despite this... I got a number close.  With the caveat that she said she can't promise she'd answer or something, can't recall the exact reasoning she told me.  I called her right away so she ""had my number too"" but obviously to verify.  I told her I'd maybe try her anyway.  Said goodbye, and left it.  Ended up not contacting, just thought it be best to leave alone as a single failed encounter despite getting her number.  I also had a bunch of personal issues that I was mired in time-wise so wasn't totally free for much.

Cut to today and I randomly see her on the same street.  I see her walking and as she runs into this little kid, she playfully kind of pats him on the head or plays with his hands a bit and keeps walking while smiling back at him (she apparently likes children).  So in hindsight, I totally should have played off that interaction and said something like ""so do you always molest strange young children on the street?""  Instead, I approach and just cut right to how I think we've met before.  She doesn't seem to remember right away... I realize I perhaps shouldn't have done that -- starting fresh like we hadn't met yet would have been the best way to go as to not frame this encounter in the same awkwardness as the previous one.  But it's too late.  And this further makes me feel awkward as she realizes who I am.  So I totally feel like I fucked this up within the first 5-10 seconds and it becomes tense again and I ask her logistical stuff yet again.  I ask if she's on her way to work, how she's liking the city and if she's used to it, what she's been up to.  She says nothing but work.. I then randomly pull out of my ass the question of whether she's traveled outside the city.  She says she has a couple times with her ""boyfriend"", whom I am 99% sure she made up on the spot to obstruct me.  I tell her I was upstate a few days ago and that it's beautiful, recommend that she should tell ""him"" and should go.  She says ""maybe"" and then there's the silence again.  After a bit of that silence and general tenseness, I decide to bail and ask her if she knows X restaurant around the neighborhood, I'm meeting my friend there.  She says she doesn't know and I say I asked because she might know the neighborhood well since she works here.  She says she doesn't and I say I'm turning on this street that we've now walked to to find it and I wish her a good day and she wishes me luck.

So right immediately afterwards, I realize a lot of stuff I could have done better like be a lot more jovial rather than tense and come up with a lot more playful things to say to engage her more positively than logistical boring stuff.  I *always* realize this shit in hindsight.  It's a mix of being nervous around attractive girls and not being in the right frame of mind or mood to do this, as 'the game' and being automatically confident around strangers doesn't come naturally to me.  Maybe I should just refrain from approaching at all if I'm not in the right headspace.  But seeing her a second time around just reminded me how fucking hot she really is and the attraction got to me.  She's basically Jessica Alba but with fuller lips.

So I know I blew a lot of this and I'm pushing it, I know, but I figure one last ditch effort wouldn't hurt maybe?  I mean, the worst that would happen is that she blows me off and doesn't reply, which I would more or less not be too surprised by anyway.  So what's the harm then?  Was thinking just a text saying this:

""Hey, so I'll level with you, I'm honestly a bit nervous around someone so incredibly gorgeous as yourself so I admit first-meeting small talk isn't exactly my strength.  In case that 'boyfriend' was understandably made up, I'd absolutely love to get a drink or coffee with you and cut out the small talk.  Promise it'll be good times.  I'll even try to keep the bad jokes at a miminum. PS.  Saw you playing with the little kid right before I talked with you; do you always molest strange little children on the street? :)""

Something that at least casually explains the awkwardness and be a bit self-deprecating while ending by asking her out for coffee, basically to appeal to a more sensitive/sympathetic side if possible.  And a slight debunk to the ""boyfriend"" but not totally.  If I've already blown it so far, I figure it's the only thing I have left and, as said, if it doesn't work then fuck it.

So I guess this is my FR (Failure Report).  Either way though, seems like maybe it wouldn't hurt if I'm never really going to see her again anyway?  Seeing her today was a fluke since I went into work really late today.

tl;dr
Met this really gorgeous girl a while back, was awkward and tense but got her number despite this.  Met her again today and still awkward and tense, with some more indication of uninterest but I think it's only due to the initial awkwardness which can be avoided once I'm in the right headspace.  Maybe try one last ditch effort to lay out the right words in a text and if nothing comes of it then just forget it?"

Is there a tool or add-on for notepad++ that would help me to automate this?

I'm good when it comes to writing lyrics for any of the songs I have worked on. My true talent though is my ear for music. I know what sounds good, and I've learned that a lot of people really don't hear the music the same way I do. I can just listen and tell anybody what isn't working in a track. I am Hip Hop based, but I really go into every other genre: Rock, Blues, Indie, R&amp;B, Country...etc. I need somewhere that can take me to the next level. If anybody can help me enter this music industry with an internship or just a hour of your time, let me know. I am based in Gwinnett, GA and I'm still in high school.

wcdu6,5,2012-07-10,Considering turning down a graduate research assistantship... any advice?,mechundecided,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/wcdu6/considering_turning_down_a_graduate_research/,"I went to a top public university in the US and majored in mech E, graduated this past May. Throughout my undergrad career, I worked in one of my professor's labs doing research for him on some pretty state-of-the-art work. Anyway, finished up my final year with a decent GPA and graduated but didn't really have any job prospects lined up. So my professor offered to pay for me to go to grad school at the same university under his grant ($20,000 stipend/yr, tuition, and health insurance). Not a terrible deal at all, but I'm having some doubts about it and don't want to commit just yet.


1. My undergrad degree was mech E and my master's will be as well -- unfortunately, the research area is more materials/nano (you could draw comparisons to thermo/heat transfer, but it's a pretty far stretch). If I start the M.S. track my degree focus will be thermo/heat transfer, but I'm far more interested in dynamics. Considering that the work I'm doing is very specialized and in a materials/nano field, how difficult would it be to find a job after graduation outside of my research area -- especially if my master's degree focus is outside of the field that I'm interested in? Am I limiting myself by doing research in a field that I'm not interested in?

2. I'd also like to intern somewhere after my first year of grad school so that I can be more prepared for the job search before/when I graduate after the second year. Unfortunately, I'll be unable to do so since I'll be committed to research during the summer time periods (as I am right now). Also, sort of related, I could graduate faster with an M.E. than with an M.S.

3. Aside from the worries that I'm limiting myself in future career fields, there are some serious health/safety concerns that have recently been brought to attention. I won't go into major detail, but suffice to say that chemicals we use are fairly toxic and dangerous and some of our fabrication methods are not up to standards.

4. And finally, say I commit to turning down the offer due to the various reasons above -- I checked with our grad office and found that I can transfer from the M.S. route to the M.E. route and stay in grad school (albeit after taking out loans to pay for it all) -- how should I approach letting him know I'm backing out at the last second? Two weeks notice and a sincere ""I'm sorry that I'm flaking...""? I dunno, anyone have any first hand experience?


I have yet to sign the financial aid agreement (the $20,000 stipend/yr, tuition, and health insurance part) because I don't want to seem like I'm taking advantage of the situation. But on the other hand, it will appear that way if I turn it down because it'll seem like I only used him to get accepted to the program in the first place.


**TL/DR**: Venting and organizing my thoughts -- considering turning down a GRA due to health/safety concerns, also afraid that I'm limiting myself in terms of future career fields. Say I turn down the offer, how should I approach letting my advisor know (considering that he is pretty much the reason for my acceptance into the program in the first place)?

wcdrc,9,2012-07-10,I am pretty much addicted to opiates (prescription pills) AMA,awayfromhome23,casualiama,https://www.reddit.com/r/casualiama/comments/wcdrc/i_am_pretty_much_addicted_to_opiates_prescription/,"I have been using pharms (prescription pills) for the last three years now.  I Started using in April of 2010.  From there I would use about once every week or two, sometimes maybe not even using more then once a month.  Then after about 6 months I was using at least once every two weeks, but more like once every week.  At this point I only needed about 15 - 30 mgs to get a nice buzz.

Starting last summer I had a lot of cash because I was working two jobs.  One job as a caddy where I would make about 140-160 dollars cash a day possibly more thursday - sunday.  The other job I worked as an intern for a small company doing basic coding / programing for there website.  

This is where everything went down hill I ended up buying 150 30 mg roxies.  Which is 30 mg of pure oxycodone very addicting stuff.  I bought this many because i had the money and it was at a big discount since I was buying so many 11.50 per pill instead of 30 dollars per pill.  I figured that between my girlfriend and friends this would last us all the whole summer since we all would use on the weekends at the beach when we would hang out.  Well turns out I ended up eating 15mgs in the morning to help wake up then 15mgs at lunch at work to get me through the day.  I kept this habbit and was using everyday for about 2.5 months.  Stupidly at the time I didn't realize how addicting they were and had No idea why i was getting such bad back pains some days.  Like back pains so bad that I would want to cry.  Now i know that I was with drawing because i wasn't using.  At the time I had no idea.

At about 3 months into last summer I was probably using about 100 mgs a day.  Then I found suboxone and used that for about 1.5 months and I had no idea what the drug really did all i new was that it helped me not use and took my mind off of the drug.  

All it did was make my tolerance higher so when i started using again it cost me more money.  This all lead until February 1st of this year when i stopped.  

I stopped using from feburary 1st of this year until may 23rd of this year.  I quit cold turkey the first 5 days was awful.  I felt so sick I was hot then i was cold then I was hot then I was cold.  NO matter what i did my bodys temperature was so off.  On top of this all I couldn't sleep at all and I would shit diahrear like it was my job.  The pain and sickness lasted a good 5-7 days.  Days 3-5 were so bad that even if days 6 and 7 i still may have been sick i felt healthy because comparably it wasn't even painful.  The worst part was probably though that after all of that I literally didn't sleep for about 3 weeks.  Opiates really screw with your sleeping habits and it causes you to have insomnia.  It was the strangest feeling because it wasn't like I was tired.  It was like I would get tired go to lay down after 30 mins maybe an hour at most lying down not sleeping just lying down I would get energized and be up the whole night.  No exaggeration I think for the first two weeks I maybe had a total of 12-15 hours of sleep.  Week three I maybe would sleep 2 - 3 hours but not much more and then after that I slowly would sleep more and more.  The shits didn't stop though till day 70-75 though.  

Before I left my tolerence was easily 200+ mgs a day and at least 60 mgs to just feel normal.  When I started using again my tolerence was back at like 10 mgs would get me feeling pretty good and 20 mgs great.  Now after about 50 days of use again i need like 45 mgs to get a nice high and today alone have already used 180 mgs.
which is 6 roxies

Ask me anything!

Also I wanted to add that I was 19 yrs old when I started and am now 21.  I live in the tri state area and have to say so many kids my age are in the same situation as me.  If you have a son or daughter in the tri state area and you are middle class I can almost guarantee your kids have taken some kind of prescription drug.  

There is also a chance they could be using a little bit more then just recreationally.  So many of my friends who you would think back a few years ago would never touch a drug are now using prescription pills multiple times a week.  The problem is doctors are prescribing benzos to any girl who claims to have anxiety.  And there are so many dirty doctors out there that kids with ""back pain"" are getting prescriptions for roxies.   Because there are the kids who need the money.  And when they can make 2000 dollars + a month by lying to a doctor about back pain its a no brainer and none of these kids think about the consequences of getting caught because they all think I can't get caught.  And then on the other side is the rich kids who parents give them as much money as they want so even at 20 dollars a pill they can afford it.

I've seen many kids start doing drugs by taking prescription pills.  Because pharms seem clean to them and they know the drug is from a legit source so they have nothing to worry about like it being laced or fake.  Then from there they realize how good drugs are and start smoking weed to enhance to effects and from there more and more drugs.  

As well pretty much everyone using is in some way also pushing / selling the drugs.  What I mean by this is say someone picks up 20 30 mgs pills for 20 dollars each.  When they go to give them to there three other friends they sell the pills for 30 each.  This way they bought there 5 pills for 100 dollars, but then sell 15 they bought for 300 at 30 each selling them for 450 meaning they make 150 dollars off there friends that easily.  Then they have 5 pills for free and 50 extra dollars.  Its called being a middle man and everyone involved does this in some way when they can.

The defense company job has been okay when they can give me work. It's a little difficult for me to consider a career here while I personally believe the US spends way too much on the defense industry. That said I think I'd have an okay chance at getting a decent paying job with them after graduating. The lab job at school is terribly dull, since its just basic testing. I'm a little nervous about getting out of school and working some place I can't stand, but I suppose that's me being a little paranoid?

I'm not asking you to tell me where to work, or anything like that. I guess I'm just wondering if you could go back to one year before graduating and give yourself some key advice, what would it be?

Ive got myself a summer internship and I was thinking about investing the money i will make into the stock market. I have a particular company in mind that i think is really going to do well in the future. I want to invest now so possibly I can make lots of moneys when im older.

I was thinkin id take a couple thousand of the money Im makin this summer and buy as many shares as that will get me of this company. I figure id hold on to it for awhile and maybe in a few years ill make some decent cash out of it (better then if i left it in a bank), or maybe ill just buy more shares. My logic is ""wow everyone loves apple, I would be willing to bet they come out with some crazy new product / everyone will be spending money on their products somehow that their stocks are going to go up."" Apple isnt really the company im lookin at but its the same idea. ""this company is going to be huge, everyone will buy what they are selling, i buy stock now, 10 yrs go by, ????, profit."" 

It be like when the TV was first invented and all of a sudden there is this new company called NBC. I think theyre gonna be huge so i decide to buy stock. next thing you know everyone watches NBC and im rich

What do i need to know before I go along with this plan and is it worth it if im only getting $2000 worth of shares. AND is my logic for buying this stock good or clearly coming from someone who has no idea how the stock market works.

_____  
I will preface this by admitting to you that I am in fact a Christian, though I ask that in this case you don't hold that against me. 

You see, I am a twenty year old college student serving an internship at an investment banker in New York, and I have got it in my head to get something in the works so that I am not sitting here idly watching others suffer. No, I'm not looking to blindly convert people to my beliefs. I believe that every person should be given all sides of the matter to make up their own minds. 

What I would like to do, or at least set in motion, is a system of helping those who are down on their luck on a personal and physical level. To be a friend for those without. To help fiscally when possible. Spiritually when asked. 

Moving here to the big city, having never been exposed to the homeless population, honestly broke my heart, and it is with them that I want to start, then branch out to anyone and everyone that would ask or need. I understand that there are places that provide soup and a place to sleep at times, but I frankly don't trust many of these faceless charities, even the churches. I am working on a plan using what I have been learning since I've been here about the market, finance, accounting etc. for a completely transparent group that keeps a public record of every dollar spent, and each dollar's origin if need be. I will be using what resources I have to fund whatever I can, which honestly isn't much after I pay off my rent and put food in my own mouth, but that will change as time goes on.

I'm not asking for anything just yet, but I would like to know if you guys would be willing to work with me on this when I get everything together. Looking past the semi-constant bashing of religious folk that I've seen, I've come across so many of you who are as generous and loving, if not more so, than so many of the people who claim to hold to a religious doctrine. So r/atheism, if I can make this happen, will you help me?

wc1pp,0,2012-07-10,"My ""The Amazing Spiderman"" review",[deleted],movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/wc1pp/my_the_amazing_spiderman_review/,"I just had a lot of problems with it. My main problem, and this really set me off the whole movie.
In the beginning of the film, Parker walks into Oscorp to find Connors, and he is recognized as an intern. However, he isn't really an intern, and he picks up a random ID tag by the name of Rodrigo. Mind you, this is a billion dollar corporation with ""maximum security"" and they didn't even card this fucking guy. For all they know, he could be a terrorist. When Rodrigo came in later and was forcefully escorted out by security, it had me thinking.. Why not just fucking card the kids. You'd think with such a high-tech organization, they'd have better security (as they advertised). 
This leads me to think, had Rodrigo been the man to actually go on the intern's tour, maybe he would've had the curiosity to go into that radioactive spider room, after bumping into that creepy Indian. Having him be bitten by the spider.. 
Had he survived, because remember Connors said that none of his test subjects survived (the mice he tested), maybe he would have used his powers for good. Though he never would have had to avenge anyone's death, say he fell through the same roof Parker did when he had his power, while running from those bad guys in that scene. Parker was inspired by a red luchador mask. Rodrigo, assuming he is hispanic, would have been inspired to become El Luchador, the masked vigilante. 

The other problems were more personal, so as a Spiderman movie, it was a 6.5/10 for me. As a regular film.. I'd say maybe 8. Visual aesthetics, effects, story, and the scene where his Uncle been was killed got me to tear up. In that sense, it was 8/10 for me. Still the minor details that I didn't like.
Spiderman used mechanics for his webs, I hated that.
Even to today's standard, Peter Parker was barely portrayed as a nerd in this film. Just because he got beat up once by that dick on the basketball team doesn't make him a nerd. 
In the movie, when he first got the Wanted poster for the dude who killed his uncle, it said ""Wanted for questioning"" when he hung it on his wall. At the end of the film it said ""Wanted for murder."" 
He never avenged his uncles death, and don't give me that bullshit, ""remember that scene where his uncle ridiculed Parker for getting vengeance over his bully by humiliating him at school? When he said, ""Do you feel better now?"""" 
There's no way that had anything to do with Parker not avenging his uncle's death. Because after Ben died, he tried to avenge his death anyways. That's how he got the idea for being Spiderman in the first place. 

So yeah. There's my review. 6.5/10 as a Spiderman film. 8/10 as a regular, '*I'm just going to go ahead and watch any given movie*' film."

You see, I am a twenty year old college student serving an internship at an investment banker in New York, and I have got it in my head to get something in the works so that I am not sitting here idly watching others suffer. No, I'm not looking to blindly convert people to my beliefs. I believe that every person should be given all sides of the matter to make up their own minds. 

What I would like to do, or at least set in motion, is a system of helping those who are down on their luck on a personal and physical level. To be a friend for those without. To help fiscally when possible. Spiritually when asked. 

Moving here to the big city, having never been exposed to the homeless population, honestly broke my heart, and it is with them that I want to start, then branch out to anyone and everyone that would ask or need. I understand that there are places that provide soup and a place to sleep at times, but I frankly don't trust many of these faceless charities, even the churches. I am working on a plan using what I have been learning since I've been here about the market, finance, accounting etc. for a completely transparent group that keeps a public record of every dollar spent, and each dollar's origin if need be. I will be using what resources I have to fund whatever I can, which honestly isn't much after I pay off my rent and put food in my own mouth, but that will change as time goes on.

I'm not asking for anything just yet, but I would like to know if you guys would be willing to work with me on this when I get everything together. Looking past the semi-constant bashing of religious folk that I've seen, I've come across so many of you who are as generous and loving, if not more so, than so many of the people who claim to hold to a religious doctrine. So r/atheism, if I can make this happen, will you help me?"

 I am a shy person and I don't talk to other peoples unless I have to but I try to ask enough questions to be able to get the job done. Should I even list my two former 3 month jobs in my resume considering they were not even internships?

When I imagined everything was going to work out with the internship things seemed doable, I'm due in February, but I could get some extra hours in before then and just finish up after possibly have to do some in the summer.  Then we'd just have between February and summer where money was tight until I found a job in my field.  The site I found even has a high placement rate after internship.  

Now if I don't get to start my internship, because of the way my program works, I'd have to wait an entire year before doing my year of internship.  

On top of all this, I paid almost $6000 for this summer session, and if I have to drop the internship that will be $6000 for two classes- a waste!

If I have to wait for my internship I'm not sure how we're going to be able to do it.  The internship requires so many hours that I'd only be able to work very very part time while doing it.  My husband works, but with baby I don't know how we can do it for a year on one income.  I'm so frustrated and anxious and worried.  Not to mention the letter from my department head saying I had till the end of the week to start my internship was kind of rude, and saying that you know we've had since January so it's our own faults(those of us who had trouble securing internship sites) that we haven't been able to secure a site.

I have an interval similarity matrix (numbers between 0 and 1) and want to do MDS on this data.

I'm more familiar with R so I'll go from there.  

I found the Euclidean distances between pairs using dist() and then did metric MDS analysis using the cmdscale() function. 
This was the exact function: cmdscale(dist.matrix, k=2)

Now someone else in my lab took the same data and did metric MDS in SAS (I am not familiar with the exact methods). This is what the SAS output looks like:
&gt;Shape=TRIANGLE
&gt;Condition=MATRIX
&gt;Level=ABSOLUTE
&gt;Coef=IDENTITY
&gt;FORMULA=1
&gt;FIT=1
&gt;DIMENSION=2


The two sets of coordinates are different. 

What is going on here? Could it be that R and SAS use different ways to implement MDS? 

I tried reading the documentation, but I couldn't find anything that I didn't already know.

I attend an all woman's college in the middle of no where. We live in suites, rather than dorms, so I'm sure you will end up hearing about my suitemates as well. 

I am the president of one of our campus societies, the Alphan society! We are building this society from the ground up since they have been inactive for the last two years. I'm also treasurer of the senior class, and of Robertson Hall. Last year I was treasurer of the Freshman class, and president of Stitch and Bitch, a campus knitting group. 

Speaking of knitting! I love to knit! Odds are, if you are my pen pal, you will end up with some sort of knitted goody. I don't ask for anything in return, it won't be big and fancy, but it will be awesome...because its hand made :)

I work on campus as the video intern. I love anything and everything about cameras, so much that people joke that I should just major in cameras. If I could, I would ;)

I have three fish that travel with me everywhere I go, Nabbychivoro, Soy, and Brutus. They are all three beta fish! Together they are very patriotic, (red, white, and blue). I also have a Pomeranian named Koda Dakota Kohl, Koda for short. He stays at home during the school year :) 

After this school year I will be making the next big step with my wonderful SO, by moving in to an apartment together. As much as I love the idea, its also slightly terrifying. Its leaving the nest! Its a whole new level of commitment! Its an adventure! And I'd love to share my adventure with you :)

Quick overview of other interests: Dr. Who, Star Trek, traveling (I'll be going to Thailand in March 2013!), reading, art, gardening, ah hell...I dabble in it all! 

I would like to have a penpan by snail mail, male or female doesn't matter. Maybe a letter (or two) a month? Nothing overwhelming, after all my studies do come first! I would even love the chance to have an international penpal! Oh yeah...19/F/Missouri, USA. That seems kind of important too :)

The wife and I are of two minds on the subject, and require a third party (and with any luck a fourth and fifth) to clarify.

It is generally kicked around that one should apply for ""3-years of experience"" even if one has zero or one years of experience (internship or similar) It is likewise kicked around that one should call a recruiter shortly after putting in an application.

I'm having a disconnect, however over the idea of applying for a job that I am clearly unqualified for, and then calling the recruiter to talk about it. I'm willing (but not happy) to apply for jobs I'm not qualified for. Inflation happens. I'm willing to call the recruiter. But it strikes me as foolish to do both together.

Sunday I mentioned I was headed home to see my parents and get a home cooked meal. I realized she wont see her home until Christmas so I invited her along. She enjoyed the meal, and we went out for a drive in my dad's old muscle car to a nice local park. Chatted a lot and then headed back to the dorms after a bit of desert. I thought for sure I'd laid the groundwork and was going to ask her out in the next couple days.  

However nice guy hung in the back of my mind so I asked her friend if I was on the right track. She warned me not to as Irish girl was after someone else. I moped for a long time after that yesterday

But today, I question that. Perhaps a chance taken is.better than one passed. What do you all think? Am I at risk to let something pass me by or am I running into a brick wall?

Odd day today.

A little background first.  I work at a brewery. Calm the fuck down...I'm not getting you free beer.  I only get a few shift drinks myself, the rest is just ""quality assurance"".  Today was a little bit of a shit-show.  My hydrometer broke, (It measures the amount of sugar in the liquid and you can use that to figure out how much alcohol will be in the beer), and I didn't have the yeast I needed.  There's a home-brew shop close to me so I told my intern to keep an eye on things while I biked over to pick up some shit.  (I love having interns, they work for beer and will do the worst jobs, all with a shit eating grin)  

This, however, is where my day got fucked.  On the way to the home-brew shop I almost got hit by a car.  I'm a pretty cautious biker.  I not a rule Nazi, but I spent the last 5 years biking in NYC before moving out to Colorado, so I know how to bike safely in traffic, albeit aggressively. This sum-bitch tried his best to left-hook me.  I swerved around him, almost casually, flipped him the bird, and mentioned a few derogatory things I had heard about his mom.  I also managed to overshoot my turn and plow, full speed, over the curb.  Well, 86 the front wheel, the fork, frame, and any sense of self righteousness I had garnered from telling a stranger to fuck off.  I landed, thankfully, on my beer swollen ass.

This is where it got weird.  I just sat there for a minute, trying to collect my thought, analyze what just happened, and sweep up the shards of my self esteem.  The fatty running toward me, however, was not in such a contemplative mood.  Think about Jon Goodman (I know, I'm sorry).  Imagine what he would be like if Rosanne didn't feed him for 2 weeks.  Imagine you smell like malted barley, hops, and vanilla (my wife's body wash, I can't help but use it, it smells amazing).  

Anyway, I look up to see 300 lb of pale, sweaty, clammy man running right at me; giving me the crazy eyes all the while.  

I don't know what other people do in this situation, but I promptly proceeded to cry.  I don't mean sobbing like a girl who just got dumped for the slutty emo chick.  I mean screaming in a pitch to high for dogs to hear while evacuating your bowels.  It was like that scene in the ""Enter Sandman"" video with the kid running from the Mac Truck.  I know a million thought flashed through my head.  The two I remember are; ""I didn't say ""I love you"" to my wife today."" and ""This is a shitty way to die.""  

I had resigned myself to the fact that this fat fucking asshole was going to kill me.  I was barely going to put up a fight.  WTF!!!

I was so preoccupied with my eminent death that I barely registered the cop asking me if I was alright.  Apparently he had been chasing Fatty McFatness over an assault complaint a few blocks away.  He managed to get close enough to use his [taser](http://hotword.dictionary.com/taser/) {TIL} to bring down the Goliath mere inches from me and my bike.  

I stared at this asshole, the fatty, not the cop, (although I understand the confusion), for a solid two minutes until I realized why he scared me so much.  He was missing an eye.  Not really just an eye, but his left eye, left temple, and left ear.  

He had been shot already!!!

The cop had shot him once in the head.  The motherfucker kept going though.  Praise the FSM that the cop realized he could take him down by incapacitating the muscles, if the fat fuck had any.     

Right after, about 10  more pigs swarmed the scene and beat the shit out of Fatstuff McEatsalot.  

I didn't stick around.  

There was a brewery less then a block away. (Thank you Fort Collins) and I proceeded to drink away the panic.  There is now a thick layer of fog between me and my emotions.  

I'm going to buy a new bike tomorrow.  I want to get a mountain bike.  The wife and I have been talking about doing more outdoor activities.  Anyway....

Just sharing and drinking,
Cheers,

I'v been in Baltimore for about 2 months now for an internship at Johns Hopkins. I'm a Medical Student as well as a student in Music and am only going to be here till mid August. I've become a little bit lonelier than I thought I would be and wouldn't mind meeting someone new to hang out with for the summer whether a fwb or just as a friend. In the future I definitely wouldnt mind keeping in contact with whoever I end up meeting.

I am 20, 5'11/10'' and 170. I go to the gym everyday among other things such as cooking, watching tv (doctor who, sherlock, etc.), drinking gin or wine while reading or watching tv.

Anyway, I dont think text intros do anyone justice so just contact me I guess by pm if you're as bored in baltimore as I am. Thanks!"

I got this from my brewing school's email job listing.  This perfectly sums up why it is so hard to earn a living wage in the brewing industry, especially as a brewer.

As a professional brewer with 15 years of experience, this is offensive on so many levels.  The sad thing is, they will probably find someone to do this ""internship.""

1. They expect someone to live salary-free for two months...in Chicago!
2. They only want someone full-time for a postion they're not paying for!
3. This person will be expected to do what a brewer does without getting paid.
4. I'd be willing to bet OSHA and their insurance company wouldn't be too pleased about having unpaid newbies lugging chemicals and climbing around in hot, confined spaces.
5. They've apparently never heard of CIP'ing.
6. They spelled wort wrong.
7. They think you'll love getting them lunch because brewers are such rock stars.

At least they're honest, though.  I'll bet a lot of breweries would staff themselves this way if they could, because they know that there is an army of people who think brewing is so cool, that they'd be willing to earn nothing just for the privilege of being in the industry.  What that means for anyone who has persevered in the industry for any length of time is that their skills, experience and, most importantly, earning potential are always being undercut by the eager throngs who just finished reading ""The Complete Joy of Homebrewing"" and want to take their shot in the bigs.

&gt;XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, one of Chicago's newest craft breweries, is currently looking for a full-time unpaid intern that is interested in making a 2 month commitment to learn and work on a regular schedule. Preferably, the position would go to someone interested in beginning a career in the brewing industry. The selected candidate(s) will receive a comprehensive and hands-on brewing experience. She or he must be willing to:

&gt;- Work hard
- Lug around 55 lb bags of grain 
- Crawl inside a blazing hot mash tun to scrub it
- Grain out
- Deconstruct an 18 head canning line and put it back together again
- Rinse filthy kegs
- Be subjected to accidental beer showers
- Handle caustics and other hazardous materials
- You get the idea.

&gt;We will train you on our 15 BBL brewhouse on the basics of production brewing, fermentation, yeast handling, wart analysis and testing, keg cleaning equipment, canning line equipment, forklift, milling, boiler maintenance, glycol function, tank sanitation, dry hopping, getting us lunch, being super cool.

&gt;If this is you then definitely let us know as soon as possible by email: XXXXXXXXXXXX. Include your resume as an attachment please. If you lack brewing education we prefer someone with a strong home brewing background. In the subject line of your email please write ""Intern"" 

&gt;XXXXXXX is an equal opportunity employer we're pretty nice folks. Please don't reply unless you have the remarkable ability to put your life pretty much on hold for 2 months. Sadly, we can't use someone right now that is only available part-time, half days, weekends and secular holidays only, or if you're a chronic over-sleeper. The schedule will generally start at 9am every day and go until the job is done, sometime in the evening. Also please don't respond if you just want to get your hands dirty for a day or two. As much as we appreciate an offer for help, we are no longer using volunteers and the work we need done requires lengthy training.

I recently bought a cx bike and this fell on the back burner until recently. I want to make this bike into a decent commuter bike for myself and then gift it to my two brothers who are currently down both cars and licenses. I am also the only one who inherited any technical/handyman skills to fix the bike up with....

The work I've done so far:
     -replaced old dry rotted tires
     -cleaned up and tuned the derailleur and chain
     -replaced the old ratty handlebar tape

Work to so:
     -invest a minimum of new brake pads (and possibly new cabling/ entire system)
     -brake handle covers
     -new seat
     -invest in a shifting system to move it off the frame (or a cool way to spice it up / make it unique)
     -build a custom carrying rack
     -new paint job


What do you think of my progress so far? Any recommendations or ideas you think would look good? I also think any flair or ideas from this community would be awesome to incorporate. I have about 2 months to get this done and there is not much I can't do. Share with me the hive-mind of Reddit!

TLDR; I got this bike and am fixing it up for my brothers as a gift. What would you do / suggest?"

I've just gotten back into playing TF2 after not having played since 2009. Medic is my preferred class, although I dabbled in Pyro for a long time as well. I bought TF2 specifically to play as the Medic. 

I've read the tips and strategies, and I think I'm okay at the basic ""heal everyone, don't die"" routine. Today I hit one of those perfect zen moments where I broke all my current records as Medic -- I stayed alive for over 8 minutes, popped 4 ubers, racked up assist kills, defended the payload checkpoint, and got several achievements out of the deal (including Intern, over 7,000 heal points in a single life!). 

So I'm getting a lot better at avoiding death and just spreading out my healing as best I can, like targeting on fire teammates first, prioritizing and pocketing as needed, etc. The one thing I know I'm still bad at is using the UberCharge correctly. I have just the standard Medic equipment, so that's the invulnerable Uber, and I know it's best used as a push or taking out Sentry Nests... but I most often feel like I'm failing to use them correctly. I know part of the problem is my mic's busted, so I can't communicate effectively, but even still. 

I wanted to ask for advice on being a better Medic -- what's your wishlist of Medic behavior? What ways can I best serve my team? What are your Medic petpeeves, so I can avoid them? What are some of the best ways to communicate when you can't use a mic?

I tend to like playing Payload maps best, if you have specific Medic strategies for that play type. "

How about a map that is a huge city, an example of what I mean would be something like Grand Theft Auto kind of set up, but the size of Cheranus. The outskirts of the city would be suburbs, and the inner city would be industrial/corporate. It could also be based on an island, similarly to Manhattan in New York, but of course any bridges leading to the main land are blown up. But perhaps something can be done where players can reach the mainland via a boat to reach military bases set up outside the island to attempt to contain the infection. There are a lot of things that you could do with an environment like this, including making a subway system underground that players can explore, all the way up to 100 floor skyscrapers crawling with the undead interns that used to make up it's existence.

Here's a quick mop-up of what I'm trying to explain here (Sorry I'm not an artist)

http://i.imgur.com/bnuj9.png

The first image would be the outside area
The second image would be the subway system if it were to be implemented, as rocket has said, he is looking to implement underground play.

I believe an urban environment on this scale, would be a thrilling addition to DayZ, and I'm sure people will agree.

I have submitted it to the DayZ forums, if you could drop a comment to help get this noticed, that would be fantastic!

wayql,56,2012-07-09,First time failing under weight,Andr3wsky,Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/wayql/first_time_failing_under_weight/,"HAD to share this story. I'm pretty new at all this. My experience today sealed the deal: I will be lifting things until I can't any more.

I've always been a pretty puny guy. 5'7'', 135 for nearly 8 years (155, now). I went to the gym, but I mostly just piddled around on the machines, never tracked my gains, never even really tried very hard. After reading /r/fitness I decided to try SS. My lifts are puny at first. I'm squatting 100, benching 85 (mostly not breaking habits of not pushing hard, so I make bigger gains that usual as my confidence grows). I look like a weinie and I know it, but I want this. I got an internship at the Sex Crimes division of the local Prosecutor's Office, so I read terrible cases every day. 135 pound me is not going to protect my wife very well.

Three weeks later I'm still self-conscious at the gym, but I'm making strides. I get to the gym and all the power racks are taken so I decide to to my bench press first. I hit 125, feel I can do more, chalk it up to first exercise energy and I DON'T want to put too much weight on the bar for a bench press. Squat rack opens up, do squats. I hit 185. I'm ecstatic. I've never, EVER lifted something that heavy. I'm elated. I look at the bench and I'm like, I can do 135. I want it so bad. I used to WEIGH 135. This is all mostly the adrenaline, but I've never wanted to do something so bad as bench my old weight. Set up the bench, tell myself I'm going to do 1x5. First four reps are smooth as butter. The last rep? I stall. I can't make it. I'm about to trap myself under the bar.

I work out alone. All my friends make fun of me for lifting -- I don't really care, but it means I pretty much always work out alone. I set up the safety spot bars, but they're only low enough to not kill me, not low enough I can escape. I'm thinking, welp, this is it. I'm stuck. All these douches in wife beaters are laughing at me -- and the worst part is that they're right to laugh.

Then this guy comes out of NOWHERE and spots me.

I'm beet red but I thank him profusely. He just laughs. ""No problem, man. We've all been there,"" he says. I'm thankful for the spot, but his being so cool about it was the damndest thing. I quickly finish my work-out and head home; I nearly start crying in the car out of gratitude.

Whoever that guy is, if he reads fittit, THANK YOU. I owe you a gatorade or something.

TLDR: Failed under weight at the bench press, coolest guy in the universe comes helps me out, learn not everyone at the gym is a judgmental gym bro."

So far I told her to work out everyday and make sure she is sweating.

I do not drink because it has ruined the lives of my friends and family around me (same with smoking).

I have tried going to parties and just being ""that sober kid"" and i can tell you that i hate it and it's not fun at all. I am a computer engineering major and i have had multiple internships and i am on course to have a GREAT career ahead of me. I would not say i am unattractive (i have played sports, soccer, all my life and i am in shape).

I want to know! Am i too boring? I don't have many girl friends because i am very shy. I cannot just walk up to a girl and start a conversation, my face would turn bright red and i would stumble over my words. Will i be ""forever alone""?

EDIT: So i have gotten a lot of advice. I have taken from the thread that my shyness is more the problem then me being boring. I can accept that, and change it. I have about 1 month for school to start. That gives me 1 month to get my confidence up and ""practice"" talking to strangers. I have to work on my attitude when talking to people. Instead of thinking about how much they could not like me i really just need to keep in mind that they are 1 person and i don't need to care what they think of me.

I'm 19 years old and living at home now that I'm back from my first year of college and couldn't land an internship OR a summer job. I've taken all the tips given for achieving lucid dreaming, but they've never seemed to work. I always remember my dreams, but now some weeks I'll remember all of them, some weeks I'll remember 50% of them. The tips didn't work while I was at school, maybe because of stress. Couldn't be much else, because I didn't have a roommate luckily since he moved out. 

So to get to the point, my room contains a comfy queen-sized bed. I still never achieved lucid dreaming, until just now.  Just an hour ago, after masturbating, I slept on the floor of my room (I forget why) and had an amazing experience as if I'd been lucid dreaming all my life.Whenever I do have dreams, even in my childhood I could not interact with the surroundings which made nightmares much worse, but I stopped having those at age 13.


My dreams have always occurred in one colossal area/town/city (even I can't make out which) which encompassed woods, residential, educational, and market sectors as well as a large 70-foot highway. I was FINALLY able to interact with it, and go to the places I was most curious about. I had a police officer stunt drive me through traffic, walked around a mall naked while no one cared because it had something to do with an event going on and others had been doing it too. I met two old friends and walked around the mall, and even learned a new song. Why did sleeping on the floor change this? Do you think I'll have to fap and sleep on the floor every time I want to lucid dream?


**TL;DR - Always had vivid dreams, but couldn't lucid dream until today when I fapped and slept on the floor immediately afterwards.**"
wev5x,6,2012-07-11,"Gamedev, I need your advice. Please help.",arcturin,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/wev5x/gamedev_i_need_your_advice_please_help/,"About a year ago, I finished college in Boston and moved to Los Angeles to dive head first into video game audio. I've been planning to get into the industry ever since I realized it would be a perfect job for me years ago. Since the move, I've done two unpaid internships, and I can't even get hired to do sound and/or music for a game for free. I've been working at a Starbucks to pay rent while networking, and continuously improving upon my own skillset.

It just hit me that I'm wasting my time. I need to work on video games. It's been too long for me to have not produced anything worthwhile. I'm not after money or glory - I just want to give games the sound they deserve. If possible, I want to eventually make a living from it, because I did not leave behind my family, friends and everything I knew to piss my life away doing nothing I actually want to do.

I've applied to jobs at Riot, various Activision studios, Blizzard and more to no avail, even when I have contacts inside the company. Of course, I'm aiming at entry-level positions, even if they require a couple years' experience.

I am very good at creating music of any genre, decent at sound effects, and have a small amount of familiarity with middleware. I'm considering getting into audio programming as well.

Gamedev, I'm asking you for advice, or if you're looking for someone to do sound for your game - no matter the scale of it - to consider me. You can find a small portfolio of my work at www.arcturin.com. Some of that stuff is even a tad outdated - I need to update it. For example, I'm just about finished with a chiptune patch library that basically makes instant cool retro music with a minimum of effort.

Thanks for your time.

Edit: Cold, hard advice is appreciated. I'm looking to realize what I need to do to get ahead, not to be comforted.

Edit 2: Here's a piece of Skyrim-esque music I'm working on, as an example: http://soundcloud.com/arcturin/castles-in-forests-1

Edit 3: For those interested in chiptune stuff, I threw together a few tracks:

wesuj,0,2012-07-11,An Articulated Defense of the Penny Arcade Kickstarter (x-post from truegaming),LinesOpen,Games,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/wesuj/an_articulated_defense_of_the_penny_arcade/,"*Disclaimer: I am in no way affiliated with PA, and I have donated already to the Kickstarter. I am simply an artist interested in supporting art with donations, and have been pleasantly surprised to find that Penny Arcade agrees with me.*

**1) The rewards are shit. (see further: $500 retweets, $7,500 internship)**
A: The reward is unadulterated Penny Arcade comics for a year plus additional comics as made possible by swapping advertising for donations. They mention on the KS page the possibilities that come out of this, including art in the RSS feed, switching to the Creative Commons license, allowing first/third party apps, and other uses they haven't yet envisioned.

I do agree that the actual reward tiers are sparse, but the content you're receiving is in large part the comics. The more goods they have to give, the more they shave off the rest of the business model.

**2) Related to number one--how is this an actual project? They are a business.**
A: The project is to continue making regular PA comics while adding additional comics (more Automata, more Lookouts, etc.). Part of this is a framing problem--they made it about the ads because that's where the dollars come from, but the dollars allow them the time to produce the comics. Should the dollars come from donations, then the adverts go and (more) comics are produced.

**3) Related to number two--how does this fulfill the other KS guidelines?**
A: Well 2 is easy, because they're producing comics. They still need to work and pay people to produce a comic in 2013, and that's what the KS is for. As for 3, it's not a charity nor a life project because they are a business. They are simply a business changing their funding model and are using Kickstarter because it's easy, recognizable, and streamlined.

Further, they're effing guidelines. Maybe the PA shine convinced Kickstarter when doubts arose, or maybe PA made good arguments about how the project will be presented / completed. Gabe has tweeted it's all within the KS parameters, you guys have your doubts, fin. Perhaps KS can shed more light on this for us?

The former CTO of Kickstarter says this:

&gt; To me, it feels like the next logical step in the evolution of fan funding. Already, fans are expecting to witness the creative process with behind-the-scenes progress updates and feedback forums. Now, they may actually help decide what gets made. If I'm right, the implications for working artists is potentially huge, providing an unexpected source of revenue, as well as potential creative headaches. [source](http://www.theverge.com/gaming/2012/7/11/3151088/penny-arcade-kickstarter)

**3b) That [one complaint.](http://www.twitlonger.com/show/i9022m)**

Subpoint 1: Supporting the entire PA brand and therefore isn't a comics endeavor? Incorrect. Their KS page specifically says that things like PAX and PATV will maintain their current advertiser partners. [source](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/575109064/penny-arcade-sells-out#WillThisRemoAdsFromThePaxSiteParOrPatv) Therefore it's not for the PA brand but for the PA comic and the website through which it is provided.

Subpoint 2: She says the guidelines prohibit creators from paying salaries and rent, and she classifies those as maintenance, but that's rather silly because if you aren't allowed to pay people with money earned from a KS, then what's the money for? You're always paying bills, whether it be production costs, actor salaries, technical equipment.

Subpoint 3: Having lunch with the creators is a pretty standard KS goal that you see on a lot of projects. I picked this one at random, but [here, for $2,500](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/anomalisa/charlie-kaufmans-anomalisa) you can talk to one of three famous people over Skype for 20 minutes.

**4) Why is PA doing this through Kickstarter, and not their own infrastructure?**
A: This one I can't fully explain; Gabe tweeted [""because this is our first try at it and KS is a trusted name.""](https://twitter.com/cwgabriel/status/222730179116670976) Not a superb reason, but I suppose it makes sense as an easy gambit. They haven't wasted any time/money into setting up a new donation system if it fails. Low risk, high ceiling. Gabe also said: [""if it works then yes I can see moving it in house next year.""](https://twitter.com/cwgabriel/status/223042942791729152)

Also, from the KS page:

&gt; Their [Kickstarter's] Pledge system streamlines this process considerably. It's also incredibly transparent, with a bright green bar that goes up in real time so you can see what is happening. [source](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/575109064/penny-arcade-sells-out#WhyKickWhyAreYouStarWithTheKick)

**5) It is a cash grab, and they are greedy.**
A: As opposed to taking checks from advertisers? They have 14 employees and numerous upkeep costs in order to produce all the content they currently make (and plan to make in 2013 should this go ahead). $1 million dollars is not a lot when you consider salaries for 14 employees, office rent and utilities, health care, backend, etc.

**6) But all the excess money will go into their pockets!**
A: Incorrect, they explicitly state on the KS page that any money over $1.4 million will roll over for 2014. [source](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/575109064/penny-arcade-sells-out#WhatHappIfYouRaisMoreThanYourAsk)

**6b) They don't need the money!**
A: Because they have advertisers. What if they didn't?

**7) Why should I pay to get rid of ads? I'm happy with the way things are now.**
A: Fine! Then don't pay anything towards the KS. Wonderful, right? Except a lot of readers are interested in turning Penny Arcade into something more like NPR and less like a newspaper comic. I would rather that Gabe &amp; Tycho are beholden only to the audience, not the audience and advertisers. As Tycho puts it in the Verge article:

&gt; ""We have Patrons [advertisers] and in exchange for their Patronage we grant them consideration on the site. To my mind, and I recognize that this has a philosophical aspect to it, it matters a great deal who the Patron is. Where I'd love to be on your map is making comics! The model is up to the readership at this point."" [source](http://www.theverge.com/gaming/2012/7/11/3151088/penny-arcade-kickstarter)

Changing to donations allows them to focus entirely on content (and their relationship with us, the audience). A quick exchange from twitter is apropos here:

&gt; ‏**@cwgabriel** 
@TheClowbog this particular scenario including a year of PA strips, no ads, other creative work will not happen without KS.

&gt; **‏@TheClowbog** 
@cwgabriel If you can make the extra work happen with the KS money, which is replacing the ad revenue, then you can make it with the ad $.

&gt; **@cwgabriel** 
@TheClowbog but right now the extra work is for publishers I'd rather it be for fans.

**8) OK that's great, but why not go with membership accounts instead? Like premium members, or whatever.**
A: I can't say as to their reasoning for avoiding the membership model (although this one seems easier to implement). One could argue that there is a democratic aspect to this process--if enough people vote for the change, we all experience the change. Next year, maybe more people will vote for donation model? Once they see it in action. Or maybe less will and they'll go back to advertisers.

**9) Do advertisers really change much of the final product?**
A: From Gabe's twitter feed--

&gt; ""Advertisers have been good to us but we have to fight hard to keep it that way. These days they want more and more. video ads and pop ups.""

&gt; ""yes advertisers have tried to influence us in the past. Some have gotten angry when we lay into them in a comic. we can deal with it but...""

&gt; ""it would be cool if we could avoid it all together""

&gt; ""I agree that we've done a great job with our ads. But if we didn't have to worry about ""page views"" we can do all kinds of cool stuff.""

Primarily what you need to understand is that the advertising model sucks up their time. I can't say how much time is takes, but clearly some. By funding PA through donations, you alleviate them of that timesuck and allow them to create more original content, not irrelevant Rainbox Six comics.

**10) How will I find out about cool games now??**
A: They will still mention them in their news posts. [source](https://twitter.com/cwgabriel/status/222711460365729793)

**11) From a redditor--""Kickstarter is a place to go to start something or keep something alive, and neither of those reasons apply to this.""**
A: This is true. They are trying to alter funding models. I find that worthwhile.

**12) From another redditor--""What if it wasn't Penny Arcade? Would you be willing to donate to say IGN or GameSpot to go ad free for a year?""**
A: Gamespot is owned by CBS and IGN is owned by News Corp, whereas Penny Arcade is owned by Penny Arcade Inc, the people who create the content. There is a mild difference.

**13) Ad Block Plus.**
A: How is that keeping Penny Arcade afloat?

*Further reading (cited above): [How Penny Arcade wants to reinvent patronage with Kickstarter](http://www.theverge.com/gaming/2012/7/11/3151088/penny-arcade-kickstarter)*

**TL;DR, my opinion:** I think they should have structured it differently. Centered it around the additional content--say Lookouts as a primary goal. The advertisement removal could have been in stretch goals. But I still entirely support their mission &amp; philosophy."

I was telling my friend about what happened to me yesterday and he told me about this subreddit and thought I should post what happened. Last Friday I ordered delivery and the bill came to 11.09, I tipped $2 when the guy got here so my bill came to 13.09. Today, I go to pull out $20 and my bank account is empty, in fact i'm overdrawn! They entered it in as $1309. :( I've filed a claim at the bank and sent in my receipts but it's going to be at least until tomorrow, maybe friday until the bank gives me a 'good faith credit' or something. basically, I get my $1309 back before they're actually able to get it back from the noodle place. My issue is that I'm totally out of food. I have some bread and like two tablespoons of hummus and 0 dollars. I'd borrow money from a friend but I'm in a different city while I intern this summer. I'd have them transfer it onlne but since I'm overdrawn cause of that $1300 I'd have to borrow like $700 to get $20.

If anyone could help me it'd really just be too perfect for words. Thanks for reading and let this be a lesson to you, if you're going to tip on a delivery order that you used a debit/credit card on, do it in cash

wennz,0,2012-07-11,"Considering switching from Civil to Mechanical, but first I would like some insight.",Stanalli,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/wennz/considering_switching_from_civil_to_mechanical/,"Little bit of background.  I took two classes in high school where we designed and built small remote control cars, engine run styrofoam airplanes, magnet levitation cars, and I really enjoyed all of this.  I also took a class where a designed a bridge and a tower build from steel plates and balsa wood, which I ended up winning a county wide competition for both competitions.

I went into college 3 years ago as a mechanical engineer, but after that year, I switched to civil because I thought it wouldn't be too much different, and there are probably more job opportunities.

However, on my current internship, I am simply fascinated by the excavators, bulldozers, and even the small water pumps.  I find the project I am working on (river restoration) considerably boring.  I always thought I would end up designing bridges in civil, but I don't work with a single engineer who designs anything.  All they do is cost analysis 70 hours a week.

I'm afraid I may have switched majors for the wrong reason, and I am now considering switching back, but it will set me back a year, and I have always been better at statics than dynamics.  Before I decide I was hoping to get opinions, stories, or even just a small job description from some of you CEs and MEs.  I really like using CAD, and that isn't used at my current workplace.

Any questions, I'll be happy to answer.  I appreciate anything beneficial to my scenario.  Thanks in advanced."

Cajun Burgers?

Japanese Burgers?

African Burgers?

I've got these and a bunch more that have taken me forever to get right.  Assume they're good and everyone who tries them likes them.  OK, so now what?

I'd like to get a place to mix my spice recipes in bulk, put them in packets, and box/palletize them for distribution.  Before that, I suppose I just want a lot of samples of each kind to try and get orders?

Where do I go here?  I worked as an intern at Rice-A-Roni 15 years ago, and I know it's extremely easy to do this.  Basically, you're making the packet that come in a mac-n-cheese with a label and a hole to hang it on the rack at the supermarket.

wef2h,0,2012-07-11,"Reddit, what's the most angry you've ever been, and what crazy, reckless things have you done while angry? I'll go first...",temp_is_risin93,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/wef2h/reddit_whats_the_most_angry_youve_ever_been_and/,"So today started slowly, with me waking up around 7AM and heading into my Electrical Engineering internship. I had planned to leave early around 12 noon to head on over to a hangout with some high school friends (I've just graduated this year).

At about 9AM, I went up to my boss and told him that I wanted to leave work early. He asked, ""You doin' anything fun?""

I responded with, ""I'm going to a party."" 

""Well have fun then,"" he said as I headed back to my desk.

As 12AM approached, I started getting a feeling of impending doom, because just one week earlier I had planned to go on a trip to the Sand Dunes in Michigan with some friends, but, unfortunately, a storm hit last Sunday, and our trip was cancelled.

That wasn't the problem though. The real problem was the communication between myself (a guy) and a ""friend,"" who happened to be a girl. She has a boyfriend, which is my only guess as to why she never responded to my messages leading up to our scheduled departure time. She left me hanging like a broken doorknob waiting to be fixed. To make things worse, I got wind that she actually ended up going without me later in the week. Feels pretty damn bad, man.

As you've probably guessed already, when I left my internship to go over another girl's house for the ""hangout"" at 12AM and finally arrived at her house for the ""hangout's"" scheduled starting time of 1PM, not a soul was at home. Mind you, I had messaged her the night before to confirm the party's starting time, and whether or not it was still planned to go on. On her empty doorstep I messaged her saying, ""You're not at home, are you? Thanks for wasting my time and money."" (Because I could still be at work still making money as I type THIS!) 


On my way home, driving past my old high school, adrenaline started coursing through my blood, and I floored it!!! I zoomed dangerously in my dad's 2008 Cadillac CTS at 60 mph in a 35, and I honestly didn't care if I had endangered anyone. I haven't been this mad in FOUR YEARS.

**tl;dr Immature youth of my age bracket don't understand the value of another person's time. They also don't understand what it means to keep one's word.**

I have degrees in journalism and computer science, but I'm not really formally trained in a tech support capacity (minus a summer on the phones for an internet company) -- just a little handy with computers. It started off with basic stuff: doing software installs, fixing shitty in-wall ethernet jacks, etc. 

After a little while, the requests got more complicated: writing code and doing wiring for a web-accessible home energy management program.

Then one day, the CEO called me into the office and had a new project for me. Sitting on his desk were two parabolic antennae and two wireless access points. Here was the task: set up one antenna on the roof of the building and one on a barn across the road ~700 yards away (which due to trees in the way had no line of sight with the company's office building). 

Then I was to establish a connection between the two APs, use them as a network bridge to connect to an old server in the barn. The server was connected to his home network by a private DSL line.

I told him I would try, but there wasn't a guarantee that it would work. His response: ""Well, I bought these from my buddy who used them to shoot internet across the municipal airport, and it worked just fine except when planes were taking off and landing. Really simple stuff, I'm sure you'll have no problem."" 

""How do I get to the roof?"" I asked.

""Oh, there's a little ledge that you can climb onto from my wife's office window, then you just shimmy around the corner and you're on the roof.""

""I'm not really on the books here, what happens if I fall?"" 

""Well, we'll be sure to add you on if you do.""

It didn't turn out to be as scary as I was imagining, as the part of the roof I was working on was only a story up from the ground. 

Anyways, I spent about a week on the roof and in the barn trying to get the damn thing connected. My friend, who was an engineering intern there, also spent most of his time helping me out. Eventually, we gave up, and told him he'd just have to spring for the extra $30 a month for his home network.

We calculated it out that the amount of time we'd spent on this project could have paid for a year's worth of internet. I quit shortly thereafter, but would still get calls from him and his wife at odd hours of the day asking for help with random computer stuff. Blocked their number hard.

tl;dr: Project WiFi Can Do Anything was a complete failure."

My campus in France is really huge, with a lot of pretty places to cultivate, and with some friends we decided to create a community garden in some abandonned research place (photo : http://imgur.com/a/IwDwA). As you can see, there are some pools which are going to be useful to collect water.
The administration at the University agreed to this and even offered to pay us some tools. We also have some money from the town because the gardens will be opened to everyone.
What do you think we could do with this surface ? We've got some ideas already : 
- going to use the pools to gather water
- you can see a crumbling shelter on the left, we hope to be able to build it back
- we are in a big University so we are going to try to reach a lot of people with animations on how to plant and cultivate
- in the upper right corner, there are some old sunhouses, which we are perhaps going to use
- there is a bunch of beech (the green square on the left of the second terrace). We are going to cut some to make some props and the remaining will give us some shadow.

For now, the place is overwhelmed with high grasses and brambles and it is the holidays here so there is no one but me in the University (the joy of a long internship), but on september we are going to begin the work.

So, tell me what you think about this whole thing, and if you've got advices or ideas you would like to discuss, don't hesitate !

First a little background on myself:

I'm 26 years old and have spent the past 5 years running my own business.  I've decided to move on due to some changes in the industry, and quite frankly the long hours and inadequate pay have been draining.  Before I started my business I was seriously considering becoming an actuary, and I'm looking at that possibility again as I ponder career options.

However, the landscape has obviously changed since I was researching in 06-07.  Then it seemed like having 1 exam and an internship almost guaranteed you a job.  Now I am reading over and over horror stories from graduates with multiple exams and internships spending a year or more job hunting.  Perhaps more distressing, I am hearing about companies hiring grads to do actuarial work without the title and at a much lower pay rate. If I decided to pursue the career path now it would entail me going back to community college (I previously completed a year in a physics program) and then transferring to a less than stellar university with a less than stellar GPA.  So not quite an ideal candidate entering the job market at 30.  I am located in Chicago and would have no problem relocating, so I imagine that would improve things somewhat.

While I know it's hard to predict the future, what would your recommendation be to someone like me as far as the future of the actuary profession?  Is competition for entry level work just going to get more and more difficult in the next 3-4 years?  Are wages and potential for advancement going to go down for people entering the field?  Any thoughts and opinions would be greatly appreciated.

I was forced to start looking at my own mortality, my own existence on Earth. It was a heavy time. In the middle of all this, a Redditor inadvertently directed me to this poem:
  
  
Aubade by Philip Larkin  


I work all day, and get half-drunk at night.  
Waking at four to soundless dark, I stare.  
In time the curtain-edges will grow light.  
Till then I see what's really always there:  
Unresting death, a whole day nearer now,  
Making all thought impossible but how  
And where and when I shall myself die.  
Arid interrogation: yet the dread  
Of dying, and being dead,  
Flashes afresh to hold and horrify.  
The mind blanks at the glare. Not in remorse  
- The good not done, the love not given, time  
Torn off unused - nor wretchedly because  
An only life can take so long to climb  
Clear of its wrong beginnings, and may never;  
But at the total emptiness for ever,  
The sure extinction that we travel to  
And shall be lost in always. Not to be here,  
Not to be anywhere,  
And soon; nothing more terrible, nothing more true.  
  
  
This is a special way of being afraid  
No trick dispels. Religion used to try,  
That vast, moth-eaten musical brocade  
Created to pretend we never die,  
And specious stuff that says No rational being  
Can fear a thing it will not feel, not seeing  
That this is what we fear - no sight, no sound,  
No touch or taste or smell, nothing to think with,  
Nothing to love or link with,  
The anasthetic from which none come round.  
  

And so it stays just on the edge of vision,  
A small, unfocused blur, a standing chill  
That slows each impulse down to indecision.  
Most things may never happen: this one will,  
And realisation of it rages out  
In furnace-fear when we are caught without  
People or drink. Courage is no good:  
It means not scaring others. Being brave  
Lets no one off the grave.  
Death is no different whined at than withstood.  
  

Slowly light strengthens, and the room takes shape.  
It stands plain as a wardrobe, what we know,  
Have always known, know that we can't escape,  
Yet can't accept. One side will have to go.  
Meanwhile telephones crouch, getting ready to ring  
In locked-up offices, and all the uncaring  
Intricate rented world begins to rouse.  
The sky is white as clay, with no sun.  
Work has to be done.  
Postmen like doctors go from house to house.
  
It's hard to describe how much meaning this poem has for me, but I'll just say it meant a lot that there was someone out there who felt the same things I did and was able to write them so beautifully and succinctly.  

So, please share! Happy, sad, whatever. I'd love to see some poems that have meaning for you, Redditors, and maybe an explanation of why you love them.

BONUS: Here is a video of Philip Larkin reading Aubade. Amazing: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDr_SRhJs80"

Ill Start",SOLUNAR,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/wdzsi/employed_redditors_what_are_some_tips_you_can/,"I graduated with a double Major in Management and Finance, i can tell you that Management is a bit of a broad major and if you plan on doing so, i would highly suggest finding a concentration. Its not going to be as easy as getting a management role because of your degree.

For my Finance peers, i would suggest learning basic software ( although this is a bit of a duh..... i often see people with little to no skills ). I would recommend learning Excel in and out, no matter what type of business you go into, Excel is a great thing to know, it can be used for almost any type of office task and can land you a job.

I always like to ask friends in college, ""what do you want to do when you graduate? Where would you like to work?"" , if they are not sure about it, i can tell they might have a tough time. I would suggest reading up on careers you find interesting, and start learning what type of knowledge you will need, its surprising but, Youtube tutorials can prepare you for an interview if you know what to search.


If you want to get into Investment Banking, or Wall-Street, its often suggested you look for an internship as early as sophomore year. As many of the hot shot firms will only hire from their internship programs, i found this out the hard way.


Most importantly, please figure out what the jobs available to your major are, and start aligning your skill sets for those jobs. You might want to start thinking of getting series licenses if you want to go into investing.


Good luck to everyone!"

I'm torn between two schools and I have no fucking idea which one I want to go to.

School A: A school that is located 15 min away with car away from where I live, in the middle of my town. A new and modern school with quite few students, my brother went there and he loved it.
Although a person who I dislike will go there it's a pretty cool school.

School B: Is located 2h and 30min from where I live (which means i have to move), a small but not as modern as school A, i will live in a dorm with other students. But this school has the education program that i want, if I go here i'm gonna have the oppertunity to be an intern at a firestation in the US.

I choose school B i will have to move and i'm not sure if i can do it, i don't know how to cook, clean or wash my clothes, but i really want to go there, and what if i cant get any friends? I don't think i could handle being alone in a small town.
If I choose school A I have to live in this hell 3 more years with people I hate and I don't think I could handles that either.

wdks7,0,2012-07-11,Interview: How to incorporate Social Media into the core of your business practice,sig791,marketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/wdks7/interview_how_to_incorporate_social_media_into/,"
Yesterday I took a few minutes to catch up with Christer Holloman – author, award-winning social media champion and sought-after digital strategy advisor. Read on to learn more about how global businesses can win success by embracing social media.
Hi Christer, let’s start with a little bit about yourself and your background.
I make my living advising companies on digital strategies, developing digital revenue streams or new digital products. I’ve been contracting for big companies such as careerbuilder.com, which is the largest job site in the US, The Daily Mail, working particularly with the property portals they own, and most recently for The Times and The Sunday Times as their Head of Digital Product Development. Alongside that I’ve been running something called First Tuesday which is a network for technology start-ups and their investors. I’ve also been blogging for Sky News about technology trends for the last two and half years, and in January my book The Social Media MBA was published by Wiley.
Could you tell us a little bit about the central premise for The Social Media MBA?
Essentially it’s a collaboration between a number of thought leaders around the world, featuring case studies from the social media leaders at brands like Dell, GSK and Aviva. My main objective from the outset was to create a book that gave voice to perspectives from different continents, because it seems as though a lot of the buzz that you get around social media these days is very US focused. Trends around social media are emerging in other areas of the world too, particularly in places like South America, Asia and Africa. I was actually speaking at a conference in Lagos a month ago, the largest city in a country with a population of over 160 million people, and they are increasingly getting connected on mobile phones. Whilst they did skip the laptop trend, they get social media just as intuitively as we do. As more and more people get connected the opportunities are exploding. So I wanted to create a book that really reflected the global revolution of social media, as well as really target professionals who got social media, who are on the band wagon and really want to take it to the next step.
Would you say that people outside of the USA and Western Europe are using social media differently to us?
I think that the drivers are the same. It is inherently human to want to share stories and get feedback and listen in on conversations. That is what social media is so good at fulfilling. Similarly what is happening is that the technology is becoming a whole lot more available to people in emerging markets. The drivers are the same, but the platforms differ. They don’t, for example, use Twitter in China. I heard about this voice blogging company called Bubbly that is doing really well in India, think Twitter meets dictaphone. In Indian few people have internet connected computers at home but almost everyone has a mobile phone. This company tapped into the Bollywood culture, they recognised that users can’t follow a feed on a screen because they don’t have those sorts of devices, so they allow people to sign up to a subscription service which sends them a voicemail from a celebrity. Users pay about 40p per month, the service have over 2 million users of which 1.2 million are paying. The underlying fact here is that people in India are just as interested in ‘following’ celebrities as we are in the UK, the difference being that the platform, the technology, the brand name, the charging mechanism that facilitates that might be different.
Are western businesses still struggling to decide which platform to make use of?
I think people are quite satisfied with the notion that Facebook is the biggest and is good for B2C, that LinkedIn is really good for B2B and that Twitter sits somewhere in the middle. What rocks the boat is when new platforms come in and businesses don’t know how to respond to them. This has been evident with platforms like Google+. Businesses should be asking: What is it? What is it doing? What do we need to know about it? How can we leverage it? The majority of companies tend to let new platforms sit on the side and be ignored. It’s been a similar situation with Pinterest. The problem is that businesses have got it into their head that it is always only going to be Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn, which is clearly an incorrect strategy. They should have an emerging platform strategy that can be applied every time a new platform comes online, almost a blueprint which allows a team member to investigate its utility and how these match with wider business objectives. People seem to be afraid of experimenting and ignoring new things, which has to change because obviously innovation is not going to stop with Google+ and Pinterest.
Have you seen the customer change of the last couple of years?
Yes absolutely. I think it comes down to availability. People can find you so easily and they assume that you are going to respond to them right away. In the olden days you had to write a letter to customer service and therefore the company would be in charge of how it responds to you. This lengthy process would naturally put a lot of people off from complaining in the first place. We then moved on to call centres, but even then it was a process that required real effort and expenditure. Now though, posting a moan on Twitter is so easy to express thoughts and frustrations. That doesn’t necessarily mean that people have gotten more frustrated with service, it is just the technology has made it easier to make the voice heard.
Do you think that we are still going to see big mistakes being made by businesses on social media, in the same vein as United Breaks Guitars?
Yes, the human factor will always allow for mistakes to happen and it doesn’t help that a lot of marketing leaders have outsourced their social media management to the youngest member of their team.
Having said that, a communications director who doesn’t understand how social media works is also just as likely to make mistakes as an intern. A recent example of this is the McDonald’s ‘#MeetTheFarmer’ campaign a few months ago, this was a fully planned out marketing campaign with lots of people involved, however the hashtag was hijacked and became a PR disaster.
What do you see as being the major themes for the next 12-24 months in terms of the relationship between customer and business?
I think that there are a couple of big challenges which are going to play out over the next year. The first is businesses recognising that social media is not just a marketing channel but is instead a form of communication that multiple departments should leverage, whether that be HR, customer service, or even product development via tools like crowd sourcing and feedback loops. So a big challenge is going to be persuading marketing to spread the social media knowledge across the organisation.
The second thing is going to be around analytics. Everyone is talking about how much data they capture from social media, the question is around what you do with that data. Lots of people are claiming that they can harvest and do all sorts of things with data, but I am yet to see any businesses doing ongoing, large-scale, clever things with the data they capture, and talk about it publically. What is McDonald’s doing with all the data they capture from social media? They haven’t told us. So the question remains, after you harvest and mine data, what then?
Those are both internally focused issues, how to manage social media etc. In terms of social media trends what we might be seeing more of is social media that happens through affinity rather than through your network. All my friends on Facebook are people who I went to School or University or worked with, so it is quite a limited group. I’m sure there is someone on Facebook who is more similar to me and who I could get more out of, but the problem is that I can’t see him. If I join a cycling club or a triathlon club, for example, I would meet a bunch of people who are more similar to me. So the question remains, how do you replicate the cycling club experience in a social context. How do you connect with like-minded individuals through a system based on something other than chance? There’s an interesting start-up company called state.it that helps you discover your opinions on a range of issues and create connections through that. So there are people working on it.
Finally Christer you are of course going to be speaking at our Loyalty World event later in the year, what is it that you are particularly looking forward to about the conference?
I’m looking forward to the networking that is going to happen before and around the event. The quality of attendees is really high and so it is going to be a great opportunity to exchange ideas and best practices.

For a few months, I had landed an internship in a German company amongst their finance department. One day, one of the higher-level employees (who was on maternity leave) had to come back to the office due to her presence being absolutely mandatory at a meeting. On account of this urgency, she had brought her 5-month old son along and assigned me the responsibility of taking care of him while she was busy, and gave me strict instructions to not disrupt the working environment. Now as an intern, I am inherently expected to agree to any demand, no matter how ridiculous it is. I quickly agreed.
Little did I know, this was the beginning of an entire shitshow (spoiler alert: literally.) The baby, disturbed by his mother's absence, started crying profusely. I had temporarily habituated ourselves in the quiet copy room to avoid disturbance, and did everything in my power to stop his crying. I tried performing hole-puncher &amp; stapler theater by gluing paper eyes on the two office supplies and pressing them repeatedly. Even went so far as to confuse the copier so it would make silly noises. For future reference: babies are terrified of loud noises. Obviously this increased his crying tenfold.
By now, the other employees were starting to get irked by the constant crying so I took the baby and dashed to the safest spot I know: bathroom. And that was when I smelled it. Kiddo had executed a dangerous performance of number 2. And being someone who is absolutely poop-phobic, cleaning up his mess was horrendous. On top of that, he manages to shoot pee on my hair. (In hindsight, quite an impressive trajectory for a kid his age.)
On the bright side, cleaning him up did the trick. He happily played with me for the next hour (and to my surprise, thoroughly enjoyed my rendition of office-suppies theatre.) I never really garnered much financial experience that day, but it taught me a thing or to on how to be a mother.
TL;DR I was asked to babysit an employee's 5-month old son who ended up inconsolably crying until I fixed his diaper mess"

So, I've been having a dry spell for a year and it's really bad. I've been wanting to end it so I began reading this sub. If you guys can help me, I would greatly appreciate it. I really need to something about this ASAP because its getting me down and distracted from what I should be doing. 

So I got home from college a week ago and started an internship right away. On my second day I notice a HB8.5 in the office. I constantly see her as we work in the same room but for different departments and I am attracted to her. Ive spoken to her a few times about nothing but no real introduction has taken place. I have made a good reputation for myself already in the office and am relatively outgoing at work. 

Today we had an event outside of the office. She was in a stunning dress and I was in a nice suit so I got the confidence to go talk to her. She was with a two of her friends and I just walk up to them and say ""excuse me, do you guys actually do anything? I see you 3 around the office but I havent seen any of you do work"" Her friend HB8 steps in starts defending herself and I keep picking on her. The girl I like and her other friend are laughing a lot. I introduce myself to all of them then say ""I have to leave because I actually do work"" .

It was 102 degrees today and everything was outside so after we finished the event I crossed the street and bought my co workers water from the super market. I walk up to HB8.5 and say ""hey, you thirsty"" and she responds ""yes"" so I hand her water. ""Oh my god, are you being nice to me"" ""yeah, i felt bad and got you water because doing nothing is very difficult"" she starts laughing. At first she doesnt believe me and thinks my boss bought it. After I tell her I actually got it, she asks me to call her by her nick name from now on. Im usually a really nice guy but she doesnt know that. I spoke to her a few more times througout the day making her laugh but didnt see her when I left. 

I will see her tomorrow morning, what should be my next step? I know she has a week and a half left in the office so how can I escalate quickly? 

Thanks for all your help, I really need it. "

Recently decided that I don't want to be an engineer anymore.

I feel like I have been disillusioned as far as what real world engineering is actually like. I've had several internships in all kinds of companies and have come to realize that I hate it. It's all business and money games. And I don't really have to drive to go to graduate school and do real technical engineering. 


While there are parts of engineering school that I like, for example I sometimes enjoy grinding out complex calculations -- dicking with equations and computer programs when there is a clear goal -- but in reality it is just a lot of ambiguity and dealing with people and going to meetings and phone calls and excel spreadsheets and endless powerpoints just to find some cheap company in China that will manufacture a boring pointless piece of equipment.

I'm a 25 year old newbie but been hitting the books/streets. 

One of the sticking point I have been thinking about is, what Tyler Durden from 'RSD Blueprint' DVD calls ""situational confidence"" and it drives me nuts. 

Basically, he says that any bartender in his bar or the Denny's manager could pull easily, flirt and hook up with the girls working in those environments because these guys have already a natural rapport given their situational status but as soon as they are put into a outside environment, like at another party, they become just another chode chugging their drink. 

I think most guys can relate to this as I have had experiences in college as an RA addressing the impressionable freshmen, at work as a senior employee addressing the interns - you can feel the swagger just swimming in your veins or if you are at the club with some crazy female friend rubbing you up and down, and afterwards you somehow feel like you gotta the magical penny and now seems like every girl in the club got that glassy-eye look at you. 

I think this is the reason why most guys want to be i-bankers/doctors, be in frat or be in some kind of high-society yuppie social circle evident in facebook newsfeed but this is not what I want! Because it's a golden-handcuff. I want to be able to walk into any situation, keep my cool, try my best and keep my cool after crash-n-burn and keep on trucking onto the next set/day/routine and get better. 

This is what I want is to get better in unstructured environments because I find it so easy to talk to people when you are associated by work, alumni association or some kind of meetup interest group but it's so much harder when it's out on the street or just in the club. You guys have any tips on approaching women sarging solo, out on the street? Do you think of something observational about your mutual environment to say to start the conversation or do you just go for the direct opener and say ""hey, I saw you and you look like a pretty cool person and want to talk to you"" and what is your mindset before and after a crash n' burn because lines aren't important, it's how you come across that matters.

wdbdd,5,2012-07-11,This is a rant (very long),[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/wdbdd/this_is_a_rant_very_long/,"So this is just a rant...which is why I'm posting it here instead of on /r/mmfb.

My family was poor when I was younger, all living in a one room apartment, parents always fighting, dad addicted to gambling, etc. I don't remember much. My family moved a lot, and by the time I was 7, I had moved 6 times. My first memory with my dad in it is him yelling at me when I was 7, calling me a piece of shit repeatedly (I had been playing with the seatbelt. It's weird because I ask what it means later on, and he gets angry at me for saying a bad word.). In the next memory, I am still 7, but this time, he's flipping the dinner table onto me. I remember I used to stay up late every night, wait for him to come home, and fall asleep to the sound of my parents fighting. My mom was always yelling and hitting my dad, while he just kind of ignored her and asked me how my day was with the same exhausted look every day. My mom told my sister and me horror stories about my dad whenever he wasn't around, so we grew not to like him, my sister REALLY hated him. I...was afraid he'd leave us if everyone was so mean to him, so I was as nice as I could be (I regret this, I'll explain why later). We'd talk sometimes after fights, and he'd always pat my head and thank me.

I lived in Korea until I was 8. That time is a blur. Most nights were the same. Trying to sleep while parents screamed at each other in the other room. Comforting my dad and mom, getting yelled at by teachers for crying, yelled at by my mom for comforting my dad. Sometimes, my sister would come into my room and we'd sit against the wall, listening to the muffled screaming from the room next to us. We wouldn't really say anything, we'd just sit there. Sometimes, one of us would sniffle, but nothing really. I went into her room sometimes too. I suppose we just wanted someone to endure the fighting with.

Japan. I moved there when I was 8, and finished elementary school there. I hated it. I was always bullied, getting beat up, etc. I got sent home early a couple times for violence. I broke someone's hip once. Lot of humiliation and shame. I cut myself once, didn't see the point in it and never did it again. I entertained thoughts of suicide and murder (I guess teenage angst kicked in REALLY early?) I HATED life. A lot of little things happened. My bike was destroyed by a bunch of older kids, they denied it and I got in trouble for destroying my bike. They broke more of my toys, and stole some others. Once I had a rubber snake outside, and they saw it. They took it and held me down while they whipped me with it. I cried a lot. When I got home, I lied and said I lost it; more screaming. We lived in a 3-story townhouse (never again). My father was always making me run up and down them to do pointless tasks (fetch this, fetch that, help me get off my bed because I'm lazy). He'd often make me run up three flights of stairs to hand him something from his nightstand. 

Continuation of parental fighting. Fast forward to the age of 10. I call my dad's boss's daughter a ""shit"" (a word I'd learned from my father some years ago). She tells her mom, who tells my mom, who summons me home and proceeds to yell and beat me for 2 hours with her hands and various stick-shaped instruments. It probably wouldn't have gone on so long, but I started laughing 40 minutes in. I remember looking at the clock wondering how much longer it would last. I desperately tried to think of something funny to take my mind off the pain, and thought of some stupid ice cream joke. I can't even remember what it was, but it must have been pretty damn funny, because I laughed uncontrollably for the next hour. I simultaneously choked back tears and peals of laughter. My mom hit me all the while screaming, ""WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING?! STOP LAUGHING?!"" in Korean. I couldn't stop. It was terrible. Try as I might, I couldn't. Eventually, she says, ""Well, your dad will be able to make you stop laughing, he'll be home soon."" The mere thought of that was able to make me stop. We waited in silence for a few minutes, and the door opened. Without even taking off his shoes, he strode towards me, his eyes red with anger. I took a few paces backwards as he raised his hand; I winced in anticipation. I woke up crumpled on the ground. My mom was screaming at my dad. What if he hit me too hard? End memory.

Fast forward 6 months. I'm in Korea again. I remember I hated both spinach and raw tomatoes. In fact, whenever I ate them, I threw up; I couldn't help it. My mom thought I just didn't want to eat them so I was throwing up on purpose. She always yelled at me whenever I did this. I remember once we were invited to a dinner at my dad's boss's house. We were served raw cherry tomatoes. I ate everything else and moved the tomatoes around a bit. My mom says to me quietly, ""eat the tomatoes,"" and gives me the glare of death. I eat them. I am repeatedly throwing up and swallowing my vomit, trying not to open my mouth. I managed to keep it down, but I was terrified. In a similar incident, my mom bought these HUGE fish oil pills, which I had difficulty swallowing. My mom thought I just hated swallowing them, so she would always yell at me whenever I gagged. Once, she had this (not-so-)brilliant idea to break the pill and sprinkle it all over food. It tasted awful. I gagged repeatedly. Now my mom does this thing a lot when she's angry where she inhales sharply through her teeth. It usually means she's about to hit me, and in fact, I still wince whenever I hear that noise. She made it A LOT during that meal. God, it was one of the most terrifying, belly-aching experiences of my life. This happened many times with seasoned spinach, which was a family favorite (I hated it and it made me throw up). Lots of hitting and yelling associated with it. To this day, she remains convinced that I like making her angry, and that I was throwing up on purpose to make her miserable (and that all the things I do that make her angry are done specifically to make her angry, and for no other reason. 

Moving away from food: I'm eleven, my mom tries to leave. Gets to the airport before realizing she's making a mistake. Comes back.

Later: I'm twelve, my parents tell me they're going to get divorced, and that my sister and I have made them miserable by forcing them to stay together. (They're still married today). After this, they tried to pit my sister and I against the other parent. They'd always done this, just not as often.

2 years pass: Family vacation in Nevada. Dad disappears. Mom says she's going to cut off his hand when he comes back because he went gambling. He comes back hours later and is chased out by a crazy asian lady with a knife.

2 years pass (dad's moved away for work): I don't finish my AP homework 2 weeks in advance, my sister tattles on me (she always does). Mom responds with lots of yelling, hitting, and making me throw away my xbox and all its accessories (I bought them all myself). Even now, she says that she threw away nothing, and forced me to do nothing, because I threw them away by my own hand (but she admits she probably would have done something horrible to me had I refused to throw it away). She even blames me for the dent she made when she threw it against the ground. O! And let's not forget that she hit my sister when she tried to defend me. That was the last straw for me. Nobody touches my sister, especially not the crazy bitch that raised us. I grab her wrists, and say very calmly, ""Stop."" She tries to shove me over the bannister of the stairs, goes downstairs, and calls me down. She's holding a knife. She tells me to come over there so she can cut off my hand. I refuse. She puts the knife down eventually. She goes to sleep. I run away from home for the second time (I ran away before when I made my first C). I crash at a friend's house for four days before I'm asked to leave. Not a single phone call, nobody comes around looking, nothing. Nada. Zip. I call her on the fourth day. She picks up. I start,
""Hello?""
""What.""
""Sorry about not doing my homework.""
""Have you done it yet?""
""Almost, I just have to write one more page.""
""Finish it.""
""Can I come home after I do?""
""Do what you want. I don't care anymore.""
*click*
I do as she says and come home later in the day. When I do, she yells at me some more, lecturing me on responsibility, how I'm worthless, how my dreams are stupid, how I'm a failure and always will be a failure, etc. This was all very crushing.
Life goes on.

Now, I'm 19 and doing an internship. I've been living with my dad for the last couple months and I hate it. I have to cook for him, carry his shit, and do everything, while my sister is allowed to do as she pleases.

I have so many other stories. Lots about my sister and I being treated differently in the same situation, etc etc. I even introduced my parents to the concept of ""grounding"" to escape beatings...I should've just taken the beatings. My parents weren't very lenient and thought a week of grounding was too weak. I've been grounded for a year before (I got off after 8 1/2 months for good behavior). I had to earn priveleges by reading the bible, internet articles, phsychology books, self-help books, novels, when I was in elementary school. There's just so much, some of them are even laughable when I look back on them, how could adults be so immature? But this is more than enough for one post, so I think I'll stop here.
Thanks for reading. Appreciate it. You guys all deserve muffins and upvotes.

The title says it all. I am a college graduate as of December 2010 (BSc in Economics) and am unemployed. I had a decent GPA and found a job quickly once I graduated... which I quickly began to hate due to the fact that it made me miserable... and I quit shortly after a year. 

I took some time off to recharge my batteries and temporarily moved back in with my parents to get my feet back under me (I still am there). I have spent the past 1.5 months actively applying for jobs, and while I have a few leads, I'm having a hard time becoming enthusiastic about any prospects due to the negative impact my first professional position had on me and I'm really at odds as to where I want to take my life from this point forward. 

Part of me regrets the major that I chose in college... While there are opportunities available to an economics degree holder, I feel as if many of them are for general and generic ""business"" positions and I'm undecided how I feel about gaining another one of these positions. I have the fear that it will end up like my first position and I will hate my life. Part of me regrets choosing the major I did over another major in an engineering-related field or a major that could lead to some sort of healthcare-related position. 

At the same time, I look back on some of the decisions I made in college and I regret not taking hold of the opportunities available to me. I never held an internship and was never particularly close with any of my professors in college (although I was a grader and the prof has agreed to let me use him as a reference)... These are things I regret and if I had a chance to go back I would want to try to become more involved in the academic aspect of college to try to forge some of these connections. I feel like because of the fact that I never held an internship, I lost out on valuable experience that could have helped me determine what type of job I should be looking for and now it's too late. 

More than anything else in life, I just want to find a career that I'm happy with. I'm not exactly a type ""A"" person, as I'm more easygoing and relaxed (I guess type ""B""), and I really feel as if the corporate rat race may not be right for me. 

How does one know what to devote their life to and what kind of job is right for them? Should I try going back to school for a different degree? How will I even know if I'm making the right job choice? I know that there are never two of the same paths to success, but I just want to make a choice that will make me happiest in the long run.

EDIT: TL;DR - Graduated college, got a job, hated life, was miserable, and quit. Now deciding between going back to school for a different (undecided) major or getting another corporate slave job. How do people know what career is best for them? "

I am a closeted gay son to a devout Christian father. Some crazy situation happened lately and I need some help because I am so overwhelmed and I don't know what to do.

There will be a giant wall of text so please bare with me while I write the entire story.

Some background story on my family:

Ever since I could remember, my parents have been divorced because my dad cheated on my mom. When she found out, she went insane and locked my two sisters and I in the bathroom with her tried to commit suicide by ingesting pills. That failed miserably. When my dad wasn't around, she packed all our belongings and took us to Korea, where her family resided. My dad filed a police report and since then, she's been on the FBI's wanted list as a kidnapper and is unable to return to USA. This all happened when I was three years old.

Growing up, she told me that my dad died of a cancer. I always believed her and my sisters who knew everything didn't tell me a thing. We lived a slightly destitute life. My mom became an alcoholic and smoked cigarettes everyday. She did some stocks to earn money, but by the time I became ten years old, she couldn't support all three of us anymore and decided to send us back to US under our dad's care. The entire time we were going back, my mom told us that we should avenge for her and ruin dad's life because he ruined hers. I didn't really know what was going on back then so I just simply nodded and listened to her like a good kid.

When I met my dad, he was remarried to a tall Caucasian women. Listening to my mom's orders, I thought it'd be the best to show disrespect to his new wife in order to avenge for my mom. About a half year passed and she couldn't take it anymore. One night, my dad and his wife got into an argument and dad ended up sleeping on my bed. That night, my stepmom stormed into my room and argued with dad once more, I pretended to be asleep. She then proceeded to pull the blanket on the bed and tried to throw it on the floor, and I flew off the bed with the blanket. Enraged, my dad got furious at my stepmom and she left the morning after. I never saw her ever again after that.

About a half year passed and I was finally enrolled into an elementary school and I lived a fine life where dad worked all week long and came home late night. My sisters were busy adjusting to their new school life and my dad was never around, so I learned to occupy my time on the computer playing games. No kids lived in my neighborhood either for some reason so I became glued to computer games. My dad didn't approve of my behavior most of the time because he didn't see merits of computer gaming and always yelled at me. But he didn't give me other things to do- he didn't let me sign up for any sports or activities even when I asked.

Fast forward about 6 years, I began to realize that I was a homosexual man and I was extremely disgusted at myself. I couldn't accept myself and I hated myself- I resorted to slitting my wrists and spending all my time online on how to 'fix' myself. I got extremely depressed and my relationship with my dad grew worse. I think he saw my depression as unacceptable and everyday he would get upset with me for every little thing I did. My sisters went off to college and I was mostly left home everyday by myself. There would be times when my dad went off to business trips and I had to stay home alone for months at times. I was extremely lonely. One day, I swallowed a bunch of my dad's sleeping pills in hopes of killing myself, but after calling a friend and coming out to her, I saw that I wanted to live. I stuck a finger down my throat because I wanted to live again and I threw up some of the pills. Then I passed out for an entire day. And since then, I've been learning to accept myself albeit only to myself, I haven't admitted it to anyone yet at this point.

When my dad came back, I did my best to amend our relationship. But every time it improved and my I felt closer to my dad, he would push me away from him and give himself a reason to be mad at me. He would get mad at me for the way I ate my food, the friends I hung out with (all A+ students!), being glued to the computer, staying up late night, and other normal teenage behaviors. I learned to keep things to myself and stopped complaining about menial things. I learned to behave the way my dad wanted me to behave, but I was still ignored by my dad. 

He retired during my senior year and began to stay home every day. He began regularly attending churches and became a devout Christian. He'd get mad at me for not going to church with him. When I did go to church with him, he got mad because I wouldn't dress properly (shorts weren't acceptable to him) or be on my phone. I tried to get out more to avoid his presence, but he got furious if I went out too much. If I stayed home, I became a victim of his emotional abuse as well as coupe incidences of physical abuse.

I finally graduated my high school as a valedictorian (but our school had several valedictorians cuz they gave it to top xyz% of the class based on their gpa). Even then I was an eyesore to my dad and he didn't approve of my grades because I had couple Bs. I got accepted into University of Virginia, where one of my sister had attended, and I told my dad expecting him to be proud- but he just complained that everyone gets into UVA. I was disappointed since only twenty people from my school got accepted into UVA and it's considered very prestigious in my area.

When I started college, relationship between dad I grew worse because he told me I am unable to communicate well with him. He complained that I use him because I always ask him for money but I needed money to eat and get by in the school. I found a paradise in school where people accepted me for who I am and more so showed respect for me. I became very outgoing and made many friendships. Of course, my grades plummeted my first year because I'd been going out too much. My dad scolded for my behavior and called all my friends losers. 

It was around this time when he decided to kick my sister out for disobeying him. She was on her last year of school and she had to get her wisdom teeth extracted. Dad wanted her to drive while she was on anesthetics in order to return home from her surgery but she refused to drive under the influence and asked her friend to drive her. My dad got upset and cut all financial support to her. My sister and I pooled our allowance together to support my sister during her last semester and she eventually graduated and moved to Korea to reside with my mother.

That summer, Home became something of a nightmare for me. My other sister had been living home after graduating and my dad became a tyranny. The house became home to constant dissonance and fury. I got a job to stay out of the house as much as I could.

The following year is when all the shit went down. I started seeing a counselor regarding my family harmony and also seek help to accept myself. I also met a long distance boyfriend and fell in love with him. I saved up as much money as I could and visited him once a month in NY. One day, he decided to visit down but I had to pick him up from DC. I told dad that I was coming home to see the family because I miss them and I also wanted to take the car. I took the car and picked my boyfriend up, and headed down to school. We stopped at a red light and I leaned over to give him a peck on the cheek. A police officer was behind us and he stopped us when the light turned green, and he gave me a reckless driving ticket. I was appalled but I didn't know what to do, I knew I was driving under the speed limit because that's one thing I can do right. I told my dad that I'd gotten a reckless ticket and he was extremely upset. I defended myself in the court, but the judge wouldn't hear it and sentenced me guilty the second I finished speaking. I appealed the case and my dad hired a lawyer for the next hearing which is in august. Shortly after, my boyfriend and I made travel plans to Toronto to visit friends. He left for NY couple days later.

Short info about my boyfriend, he graduated from NYU that semester and got accepted into an internship in San Francisco. He insisted that we break up once he moves to San Francisco because we are at a different stage of life. Bitter but without a choice, I agreed. I figured I couldn't do anything if he already set his mind and staying together wouldn't be healthy at that point. We planned the Toronto trip to be our last trip together before we part.

I graduated 2010 with a BS in Microbiology. I had a hard time finding work due to my husband going to another country for a few months to train others. I worked a little bit as a Document Control Intern and then found out I was pregnant with my son. I never planned to be a SAHM. I was going to stay home then work part time. I am seeing people who were HORRIBLE to me getting their CLS degrees and making lots of money now while I am sitting at home wasting my life and no doubt being the loser everyone thought I was.

My son was born premature and due to health issues  we made a decision for me to stay at home as financially we are well off and my husband makes more than I could ever dream of. He works 9AM-7ish PM. Also due to doctors orders I breastfeed him on demand (3 months old) and try to avoid bottles. 

I guess I am just ranting but I am really upset and my husband just tells me ""I do love and appreciate you staying home."" Great, by the time I will re-enter the workforce my degree will be so outdated no one will look twice and grad school is out. I just don't know what to do I feel so disgusted and worthless.

My life has been nothing but bad luck and lemons and I can't seem to make lemonade anymore."

Unfortunately, I was there, so I don't know exactly what the doctor told them. But from what my two sisters and brother in law say, the doctor kept mistaking between near and far sighted, told them there's nothing wrong with her eyes and had his interns perform most of the tests and checks.

I'm in college and I intern at a financial institution in Manhattan. There's a dress code, so I was wearing a shirt and tie, slacks and wingtips. 

I have long hair, tied into a ponytail.
I also had headphones on.


It's a hot day as I'm waiting for the bus a few classes of children with teachers start walking by me. They must've been in fourth grade.

Now this is Queens, and there's ethnic children everywhere, for every ten black kids there's one white kid, four latino kids, and five brown kids.

I stand back to let them pass, and all of these kids start to pass me, I'm regular height about 5'8"". And it's like a midget army, with these dressed up in uniforms and Jordan sneakers.

They all start looking at me with these huge eyes. You have to remember these kids are from Queens, EVERYTHING that isn't New York is west, Florida, west, Maryland west, Colorado west.  All they know is Long Island and New York City. 

I grew up in the neighborhood, and kids don't learn anything, they live in the community there whole lives not knowing about the world.

As the last kid past me I asked one of the teachers if she was lost, there's pretty much nothing but highway next to the airport.

She replies, ""no, we're just having a fire drill.""

And then the kids turn back, they have never seen someone wear a tie outside of a wedding much less full business attire.

As they pass, some of the kids high five me. One kid holds his hand out and I give him dap, he looks at his friend and goes "" I told you I was gonna get dap from that guy."" 

One of the kids comment on my headphones, saying ""Awesome headphones man!"" 

A girl exclaims, ""Oh my God! Look at his hair! It's sooooo nice!""

A few of the girl wave to me, while all of them smile and say hi to me. 

""Hi!"" ""Hello!"" ""Hey!"" ""You're so cool!"" 

I felt like a rock star.

It was awesome, I don't know if they thought I was a pilot, a drug dealer, or a business man, but I hope that these kids saw that even in their world, they can become something.

That made my entire day, and I usually hate kids!

I feel I could have read a rudimentary electronics book from amazon.com in a few weeks and be where I'm at now. 

My biggest concern is finding a job. Like I said, I graduate this November. I'm going to be moving from the Boston area to Fort Lauderdale, because I hate life up here and I've lived down there before. 

All of the jobs I've searched online have very stringent minimum requirements. In many cases, 5+ or 10+ years experience, proficiency in certain programming languages, very specialized experience (I mean, how many people have 10 years of Airbua A320 avionic experience?), a PE license, etc. 

I have none of those. No experience. No specialization. No programming knowledge aside from one C programming class I took. No internship... 

I got into Florida Atlantic University's graduate program for MSEE, but I already have a HUGE student loan debt. 

I'm moving to Florida December 1st no matter what. Can anyone give me any guidance? Grad school? Try to find a job? Become an Air Force officer?  I'm feeling pretty pessimistic right now..."

I accepted an internship in Massachusetts for this summer back in May. I am originally from New York, and my girlfriend and I both go to school in Upstate NY. We have been together for just over two years and for the majority of the time it has been great for the both of us. I am living with a friend during my internship. Two weeks into the internship, on a Saturday, my girlfriend sent me a picture of herself in her car. I did not think it was a great picture and I told her because I am always completely honest with her. I then started to think of random negative thoughts such as “What if I don’t think she’s attractive anymore?”, “What if I don’t love her the same when I get back after the summer?”, and “What if something changes between us?” The next week I was alone in this huge house for the whole week in the middle of nowhere and these thoughts eventually consumed me. I was having a hard time functioning at work and I really had a lot of anxiety and was somewhat depressed about all these negative feelings. I have had obsessive thoughts before; honestly, I believe that I have a form of OCD known as Purely-Obsessional OCD. I put a link to the Wikipedia page at the bottom of this post. I have experienced instances of this OCD, and am dealing with the relationship substantiation aspect currently. The thoughts were so obsessive that it almost seemed like I wanted to be broken up with my girlfriend, and I even suggested taking a break twice because I did not think it was fair that I was dealing with this while she was being so supportive to me. I was very communicative to her throughout this entire process. The break was not what I wanted, and just made things all the more difficult because I know deep down I want to be with her and work things out. I am just a little confused on why I have been having negative thoughts about us randomly. Prior to having the initial negative thoughts, I was happy with the entire relationship and had no problems with us. I want to go back to how I felt at the beginning of the summer. I do feel very alone and isolated down here in Massachusetts. I am leaning towards thinking that this is the main cause as to why I am somewhat depressed and am having anxiety about this. If anyone has any inputs or similar experiences I would love to hear them. I apologize if I have not been clear enough or am leaving out any details. Thank you to everyone who reads and may offer some help.

I graduated in May with a BS in Computer Science.  Since I graduated in May, I have been applying to 5-7 places every week. I have applied to over 100 places, which isn't that many at all but I usually take some time to apply to places that feel like a good fit for me instead of just blindly applying to every job I find.  Should I be applying to more places, even ones I might not be qualified for?

For the most part, I have been finding jobs via linkedin, indeed.com, dice.com, and my schools job board.  For almost all of these I am sending an email with a cover letter and my resume attached.

I have been getting some interviews, maybe 1 every week though all of them have been phone or skype interviews.  I tend to do well in interviews except for algorithms questions.  I try my best to talk through my problem solving process but I tend to blank out and then have the solution come to me the second the interview is over which is really frustrating. So far I have only had one offer and it was only for 45k, which I am going to reject because that is way too low.

What else should I be doing?  Is sending emails a waste of time? I do a little bit of programming in my free time and I have a few things I can show but its nothing that special.  I could probably find some open source project to contribute to but I have no idea what I want to do or what is going to help me the most.  My specialization for my degree was in computer graphics so I have tried applying to game development jobs.  I have built a few games as part of my undergraduate course work which I show to them, but I haven't gotten interviews with any game development studios which I applied to.  On the other hand, I hear so many negative things about the game industry and I don't know if its for me.  I just don't care about video games anymore as well.

Most places that have rejected me and gave a reason said that I just didn't have enough experience.  I have been working part time as a web developer for 6 months so I have something but I don't really want to do web development.  I also worked as a intern at a pretty big company, but it was such a terrible experience that I wouldn't want to pursue a career there. 

tl:dr basically, I feel like I am at square one and I am not sure what I should be doing.  I keep applying to places, getting an interviews here and there, but I am getting no where.  I am not sure what I want to do with CS or if I even want to do software development.  I feel stuck because I have this degree and its my best chance at finding a job and i'm getting no where.

Edit:  Thanks for everyone's input I really appreciate it.  I have a lot to think about it seems.

He gave his entire inheritance from his father to charity.

Mitt Romney is one of the wealthiest self-made men in our
country but has given more back to its citizens in terms of
money, service and time than most men.

And in 2011 Mitt Romney gave over $4 million to charity,
almost 19% of his income.... Just for comparison purposes,
Obama gave 1% and Joe Biden gave $300 or .0013%.

Mitt Romney is Trustworthy:

He will show us his birth certificate

He will show us his high school and college transcripts.

He will show us his social security card.

He will show us his law degree.

He will show us his draft notice.

He will show us his medical records.

He will show us his income tax records.

He will show us he has nothing to hide.

Mitt Romney's background, experience and trustworthiness
show him to be a great leader and an excellent citizen for
President of the United States.

You may think that Romney may not be the best representative
the Republicans could have selected. At least I know what
religion he is, and that he won't desecrate the flag, bow
down to foreign powers, or practice fiscal irresponsibility.
I know he has the ability to turn this financial debacle
that the current regime has gotten us into. We won't like
all the things necessary to recover from this debt, but
someone with Romney's background can do it. But, on the
minus side, He never was a ""Community Organizer"", never took
drugs or smoked pot, never got drunk, did not associate with
communists or terrorists, nor did he attend a church whose
pastor called for God to damn the US."""
wgy0p,2,2012-07-12,I work for a state-wide candidate. There was a donation from a man out of state for a fairly large sum of money.

I was sorting through donation receipts when I found a donation for a large sum ($10k) to the candidate from out of state. The donor's name and employer were listed but no other information.

Would anyone more familiar with state politics know why such a thing would happen and/or the legality of accepting such donations?

Something strange is going on here."

I am looking for fellow redditors who would be willing to introduce me to businesses in the DC/VA/MD area. I’m currently a college intern with the company AFLAC (yes, the duck company) and work at one of the top branches in the area. However, I am looking for all the help I can get. I grew up overseas and a lot of the other interns have a lot of contacts in the area through family friends, classmates and everyday life I guess. I don’t.
I hesitate to give out more specific information but feel free to send me a PM and I can tell you more about what I am doing and answer any questions you may have about myself or anything else really (the money, the process, all details really). The gist of the job would basically be to pay you to introduce me to business owners (businesses of any size) with the purpose of using your introduction to set up a meeting. No other work is required on your part – just getting me into a meeting with the business owner. A proverbial foot in the door. There is more to the process on my part and I welcome any questions you could have to make sure you are comfortable with everything, etc. In the end it’s a good opportunity to make money for both of us (it is a partnership) and, for me at least, to meet new people in the area ☺.
	Additionally, if anyone has any suggestions about how to create a network in the area I welcome it. Any help I can get is appreciated.

""Epicbot!"" my mother called""The Professor wants you in his lab.""
Yup, not creepy at all, but I had no plans for the day, so I went anyways.
""Ah yes, Epicbot, there you are."" Professor Elm continued ""I need you to do an errand for me.""
Fuck. I just woke up and don't have energyto do anything, but whatever.
""K, I'll do it, what do I have to do?"" I asked Professor Elm
""Well, take one of my starter Pokemon and go see what Mr.Pokemon wants.He says it's an important discovery, but bring back the starter.""
There was three Pokemon at the table-Totodile, Chikorita, and Cyandaquil.For me the obvious choice was Totodile. 
After that I exited the Professor and I exchanged numbers then I went to Mr.Pokemon's house to find out it was just an egg and met Professor Oak.
Elm soon called and told me to come quickly because somebody had stolen one of his starter Pokemon.On my way back I met a boy with a Chikorita just like Elm had, but I beat him easily.
""Asreal that's my name"" the kid said ""and don't you forget that!""
Back at Elm's lab there was an Officer Jenny that described the person I had just fought and asked if anyone had seen it and I replied.
""Yeah he was just at Cherrygrove and his name is Asreal.""
The Officer Jenny then thanked me and left. After I went to my house to restfor a while and then my father woke me up.
""epicbot...Epicbot...Epicbot!"" my father shouted in my ear. I yelled "" Holy Shit!"" as I fell of of our couch.
""Time for you to get your first Pokemon!"" Dad told me in a very excited voice.
We both got dressed in our Trainer Gear and went outside. My dad had taught me the basics from when I was 5-8 and got a bit advanced from age 8 to a couple days before today. He told me that if I wanted to catch every Pokemon I had to lower their HP, make them have a status problem, and have a lot of Pokeballs.
""Alright son are you ready?"" My dad asked me, yes I know a stupid question because, well who wouldn't, but I answered anyways.
""Yeah, you know it!"" I answered ecstatically.
As soon as we stepped into the grass a Lv.5 Porygon jumped out at us and it began. My father sent out his prized Pokemon Rick the Scizor.
""Go, Rick use False Swipe!""
*Wild Porygon used Tackle*
I could see my Father's Pokemon Scizor was very strong because the Porygon's Tackle had barely affected Rick.
""Go Pokeball.""
*click click click*
""Hey, there you go that's all that's to it, would you like to nickname the Porygon?"" My dad asked me.
"" Yes, Duckbot."" I answered *giggle* ""It's gonna be just me and you all the way! We might even beat the Elite 4 and Lance."" I embraced Duckbot and said my good byes to everyone while I started my journey. 
I soon got to Violet City, the first place we went to was Sprout Tower which we swept pretty fast between trips to the Pokemon Center. Saw Asreal at the top fighting Elder Li, he left before I could punch his Fucking lights out. Elder Li was fairly easy, so next was Falkner.
**Enter Major Grindage Mode!!!**
""So, you're here challenge me?"" Falkner asked.
""Well, yeah"" I told Falkner ""why else would-""
""Well it doesn't matter because I have my dad's cherished-""
""SHUT THE FUCK UP BITCH!!! Go Duckbot!""
""Go Pidgey!"" 
*Duckbot used Psybeam* **OHKO**
""Fuck! Go Pidgeotto!""
*Pidgeotto used Quick Attack*
*Duckbot used Pybeam* 
*Duckbot used Psybeam*
*Pidgeotto used Roost*
""Fuck, he can heal.""
*Duckbot used Psybeam*
*Pidgeotto used Roost *
""This shit is getting fucking annoying. Use all your power in one hit Duckbot""
*Duckbot used Psybeam*
*Falkner was defeated*
""Here, you deserve this...Twerp.""
*Obtained the Zephyr Badge*
Once I thanked Falkner for the match and exited I got a call from Elm to go to the Pokemart. When I got there I found an intern from Elm's lab there holding an egg and wanted me to hold it but I told him he should give it to my mom, the once proud owner of the Sinnoh Daycare, because she knows how to take care of eggs and Pokemon of every type.

Today I was replacing some of the light bulbs at work, and there ended up being one that was out in the office of the president of the company. I knew most of the higher ups owned guns and hunted, so while making small talk I mentioned that I had gotten my FOID card yesterday. He gets a big smile on his face and talks about guns for a little bit. I leave and go back to work. He comes to where I was working and showed me the gun he has at the office. We talk a little more about guns and how I know very little to nothing about them (I have read the FAQ here about thats the extent of my knowledge) he leaves again. I see him in the hallway and he motions me to follow him and he tells me we're going to go gun shopping so I know what to look for. 

So we leave work for a few hours and he just explains guns to me, helps me choose what to buy, offers to take me shooting, says he'll bring me a trigger guard for when I do buy my gun, and overall we ended up becoming friends because of guns. It was awesome to see the good side of guns as soon as I become legally able to handle them, especially living in Illinois where they are demonized.

tl;dr: Me and the president of my company became buds and went gun shopping because I mentioned them in passing to him.

Also I think the my first gun is going to be a Ruger 22/45. I don't need it for defense of my home, I just want to get good at shooting and don't want to be broke. Just thought you guys might enjoy this story."

One of my groups project is to is to develop a solution that raises awareness for a foster care group known as Koinonia. We plan to use Social Media to spread Koinonia's name. We want to seek the out supporters and volunteers by touching on the emotions of the public (similar to the ""Kony"" approach). 

We have created some accounts for Koinia and if you can help us get rolling by following the twitter account, liking the facebook page, and upvoting this posts, you will really help me and my group by showcasing the amazing power of the internet and social media (especially reddit!). 

Twitter: https://twitter.com/koinonia13
Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/pages/Koinonia/403706429664501

Here is our problem statement and solution if you are interested:
Project: Second Chance
Koinonia is a program that provides teenagers with dysfunctional families a new hope. It is a program that

“Lack of awareness and knowledge in the community regarding the second chances provided to children from dysfunctional backgrounds has resulted in negative perceptions toward these children, which has lead to reduced opportunities and higher criminal activity.""

Our goal is to improve the awareness in the community regarding the programs like Koinonia. We hope to enhance and promote the image of Koinonia by spreading the name to as many people as possible through the use of social media.

Getting the information out is not the only thing we are focusing on, we want to prove to the people like you that by giving support to programs like Koinonia, they are making a difference in their community.
    In order to prove that the community is affected in a good way through programs like Koinonia, I am now going to explain exactly what our plans are:

    #1. We plan to engage with the Law Enforcement and have their involvement as crucial
    Law Enforcement is important in our planning because we all agree that they are the ones who deal with children from dysfunctional families.
    Police will give the program credibility in regards to the program’s role in helping the communities.

We have seen the difference in the lives of the foster kids that have went through the Koinonia program. Koinonia

With people having faith in the program, our next step would be to make important ties with local schools and counselors for volunteering opportunities. Our main focus is not only to give the community a positive perception toward the program but also to engage them in contributing toward the betterment of not only the children but also the society.

Our objective is to get the people involved in changing lives of children throughout the community so they can help these kids succeed in life.

We are confident to receive positive feedback from the law enforcement because programs similar to Koinonia, for example Child Protective Services, are heavily supported "
wgux2,2,2012-07-12,Relapse. ,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/wgux2/relapse/,"Hey RA,

This isn't the first time I've reached out to you. I've been amazed in the past of the power of advice, understanding, and direction strangers on the internet can provide. I'm a 22 year old male. The girl in question here is 21. Here's the condensed version of the past three years I've known her:

**Sophomores in University**: We fall madly in love. Spend virtually all of our time together. 

**Juniors in College**: Still madly in love, so we get an apartment together (bold move for a college couple). 

**Summer after Junior Year**: I take an internship in London and she decides that she's going to study abroad for the first semester of senior year. I go to London. Distance is too much for her so she breaks up with me. I spiral... get into a pretty deep loneliness, exacerbated by being in a country in which I know no one. 

**Senior Year**: I get back from London. There's 10 days we have together before she leaves for London. I find myself groveling... desperation takes hold but she resists. She wants to go abroad and be free. I'm pretty down a lot of the semester.

**Second Semester Senior Year**: She comes home from London. We start hanging out again, taking things slowly. Take a trip to NYC for New Years together to visit some friends. Ball dropping... 3... 2... 1... we kiss for the first time in six months and I'm fucking flying. We continue to take it slow for the rest of the semester, until we're full on dating again by graduation. 

**Graduation**: I didn't have a job lined up upon graduation, and the uncertainty of everything was really taking its toll on me. She had a job lined up, and both my roommates had started a business that was gaining a lot of traction. I developed some serious insecurities because of this, and withdrew from the relationship. I became obsessed with job hunting and solidifying my ""career"", to the point where three weeks ago I told her I have to break it off with her. I thought she was hindering my success. 

**Present**: I almost immediately regretted doing this, but now she's gone. I've got my career a bit in line now and I've worked through a lot of the insecurities I had around graduation. The last thing she told me after I broke up with her was that she was shattered and that she'll be subconsciously waiting for me to come around. She knew I had some things to work out; however, I read a post on her blog the other day that basically says that she's happy right now. She's gaining independence and it feels good. I also know she's been going out a lot.

Sorry, this ended being not that condensed. 


**So my question**, RA, is how to I reestablish contact with her? How do I let her know that my anxiety and distance surrounding graduation was just a temporary sort of existential crisis and that I feel a lot better about my future now and thus my ability to contribute to the relationship? I want her back, but I don't want to resort to the same groveling I resorted to a year ago. I'd appreciate any thoughts or advice :)"

My lease on my Apartment was up in July and my current ASM contract ends at the end of July.  I'm currently house-sitting but I have very little tying me to the very expensive city of San Francisco.  I have relatives in Seattle as well as a man in Olympia who means a lot to me.  At first we were planning on reuniting in a year after he graduates, but with my current state of flux, I'm inclined to say fuck it and move up to stay with my relatives in Washington while looking for work and housing.

I've focused a lot on Electrics, Lighting Design, and Stage Management with some Directing and Carpentry/Stitching experience.  I'm aware that most large house internships will be filled already but I'd kind of rather jump in and get my feet wet with over hire and stage-managing smaller house anyway.  I have 10 weeks towards Equity Membership as part of the EMC program and would ideally love to acquire more, but would really just love to pad my resume with any work as I transition from the academic to the professional world.

It's a long shot, I know, but Reddit sometimes works miracles.  Do any Sea-Tac techies have words of wisdom on the network up there?  The cost of living down here makes me nervous to take unpaid work, but I feel like I could actually afford to work for stipend pay up north as long as I also picked up some sort of over hire work or day job.  And like, I said, I have relatives in the area who could help me through the transition.  Am I crazy?  I've always loved the city but I don't know much about the theatre scene."

We have never  been late or problematic paying the monthly payments, Dad has a pension and SS that more than covered monthly bills, but the last time he went from the nursing home to living at home again (which only lasted 2 weeks) he kicked out the two men I had living in and maintaining the house.

""In depth press release""

Talawa Games and Teotl Studios bring intricate puzzles and a unique, atmospheric world with Unmechanical.

STOCKHOLM, Swe. – 11 July 2012 – Today, indie developers Talawa Games and Teotl Studios are thrilled to announce the puzzle adventure game Unmechanical, to be released August 8th 2012 for PC – and a few weeks later – for iOS.

Unmechanical is an award-winning 2.5D side-scroller which combines tricky puzzle solving, alluring exploration, and an engrossing atmosphere. The game had humble beginnings as a student project and since then both game and team has grown. “Unmechanical has been about taking on something for real and working our fingers to the bone to get it done. It’s our hopes and ambitions combined into this very personal, unique, and awesome adventure that’s crafted with lots of love.”Said Marko Permanto, project lead for the Unmechanical team.

Unmechanical begins with a twist of fate as you’re spirited away by a network of coiled pipes into a mysterious underworld. You find yourself in a strange environment that pulsates from mechanic and organic machinery alike, and your journey to freedom begins. Flying freely through the odd and fantastic surroundings, a powerful tractor beam lets you pick up objects and interact with the world. 

Your quest for freedom requires you to solve a great variety of puzzling challenges, and while it’s easy to pick up and play, later challenges may prove very difficult indeed. On your adventure you might also begin to understand what it all means–The underworld may be more than it seems, the fateful descent more than just chance, and you might not be entirely alone after all…

About Talawa Games:
Unmechanical started in early 2011 as a student project at Futuregames, a game development education in Stockholm, Sweden. The Unmechanical team has doubled in size since the beginning, but has always been about a tightly knit team that collaborates rather than delegates. Most work has been done on the students’ free time, both during school and the following internships when the team was spread out across Europe. About half the Unmechanical team joined additional enthusiasts from the school and started Talawa Games to work on new projects. The new studio is hardworking, multi-talented, and passionate, which they hope will shine through with their games. Talawa is from Jamaican patois and means strong or sturdy, often used in the sense of “small but strong”. Visit the Unmechanical team and Talawa Games at http://talawagames.com/

I picked up vim b/c I was working as a government intern doing ASP web-dev with `notepad.exe` and got tired of having to hit the down arrow 87 lines when ASP spat back ""Syntax error, line 87"".

I've e-mailed Dr. Bullard (NCSU's director of undergraduate studies in chemical and biomolecular engineering) about these same things but it's the summer and I don't even know if she would reply even if she got it. We're in a pickle, and not a good kind. Because I like pickles. This is a bad pickle that we are in, and we could use some help. I really don't know what else to ask for.

EDIT: So co-ops are out of it, I guess I need to know if there's any good local companies or pharmacies that she can look to for internships or part time work."

She was unable to find an internship during her final semesters at school. I moved out to live with her and now I'm having trouble finding work, hours at current job cut and even if those were not cut, I wouldn't be making enough. So there's like dozens of potential solutions to the problems we're facing, but most of the smaller things are in our hands to figure out. The harder stuff? We could use some help with.  
  
If she can find a job in her field, that would be great. I need help finding good places that have internships (that preferably pays).

wgfz4,46,2012-07-12,"He's telling me I'm abusive, how do I know if I really am? ",amianabuser,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/wgfz4/hes_telling_me_im_abusive_how_do_i_know_if_i/,"Throwaway account, but I'm a long term redditor.

My boyfriend and I are both 25. We've been dating for just over 3 years. Most of the time things are great, but the last few months have been rough. His depression and anxiety have been taking over our lives, in my opinion. He says I emotionally abuse him.  

Last night things came to a head. We started arguing because he was saying I refused to recognize my privilege from being pretty, and that I had to realize the world treated me differently that it did other people. I didn't deny the power that looks have in our society, but I said my feelings were hurt that he was acting like much of my success was from how I looked instead of my hard work.

The fight escalated and I tried to leave the room. He blocked the door with his body. I told him he was acting like a crazy person and I just needed to get away for a minute to cool down. 

He said I enjoyed breaking him down, that I was a cruel person who got pleasure from his pain and that I never admitted I was wrong.

Then he said ""Do you even love me anymore? Say one thing you love about me.""

I was so upset I said I couldn't think of any, which was wrong of me I know. I do really love him, but my mind was drawing a blank at that moment.

When I said I couldn't think of a reason I loved him, he freaked out, started throwing things, hitting himself, and whipping the towels and blankets in the room around. He collapsed on the floor and sobbed, saying I always had to win at any cost, that I didn't care about him at all, and that I did things purposefully to hurt him.

At that point I was cold and detached. I asked him to leave again. He wouldn't so I picked up a magazine and started reading. After I ignored him, he lunged across the bed and ripped the magazine out of my hands. Then he started pulling the mattress off the bed while I was on it. 

At that point I felt physically threatened and I was sitting on the floor in the corner of my room, crying while the dogs sat protectively in front of me. 

He said ""Just keep crying your crocodile tears"" and then lay on the floor hyperventilating.

We ended up calming down and at that point it was like three, so we went to sleep. The dogs made sure to be on either side of me on the bed. When we woke up I apologized for saying I didn't know why I loved him, and listed several reasons why I did. Then I asked him to apologize for getting violent. He said he wasn't violent last night.

That made me upset again so we started arguing again, and he said that everything he did last night was because I drove him to it. He said I got pleasure from making him hysterical.

I really don't try to make him cry or get upset when we fight. I DON'T want to make him sad, or break him down. I know I don't want that. Is it possible to be emotionally abusive without knowing it?

As I write this all out I have to say I feel like if anyone's abusive it's him, but I don't want to not take responsibility for my part in our problems. I tend to be cool, calm, and collected in a fight and I always have sometime to say  which I know can drive people crazy. My tendency is also to leave when things get heated, just for a few minutes to calm down, and he hates that.

So what do you think r/relationships. I am an abuser and I just don't realize it? Should I walk away from this person? Demand counseling? I've been crying all day so just internet hugs would be nice (thankfully I have today off from my internship). 

TL:DR Boyfriend of 3 years is accusing me of trying to  make him sad, and getting enjoyment out of his sorrow. I'm really not trying to make him scream, lash out, or throw things. Is it possible I'm an abuser and I don't know it?"

",[deleted],democrats,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/wgd6x/reddit_i_was_just_nominated_to_serve_as_a_page_at/,"Hey fellow Democrats! My name is Jordan and I've been working as an Intern for the Democratic Party since last spring and finally all of the hard work has paid off! Myself and one other of my fellow interns were just presented with a nomination to attend the National Convention in Charlotte this September! I'm a Political Science/Pre-Law major and this has been a dream of mine for as long as I can remember.

There's only one problem - the trip is going to cost around $3,000 between airfare, hotels, registration fees, etc. 

I'm a 21 year old college student (the first in my family) and because of my rigorous school schedule I've had to rely on student loans to support myself financially since I began my education. There is just no way I can afford this trip by myself. 

Thankfully, the amazing executive team at my state's Democratic Office has set up a fund to help send me and my fellow intern (another full time student who is raising five children) to the convention this fall! I am so thankful for them and for the opportunity they've given me. 

I don't even know if this is allowed or if I'm out of bounds for asking, but, Reddit, if any of you are able to donate to help send us to Charlotte, I can't even describe how thankful we both would be. Also, if any of you (by chance) have ever attended a National Convention as a Page before and have any knowledge or wisdom to pass on to us, feel free to PM me, since neither of us are sure what to expect at all at this point! 

Here is the link to our fundraiser: https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/charlotte4karen_jordan?refcode=jordan

Having spent my entire life in an extremely conservative state, I know to appreciate every chance I get to encounter another Democrat. Thank you guys so much, I speak for myself and my fellow page-hopeful when I say how grateful we are for the supportive community of Democrats in our country.

1)	Prepare. I was given the job today, to start on Monday. How can I ease my transition to my new schedule?


2)	How can I stay sane/awake during my shift? I’m the summer intern on nights, so I’m not going to be in high pressure environments, but I still want to do a good job/ not be found asleep in my chair in the morning.

3)	I have a planned long weekend meet-up with friends in a few weeks. It doesn’t conflict with the hours of the factory, but will I be able to actually attend, when everyone else is on a normal schedule. Is it worth me even going?

4)	Any other tips people can give me?

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[Where do you stand on in on the whole pro life/choice argument?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cmoxn?context=5)|I definitely understand why someone would be against abortion, but I just don't sympathize with them trying to control the choice. It's hard for someone to be forced into an abortion, that's why we have a solo counseling session with them. But after working with so many different women, I can clearly see how abortions being legal affects their lives. Shit happens, people get pregnant when they didn't want to, and not everyone can handle going through a pregnancy.
 |But yes, I understand their argument, I just think their argument is a personal choice, not a political ideology.
[*""forced into an abortion""*  For medical reasons I'm guessing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5d01tj?context=5)|No I mean being forced by someone to have abortion. We don't allow any one other than he patient in counseling sessions to ensure that she is making the decision herself and no one is forcing her.
[But whose choice does that become? Shouldn't women and men be held responsible for their promiscuity?  Would you say that allowing abortions leads to more irresponsible behavior? The child certainly doesn't get to choose whether or not it gets to be born. If the child had a choice I would think it would choose life over not being born at all. People use the argument that a fertilized embryo is not the beginning of life but if you were to live it unharmed would it not develop to the stage of life we consider the ""beginning"". I believe in pro choice and that a woman should be allowed to do whatever she wants with her body, but for me the problem becomes when does it become her body and not another human's body?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cpvxu?context=5)|Yeah it's a hard debate. I don't think it adds to promiscuity, that's similar to arguing that teaching comprehensive sex ed makes more high schoolers have sex--when statistics show pushing abstinence leads to more teen pregnancy. I think abortions is one of those things that people change their minds when they are put in the situation, a lot of women were pro life, but that changes when they accidentally get pregnant. Also, abortions are pretty expensive (obviously cheaper than raising a child though) so it's not something anyone really uses for birth control, at least I haven't come across that.
[What's the hardest type of situation you've had to work with? Like do you get young patients or the woman trying to keep it from her abusive husband, that kind of thing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cpvps?context=5)|My hardest situation was a woman that had to abort because she was recently diagnosed with cancer. Had she been healthy, she would have kept it, but she need chemo and it's not something you should do when you're pregnant. I also worked with a women in an abusive relationship, it was very violent. Fortunately her partner was in jail (last I heard) so she is safe.
[Do you ever run into past patients in situations elsewhere? How is that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cpvps?context=5)|The city I live in is fairly small, so yes I have run into some of my patients. It's weird. I just let them lead on whether or not they want to acknowledge me. 
[I recently spoke with someone who cited the protestors yelling at/doing things to her as one of her fears about going to a clinic. I had no idea how to respond as I can imagine that would be extremely traumatizing. What advice would you give someone who had similar fears?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5d65cq?context=5)|Put on a game face. Or smile and wave. You don't have to talk to them, and if the parking lot is privately owned by the clinic, they cannot approach you. The best thing is just not engaging them, they are anticipating a reaction from you, and giving them that makes them satisfied.
[Thank you for doing this AMAA. I am quite fascinated with all of this. What is it like to accompany someone during the procedure? Was it difficult for you at first? Do women cry often? Do you still accompany the woman in the room if the father is there? And do you often get women who have no choice but to abort (i.e. medical reasons\)? If so, do their emotional reactions differ from those who are choosing to abort for other reasons?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cph18?context=5)|So many questions! Firstly, yes it was pretty weird at first to go into procedures with women. I trained a lot by shadowing other counselors though, so that actually became the part I caught on to faster. When they have fathers or friends I still accompany them, but in those cases it's more to assist the doctor and make sure the patient is doing fine. We have an optional anti anxiety med if they are super nervous for the procedure, and if they choose to be doped up, it's important to have someone there checking their vitals that knows what the side affects are.
 |Some women cry. It can be pretty painful for some people, everyone's bodies are different like that so we can't really predict what their pain levels will be. But it is a pretty weird experience to have someone prodding around your uterus when you are conscience, not to mention all the varying levels of emotions they have on just making their decision.
 |I have had a few patients that really had no choice. Those are by far the most sad. I had a patient that had been trying to get pregnant for years, she finally got pregnant right after finding out she had cancer. Those patients have it hard, especially if they wanted children. We usually recommend regular therapy after the procedure for those patients. We also had someone call us from a local Catholic hospital; she was on the waiting list for an organ donation and she accidentally got pregnant, you can't get organs donated when you are pregnant and the hospital she was at refused to give her one. There was nothing we could do, since it's not our hospital. 
[I've always wondered...what's the actual process of getting an abortion like? Is there anesthetic? Do the patients feel sore afterwards? Does it take long? I'm sorry if these are ignorant/already answered questions.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cqsca?context=5)|The process nowadays is mostly suction. So it's a process of dilation and then using a small suction device to remove everything. There is also a medical abortion that is an option when the gestational age is 8 weeks or under, that is basically a mixture of meds that induce a miscarriage. For procedures that we do, there is an option for anti anxiety medication given through IV and we have an anti pain med used for severe pain, which is pretty rare, would be more for someone that has an ovarian cyst. A whole procedure (at my clinic) is about 15 minutes, including set up and confirming that he abortion was complete. Those all change though the farther along in pregnancy you are, I think it's an overnight hospitalization thing if you go farther than what we do.
[Can anything go wrong with it , is it 100% safe or can the ""Abortee"" suffer some horrible death or altercations later in life?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5dfj63?context=5)|I know in the state I'm in, we've never had a death since abortion has been legal. There are always possibilities of side affects though. Like someone could have an allergic reaction to the numbing agent we use on their cervix. When we did emergency response training, it was all like worst case scenarios; like someone shoots up with heroin, opts for the anti anxiety med we can do, and that mixed could make an overdose. After the procedure, women have specific care instructions; take all the antibiotics we give them, no sex, no tampons, etc. Those instructions are to prevent infection, which more than anything would be the only thing that could potentially cause severe side affects. If you get an infection and let it go untreated, it can turn in pelvic inflammatory disease, so it's similar to not treating an STD. PID can cause infertility and I think death if it goes untreated, however if women are following our instructions, their chances of an infection are very low and if they show any signs of infection we have them call us and we will treat it before it turns into PID. I've never had anyone even get an infection though.
[As a counselor do you have many women who regret their decision later? how do you help the cope?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5co2no?context=5)|I actually don't work as much with aftercare patients. We definitely have people that do that at our clinic though. I have honestly never heard of anyone regretting it more than ""I wish I didn't get pregnant"" though. Most women feel more relieved than anything. Of course, if someone is mentally unstable before the abortion, they will most likely still be unstable after the procedure. 
[Other than obvious mental instability, is there anything else that would come out during a counseling session that would indicate that a patient would have emotional or psychological fallout after the procedure?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5d619q?context=5)|Well most women will just tell me if they are worried of how they will do after. We always discuss how they think they will feel after the procedure. Obviously if someone is in an abusive situation we make sure that they have a restraining order or something to keep them safe.
[So theres no sense of regret at all for most, its just completely casual to them :/  thats sad.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cubeo?context=5)|Or it's a good thing because they thought it out before they did it. Abortions (and unplanned pregnancies in general) have actually gone down in the last year or so in the US.
[My question: Are there steps that you take with minors who are getting an abortion that are vastly different from an adult?  If so, what are they?  How do you deal with minors in general?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cr6y4?context=5)|Hope that answered it for you! Supportive partners are the best.
[*At 8 weeks it is not a fetus!! It's still an embryo.*  Who are you trying to convince, me or you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cwz5v?context=5)|I just hate that propaganda says it is. Science says otherwise.
[I am 100% pro-choice, but kind of curious: What do they do with the fetus after they abort it? Has anyone requested it be buried? Why can't they put someone under for an abortion? How painful are they? How many people were using BC and had it fail? That is my nightmare.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cuoej?context=5)|Fetuses are sent away with human waste and needles, you know the red boxes they have at doctor's offices. It's currently illegal to send fetuses in for stem cell research, because that would make it beneficial to abortion clinics and it would look like we were encouraging abortions in order to make more for stem cells. I've never had anyone request to bury it, but I'm sure it's been done before.
 |Putting someone under for any procedure adds a significant amount of risk. It's a 15 minute procedure, and one of the most common outpatient surgeries. I believe in later pregnancy abortions they do need to be put under, but I have no experience with that.
 |It's crazy how many people get pregnant when they are on birth control. It's definitely made me more paranoid about it. For the most part it's user error though, like taking a pill late or something. Specifically progesterone only pills need to be on a tighter schedule for taking pills, that kind is fairly common for someone to pregnant on. It really kills me when someone comes in that got pregnant with an IUD in, those are so affective, but shit still happens.
[How much fetal matter is there for a 6 week pregnancy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5dsp96?context=5)|Very little. For pregnancies that young, the lab tech looks for the embryotic sack, which is very small, to confirm the pregnancy was terminated.
[As someone who fully defends a woman's right to get an abortion, a counter argument I hear sometimes is that people use abortion clinics as their form of birth control instead of condoms, the pill, etc.  My question is: do you see many/any returning patients?  Do you think this counter argument holds water? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5czdhb?context=5)|No I think that argument is pretty dumb. Just logically speaking, who would want to spend $600+ every month or every few months on birth control? Abortions aren't  cheap. Usually if someone comes in for a repeated abortion it's birth control failure or they had an abortion at 16 but now they are in their 30's. And no one is comfortable wih someone putting all that equipment in their vagina, not a common birth control. 
[What is the youngest person you've counselled?  How did that go? Was it especially emotionally draining on you or them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5coqro?context=5)|My youngest patient was 16. Surprisingly though, in my experience, the younger women handle abortions much better than older women. In general, younger girls more willingly open up with me in counseling sessions and handle the actual procedure much better. Most older women (I'm talking 30's ish) don't really open up and are more upset with and during the procedure. It could also be that they don't want to open up to me about their abortions because I do look pretty young. I've probably only counseled women under 20 around 4 times, so it's actually more rare than people think. And I think all of them came in with their moms too.
[Have the protesters ever done something really bad, or gone too far? Have women ever entered crying or upset over what the protesters have been saying?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cqbly?context=5)|Not since I have worked here. Our clinic was bombed about 20 years ago, it was on a weekend though so no one was hurt. But there were 3 years after that that there was no clinic because they had to come up with the money to rebuild. 
[Odd - did they not have insurance?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cwnjk?context=5)|Oh I never really thought of that. From what I know, they were renting space for the clinic before, but after that they had to build their own because no one would rent to them.
[Do you ever feel like you are doing something wrong? Not necessarily the actual abortion, but like if it isn't right for that person to get one in your opinion?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cmph4?context=5)|I have actually sent women home if I don't think they can handle an abortion. My clinic can do procedures up to 16 weeks gestation, most women find out they are pregnant at about 8 weeks. So if I feel like someone is indecisive about it, I'll tell them to go home and think about it more. The counseling session is there so that we can be sure women are confident in their decision. And most women have already thought about it a lot before even coming into the clinic. Only twice have I had to repeatedly go back and forth with a patient about whether or not they want it, which sucks because it's not my choice, but sometimes they just need someone to tell them it's okay.
[How often have you done an abortion at 16 weeks?is that more disturbing... Yikes :(     ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cspu8?context=5)|Never. The oldest gestational age I've worked with is 13 weeks.
[Do you find it hard not to be judgmental? Ever had a patient who you thought was being selfish or doing the wrong thing by aborting?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cpmz5?context=5)|Sometimes yes. My job is to be non judgmental though, so it's just a matter of turning off that voice. We have a good system at the clinic I'm at though, we can talk to each other if we've had a hard day and we can trade patient's if we are uncomfortable with the person we get or find it hard not to judge them.  I don't think I've ever felt anyone was being particularly selfish, I just think some women should be more responsible and just get some birth control. 
[Do the fathers ever attend the procedure?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cmpxl?context=5)|Yes, quite often actually. Sometimes they react more severely to medical terms and procedures though, more men pass out watching a procedure than any patients I've had. Another counselor had a boyfriend pass out when she was explaining the procedure, they weren't even in the abortion room yet!
[In Germany some abortions (e.g. the child will be disabled\) are still legal in the 8th month. What is your opinion on this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cmwux?context=5)|Well an abortion that far along would be a huuuuge process. Like they would be in a hospital overnight kind of thing. And you can test for down syndrome when the fetus is pretty young, so the need for an 8 month abortion seems minimal. But it still comes down to choice I guess. I don't think I could abort a baby for the sole reason of birth defects, but everyone's different.
[Has this experience changed your attitude toward sex education? If you had one minute in front of a class of high school students, what is the most important message you would give them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cyuqy?context=5)|Use birth control!! I think people should learn more about birth control at a younger age, so in high school. And this job makes talking about sex and vaginas so easy, I need to turn that off sometimes because not everyone is comfortable with talking about sex.
[I was taught about birth control in middle school/junior high. They were stressing the importance of the pill/condoms/other forms of contraceptives to students around 11-13.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5d7385?context=5)|Good for you! I don't think I knew all about the forms of birth control until college.
[Why did you chose to be an abortion counselor?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cn17r?context=5)|I wanted to get into women's health and I did my nonprofit admin internship at an abortion clinic. They were hiring for counselors when I finished and I've always wanted to get into women's health. 
[How exactly do they perform the procedure these days?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cmoqr?context=5)|Whew. Well there are two methods. The surgical is the kind I usually work with. For that it starts out like a pap, the duck lips and everything. First the cervix is numbed, we use a medication similar to what a dentist would use. To dilate the cervix, we use dilation rods, which are these blunt tipped stick things. We dilate it according to how far along they are, so for 8 weeks gestation it's 8 millimeters. After it's dilated, the doctor uses a flexible straw thing connected to a little vacuum or suction device. After that it's basically just cleaning up. The doctor checks the contents to confirm that they are not pregnant anymore.
 |The option is a medical abortion, only available when it is 8 weeks or under in gestation. That's when the doctor will prescribe two medications and when they are taken they basically induce a miscarriage. Women get to be at home for this one, and it's a lot cheaper, but it can be pretty painful for up to three days.
[What's your educational background / how'd you get the job? I'm curious about this kind of thing but have no idea how I'd get into it.  Also, thanks for all that you do!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cuoqt?context=5)|My job title is technically an abortion peer counselor, so not something you need a degree for. I got into it by doing nonprofit admin, with intentions of getting into women's health. But actually nursing is a great way to get into it, some nurses will help when we are understaffed for counselors, they do the ultrasounds and see patients for aftercare. 
[Have you ever had an abortion? If so does this help you relate to your patients?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cserh?context=5)|No, but it's a question a lot of women ask me in counseling sessions. I think they could potentially relate to me more if I had though. But working in an abortion clinic just makes me extra paranoid about pregnancies so I am pretty tedious when it comes to my own birth control.
[Where are you generally?  Being an abortion counsellor working in the Vatican or in the southern US would probably be a pretty different experience than working in Canada or whatever.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cmpv3?context=5)|I'm in the US, not the South. My city is pretty liberal, but the surrounding state is very rural and conservative-- we get our fair share of protesters.
[Can a parent make their child under 18 have an abortion?? Even if the daughter wants to keep the baby?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5dp5sv?context=5)|Nope. No matter the age, the ultimate decision is with the pregnant woman.
[Have you ever counseled rape victims?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5ctivw?context=5)|Maybe? It's not really something most women want to elaborate about. I've suspected it, but it's not necessary for them for tell me that on order to get an abortion.
[What do you say to people you meet who are completely against abortion, and they ask you your occupation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5co3jc?context=5)|I actually just don't tell them about it. I have family members that don't even know (I live far away from them, so they just think I am a medical assistant). It's a part time job though, and I've been on a constant search for a good second job, my resume just says I'm a medical assistant because I don't want that to affect whether or not I'll be hired somewhere else.
[What would you say is the average age of the women who come into the clinic?  Do more women come in by themselves or with a significant other/family member/friend?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5criey?context=5)|The age range I've worked with has been between 16 and 37. Average would probably be mid to late twenties. Most women do come in wih some kind of support group, I've seen entire families come in. They usually come in with their mothers, no matter the age. 
[What tends to be the demographic of women who come to your clinic? Age? Race? Economic background? I have no preconceptions (that's why I'm asking\) but I know what most people think and I wonder how accurate it is.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5d0vo5?context=5)|Mostly white, age range from 16 to 37, but average age is probably mid to late 20's. We have to keep stats of everyone, including their level of education, mostly college grads or someone who's taken some college level classes. Economically...we don't really ask what their occupation is.
[Do you turn people away? If so how often does it happen?  You said the sessions are to make sure they are not being forced. How often do you suspect this is happening?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5czb9j?context=5)|Only twice have I felt iffy about patients. But never have I felt like they were being forced, they were just super undecided and unsure about what they wanted to do. They had time, since we go up to 16 weeks and most women realize they are pregnant at 8 weeks, so they just went home to think more to decide what they want. They ended up coming back wayore confident.
[Do you even discuss adoption as a potential option ?.  I am trying to adopt and it seems like I will be forced to go overseas which seems a shame when pregnancy terminations occur in this country daily.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cnkw1?context=5)|When most women make the appointment, they have pretty much already made up their minds. Our counseling sessions are based around them just telling us their thought process on how they made their decision, which is usually them explaining why they don't want to do parenting and adoption. For people that ask though, we have a few local resources to find someone to parent their children.
[A second question, where do you stand on abortion as a choice in gender selection ?.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cnkw1?context=5)|On gender...no way. But you can't tell the gender before 16 (I think) and so our clinic doesn't even have the potential to do that. I don't think that has ever been an issue in the US, I believe it is in other parts of the world though. But no, I definitely don't stand for that.
[What percentage of people that you counsel decide not to get an abortion? Any last minute run-outs that you never see again?  Do you get a lot of ""I think abortion is absolutely wrong! But in my (daughter's\) case.....""?  Do you do the counseling individually, or are they allowed to have a SO or family member with them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5d62fk?context=5)|Counseling is individual, no one else can come to make sure they aren't being forced. So many pro lifers get abortions. We have a separate consent form for them pointing out that the abortion is against their morals but they still want it. It's the belief that abortions are not okay, but my case is different. And yes, every reason for getting an abortion is different, but that doesn't mean you are the only one that gets a choice. 
[Hi - what is your job position? are you a medical assistant?  This sounds like a field that i'd like to get into - i am already a medical assistant.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cmsny?context=5)|I am an abortion peer counselor. I think all abortion clinics are required to have counseling sessions before a procedure.
[Was it posted by the IAmA poster?  If it was deleted then it probably was not posted by the same person, based on their ""scoring system"".](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cone0?context=5)|No it wasn't posted by me. I was a little confused by the original comment though, I'm a little new to reddit.
[What's the most common reason women give for wanting an abortion?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5czfdj?context=5)|Because they got pregnant accidentally and they don't want to have a baby or can't afford it. Think of the average age here: mid to late twenties, I have plenty of friends that age, I am in that age range, I sure as hell don't have enough money to afford a baby.
[My ex-girlfriend once told me that it is her body so she can decide what she wants. She wasn't pregnant but I still thought the man should have some say in the matter too. Have you also counseled the men in the relationships? If so, what are their usual stands?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cygy0?context=5)|Most men are supportive of he decision, but they are not allowed in the initial counseling session, to make sure that they are not forcing the procedure. It sucks, and I agree that's it's a sticky issue, but if men were always allowed to make part of the decision we wouldn't be able to stop any abusive situations.
[What's your gender?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cmkvx?context=5)|Female.
[How many patients do you see daily?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cmt6l?context=5)|My clinic only does procedures once a week, and there's usually 5 to 8 patients.
[Do you ever have couples that come in, where the woman wants the abortion but the man doesn't? If so, how do you deal with that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5d1h4r?context=5)|No, in that case the man probably just wouldn't come. The only time something like that happened was a woman in a very abusive relationship, her significant other was recently put in jail for nearly killing her. He didn't want her to abort, she told him she was doing it anyway, last I heard he was still in jail.
[Have you ever been confronted by a potential (no longer potential\) father after the abortion, when he was unaware it was happening?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5d01au?context=5)|No, I've actually never had a significant other unaware, at least from what my patients have said. Most people talk to heir partners.
[Are you required to encourage communication if the scenario does arise? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5demqv?context=5)|No, because it is ultimately the woman's choice and I would have no way of knowing how sensitive the situation is and/or if it is abusive. No one likes to be undermined, we just talk about they, the women, feel in this situation.
[Why are abortions so damn expensive?!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cv6kb?context=5)|Places like planned parenthood are not allowed to use state money for abortions, so that's why they aren't cheaper there. But it comes to paying he doctor, sanitization, etc. Some insurance covers it and some clinics have funds put away to help women that can't afford it.
[In my state, minors are required to obtain parental consent. Interestingly enough, one of the staff members on my high school newspaper knew a girl who managed to get an abortion without telling her parents. At the time, we were thinking about doing stories about minors who had gotten pregnant, but in the end, we decided not to run with the idea. Anyhow, this girl had an abortion in the basement of a doctor's house, which is supposedly run as some sort of secret abortion clinic. I'm not sure how well-equipped/staffed it is, but what is your opinion about such clinics in states that require minors to obtain parental consent?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cvljx?context=5)|Parental consent can be very wrong. I understand it, but the girls hat choose not to tell their parents do so for a reason. Honestly most girls come in with their moms or their parents help them afford it. We had a study at our clinic (don't know how they did it honestly) that in our state if parental notification were to pass this year (it's on the ballot) it would put ten girls a year in an abusive situation. That's not a ton considering the whole state, but those ten lives are changed forever.
[Do you support the idea of getting ab abortion because the child will have special needs? Where is ""the line"" between a special needs child that should be aborted and one that should not?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5d3dc9?context=5)|Well at the gestational age I work with, it's not really possible to know that yet, so I don't directly work with that kind of situation. I don't think it's something I would personally stand for, but who am I to decide that for someone else. If someone already had three kids with down syndrome and found out their forth pregnancy had it too, I don't think I would stop them. Every situation is different.
[What about partial birth abortions? Are those readily performed? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5czxal?context=5)|Not at my clinic, we go up to 16 week gestation. I think in San Fran they do partial birth? Not sure though. But those cases are generally more abuse related pregnancies or homelessness. 
[To use framing cooked up by a National Right to Life Committee lobbyist is to agree with the National Right to Life Committee.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5delje?context=5)|Yes. I am not sure how that relates to what I said...?
[HOW you said it reinforces the anti-abortion framing of abortion as killing babies.  If you don't think early third-trimester abortions are killing babies, then make your framing consistent with your sentiment.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5egtvu?context=5)|I really don't know what you're talking about. When did I agree with the National Right to Life Committee and when did my sentiments not make sense?
[In the debate about abortion, one of the common points made is that it would be wrong to deny abortion to victims of rape or incest.  In your experience, how often are your patients victims of those crimes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5d3cj0?context=5)|They don't usually elaborate it. I've suspected it a few times, but it's not something people usually want to talk about.
[Probably too late with this, but if the woman is expressing any level of doubt about going through with the abortion, do you advise against it? Thanks for your work and doing this AMA.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cyuti?context=5)|Yes. We tell them to go home and think on it more, since they usually have time before our cut off.
[How many patients do you see daily?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5cxfzl?context=5)|The clinic does abortions once a week, we'll have between 5 and 8 patients on that day, I'll work with 3 to 4.
[Have you had any patients who have had some horrific experiences from PTSD or other mental horrors after the surgery? I know the doctors use anesthetics with medicines to knock you out and sometimes forget it, but it's never something you forget. Most councilors don't keep I'm contact with the patients after they leave the clinic from what I've seen, but after, if you have, have any of their post surgery stories stuck out to you? And if so, what happened?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5dusbr?context=5)|I don't work with patients after, but the nurses do follow up exams and would hear from them weeks after the procedure, I've never heard anything bad from that. I have had PTSD patients, they are hard to work with, and usually get our anti anxiety meds, which is basically like half ""being under"", their memories would be fuzzy, but they are conscience during the procedure.
[How do you feel about Virginia's new law of mandatory external imaging being a requirement prior to abortions?  Personally, I think its ridiculous ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/weius/iama_abortion_counselor_ask_me_almost_anything/c5d8unh?context=5)|Does that mean mandatory ultrasounds? Or mandatory viewing of the ultrasound? Anytime you do an abortion, you have to do an ultrasound to accurately date the pregnancy. And it is hard to get a clear image from the abdomin when the pregnancy isn't very far along, so we always do vaginal ultrasounds. But when patients fill out paperwork, we have the ultrasound consent form, where they can check off whether or not they want to see the image. So ultrasounds are necessary, but women viewing them is not needed and just a tactic into guilting people.

I am 21/F.

1.Family- Dad is emotionally abusive. Mom is a door mat. They work at the same place, it is allowed there. He is above her. I know he doesn't treat her well, because I had my intership there for a while. I tell her to leave but she won't because she knows his behavior won't change and she'd rather that he removes his anger on her than others. When they come home, almost 80% of the times, they have a screaming match going on and this has been happening since 6 years. I don't know what changed then. I have sheltered my sibling as much as I could. We have spent way too many nights crying ourselves to sleep. Also, since a couple of years, my grandmother has been staying with us cuz my grandpa passed away :( We can *not* put her in an oldage home. She and my mother never got along well. She(granny) loves to brew up fights between my parents. The thing is she's sneakily manipulative and they know it but still fall for it. It's all too WTF and frustrating to tolerate. Also, it has made us very very cynical in life.

2. Me- I am moody. Very. At times I am happy, other times I am depressed. I would self-diagnose myself as bipolar, except the sad parts kick in only after bad family time. My study/career is in a major dump. I am about to finish my education, yet have little work experience. It terrifies me. The thought of working. As in I literally panic and start sobbing. I know it's pathetic, but for the love of God, I wish I knew why. Also, that internship at my parents' office was a nightmare. My dad thinks I am a useless good-for-nothing since I am currently sitting at home. Money is not that low, that I *must* earn. He just wants me out. Who wouldn't? I get that. But he constantly taunts me and in front of everyone. And then there are times when he's sweet and concerned like a normal father. My mom will say/agree with everything he says about this. I have told her a million times that her adding to it, doesn't help at all. I am a very communicative person. They know everything about how I feel. There's no doubt at all that I am very troubled by the tension in the house and how much they are pressurising me. Yet they do *nothing* to help.

3. Love- So obviously I was with a guy who loved me and never pointed out anything wrong in me. That ended though. We realized how dysfunctional we were behaving. But now I am worried I will always go for guys who give me approval. I do not want that. I have seen people belittling their own selves based on other people's opinions. Also, I have body image issues. I am trying to work on that. Thankfully I would never stop eating. Eat healthy, yes. But dieting, no way. So that should probably make me feel a bit better.


The problem still remains that I can not live like this. Constantly being driven crazy. I know I must improve, but can't handle the crazy in the house!

I'm currently a sophomore in CS who's planning on applying for a summer internship this fall. I'm currently working on a resume and getting on LinkedIn and have been asking around for advice. I mainly use Windows and have experience working in Linux from classes. I know Java and PHP well, worked with MySQL quite a bit, am familiar with C from 240 and learned Python in the past and could probably pick it up quickly again. I don't have much work experience except I am involved in EPICS and attended an engineering camp in the past. I'm not exactly sure what I want to do with CS but am interested in web development or some career in software engineering.

1. How do you go about applying for one? Should I just attend as many job fairs as possible and hand out my resume, and wait for a call? Which job fairs?
2. Any particular companies I should look at? Should I do my research about them before attending a job fair or the interview? I hear that's a popular question.
3. What were the interviews like? What questions did you have (programming/non-programming related)? I know in a resources seminar some recruiter from Microsoft recommended books for us but I didn't know if the practice problems/tips would suit other companies.
4. How much are you expected to know/what tech skills did your company look for? For most of the skills you needed for your job, did you learn them at the company or at Purdue?
5. What was your job like each day? What did you do? Who did you work with?

Thanks a million! Kind of excited to begin the search for a CS job."
wg1i7,21,2012-07-12,What's a girl to do?,atadistance,atheism,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/wg1i7/whats_a_girl_to_do/,"First off, I'm not sure whether this belongs in r/atheism or r/relationships, because there's a little of both in this post.

I'm a preacher's daughter. Unluckily for me, I also happen to be an atheist. I have been since I was 16 due largely for personal reasons. To put it simply, religion has been used to harm me from a very young age and I don't know how to get over my hatred of it. I don't want to become a Christian again, but I do need to learn to get rid of some of my anger to better my personal relationships.

Why? For starters, there's my dad and his church. The church practically raised me, and while they're very nice people, they do things like pray to stop the spread of legalizing gay marriage. I'm an upcoming sophomore in college who is home for the summer. (During the school year I only went to church once with my boyfriend, and after that I kinda had a HULK SMASH episode.) There is no way I can get out of going to church with my family, even if I end up crying after I attend services. And by attending services, I'm at church for at least four hours Sunday morning, two Sunday evening, and two Wednesday evening. I don't intend on coming out to my family since my dad already guessed it and thinks I'm just going through a phase and that forcing church into me will cure me. He, along with my boyfriend, is confident that I'll eventually become a devout Christian again. That thinking, more than anything else, offends me greatly. 

My boyfriend and his mother are both Church-on-Sunday Christians. His mom is way more religious than he is, so she has no idea that I'm an atheist. She has breast cancer so I send letters to her and get everyone at church to sign them, because things like that make her feel better, and because my boyfriend is in a different state on an internship and can't be with her during this difficult time. My boyfriend, as aforementioned, goes to Sunday morning services at mega churches that are not anything like my dad's small country church of 40 members. He has liberal political views but is very strong in his faith. His view of religion of God and religion as being pure and good sharply contrasts with mine. His faith doesn't make sense to me, as I've read the whole bible cover to cover four times and he hasn't made it past Leviticus. I know too much about Christianity to be a good Christian! My deep rooted anger at religion causes us to have discussions, not really debates, in which we don't get angry at each other. But it still really hurts him and it hurts me. The only way I see to alleviate the hurt is if I get a grip on my emotions regarding religion. I don't have to agree with him, but it would be great if I didn't end up crying every time Christianity comes up. He loves me and I love him, so I don't want to lose him. Our relationship is probably the best thing I've ever had. He has accepted that I am an atheist, but I'm having a difficult time dealing with his moderate Christianity, which saddens me because I know that it's nothing like my dad's version. 

I'm already seeing a therapist. Unfortunately, she's also a Christian. Whenever I talk about church to her, she tells me I need to think of it as a choice, when to me it's not. Being homeless versus hours of quality Jesus time doesn't seem like much of an option to me. But she's also the first person to say that my anger is justified and she understands why I am an atheist. I just don't know how to forgive the people and the institution.  

**TL;DR: My religious upbringing has left me with a good amount of scars. This is causing conflict with my parents and my boyfriend, who are all Christians. Is there any way I can control my anger to keep my lack of faith on the DL with my family and avoid conflict while still maintaining my own dignity (there is no way I am joining the prayer group to end gay marriage), and is my relationship with my boyfriend doomed? How can I use my frustration constructively, if possible?**"

Please.",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/wfzq5/my_college_is_basically_telling_me_that_im_just/,"So basically, I was a foster child, and because of that the State of Florida has been helping me with tuition and whatnot because there really is no way I could possibly afford it myself.

Long story short, after I finally managed to get in with an adviser I was explicitly informed that I had just one thing to sign and everything was going to be set. I did, and so far as I knew I was golden. 

This morning I got a phone call saying that I am missing two more documents, and without them they will not even consider my financial aid status. My foster mom offered to go and have turn them in for me, but the school said she isn't authorized, and I can't until I get back to Florida August 20th, which is after the deadline for financial aid. 

I have all of $400 to my name, given to me out of the generosity of my boss who agreed to give me a small salary while I'm here, but what I will be able to save up is nowhere near enough to cover my classes and everything else. I *need* to figure this out.

As an aside, I do *not* want any charity, it's bad enough I have to let the state pay for it. I know next to nothing about student loans other than half of everybody is buried in them. Is that a viable option?

At work today I'm told by my boss I need to give someone tutoring in registering accounts (it's an accountancy firm and I've worked this job for about 3 weeks as a summer intern).

This girl I'm supposed to tutor is roughly my age and she seems pretty happy and smiles a lot in general, but as soon as I sat down to try to help her she immediately gets this very strange attitude. She starts questioning everything I am trying to teach her and just generally seems disinterested in what I have to say. Fair enough. Whatever. I don't care.

Then we get to the difficult part of the registering and she gets really confused, and while she is making a ton of mistakes and I try to correct her before she makes too many, she looks at me and with a massive ""happy"" (read: angry) grin, says, ""I know. THANK YOU!"" Then she tells me that she can't learn anything and wishes the person that I replaced was here because she learnt better from her, but still thanks me for my help.

She asks me to leave so I leave and sit at my desk. Glancing over every once in a while, she is clearly struggling with the task. Eventually she buckles and asks another colleague in the office for help, who then tries to help her. She still seems to struggle but every now and then she looks up at me while saying to my colleague, ""Well THAT'S easy!"" and ""You're so good at explaining!"".

I don't understand why and I don't really mind too much. I thought it was pretty funny. Does anyone else have a story about someone extremely passive aggressive?"

She started the procedure on me and was actually very gentle so it didn’t hurt at all, it was actually one of the most gentle check-ups I’ve ever had. Ofcourse at one point she started to clean up a little bit of tartar I had at the back of my teeth. While she was cleaning my teeth and ofcourse its an annoying feeling and sometimes I tiny bit painfull and I for some reason thought it was a good idea to all of a sudden yell out “AARGGH FUCK!” and give a very painfull expression on my face.

She instantly pulls out and starts apologising instantly “Oh I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean to hurt you sorry sorry sorry” ofcourse immediately my dentist who was observing comes to check up what happened, at this point is by the way felt kinda guilty for pulling the joke on her’ and I just turned to face her with a sheepish grin on my face “I’m sorry I did that I couldn’t resist, to be fair you are alot gentler then my dentist is’ so my dentist couldn’t help but slightly laugh while she stood there with the tool still in hand not really knowing how to respond, I just laid back and let her continue the procedure.

After 2 minutes or so she was done cleaning and I washed my mount with some water and made sure to thank her and told her she did a really good job and I was sure she would become a great dentist.
Luckily at this point she was able to laugh and told me “Yea but I am never gonna treat you again” I smiled and replied that I would love to get threated by her and walked out.

I must say that girl actually made going to the dentist fun.

But this isn't about me; the point is for everybody to meet a bunch of people who are looking to improve, and makes some friends who will stick around as practice partners in the future. On NA I've got some friends I've never met in real life but who are pretty close friends nonetheless, simply because we've spent so much time playing together.

I will be inviting everyone on EU from http://www.reddit.com/r/sc2partners/ so it shouldn't be just me even at the beginning. Even if you don't feel like playing today and just want to observe or something, drop by and meet some people. CONSIDER THIS A STARCRAFT MIXER.

Tips?,snarl,SCREENPRINTING,https://www.reddit.com/r/SCREENPRINTING/comments/wfjz1/having_issues_heat_pressing_gold_foil_advice_tips/,"So a friend of mine and I started a screen printing shop. We've been taking care of business as usual up until a recent order where the client asked for gold foil on the design. Now most of my knowledge and experience in screen printing came from an internship at a larger print shop here in Seattle. During my internship we covered almost everything, enough that I felt confident to open a screen printing shop. When I helped complete a job that required gold foil at my internship, the shirts had been printed with just a gold plastisol ink (to my knowledge) then we used a clamshell heat press to press the foil onto the print. The coverage wasn't *perfect* but it was acceptable enough to deliver (only minor spotting in the final foil).

Now back to the order I received at my shop for black shirts (the client wanted Gildan Soft Style shirts) with gold prints in multiple locations and a gold foil finish. I looked for a basic gold ink and decided upon Union Liberty Shimmer Bright Gold and I also grabbed some Union Gold Foil. We printed the shirts with the Union Gold and they came out perfect. We don't have a clamshell heat press in our shop yet so we wen't over a friends shop to use his press. Needless to say the foil wasn't pressing correctly. The heat press was set to 375°F like Union recommends and we were using the press at a medium to high pressure. When we pressed the foil it didn't adhere properly, only very lightly in some areas. We tried many times, sometimes the foil wouldn't stick at all and others it would stick more, but never enough to be acceptable for delivery. We varied temperature and pressure with the same results.

**Am I just an idiot for trying to heat press gold foil on a shimmer ink?** I have read about using an adhesive on top of the print to adhere the foil (Union recommends their own) or even an additive for plastisol ink makes foil stick way better and last longer. I just didn't do this because of my experience at my internship.

So, Reddit, Can you help me out? Any suggestions, experiences, or advice would be greatly appreciated!"

By the time I graduate (May 2013) I will have worked at a HVAC engineering company for two years as a Line Engineer and Electrical Engineer in training (I have been trained, but not yet promoted but they are hinting at a promotion soon).  I got the job as a summer internship, but since it is located in the same town as my univeristy I managed to make myself indespensible and they allowed me to work there on night shift while i finish my degree.  I currently work directly under the vice president of the company and have a good working relationship with him.

I don't want to stay at the company I'm at because they have a complete lack of fucks to give to any and all of their employees. Because a large portion of their manufacturing employees are unskilled workers or worse (many are ex-convicts) they treat everyone like drugged up teenagers who have to be babysat non-stop.  I see huge issues in their business practices and engineering practices, but I've also seen people point out those issues and find themselves fired. 

I come from a family who has no technically capable people in it other than me and my younger brother and from a high school that barely taught the basics, so I found that many of the things that came naturally to my classmates were a struggle to me. Combine that with a complete lack of time due to having to work so much just to stay in school and I have my shitty GPA.  Every job I have ever been at I have been bored out of my skull (including my current job as a line engineer) due to lack of challenging things to work on.  I have always excelled at work and try very hard to be the best at my job (whether it was carhopping at sonic or designing a wire mapping system for large HVAC systems).  I was taught that the way to ensure that you are never fired is to make yourself indespensible.  

I'm overwhelmingly afraid that companies will look at my GPA and pass me over for jobs that I would be awesome at!

Our university is rather small, so there won't be as many companies there that I'd like, but I have a game plan for the career fair coming in October:
1. Have my resume primed and ready. Know it inside and out. It will be unique, but readable.  I will have it printed on a nifty folder and hand it out as swag for the recruiters to use to hold all of the resumes they collect for the day.  On the outside will a diagram outlining why I would be a good employee. On the inside will be lists of my skills and job experiences.
2.  Apply ahead of time for every electrical or software related job I can find on the job sites for all engineering companies on the list for the career fair.
3. Create and have on hand a portfolio of past work and experiences to show at the career fair if necessary (I'd like to save it for the interview, but hell if I have to whip it out at the fair I'll do it to get an interview).  
4.  Firm Handshake (I've been complimented for mine).
5.  Have questions ready ahead of time for each and every company that might be interested in me. I will overlook no company and, if possible, will know what each company's future goals are. (Many companies post press releases with such information).  
If I am not offered an interview by the time the career fair recruiter is wrapping up our conversation I will ask outright.  

Do I even have a chance at a decent job with my GPA, though, or should I be lucky that I got the job I have?

EDIT: Thanks so much for the responses! I have never actually gotten this many people to respond to anything on reddit before.  Its really encouraging that I still have a shot. Without trying to be egotistical, I can say that I know that I am a very good employee and all of my project experience points to me also being a good engineer. I have been project leader before and on the work-front I am currently in charge of engineering issues for two production lines (with the ability to cover all of the other lines if necessary). "

I have also heard that Australians might have a higher standard of living. Does anyone have any evidence to settle this discussion? I have looked at a few articles that suggest that, but there was a number such as 300K for a mine manager there. Also would you be living the life financially if your company was paying for your room and board while working there? (This is sometimes the case with our company)."

There are a number of temps, and each of us assists one manager directly. I get along with my manager (G) very well. We are both laid back, he is a great guy, and I am a hard worker, so it is a good match.

Today, G told the VP that if the company ever has a full time position available, I would be a good candidate. He said this to him in front of me. The VP looks at me and goes ""I am not impressed."" I was speechless. Every time this guy sees me, I am actively in the process of completing an assigned task. G responded with ""she is smart and a hard worker."" and the VP said something like ""we will see.""

Later, as the VP went to do something else, he asked me what my name is. I have been working there for 3 months, and have interacted with him on numerous occasions. I told him, and he said ""It was nothing personal"" and I said ""i know."" Then he asked me which department i work for...again, information he obviously knows because I see him daily. Another manager (C) stepped in and was like ""seriously VP? she has been here for months, you work with her every day.""

Then, a few minutes later, C and G were discussing potential dinner plans. My manager didn't want to go out because he had just traveled. He said he would only go out if I came. I enthusiastically said I would love too. C's face just dropped, and she said ""no, it's okay we don't have too if you are tired."" And my manager said he wanted to go now. I figured the other manager maybe just wanted to spend some quality time alone with my manager, since the two are good friends.

Anyway, I wound up working a bit longer and then telling them to head to dinner without me, as one of the other temps I work closely with was swamped with work, and I thought it would be best to stay late and help them out. My manager tried to talk me into going with them, C eagerly agreed that i should stay and help.

The whole situation was so weird. I am not exactly a fetal intern, I am 24, just 2-3 years younger then C. I have only received praise for my work at this company, never any criticism or complaint. I just don't understand why my employers are being so rude and cold to me. I don't know if I am taking it too personally, or if they are just stressed out and snobby."

Needless to say, I'm excited about it and start next week.

My question is, how do I politely reduce my working hours with my current employer (who requires a minimum of 24hrs/week, and max or 40) with whom I currently spend about 33 hours a week at?  

Should I say that I have another job?  Or lie?  

Do I have to say anything at all? (they will likely notice my reduced hours within a few weeks)

Sorry about the wall of text, I just want to make sure every detail is known. 

Well I'll start off by saying I'm the guy that posted about my ex stripper girlfriend a couple weeks ago. I sugar coated what I knew and became a monster for it. If you didn't see that post, I'll lightly touch it. Let me begin by explaining my situation. 

About 10 months ago I met my girlfriend. Everything was great and she seemed perfect for me. She had somewhat recently got out of an abusive relationship and told me about her ex fiance and everything, no big deal. Well after about a week or two into our relationship (maybe four weeks after meeting) she decides to break up with me out of nowhere. I'm heartbroken but she calls me the next morning and explains that she made a mistake and has trust issues. She explains she just got scared and proceeds to tell me about how she stripped for 3 months from Nov 2010 to Feb 2012. She tells me that she did it part time to make ends meet during the recession and left as soon as she found another job. Keep in mind she was stripping one week after her abusive boyfriend let her move in and that he had no problem with doing it because she needed to support herself. He was a dick and pretty much gave her an ultimatum.

Well, she said she learned her lesson when she left and never went back. She said she hated it and did the bare minimum. I thought I was OK with it but panicked after we moved in a month ago. I just couldn't get over the fact that she was OK with the idea of selling her naked body and talking up random guys when she had a boyfriend and was 1000 times better than that. It just bothered me that everyone has gotten a piece of her body and now I feel like its damaged goods. We almost broke up over this but we got over it and moved on with it getting better day by day. Well I asked her, did she strip anywhere else other than this one place, and she swore she only danced at one place and tried out at two others. Well, she left her phone here yesterday by accident and some random number texts her about coming on his boat. I recognize this as someone that called the other day that said he had the wrong number and text back playing stupid. He let's me know that he met her at another strip club 14 months ago. Well, I assume he's just confused and just some creep and say he has the wrong number. But I notice there's no texts from him, yet she randomly texted him ""who is this?"" So, nothing makes sense. 

I decide to ask her who this creep is and long story short she admits she stripped AGAIN in May last year, but for only one day and because she needed new tires badly and was driving on donuts and needed to go to work. I FREAK telling her she swore to me that she didn't dance anywhere else and that if she hated it so much how could she go back even when she found another job. She says she didn't tell me because she didnt want me to breakup with her and deleted his messages because she didn't want me to think she was cheating and he was just some creep that the bartender gave her number to. She says she just danced two songs and sat around and left, not giving any dances. Which makes it somewhat worse because its like she was willing to get naked and talk to guys for like ten bucks, when she supposedly gave it up and had found a job. She says she also tried to sell stuff and give plasma, but nothing worked. She also initially tried to say she didn't even dance there, but I got the truth out of her when I said that makes no sense that she just sat there and didn't even dance. Well heart broken because she lied again (I'll get into this) I tell her were over and she goes berserk about how I can't judge her for her past and how she's a different person and how her friend talked her into the idea. She freaks so loudly I lock myself into the bedroom and she pounds to let her in. Then, THE COPS come because they think I'm killing her or something. I just give up and go to sleep. Well morning comes and we argue again and I just start throwing shit away and pack a bag and go to work. 

To touch on the lying, when I first started dating her, I asked her to see a picture of her ex and she said she blocked him and didn't talk to him any more. Well I knew his first name and thought I saw her text that name occasionally but gave her the benefit of the doubt. Little did I know, that once she did finally block him she let me know his last name in conversation. Curious, I looked him up and saw this abusive asshole has been talking to her on her facebook wall all during the time we we're dating. She also has been texting him. I confront her and she breaks down saying they had the same friends and she was staying in touch so he wouldn't turn them against her. OK then. I say don't lie again and we will be fine. But she does again about some guy she slept with, says she never slept with him in a story, but changes it weeks later (wasn't still in contact with him though) and lies about if she's still looking at the facebook of some ex friend who was obsessed with her and borderline ruined our relationship due to the way he treated her (I noticed she would look at his and her ex finances Reddit every day pretty much after she told me she didn't care about them) after then she promised to stop but kept doing it only to be caught again and again.

I understand I can't tell her what to not look at but its my laptop and she's supposedly left that life behind her. Then she lies to me about quitting smoking and other little stuff after that. And on top of it, now in her arguments she physically abuses me. Granted, I may verbally abuse her and call her terrible things in our arguments, but I see no way that this gives her the green light to scream to hug her and pull my hair and punch me. 

I'm at my wits end. Part of me says that she would be perfect for me, not considering she's an ex stripper, and that with everything piling up (car broken, long term internship away from her (4 months) coming up, me quitting my job, and me going to school in addition to moving in with her and getting a pet, that I'm just freaking out and getting cold feet and taking it out on her for her past. But another part says I should just walk away and that I'm biting off more than I can chew, and that its not fair to me that I have to date some lying ex stripper. I want to love her, but im afraid that feeling will never come back. I also am afraid I'll always have that vision of her stripping in the back of mind and grinding a pole, and its gonna drive me crazy. I cant keep arguing like this though. The thing is, this never bothered me at all and our relationship was amazing for the first eight months, its just that once we moved in, it all went down hill. 

To add some odd information, what triggered this was when she got a new haircut (with my push) she made some little comment like (this reminds me of my stripping days) and I just freaked that night after she mentioned giving someone a lap dance or something and haven't been the same since or been able to get the images out of my mind or out of my nightmares.

Can I ever love her again? Is this all just pointless? Am I settling by dating an ex stripper, or should I accept its in her past and it doesn't define her now. I just want to go back to where we used to be, but I'm afraid I can't fix this and I'm gonna have to go away for four months knowing our relationship is terrible. She was a different person back then and doesnt experience with drugs any more, but I don't know if that's enough.

So Reddit, please help me. Should I stay and work with her? Or just walk away? If I should stay, how can I fall in love with her again and embrace who she is, not hate who she was. I feel like I want to break up with her, but I know deep down inside its a huge mistake, and that's why I can't just do it. I don't think she would ever cheat on me and she definately wants to make it work. 

Please, Ill take any help or advice I can get. Sorry if there are typos, as I typed this on my phone while I'm at work. 

Tl;Dr: I have a huge problem with my girls past and minor lying problem. Discovered that her shady past was more than she initially told me and I'm sick of the lying. I'm also afraid I'll never get over her past and don't know what to do. "

My parents think that I don't take the real world seriously enough,evomax01,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/wiv6x/am_i_not_thinking_realistically_enough_my_parents/,"Hi Reddit. I'll be 20 soon and already halfway through college. My parents think that I think living in the real world is a lot easier than it actually is. I do think that living in the real world by myself would be much more difficult than college or my previous years, when I had the financial support of my parents.

However, I'll be graduating from an Ivy League university, with a pretty useful degree (major in statistics, minor in Spanish), and will have taken two actuarial exams before I graduate. My grades aren't stellar, around 3.2 (my stats GPA is higher, around 3.6), I'm doing an internship at this HR dept, so I don't think i'll be too badly off. Also, even if the economy keeps going south, the unemployment rate won't be much higher than 10%. I know that for recent graduates, it'll be higher, but I still can't shake the fact that I'll be statistically more likely to be employed than not.

Also, my parents are pretty wealthy, so they live in a large house, own a new BMW, etc. I know that I can't live like that on a 50K a year, but I think that whatever wages I get, I can adjust my lifestyle so that I can make it work.

Am I just so naive about my life after college, or do I need to get serious?"

We just very recently found ourselves short a person, and we are in dire need of help.

There is a decent garden that we get most of our vegetables from, and we raise goats for milk and meat.  We make different cheeses and yogurt for our own consumption, and we sell the rest at the farmer's market and co-op.  

Taking care of the garden would be part of your responsibility, as would learning how to make cheese, herding the goats, and cooking once or twice a week.  We require at least four hours a day, five days a week.  There is a small stipend offered.  

You could sleep in a tent while you're here, or stay in a clean trailer with a bed.  In a few months the bedroom in the yurt will be available for your use as well, but the trailer would offer more privacy since the yurt is where the cooking and hanging-out happens.  

We are off the grid and use solar panels to run the wireless and sometimes lights at night.  Otherwise dinner is eaten by candlelight.  

The land is beautiful, the neighbors are far away, and we have a lot of privacy.  We're surrounded by BLM on three sides, so the goats get to free-range for miles around.  

We are a 61 year old lady, a 30 year old female, and a 27 year old male.  There's a 60 year old man who comes and goes, as well as a 50 year old male and a young couple with a baby.  Expect good conversation and friendly-ish people (we're all working on that, some of us more than others).  We're all pretty open-minded to all sorts of stuff, and we're all probably a little crazy for wanting to live this way with other people.  It is definitely communal, so expect to share your life with others in ways you might not have before (except for maybe with your family).

Okay!  I hope I haven't scared anyone away, and if I did, then it's probably for the best.  For those of you interested, please have patience with my replying!  I probably won't be back online until tomorrow afternoon.  

Thanks for reading, and I look forward to hearing from you all!

Oh, the internship can last until the end of October, starting immediately!"

I recently graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Information Studies and I am looking for an entry level job into network, security or systems administration. I've worked with networks before including having a short internship that allowed me to interact with the OU and other parts of Active Directory. 

I am determined, catch on firmly to concepts and would leap at the chance to be a shadow/understudy as long as I could still make ends meet regarding pay. I work well with teams or on my own and do flourish if given a project that requires some thought on my part. My problem solving skills are excellent and I have been told that my solutions are often creative. I've also been doing various jobs since I was 12 and thus have a good work ethic that only improves as I know what needs done. My communication skills are generally excellent and I have the ability to be both direct and tactful. 

I am more than willing to relocate for this and would welcome the chance to get out of the midwest, but I am currently in Oklahoma. If I am to stay in the area I am hoping to earn about 40k. Leaving the area would influence that and have to take cost of living into account. I am not interested in call centers, sticking with basic desktop support or help desk situations as those are not pushing me to where I want to be and I am intent on exploring new territory and expanding my knowledge. I will gladly furnish my resume on request as I would rather not put it on here with all my personal info readily obtainable. 

Thank you for any time you've taken into reading this post and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

So I was hoping you guys could help me with getting to know these cities:

1. Is there a method to this freeway madness? I'm on one freeway, it ends, and then a few miles later it starts again...wtf?

2. Do you guys have the same problems with Google maps? I'm told something is on the corner of XY and it's not anywhere near there, etc.

3. Is there a place to get information about local events or great places to spend time?

4. Are there any regular Reddit meetups?

5. Is there a good place, other than Craigslist to find a room for rent?

6. Are there smaller CA subreddits, like burbank or Glendale? Arizona had separate ones and it made it easy to only monitor things near you.

Thanks guys"

I know the general consensus is you really need to mess up bad to not receive one, but it honestly wasn't the case.  I had really good performance feedback reviews up until the last week.  To my luck, since they wanted a final PFF from all interns in the last week, I had to submit one literally based on 15 hours (found out later that is against firm policy....and I was on a brand new engagement).  I'll note I didn't make any major mistakes by any means, I was very blind sided by their decision.

Overall, it was an amazing experience and I learned a lot and am fully confident I'll do well in the future, just need to show the other firms that.  

Moving forward, I'm having trouble in how to approach the other firms.  I know it is clearly a red flag having one on my resume.  Just want to see if anyone can give me advice on the matter that I haven't already heard.  

TL;DR - Didn't get an offer from a big 4.  Need advice on how to get back in public accounting!

Edit 1:  I should note on my last engagement it was a project I made some errors that should not have been there.  It was mostly due to me typing paragraphs in excel.  To explain, I have never used excel in that manner so when I turned it in, it contained some spelling errors that could have been easily avoided with spell check.  The associate (who drilled me on the PFF) said those errors are ones that should never exist and that is not acceptable.  I have to agree with that so I'm at fault there.  Also, I was on a team with other young guys who were always goofing around and talked a lot.  I got along with them very well and of course talked back to them.  However, on the PFF, a director who was there for 2 hours one day commented I talked off topic a lot.  I think I gave all the relevant info for my case now."

---------

As you know I am (was) in training to be a Coroner. My education was almost complete and I had been working a paid internship with a well-known medical examiner in the Washington D.C. area.  All that changed a few hours ago when I was fired from the office for refusing to participate in, what I believe to be, a cover up. Even though they ‘warned me’ about ‘consequences’ for leaking any information about this case, my conscience wouldn’t be clear if I kept quiet. This is something people need to know.

A few days ago we received a call from the Metro police about a possible body discovered on the redline. Since working here we’ve responded to a few calls in the subway system. The first time it was a woman who tripped over someone’s rolling suitcase while trying to pass by on the escalators. She ended up with a broken neck. Twice we went out there for a heart attack. Once for a late night mugging that went bad. The poor guy was stabbed repeatedly in the stomach even though he handed over his watch and wallet like the mugger requested. So far I haven’t seen anything especially gory and it was a bit of a let down when the dispatch officer said the man was found just sitting on the train. (Is it wrong that I’ve been looking forward to a call about someone either jumping or being pushed in front of a train?) The interesting thing is the wording of the dispatch request. “Possible body.” If the word ‘possible’ is in front of body, maybe it’s the paramedics that should be responding and not the coroner’s office.

When we arrived, the paramedics actually were on the scene so we figured it was just a miscommunication and we were called out prematurely. Police tape blocked off the whole entire station platform. From our view at the top of the escalators we could tell something wasn’t right. The paramedics stood outside the door to the train car and they weren’t actually doing anything except arguing and pointing at a body slumped up against a window inside. We could have left, but since it was a slow evening we decided to take a look anyway just to see what was going on.

As we approached I overheard some of the conversation between the two paramedics. “He’s dead, right?” said the older of the two. “Dead people don’t do…that.” Do what? I thought. Once they saw us, they quickly agreed that the man was dead and promptly left the scene to us. Clearly this wasn’t a call they wanted to handle, I can understand that.

The police weren’t much help either. I chatted with the officers on the scene while the doc went in to take a look at the man on the train. One of the detectives commented that there weren’t any clear signs of foul play. The witnesses all claimed the guy just sat down like everyone else and then he stopped breathing. Natural causes, I thought, seemed like a pretty cut and dry case, but when I looked over my shoulder at the Doc, he seemed… confused.

“Look at this.” He said to me as I walked into the train. As I approached, it seemed like the man was just napping like a lot of the train riders do when they know their stop won’t be coming up for awhile.
“Look at what?” I asked.

“His eyes.”

The man’s head was forward with his chin to his chest so that I had to kneel down to get a good look at his face. As I’m doing this, the doc is talking out loud like he tends to do, just going over his mental checklist. “Not breathing. No pulse. His skin is cold to the touch. Approximate time of death 6 to 8 hours ago.”

I’m in the isle of train trying to make due with a pin flashlight since the dim lighting on the train wasn’t helping things much. The man’s eyes were open and they seemed to be staring at me. It’s not uncommon, so I lean in closer hoping to figure out what it is the doc wanted me to see so that I don’t look like an idiot and then… he blinked.

I jump back as quick as a mongoose would jump away from a cobra.

“What the fu…” I tried to say.

“Exactly.” The doc said.

“Got’ta be just a muscle spasm, right?”

“You would think,” he says, “but watch this.” He grabs the guy by the hair and pulls his head back. With his other hand he waves a finger in front of the man’s open eyes, which then began to follow along as the doc moves his finger left and right. Then the man looked at me and blinked again.

“Have you ever seen anything like this before?” I ask.

“Nope.”

“And he’s dead?”

“As a doornail.”

We let the officer in charge know that we couldn’t determine the cause of death on site. A full autopsy would need to be preformed to make any kind of determination. She made a note in the report that this body had a tendency to follow you with its eyes and occasionally blink. Off the record she told me the whole case bothered her. The man, she said, didn’t have any identification, credit cards, watch, jewelry, a phone, or even money. All they found on him was a train ticket and a napkin.

Once we had him back at the office we changed into our examination coveralls.  I was asked to deal with his clothing. The man watched me the whole time as I stripped off his business suit. He even winked at me once. Also a few odd things were noted about the clothing. First, he wasn’t wearing any under garments. Normally people wear a tee shirt, boxers or briefs, and socks. This guy wore none of those things but for some reason he had on two belts, one over the other. 

The doc switched on his tape recorder and then turned on the buzz saw. I watched as he preformed the Y-incision, and I made a mental note of his perfect technique so that I could try and do it better next time. I’m telling you the doc is a real artist.  Next came the enjoyable cracking sound as the ribcage was pried open. All while this was happening the man’s eyes watched us. I could almost swear he was smiling too.

Over the next hour the doc made notes as he did the exam. He handed me each organ to be weighed and cataloged. There was nothing strange or out of the ordinary about any of the internal organs. 

“Okay.” The doc said, “Lets take a look inside his head. I want to see what’s causing the eye movement.”

“Listen, do you mind if we tape the eyes shut first?” 

I’m trying to remain as professional as I can but the constant blinking is unnerving me. The doc didn’t mind so I took some suture tape and worked up the courage to manually close the guy’s eyelids and taped them down. Immediately they started moving fast. His whole face was convulsing and contorting itself, trying to break free of the tape.

“I don’t think he like’s that.” The doc said and then he removed the tape from the man’s eyes. The violent motions stopped right away and he winked at the doc.

“This isn’t natural.” I said.

“There’s a scientific reason for everything. It’s our job to find it.” The doc replied.

“But he actually fought to get the tape off his eyes.”

“I guess he wants to watch. Now do you want to remove the skull, or should I?”

I’m too shaken to handle the equipment so I watch as the doc works the saw around the man’s skull. The bastard is smiling. I’m sure of it. He’s staring at me and blinking his left eye then his right eye back in forth. I hear the familiar popping sound caused by the top of a skull being pulled off.

“Whoa. Okay….” The doctor says.

“What is it?” I ask as I’m walking around to see what he’s seeing. The man’s eyes follow me of course.

“I think I might have to call this one in.” 

Dear god. 

The brain was missing. 

“Doc?” I ask

“Not now. Pack up and go home. I’ll finish cleaning this up.” He’s saying this as he’s already dialing a number on the phone.

“But…”

“Just go. I’ll call you later.” It isn’t a request. I know when to shut up and listen. I make my way to the door knowing that the man is still staring at me. “And don’t say anything to anyone.”

The Doc never called me back. Each time I tried to reach him it went to voicemail. I tried to go back the next day security wouldn’t let me in the building. They said I was to await further instructions while on paid leave. That was four days ago.

This morning I hear a knock at my door. It’s a man who said he was with the medical examiners officer but he looks as if he’s with the CIA, FBI, NSA, or some other 3-letter agency. He asks if he can come in to talk. I open the door to let him in and as I do I notice two other similarly dressed men sitting in a black suburban across the street.

The folder he hands me is a case file for the John Doe that was found on the train. All of the notes about the eye movement and the blinking were removed. There was no mention of anything out of the ordinary, let alone a missing brain. It’s already got the Doc’s signature on it and this man is asking for me to sign it as well.

I try to tell him the files wrong but he holds up a hand to stop me from speaking. “This is how it happened. Sign it.” He said. I ask about the doc. I want to know why I haven’t heard from him. He says the doc has been ‘let go.’ The way he says it makes me think the worst. I refuse to sign it and ask to speak to the director of the medical examiners office. The man informs me that would be impossible and that I am to be fired. But fired isn’t the word he used. The word he used was ‘terminated’. 

He leaves when I ask him to go but he warns me that mentioning this to anyone would have serious consequences. As soon as the door closed behind him I packed a bag and took off. I saw that a black suburban was parked at the end of my street and I might just be paranoid but I think it pulled out after I did. Just in case I was being followed I changed direction several times. When I felt safe enough I pulled into a nearby residential neighborhood and found an open WIFI signal. 

I think something strange is going on in D.C. maybe elsewhere as well. I don’t know what it could be but I feel like the doc and I stumbled onto something we weren’t supposed to know about and now we’re in danger. I found the doc’s home number online. When I called it went straight to voicemail. I tried to leave a message for him but the line went dead once I began talking. If someone is monitoring my phone calls it’s possible my car is bugged too and they already know exactly where I am. 

Again, maybe I’m just paranoid (or crazy). Maybe there is a completely logical explanation for the scarecrow corpse that stares and blinks and winks and smiles. I can't imagine how anything like that could exist or why. I’m scared, really, really scared. I decided the only thing to do would be to write this and email it out to everyone I know. Hopefully this information will make it to someone…

If you’ve received this and haven’t heard back from me by tomorrow then I’m probably dead and you’ll know what I’ve written is true."

I work out to stay in pretty good shape, but I am looking to play.

At a local indoor place that I was told was starting up a mens ""for fun"" league (anyone over 16 can play in a 7v7 format, no prizes) I came across the name of a team that happened to be named after a pretty good friend of mine. We don't talk much since after high school but if we were to run into eachother somewhere we'd be pretty happy.

This friend of mine is a pretty good player but unfortunately even though he is nice, the main group of guys he plays with are pretty elitest when it comes to playing.

When I say *elitest* I mean it in the way that the only people who are good to them, are the people in their group. If you fuck up, they will be obviously put off by your ""lack of ability"", but if they fuck up it becomes a huge joke and they ""weren't really trying."" 

All of the guys in the group know me pretty well from playing pick up games and competitive leagues throughout the years against me, and they know they are better than me (they actually are). But it's just pretty dickish to make a big showing of it. I know if I don't play with them I'll end up meeting them in the league eventually and probably get my ass handed to me with a bunch of other random guys that are put on my team.

I'm not for sure that my friend will be accompanied by this group of guys, but I'm fairly certain of it. I know that I'll likely have a better chance of winning games if I play with them and it would be nice to be able to play with an old friend of mine despite these guys being pricks. They aren't horrible all the time, but if you begin to play subpar according to their standards they slowly start drifting more and more to elitism.

All the advice I see online is to never be the first person to put out a number. Wait for the other person to put out a number first. Part of the reason for this is that you could ""out-price"" yourself if you say something too high but could this really be a problem if they already know how hard I work and how good of a fit I could be for this position?

I have other thoughts but I think I've written enough here already."

whz58,4,2012-07-13,[Rant/Help] I've been dealing with the same anxiety on and off for the past 14 months... I'm really getting tired from it and want to move on.,[deleted],Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/whz58/ranthelp_ive_been_dealing_with_the_same_anxiety/,"I was caught with pot in October 2010 and again in May 2011, and now I have a criminal record that won't be able to be expunged (erased) until 2017. I've never even been a heavy pot smoker, but now every time I apply for a job or apply for an apartment, people are going to think I am a pothead. Later this year, I'm going to need to start applying for internships next summer. If they do a criminal background check, I have no idea what to expect. I already struggle with incredible anxiety whenever I apply for little jobs like at supermarkets and stuff, but I can't imagine what it's going to feel like when I need to step into the real world. The muscles in my legs tense up, I completely lose my appetite, and just the thought of getting zero interviews for years scares the shit out of me. I try to calm myself down in many different ways, but still the thought just consumes me. This has been on my mind practically every hour of every day for the past 14 months, and I think it's really starting to do its toll on me. My social anxiety has gone up, since the second time I didn't even KNOW my friends were going to start smoking pot, when before I knew it, the cops showed up. Everyone around me has the attitude that in order to be successful you need to take risks, but I simply can't have that attitude anymore. I've taken a risk and fell really fucking hard. It's irrational, I know, but I can't help it. That one night last year, I kept telling myself that the chances of the cops showing up are slim to none, my friends smoke here every day. And of course, the one day I decided to go with them, I get fucking caught. I'm the one who has to tell people that I was a pothead, me, the guy who only smoked about three times ever but got caught twice. Not the guys in college who smoke weed in their dorm rooms every day, or the people who binge drink every weekend and get close to death once a month. They can keep up their grades as good as I can, but *I'm* the one who has to ""pay"" for the two joints I've smoked. 

The ways I calm myself down are:

- Reminding myself that we live in an age where marijuana acceptance is rising at a faster pace every day. Employers are therefore more and more likely to look over my record as youthful ignorance than something more severe. They are also only misdemeanors, which employers are much more likely to skip over than felonies.

- I have options. I live in a state that is obviously pretty tough on marijuana laws, despite 3 out of every 5 college students puffing up daily. I can move out to a state that's more open-minded about it, and will maybe understand.

- I'm still young (21) and have the rest of my life ahead of me. In twenty years, this whole thing will only be a blip on my radar. I should focus on making my life better for myself forty years from now, rather than at the moment. 

However, this whole deal just impairs my ability to think clearly and reason through situations like I normally would. I'm scared of getting into any relationship, since I'll have to tell the girl eventually about what happened. I'm scared about meeting ANYONE new, because a quick Google search of my name plus my hometown will make it pop up (my town is uptight, and reports on every fucking arrest here). I'm scared to move into apartments with anyone, since they'll have to know. I'm not the type of person you'd expect to even drink that much, so I have no idea how warped some of my relationships would become with the people who still don't know. I've already lost friends because of this, but I don't want to grow up alone. This whole situation has pervaded every aspect of my life and I constantly find myself wondering how much happier I would be if I just didn't go out with my friends that one night. I already have been to therapy for this (court-ordered ""drug counseling"", but we treated it more like therapy because it was obvious I'm not addicted to anything), and that definitely helped me out a little, but the thoughts still persist. I sometimes feel depression creeping up on me, but I've learned how to make it go away.

The anxiety remains constant, though. I don't know how I'm going to deal with it once I need to apply for real jobs. I just need to keep an open mind, and let my life flow on... Any advice would be appreciated.

Edit: Just a little more backstory that I want to get out there. I was planning on becoming a teacher before this all happened, but after it happened, the chances of that were shot. I was forced to change my major by the school (since people with criminal records have close to zero percent chance of becoming a teacher in this state), and I went through a period of time over the summer when I just had absolutely no idea what to do with my life. I went through a phase where I wanted to become a musician, since I have a huge passion for music. However, I eventually reasoned through that by telling myself that my chances of getting a job as a musician are slim even *without* a criminal record. I eventually settled with Biomedical Engineering, which I am *incredibly* happy with. I feel comfortable with doing this. However, that period last summer really did a toll on me. I felt numb for weeks and weeks, not depressed but just *numb*. Like all the emotion was just drained out of me. I moved past that phase when I went back to school, but I sometimes get flashbacks to that part of my life. It was incredibly dark. I used to listen to lots of music, but I was so emotionally drained that I completely stopped. I would watch movies and start weeping at the dumbest little things for no reason, and then have no idea what was going on with the plot. I would listen to music and just hear sound, not music. It really changed me, but I moved on from that part in my life. It kinda feels like I made it out of the deep dark hole, but now I'm just in a more complicated cave with a little light here and there, even though I know the surface is just above my head."

My manager approached me the other day, and I suggested that we give the clients an option if they would like cloud based storage. He loved the idea, and put me in charge of the project. I'm supposed to research the information, throw it past the coworker, and set it up.

I'm unsure where to start from since I'm not very familiar with cloud based OS's and also server models. I setup a local backup server running sshfs and also vsftpd. It also doesn't help that my other coworker is on vacation for the next two weeks.

IS there any type of cloud based OS's and also any type of free, (preferably open source) software that will connect to the cloud, and use it as a removable drive? (Similar to SSHFS and also Expandrive)

My questions are at the end, but a very short TL;DR is money's getting me down, or rather, a lack of it.

It's now the 10th straight day I've really been unable to get a good night's sleep, so I might as well just get what's on my mind out there...if that's alright. [](/fluttershy)

I feel terrible.  I recently participated in a gift exchange on the [redacted] subreddit.  I ended up sending the person something that they had indicated they wanted, and more importantly was in my strictly limited budget - which I'll get to in a bit.  It seemed fine when I sent it, but then I received my gift. It was awesome: my match even went as far as to include a hand-drawn picture of Fluttershy with the rest of the gift; it's clear that whoever got my name went and put a ton of thought and effort into it.  As I see people posting photos of what they got, I feel like an ass.  I spent the most I felt I could afford to spend on the gift; things happened between when I signed up for the exchange and the shipping deadline that severely restricted what I can spend on random things.

That gets at my other problem, even perhaps the one that I am losing more sleep over because it has gone on for longer.  I was all excited to do an internship this summer and get paid for doing work that I love to do.  I do love the work, but I'm 6 weeks into the internship and I haven't been paid yet, despite repeated promises that I would be; all the budgeting I did with the help of my parents assumed that I would, in fact, be getting paid something.  I'm getting by with my savings, but just barely; in short if it's not food, rent, or something that has been built into my budget for the last several months, I need to seriously think twice about spending money on it.  What's more, it's clear that I know much more about the specific job I was hired to do than my boss does; I had expected to learn more about the industry and to challenge myself this summer, but I often end up teaching my boss things they didn't know about it.  There's no office I report to either; when my boss wants me to put in face time, I have to drive 30 miles outside the city to *their house* to work.  The description posted with my university made the job sound like exactly the thing I wanted; now I just sit in the dark and write posts that will never see the light of day.

It's so bad that I'm working on starting my own consulting business, if only because I'll actually see something for my efforts and it'll be my own damn fault if I don't get paid.  Despite all the research I've done - on Reddit, through the SBA, etc. - I feel like I have no idea what I'm doing.  I know the actual nuts and bolts of the industry; I've worked in it in some capacity almost the entire time I've been in college.  It's just, I have no idea about how to do formal market research or anything that goes into the business plan.  Also, one of the major projects that I could have used for a portfolio specifically requested not to do so when I finished that internship two years ago, and the other one is still very much a work in progress, leaving the site I have built over the past two weeks as the only thing I can really use.

In short, I feel like I won't be taken seriously enough to get any business.  I know how to do what I do, and I know I do it well; it's just, how do I prove that to potential clients?  I have a blog set up on the subject and I can talk about it for hours on end, but I recognize I'm probably screwed without a portfolio, as people only care about results in this industry, and rightfully so.  On the off chance somepony here has gone through something similar, how did you deal with not having much of a portfolio despite having years of experience?  For anyone who reads this, how can I quiet my fears about this, as well as the feeling like I let down the person I was matched with, if only to be able to get a full night's sleep again?  Even shorter, how can I feel like it's all worth it in the end?  Starting this business is the only positive thing that's happened all summer to me, but I recognize it could be a while before I see any return out of it; something that I'm fine with on my own, as long as there's consistent progress, and it all started on a whim and a realization that ""I can do better"".

So far, I'm not sure if ""doing better"" has been worth almost two weeks of less than 4 hours of sleep/night."

Has anyone been in this situation before? Does anyone have any suggestions?

I have been networking recently to try and get some work experience of any kind. I know its late but I got a final rejection rather late and so I am a bit unprepared.

I have also thought of teaching myself a completely new skill like programming.

**Edit:** Wow, thanks for the responses, it's a lot more than I expected from such a small subreddit.

I think I will also look into doing some charity work as others have suggested and learn programming in my other spare time. I am also still looking at getting some time doing work experience for free in an engineering company if I can.

Sorry if this gets a little long, I have a tendency to ramble.

I'm 5'2"" tall and weigh about 105lbs. 30"" bust, 24"" waist, 35"" hips, though I do often double bra to get me up to a 33"" bust (otherwise I look flat as a table).

I honestly do still look like a child. My facial structure hasn't really matured. I like to play off of that with ruffles and bows as of right now. Since I can't be sexy, I might as well be cute, right? I'm not daring with my clothing, so no bold colors! I'm okay with bold accents though.

PLEASE HELP!",jchung243,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/whgjm/dear_redditmy_girlfriend_is_in_a_bogus_situation/,"My girlfriend is currently in her second year of a CACREP graduate school program (graduate school for counseling) in Illinois. Her counseling program requires a hands on internship, working with high school kids, for 600 hours through the course of the year.  She was told today that in order for her to even begin this internship, or even to set foot on a high school, she would have to pass a certification exam (Type 73) which normally she would have to complete at the end of her program. However, the state of Illinois (or more specifically the Illinois State Board of Education), in its infinite derpdom, has decided to make it law in the past month, for all students to pass certification BEFORE they can even begin internship. 

To make matters worse, since the law was just passed, all students in this type of program all around the state of Illinois, are being forced to take the exam with less than a month's notice, with out even being given a date on which the exam will take place.  They are still deciding if it will be on August 4th or August 11th. Since they don't have a set date, none of the students can even register. Since none of the students have registered, all of the students will be required to pay double the fee of $86, as well as additional ""emergency fees"", adding up to over $200 worth of mandatory fees.

And it gets worse. The state has decided that they don't have to give the results back for an entire month, long after many high schools have already started.  Many students have already planned their internships around school dates, but now they are being required to push back all of their starting dates till whenever the state returns the result of the test.  Because of this, many students will have to make up for lost hours during the year to reach the required 600 hours...in the case of my girlfriend, she is going to have to make up around 60-80 hours, on top of an almost impossibly busy schedule requiring her to be in class or at work from 9am-10pm or later every single day.

Currently, some students are trying to call the state and see if there is anything they can do but so far all they have gotten are recorded messages saying that no one is available to take their call.  

I'm sure that the government pretty much has leeway to do shit like this, but it most definitely is not fair for the thousands of students that will be out $200 and 60 or more hours of their lives. I feel like their should be some sort of grandfather clause exempting this year's students from being forced into something like this so last minute… Is there anything at all that we can do to contact state representatives or something like that? All I can think of right now is to call the state representatives office or write a strongly worded letter…

PLEASE HELP REDDIT…any advice is appreciated…and even if you have no advice, the upvotes for publicity would be much appreciated as well.

whd8m,6,2012-07-13,Grad school for the wrong reasons?,ireallylikedogs,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/whd8m/grad_school_for_the_wrong_reasons/,"**Background**

Hi, I'm one year out of college, and am considering continuing on to grad school. I majored in applied math as well as cognitive neuroscience (minor in cs) at a top tier school, though I floated around in my subject matter for quite a bit. At first I wanted to do bioinformatics - I did some coursework, loved it, then grew tired of it. Then I was really into brains. I did some coursework, loved it - then I did some lab work and hated it. I also had lasting love affairs with media studies, sociology, philosophy, and law.

When I graduated, I had no idea what I wanted to do. A friend told me that a poli sci research group needed someone to do some web design and some database work for the administration side of their team. I joined them, worked on the admin-y stuff for a summer, and befriended the poli sci grad students. My work was mildly interesting (at best), but I grew really fascinated with the grad students' projects. The lab did very data heavy empirical work with some really cutting edge modeling. I worked out a transition from the admin side of things to becoming a research assistant to the grad students. I loved the work that I did for them. I got to satisfy many of my academic 'needs' such as doing math, coding, and thinking about behavior and the law.

Anyway, I left the group I was working with to accept a summer internship at a top tier law school to do research under some of my favorite legal researchers. It's a great experience, and I am still able to take a data driven look at law and culture.

But, this internship is ending soon, and I'm not sure where to head next. Some days private sector work sounds exciting. Other days, it's academia.

**Questions actually start here**


I have a few worries about going back to school, and am wondering if you might have any input to help me think about this:

* I've been very academically fickle in the past, and am not sure if this phase is over. I 'dated' poli sci (and loved it) for about one year after graduation, but I still don't know if it's ""the one."" Should I try a stint in the private sector, and see if I still yearn for it after a year or two?

* Poli sci was attractive because I got to do math with an interesting subject matter. I *may* be more excited about the math behind poli sci than the poli sci itself. I'm also very interested in the private sector applications of the modeling skills I would pick up during the phd process and am realistic about the slim probabilities of successfully becoming a professor. Is this the wrong kind of mindset?

* I would most likely go back to my undergrad institution for grad school. This is due to strong connections with the faculty in the poli sci department who are willing to look beyond my not 3.5+ gpa. I also know with whom I would want to work with, and which outside courses (especially stuff within the math and cs departments) I would wish to take. There is a sense that I would be moving back to a place that I am 'comfortable'. Is this a bad idea?

* I also know what the conditions of the grad students at my alma mater are. They live pretty nice lives, have good offices, and are happy almost all of the time. Placement is very good as well. I think I could really thrive there, but I haven't seen anything else, so I don't know how this compares.

whckr,28,2012-07-12,tips for dealing with an overwhelmingly male dominated workplace?,[deleted],SRSWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/SRSWomen/comments/whckr/tips_for_dealing_with_an_overwhelmingly_male/,"I'm an intern in NYC for the summer at a software company. While I wasn't expecting a great gender ratio, I was flabbergasted to find out that I'm the only female in a department of ~50. I come from a school with about a 30-70 ratio in the CS department, so this is a big change for me.

My co-workers have been polite and respectful, for the most part. Today one of my co-workers asked about the gender ratio at my school. I told him, and mentioned that I was surprised that there were no female engineers in the department, especially since it was relatively large and successful company. 

He then conversed about past experiences, and mentioned that at his last job there was only one female engineer as well...but was dismissive about it, saying: ""oh, but she was kinda just one of the guys... drinking beer and playing paintball""

That immediately made me cringe. I am going to go paintballing next tuesday. We were holding this conversation over a beer. I am a software engineer, and participate in many other male-dominated activities. And here he is, unwittingly insinuating that I too wasn't really female, was just kind of 'one of the guys'.

I responded, ""hey, women can do those things too""...and then he rapidly excused himself from the conversation saying something about ""I hope I wasn't too sexist"".

Is this legal??",animousity692,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/whama/intership_overpaid_me_last_summer_now_this_summer/,"Last summer I worked at this internship. Apparently there was some confusion for a while because even though my supervisor KNEW I was working 7 hours a day, they were paying me for eight. This was noticed after a month and stopped. I wasn't trying to ""get away"" with anything, trust me. 

Now this summer, I decided to work at the same internship. They didn't even know I was coming back. So with a raise I began working again and noticed that my checks looked awfully skimpy for what I was making and my hours. I finally knew something was up when I made just $375 for 45 hours (I make 14.66/hour). With much difficulty I got someone to investigate only to be told, through email, that I had an active debit account since they overpaid me ""40"" hours last year and they were deducting from my wages!

No one EVER notified me that this was going on, and it seems sketchy because this was last summer and they didn't know I was going to comeback. They never told me I owed anything, and I have no way of knowing how much they actually overpaid me.

Is this okay? I get direct deposit and I know it's different in every state, but seriously... I pay rent in shit. Notice or authorization should be required, no? Thanks in advance for advice.

Some hobbies include drawing/sketching, music, interacting with people,graphic design, day dreaming, creating stories of symbolism in everyday things. 

Im starting my 3rd year of community college... This semester I have a lot of psych classes that I haven't started but I might be able to change last minute... I should have been transferred to a university by now but I simply made no movement. So how do I go about doing technical things in advancement, what is an ideal degree?

We are worried that one of the 10 interns who actually qualifies for the $4000 did not receive his or her proper amount. Is this even possible? the check was addressed to each of our names and addresses from the hosting university.

Furthermore, the pdf about the grant states that each intern should be paid in 2 installments. I got a single check. I'm guessing that means the 2 installments deal is a guideline?

I'm sorry that there isn't a TL:DR, but it's too complicated for this :)

A little background on me: I'm a french dude who moved in Los Angeles about 2 years ago, just after getting out of film school and doing a few internships and gigs with friends. I didn't really have a ""network"" yet, so I thought, why not move now? I got a green card in January 2012 and right now, I can't say that I'm living the big life, but I'm booking enough jobs to survive.

I'm not gonna enter the details on how to get a visa. Just know that it's almost impossible to get one working on sets. I married an american and got my green card.

From the moment that I could legally work, I looked up for PA positions on craigslist and Mandy. I came and worked for free. I already had quite a lot of experience (had done a lot of shorts as a student, some other projects with friends, and a union TV show, all in france), which gave me an edge over the rest of PAs. All the free work that I did brought me paid work. I'm gonna detail my attitude below, hoping that it will help you.
Also, you want to ask everyone you know if they have friends in the industry. I got a gig on a major union show through my insurance broker. One of his clients is a very successful AD. He got me to meet him for coffee and bim, 2 weeks later, job.

So here's how to move from being a PA to being the PA that gets called back, in my opinion:

Beginner PAs will, most of the time, SUCK. They're either not motivated, or just don't have experience and you have to explain them things. There's nothing wrong against that, but it's very rare to qualify for future jobs if you still ask questions about the basic stuff. Make sure to remember things the first time, so that you can take the initiative the next.

On the first sets that I did in the US as a PA, I didn't sit. I stayed alert, close to the ADs (not too close, you're only a PA, remember it). Being a PA is boring, and boredom is the enemy of discipline! If you force yourself to pay attention, you will catch things that other PAs won't, and that's how you start to impress people.

I just mentioned staying close to the ADs. I am myself aiming at being an AD. Knowing what you want to do is important. If you want to be with the camera department, there's nothing wrong at the beginning of a shoot to go to the producer, and say:
""hey, I'd like to PA with the camera dept. if possible, or share my time between this and production"". You're a PA, working for free, no one will say no.

Another good point: introducing yourself to people is important. For 2 reasons.
One, you don't want to be the anonymous PA. I see some guys on set who show up and disappear without speaking with them more than a minute.
Two, and that's a personal experience as Key PA or AD, if I need a PA to do something, I feel better asking the guy that looks like he know his way around set rather than radio all the PAs. And that's how you start getting more responsabilities than the other PAs...

You have to be most helpful to the people that hire PAs: Line producer and UPMs. If they know who you are and like you, they will call you back. Hiring PAs is a minute thing in the production prep. Most people are nice, they will hire a few of their friends, and then hire a few good people. You want to be in this category.

As a PA, there are very few moments for you to shine. So, don't wait for order, take the initiative. If you're new, make yourself a list and stay busy. Always:
-check the trash cans : is it overflowing? Can I push trash down to make room?
-Check the crafty table : is it in order? Is the cooler still full? are we running out of water/ice? Radio the producer if so, just giving him a head's up.
-Does the camera dept. need someone to stand in when setting up a shot? Jump in! You don't even need to say anything, they will frame with you. Jump out when you see cast coming back on set.
-Do a trash sweep, clear bottles and cans from the set.
-is it hot on set? grab a flag and vent the actors/crew (ask the ADs first)
-Is it lunch soon? Check that tables and chairs are prepared, radio the AD saying ""lunch as landed, everything is ready""
-Carry a spare radio battery (""hot brick""). When someone asks for one, you'll be 10 feet away. Instant friendship.
-Be very strict on your lock ups. You don't care about being friends with the grips who will talk because ""there's no way the sound guy can hear that"". Grips don't hire PAs or get you jobs. Still, try to not be a dickhead. Diplomacy!
ect ect...there's a lot that people won't ask you to do. If you witness something, write it down to be the one doing it the next time.

Looks like you belong! ADs have their goldfold, Grips their clamps, electricians their C-47...having your gear makes you look prepared! Here's what I would advice:
Go to a hardware store, get a belt and a pouch or 2. Get:
-gloves (for taking trash out or moving heavy objects)
-a pen (several actually, people will steal them :p)
-a sharpie (to mark bottles and other things)
-a knife, or better, a small laserman (you can find some for 10-20 bucks)
-a torchlight/headlamp (makes working at night a lot better)
-small gaffer tape. Very useful to mark actor's position (remember I said to stand in for camera? well now you can mark your position and save your AD some time)

When someone asks you to do something for the first time, don't be hesitant. State that you have never done it, but be confident. Driving a passenger van or making background fill paperwork isn't hard, just intimidating. The sooner you learn, the sooner you get to say ""I've already done this, trust me"".

Follow up with people you worked with. An simple email with a resume asking to forward it to their friends takes no time and can bring you a job!

There are other ways to get work, but they're much less certain. You can track the new productions through the press, and call/walk into the office, looking for the UPM. Like I said, PAs are hire on a whim, so you never know. I got a 2nd 2nd AD gig on a union show like this a long time ago.
Working for new production companies is great. You want to give 200% because new companies won't have their regulars yet. You want to become one of these guys.

You resume:
No one gives a shit about your work at Costco. List things that are relevant to a film set. You can add a little paragraph at the top saying something like: ""I am trying to get my foot in the door, just give me a change to prove myself"". It appeals to something that we all went through.

The bonuses:
-if you can afford to fill a pick up's gas tank, then great, this is the car you should buy. Not 2 weeks ago, I was asked by an AD to go steal 2 shopping carts (don't ask, funny shoot :p). He asked me because I'm the only PA with a pickup. Being on set 24/7 isn't the best way to be called back. Running errands will give you the opportunity to chat with the producers when they give you petty cash, and, most of all, show that you can be trusted with more things that just lock ups.
-Having random stuff in your car. For instance, I have rags, various tools, a few trashbags, twine, ect...A PA doesn't need any skill, but must be able to solve any problem. Be versatile and always prepared.

Be a good person: Be nice to other PAs. If you see a job opportunity for another PA, or an AD you've worked with, send them an email with the craigslist posting. This is a basic life lesson, but if you give, you will receive.
You want to be a nice, confident person. Officially, I'm a Key PA. But I play 1st AD for small shorts. I like to bring on a PA I worked with to play 2nd AD/Key PA. Even if it's a small set and I could do call sheets myself, it gives someone the opportunity to learn. In return, these people have already started to forward me for AD gigs. They still feel too unexperienced or intimidated, so they have their friends call me. Do I really know more than they do? Not so sure.

I'm sure I'm forgetting things, but in the end, the best school is on set. I don't believe in being an office PA to get set gigs. Hasn't worked for me (I interned a lot in offices in france). I'd rather advice to find short gigs, like 2 days spec commercials, where you can work you ass off and then rest, and also meet a lot of people in a short time. a 2 weeks unpaid ULB feature, no so great. 

IT IS A NUMBER'S GAME. The more people you meet, the greater your chances. Luck is a tremendous factor in life, and especially in our field.

Finally, I'm saying this because I'm anticipating it, not because I have a gigantic ego:
If you send me a message asking for a job, most likely I won't be able to get you anything. If I can provide some work, it will go through the list of people that have done some free things for me first. My priority is to pay back the people who gave me their time. This is one of the reasons that it is hard to clim up the ladder. Everyone has a ""list of friends"" that they call first. You goal is to be as close as possible to the top of this list, but it takes time!
I can help though. If you want to send me your info, I can try to get you PA gigs where you'll work for free. I'll either be working myself on a project and need some help, or a friend of mine will. It's not much better than a random craigslist post, but at least you'll have a friend :)

I hope this helps a few people, and remember, it's all worth it when you love your job! And when you get to film a guy on skis pulled by an ATV in a pool full of fake blood. Ahhh...good times!"

You'd think there's a lot of stuff available to do -- and I'm not saying there isn't. I just have no idea how to get out/do stuff/meet people who are into the things I'm into. I have summer homework to do, and an internship, but most of my activities involve me sitting at a computer and typing (programming for my internship, writing and researching for college (apps), reading, gaming, browsing forums), which gets really tiresome after a while.

My interests include reading, (formerly) coding, philosophy, and talking with people. I'm not heavily into sports and I don't do any exercise. I also don't have many friends to reach out to -- I do most of my socializing during the school year.

How can I use my time better, not feel so lonely, and get stuff done?

I am a student with a strong desire to work in public accounting, but I am scared I will not receive an internship opportunity with a public accounting firm because I attend a smaller university.  The reason school size is relevant is because my university does not have the same ties to large public accounting firms as larger universities.  I am entering my senior year in the fall with an expected graduation date of May 2013. 

Currently I intern with a mid-size company and things are going awesome.  It is looking very likely that I will be hired in as a part-time Accounting Assistant (Job duties include entering invoices, assisting our receivables and payables manager, controller, etc.).  I know this experience is very valuable and will look awesome on my resume when I start applying for Winter Tax 2013 internships. 

*Assuming I do not receive an internship with any public accounting firm in the next year:* 

What is the likely-hood of being hired by a public accounting firm after graduating?  

**OR** 

Would a better option be to move on to grad school (probably at a larger university) and try to receive an internship/ job offer that way?  


*Also, I am really unsure how the Big 4 and regional accounting firms recruit:* 

Do they focus primarily on undergraduate students or both graduate and undergrads?

wk7ho,1,2012-07-14,Help for an innocent mistress?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/wk7ho/help_for_an_innocent_mistress/,"This is going to be a long story over the last year, and I really don't know what to do in this situation.

I've had the most interesting of years. Last July, I was at my roommate's wedding and because I was staying up messing around with the best man all night, I was in no shape to drive the 2 hours home the next morning. I had driven my roommate's car from our house to the wedding location, so some other member of the wedding party drove that because they were going to go visit the brides' parents' house anyway. I was left needing a ride back to my house. One of the wedding guests, who we will call Rick for privacy, lives near me and offered me a ride. I accepted. On the way back, we discussed how I was sleeping with the best man (who is in the army and was headed back to his station the next day). I was so in love with that man that I didn't even know what to do. Then Rick and I started discussing other things. Other interests and what we're doing with our lives, and realized we could be really good friends.

So here's Rick's story: He grew up in Texas as an atheist misfit. His father cut him off when he was halfway through college so he was forced to drop out and get a job. Eventually, he saved up enough money to move out to California. Through some unfortunate circumstances, he was red taped out of the UC and instead went to a state school. During his time in California, he completely remodeled his whole persona. He was still the shy little misfit he was back in Texas on the inside, but he was more open and friendly on the outside. Some of his old personality traits were lingering, so he was bad at making friends. He was friends with his roommate, but then his roommate got a girlfriend and the girlfriend decided she didn't like Rick, so Rick was no longer permitted to hang out with the roommate. Rick got lonely. He wasn't interested in making friends at school, because at this point, he was a good five years older than almost all of them. He browsed craigslist and found a girl to date. Turned out, he really liked this girl. After six months they agreed to move in together, and soon after that, they got engaged. She was a vet student who did a lot of externships and left the country and left Rick alone a lot. And she talked him into having an open relationship. He wasn't too keen on the idea, but she talked him into it. After she graduated, she took a year long internship on the east coast, but Rick still had a year left in school here. So he stayed behind, and she went to the east coast. 

This is where I come in. When I got a ride with Rick back to my house, he had just dropped his fiance off back at the airport to go back to the east coast. He was back in the same boat he was when he first moved out here. All the friends that he had now were through his fiance. And since his fiance and all her friends graduated, they all moved away, including my roommates, who I was really close with. So we decided to be friends. I was single and obsessed with that army guy, and he just wanted someone to watch tv with. And we soon became very close and developed a very natural rhythm. It didn't become a question of IF we were going to hang out, but rather when. Since he had an open relationship, he was open to sleeping with me. I was very hesitant at first and more than a little freaked out. He calmed me down and talked me into it. He told me she was absolutely fine with it and it wouldn't be an issue. She congratulated him for bagging such a hot chick (me). 

It was more than that, though. I don't think she really understood just how close we got. He changed so much about me for the better. I have grown so much over the last year because of him. I am so far over that army guy, that it's absolutely hilarious to think about me ever wanting to even date him. I'd never orgasmed before Rick, I never had a real boyfriend. I was scared of the world and a giant pushover. I have so much more confidence now than I did a year ago, my mom noticed it when I went to visit her a week ago. 

He understands me more than anybody else. He can get me to calm down within five minutes every single time. I have never once been mad at him for more than five minutes. I take care of him because he's a giant manchild that can't handle basic tasks associated with living like grocery shopping, or checking his mail. He would have had a horrible year last year when it wasn't for me. And at some point during that year, I fell in love with him. Real love. Not infatuation *OMGHE'SSOHOTANDGOODINBED* more of a ""I never want him to be away from me ever again"" He drives me up the wall sometimes with his insistence on being right, but there was never a point where I didn't want to hang out with him. I never wanted to leave. I've never had that before. I am an exceedingly impatient and easily annoyed person. I hated the last two guys I dated before Rick, but stuck with them because that's what I thought a relationship was. While I was with Rick, I dated other people. I gave up on them after 2 weeks each because they were annoying as fuck. I just didn't want to hang out with anyone else. Rick was what I wanted to do just all the time. 

The whole time, there was never ever a question that he was going to leave me around this time to go marry his fiance and live happily ever after. When I first was involved, I was worried I'd be hurt. And I was. It hurt to have him leave me. I was lonely, but I grew so much as a person with him, that it wasn't a huge handicap for me. Life went on. I'm interested in another guy, and Rick isn't on my mind all the time. Because I knew he was going to be happy. Right? That's all I want. As long as he's happy, I'm happy. I'll find someone like him, and then it'll be my turn to live happily ever after.

But is he happy? She's an emergency veterinarian and her internship drove her to the brink of insanity. She was super stressed out and called ihim on the phone crying multiple times a week because her life sucked so much. It really did. Her life was awful. And she was all alone, completely miserable... but she refused to quit. Absolutely refused to leave. Would it have hurt her future career very much if she had? Probably not enough to validate putting herself through hell for that year. I never said anything, because I didn't want to give him up before my year had expired. She also practically killed herself with stress over the wedding, which is a destination wedding that he didn't really want to do. But whatever, he said, it's her day, not mine. He would tell me little things about her. Most of which were negative. He's a guy that always makes fun of me and points out faults and fallacies at every opportunity, so I didn't think it was that odd of him to make fun of her basically the same way he made fun of everyone else he knows. But over this last year, I just watched. I never saw him describe her with much affection, he rarely said anything positive about her (but I think he did this to spare my feelings) and there are a lot of negative things about her. She's an impulsive, selfish, bossy, stubborn, impatient girl who drinks a lot, yells a lot, and has no interest in taking care of him. He says he's happy. So I was inclined to believe him. She has too many pets and adopts them spontaneously when they shouldn't have this many pets. They have two dogs, two cats, a hedgehog, and two geckos. She had the dogs with her during her internship. When she was working over 100 hours a week. He kept one of the cats and the caged animals. She actually went to the east coast with one dog. She decided she wanted to adopt the other one cause the dog was going to be euthanized if she didn't. I have both dogs in my house now while they're going to their destination wedding, and they're not housetrained. A chair and about 12 of my roommate's dvds have been ruined because this dog keeps peeing on them. It's over 100 degrees outside, so I can't leave them there while I'm gone, so I just have to deal with pee all over my house. 

Today, I started talking to my old roommate who has known both of them for years. She told me basically that she's been worried for a while about this relationship. She doesn't think they're very good together because the girl is crazy and I would be much better for him. I don't know the fiance very well, and I'm thinking about one of the stories from Rick's past. He constantly talks about his ex-fiance who was really stupid, really mean, and all his friends didn't want her around because she was a giant bitch. I asked why he stayed with her and he shrugged and said ""She was nice to me."" and one day i asked why he wanted to marry her in the first place and he said ""Cause I grew up with her."" 

I've already actively tried to move on, and I'm not that upset about not having him around, but I'm worried about Rick and am actually concerned he might be making a mistake. What should I do?"

* I'll be using it to supplement food, a car insurance payment, and part of my rent payment (had my landlord push it back to the 15th instead of the 1st, which I'll still be a few days late on)
* I'm in Dallas, TX

I am in Dallas on an internship that pays $1000 ($885~ after taxes) every two weeks. Since I wasn't able to find a sub-lease for my apartment in Lubbock where I go to grad school, I had to pay for two sets of rent this summer. That paired with a poorly timed car insurance bill has left my checking account &lt;$100 (car insurance is now monthly since i couldn't cover the whole 6-month payment). I am really regretting not having a credit card at this moment since it would easily cover me and I'd be able to pay it off in full without issue.

To give you more information, here is how I see my expenses going in the next two weeks in chronological order:

* 7-14-2012 Starting Balance - $75
* 7-16-2012 Last paycheck entering my account - $885 (balance $960)
* 7-16-2012 Paying second half of summer's rent to land lord - ($875) (balance $85)
* 7-17 -&gt; 7-22-2012 Misc expenses - Assuming $0 for the sake of this
* 7-23-2012 Paying monthly car insurance - ($78) (balance $7)
* 7-24 -&gt; 7-25-2012 Misc expenses - Assuming $0 again (balance still $7)
* 7-26-2012 Incoming paycheck from work - $885 (balance $892) - There is a bit of a difference between when I get paid and when the money gets to my account though so it'll hit my account more likely on 7-30 or 7-31

Obviously, the loan would go towards the misc expenses in the next two weeks. This will pay for food, gas, and anything else that may come up. I have a paypal that the loan can be transferred to. I'd then transfer it to my checking account. Then once I got paid, I'd transfer it to my paypal account and back to you. These delays probably put my payback time to be around August 2-3rd. If you need to see a report from annualcreditreport.com, I am sure I can produce one to show my impeccable payment history (0 missed or late payments).

Let me know if you need more info.

Thanks

Regardless, there is a lot of progress left to be made, but today I am taking the time for this small celebration with all of you.

[50 pounds gone](http://i.imgur.com/jyXss.jpg)

I mostly focused on calorie counting. The aptly named app LoseIt has been  very helpful, though more recently I've been able to do the calculations more quickly in my head. I aim for around 1800 calories a day at this point. I tried 1600 but felt crappy too often.

in the last month and a half I've introduced notable exercise, jogging 3 times a week. I've been following the Couch-2-5k program through an app on my phone. I've consistently gotten faster, but the times are.... unimpressive. However, its allowance for you to repeat weeks of parts of a week rather than advance has proved important on the course becoming not too challenging as for me to become frustrated

Summer has been rough, I'm staying in an unfamiliar college dorm for an internship with no kitchen. My loss has slowed due to a dietary limitation, and corporate functions and luncheons. The exercise has helped temper this, but I know better than to try and out-exercise a bad diet. Still, I have not gained, and never stopped losing for more than 2 or 3 weeks.

I need to lose 100 more before I'll really start heading into maintenance mode, but I'm sure inspiration and reevaluation will come as the challenge grows and new obstacles come into play. But for today, I'm pleased."

I broke up with my ex (20 F) last September and I made the mistake of seeing her very regularly and speaking with her, up until June 14th. We were having a fight because I called her out on making up an excuse not to visit me,and something clicked--I realized that she was a lying, opportunistic, soulless person who would take advantage of my trust for as long as she could.


I was very much a wreck after we stopped talking, but I found proof that I was right in our last argument the day after we fought, so at least I had *something* to hold on to. the last month has been very eventful for me-- got beaten up by a bouncer, got two jobs and an internship, been volunteering for political organizations, studying for the lsats-- but nothing could truly take her off of my mind. my ex didn't have a facebook, so i blocked her closest friend, but i would still look at her other friends' pages, just hoping that someone posted a picture of her. looking at her twitter always resulted in me wanting to throw up, so i made myself stop that a while ago.

I know I'm not out of the woods yet, and while I'm currently at home, where running into her in person is *extremely* unlikely, I'll be up at school in just over 6 weeks, where we'll be living down the block from each other. My goal is to be able to pass her on the street, give her the slightest acknowledgement that I know her, and keep walking by, and I think I'm at the point where this is a very likely possibility.  


If I had to pick one thing that really made this process a lot easier for me, it was the fact that I started talking to other girls who I was interested in.  It sounds like such a simple solution, but I had no idea how effective it could be.  My friends used to tell me ""get a hobby,"" or ""do something to occupy your mind,"" but I always greatly underestimated how much my mind would be occupied if I even just started talking to other girls. 


Guys and girls, it does get easier. Part of the whole process of breaking up is realizing that it's actually over, and that the life you envisioned for yourself before your breakup is already over.  Now you have a new life and so many opportunities to cultivate new relationships, revisit old ones with old friends, or just have some time for yourself. Just repeat the mantra; No Contact, Block On Facebook, Gym. We're all going to get through this-- we're better than them, and we'll show them that we deserve better than what they offered us. Stay strong. "

This guy I have a thing for that I've only met once (over a couple days on vacation) is coming to my town for freelance work, and I offered to let him stay with me to save on costs. I've got an extra bedroom so it wasn't a direct come-on for a sexcation, but the one time we met, our chemistry was undeniable and he kissed me, right before I left for my flight. We've been flirting pretty heavily ever since. For reference, he's 26 and I'm 22(F) and we live about a 5 hour plane ride apart, though that could easily change within a few years because we're both big travelers/not tied to our cities.

At this point, it could go either way, but I highly doubt he'll actually use that extra bedroom... I can't stop thinking about being with him, but it scares me to think it might just be a one week stand and then I'll never hear from him again. It could be a while before we see each other again after that because I have a 9-month internship abroad, and in light of that it wouldn't hurt me if we slept with other people in the meantime, but I have really high hopes that we could continue whenever we're in the same city again. Maybe even eventually make it something real. I might be getting ahead of myself here but it's rare that I feel an all-consuming crush like this (the last was my last long term boyfriend who I truly believed was the one, until he started showing some true colours, but I'm over that one) and I really don't want to let it go as a casual weeklong hookup. I know he's a good guy because we met through a mutual friend. This friend though is quite the gossip though and we decided to keep it secret.

Has anyone got stories similar where this has worked, or any good advice? Or just tell me to cheer up if I'm being silly and get over this one? :( How can I entice him during the week we'll be together so he doesn't write me off as soon as he gets home? Or should I just let myself have a really sexy week living in the moment and then forget about him?

TLDR; Should I settle for a weeklong hookup with a guy I'm crazy about and then let it go, even though I haven't felt this way about anyone in years?"

I just got a good internship at a fortune 500 company trying to save every dollar I have so I can go to London my last semester and do an internship to expand my skillset and explore my birthplace. This has been everything I've been working for over the last 18 months. I put in extra hours at work (2 hour commute) at a shitty jimmy buffet restaurant while going to school full time. I didn't mind. Whenever I was on the train back home at midnight I just thought about the pay off.... All the sacrifices I was making would be worth it in the fall.... why I was doing all this. 

Then today I got some soul-crunching news. My parents were in a jam and had to pay off some debt collectors this week or they were going to be evicted. I don't have much money, but I gave it to them. Even though they weren't the most financially savvy parents in the world they tried as hard as they fucking could to provide me and my brother with a happy childhood. What was I supposed to do?

But now I sit here just crushed..... 18 months of work, blood, and sweat gone. Going to london in the fall was the only thing keeping me going in some of my darker moments. The thought of escaping from all of my BS was a real motivator for me.... Now thats its gone I don't know what to do. I've given my parents everything (~$8k).

How do I turn an unwanted flirt from a platonic business contact without leading him on, offending him, or losing the contact? To note, yes, I am a female!

Backstory:

About a year ago I left my country to backpack around Asia. I got bumped to first class and sat next to a successful businessman who is also on the board of my dream grad school. We exchanged a few innocuous messages over the last year and tried to meet up when our schedules overlapped but it fell through.

I never thought our exchanges were flirty. In fact, he connected me with his daughter (3 years younger than I!!) so I could help her get an internship.

I'm on my way back to his city and yesterday he messaged me to share his schedule and also said ""I feel like I already know you so well after our great plane conversation and your updates on Facebook :-)."" To note-- I did not get a creepy vibe from him, he's just 20 years older than I and therefore not my type.

How should I respond? I was thinking of something like this: ""Facebook is definitely the great advertiser but can't articulate experiences [generic travel story 1] or [generic travel story 2]. I look forward to sharing! Also, now that I'm transitioning from 'gleefully FUNemployed' to 'uneasily unemployed' I hope to be able to bounce some career questions off of you.""

What do you think? 

Thanks!!!

TL/DR: how do I get an important business man to focus on my big brain instead of big boobs?

I'm a materials engineer at UIUC and I'm also pre-med. I will be a sophomore in the fall. Currently I am taking a class and doing research.
My question is for the upcoming summer after my sophomore year, should I be more vested into getting a research position at the school, or an internship position with a company? I am pre-med which makes me think research is better, but then again materials engineering is ranked like 1 or 2 in the nation here, which would give me a better opportunity for a good internship. Thoughts? Is there a research+internship position that would provide the best of both worlds?

I intern at a hospital's IT Department, and we basically run off an ""RFS Ticket System"" where nurses around the hospital send in a ticket if they're having issues with their computer/software, whatever the case may be. 

Now in this program, the nurses can specify how urgent the issue is. So I got this ticket which was specified as a ""Priority Level 1 - Severely Urgent"" which means we have to resolve the issue within one hour upon reading.

I opened up the ticket, and read the description....sure enough palms were met with the forehead...

The ticket stated ""Mouse unplugged, need assistance in reconnecting mouse."" Completely dumbfounded, I gave the nurse, who sent in the ticket, a call. 

Me: ""Hi, I recently received your ticket about a mouse issue? Could you give me more information about it?""

Nurse: ""Yeah I dunno it just won't work, someone said that it might have been unplugged but could you please come down and take a look at it?""

Me: ""Ma'am could you please turn the mouse over and tell me if so you see a red light on the bottom of the mouse""

Nurse: ""Yeah, there's no red light""

Me: ""Okay, could you go to the back of your computer and tell me if you see an unplugged USB cable""

Nurse: ""I don't see anything, just a thick black cable and a blue cable going into the computer""

**At this point I'm pulling a ""Jean-Luc Picard"" facepalm as I've spent 5 1/2 minutes trying to get this lady to plug in a mouse**

Me: ""No Ma'am that's the monitor, can you look behind the...big black box...next to the monitor""

Nurse: ""Oh yes, I see it""

Me: ""Ok, now plug it in to the USB port in the back of the computer""

**I can obviously hear she's struggling, and she says it won't fit**

Nurse: ""I'm trying, but it just won't go in to the hole"" 
(Sincerely,
- She)

Me: ""Alright I'll be right over so we can get this issue resolved""

**After about 10 minutes, walking over and waiting for the elevator to get to the 10th floor, I ask her to show me where she was plugging the USB cable in, and low-and-behold she was attempting to put it into the HDMI port**

I showed her where the USB ports were, and plugged it in for her. 

Nurse: ""Now the monitor won't turn on""

Me: ""Push the power button on the monitor""

**She reaches for the power button on the computer**

Me: ""No Ma'am, it's right here""

Nurse: ""Ohhh, thank you""

wjaih,10,2012-07-13,Help with understanding this condition,zompires,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/wjaih/help_with_understanding_this_condition/,"
I've been dating this wonderful girl for almost 2 years.  A couple months ago I proposed to her and we've been ecstatically engaged. She is the love of my life and I would do anything for her.

Anyway, I'm posting here because recently she's been bad about taking her meds and so she's having a little episode. I would just like to have a better understanding of her condition and what I can do to deal with it better and help any way I can.

In the beginning of our relationship I quickly learned she was very emotional and irritable at times. Infact, she tried to break up with me almost every week and was so pessimistic about our relationship, but I never gave up. And our love grew and grew and now we can't live without the other. I am her rock, and she is my comfort and support.

 I've dealt with her having issues with depression, cutting, etc in the past.
But what I would like to avoid is what happened one evening when we had been dating about 6 months. In a rather dramatic turn of events, she tried to put a knife in her throat and I stopped her with my bare hands. She claimed it was for my attention, but I think that was to keep me from freaking out from her losing control for a moment.

I don't ever want to deal with an evening like that again. And I haven't. And I don't think I ever will again. She's completely changed from the way she was when we first started dating.

She's changed medications. (she is now on Seroquel and Wellbutrin.) and had regular therapy sessions for several months, and she was doing AMAZING. She graduated with her bachelor's and is currently on internship and was offered a job after just 3 weeks.

Recently though- and the whole point of my post- she's been so busy with life and work that she's been slipping on her strict nightly combo of pills and now she's having a little freakout. She feels depressed, overwhelmed, irritable, anxious, and very emotionally volatile.

She's confiding in me and is getting support and security from me. She's tiny little thing and will just ball up in my lap and I'll hold her in my arms and tell her everything's gonna be ok while she cries in my chest.


TL;DR:
I just want to be better at helping her with this stuff. And I want to understand her condition as much as possible. All the ins and outs.

Explain to me how bipolar affects a persons mind. Symptoms, perspective of their feelings, etc.

The more I know the better I can help.

Thank you reddit."

I'm worth the investment of their attention because I can't just go find a job for the next 3 summers, so they can trust me to stay if they let me legitimately learn about the business.

How do I set this up, though? Do I just walk in the doors dressed nicely with my resume and ask to speak to someone? What do I need to do in terms of preparation and strategy? How do I find that one first contact to vouch for me? 

Finally, do you have any other suggestions of things I should consider? I'd like to step right into a salaried career after I complete my PhD, either in industry or academia.

We go to the same university, but for the summer(seven more weeks), we have internships at different companies in different states. I'm also new to anything around dating and haven't considered these sorts of thoughts before. I'm also probably naive about things, so fire away and point out my thinking flaws.

---

We were good friends before the summer, but we've been in communication, and by now I do consider her one of my closest friends. That's mutual too. She cares about me as a close friend.

I mean.. we talk every morning before deciding that we both need to get work done, distract each other over useless things every few hours, and 4/7 days hang out on skype in the evening for an hour or two before one of us starts falling asleep at the computer.

I haven't really ever had a girl(let alone any friend. Dude communication is infrequent) spend this much time with me, and I'm falling for her. A category of one of my favorite moments is her chatting/texting to me some message that isn't about anything important to &lt;get my attention&gt;/&lt;force me to context switch from my work&gt; :). Makes me feel loved(as in it's nice to know that someone is thinking about me sometimes).

I do want to ask her out, but it seems like that could be sort of weird.. over skype. [Actually, I'm not even sure if in this context if that is equivalent to 'be my girlfriend' as opposed to 'go on a date somewhere'(which can't actually happen)]. If that were to work out, would that just mean we'd probably stare at each other in skype more? At the same time, it also seems pretty lame to sit around for seven more weeks and have this avalanche into a giant crush of sorts.

Not even sure how to phrase such a question. How could I ask in a way such that if she wants to remain as friends, then we could? Because I really do value her friendship. Some part of me thinks I might just speak to her the first sentence of the previous paragraph then ask if she would be my girlfriend. But then I want to make a smooth path for her to ensure that we can interact in the same way in the case that she doesn't want to be in a relationship with me. Not a fan of the notion of putting much unfortunate pressure on her. I do fear rejection(cause that moment seems like it'd be awkward), but I fear the loss of this friendship more(cause that really matters).

Thanks a ton -- It helps just to write this out actually.

A little help?,[deleted],seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/wj33d/confused_about_how_to_proceed_a_little_help/,"I went out for drinks with a couple people I met through work the other night.  We don't work together, but our jobs (all summer internships) require us to interact several times a month, and we've frequently talked about getting together after work.  One of these people is a solid 10.  We had pretty good rapport while we here hanging out, and it really didn't even occur to me to make a play.  I was just hanging out, being my funny and confident self.

About 30 minutes after we all split up, I go to text her and realize I don't have her number (we'd only been communicating by email so far).  So I shoot her an email basically saying, ""Hey, was just about to txt you and realized I don't have your number.  Digits?""  Digits arrive in 2 minutes with a ""thanks for coming out tonight.""  I text back something similar.  Now I'm interested in the play.

The next day I start doing some back and forth flirting texts, things are going fine.  And this is where I get confused.  I say we should hang out sunday afternoon.  I say a specific fun thing I want to do, and frame it to sound exciting, but not too exciting.  She says ""That sounds awesome.  I might be going to the beach but I'll let you know.""  Not wanting to allow that ambiguity to stand, I go for the McConaughey, and  say, ""yeah, the beach is fun, but there's no comparison with [what i suggested].  You should come, it'll be fun.""

No response.  And so I think, oh well, I didn't balance the aggression/desperation thing well enough.  No worries, plenty of girls, etc.

And then, 2 hours later she responds ""Keep me posted!""

So, I don't know what that means (literally, not just in a seddit context), let alone how/if to proceed here.  Any thoughts?"

I would say everything has gone well and I've been really happy in the last year. About four months ago, I moved back to my home city for a summer internship. This made our relationship into a slight LDR, it's about a two an a half hour drive each way. Our schedule conflicts so we try to see each-other on weekends twice a month. 

My boyfriend implied to me he is losing interest in our relationship. He told me he feels it's not as fun as it used to be. He has asked me to plan our dates so it's not the generic couples night. I'll be the first to admit, I'm not spontaneous. I do like to try new things but I'm uncreative when it comes to planning. 

I feel really pressured because he's unhappy. It's to the point I want to make an excuse to cancel the visit. I feel like, if I an wasting his time if he's disappointed. It doesn't help that I have a perfectionist attitude towards everything. 

So RA, I'm asking how can better the situation because it's stressing me out. And what are some fun things I can plan for us?

Is she something special or just a very long lasting crush.,IsSheIt,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/wm5kg/one_particular_girl_is_stuck_in_my_head_for_the/,"So first off  I'm a 22(M) and she is a 19(F). The relationship was quite short, about two months give or take. We only went out on a couple of dates. I got to know her as we both worked for a hotel last summer. Well we hit it off big time, I can honestly say that I have never had that  much chemistry with any girl before. Our friendship continued the thrive until the end of the summer. I would have liked it to be more than friendship, but I didn't want to risk loosing a friend.

At the end of Summer there was a staff barbecue in the local pub. At which I ended up [browning out.](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=browning%20out) One of the big memories I remembered that night was her tongue wedged down my throat, as my friend drove us home (Side note: I said some pretty stupid things to her on the journey home). The next morning I was a mixture of joy(because i had finally gotten the girl ) and sadness (what if she doesn't remember what happened,or if she remembered what i was saying to her and and thought out i was some sort of weirdo ). Well despite what a jackass i was in the car,she agrees to go the cinema with me and makes the first move.The last time we went out as i dropped her to her parents house we waited in side my car for her parents to come back(she was locked out) As her father approaches the driveway she stops kissing me and says 'I'm not going to kiss you again'. Oh if only I had know line was cruel foreshadowing.

 I thought things were going great we were calling each other every day (different colleges). But slowly things started to wind down texts become less frequent and we started to see each other less and less.
 Eventually I give up on texting her. My logic on that was if she wanted this to continue she could call me.Our communication dropped off to zero eventually. Seeing as I was a young man about town I decided to find someone young and single to have fun with. But no matter what she was there in the back of my mind and had become a standard that I would base women on. Because even though i didn't realize it at the time she was the one i wanted.

Part of my college course involved going on an internship to a company in a different part of the country, in January so the time  I would be seeing her would be slim to none. A perfect way to get over her 100 percent in 6 months. She became less and less present in my mind  although still present not as much. 

That was up until today when I went back to work at the hotel and she was there the instant I saw here I had butterflies in my stomach i could feel my heart beat a million times an hour, I was flustered and  I knew I had to be with her or erase her from my mind. So now I ask you /r/relationships how do I either 
* A: Get over her 
* B: Get back with her

Tl:Dr fell in love with a girl. Go out with girl. Stop going out with girl. Cant stop thinking about girl. See girl in person realize she could be girl of my dreams or my brain is just an asshole."

wm491,1,2012-07-15,Growing up?,john2o01,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/wm491/growing_up/,"Sorry one of my first self posts is a rant. But i just feel kind of alone here. I recently moved to indianapolis. I was having a great time and all at the beginning of the summer, but my trees started to run low. When i started to ask around to the few people I knew here if they had any connects, a weird coincidence started occurring. Everyone started to answer, no and everyone I know has grown up and doesn't do weed anymore.

I haven't said too much to anyone other than my only frient here, my roommate. We came to the conclusion since when does growing up mean you can't smoke? I don't view it as an immature trait or hobby but something that has brought forth some of the most interesting, intellectual, and thought-provoking conversations I have ever had with both close friends and random strangers. I look at these people that are telling me this, and they are people who had kids before they graduated college, dropped out of college, or have some fast food/small retail related job. I am not disrespecting any of you who might have one or more of these traits. But I then return to looking at myself, I'm in college paying for it by myself, I have a nice internship and make about 2 to 3 times that of all the people who told me this, and when I look at my future compared to theirs, I am reaching for my dreams and they gave up on theirs a while ago.

So it just seems to bring the question to mind, was it really that they felt they grew up, or they gave up on the life that they once admired and the dreams they once sought. I think of myself as a professional intelligent, and mature young man, and I smoke weed. I am ""grown up"" since when does the latter mean i'm not? And the last thought it brings is that this gross mentality only means one thing for me, no tree for the foreseeable future.

If you read this and feel that you can relate, take a hit for me and my frient roommate for it will be awhile for us, and have a good intellectual conversation with your frients.

When my mom brought my grandma over, I discovered that she can barely walk (needs a walker, will fall over if not wearing shoes), can't stand up from a sitting position, etc. It's pretty severe.

So, when my grandma was napping this afternoon, my mom and I sat down to make a schedule of who could take care of her at what times. I've just started the summer quarter of classes, and nearly ANY time that I'm not in class, I'll have to be home to care for my grandma. Responsibilities will include helping her move from point A to point B, lifting her up when she needs to stand, cooking her meals, making sure she takes her medicine, helping her use the bathroom, and possibly driving her to and from doctor's appointments and extended family's house. I'll have to start caring for my grandma tomorrow morning, and I won't have anyone around to help me.

I'm a senior in college and taking 16 hours of very project-intense major classes, and my available homework time has pretty much vanished during arguably the most important period in my schooling. I'm supposed to be looking for internships now, but I won't have the time or portfolio to do so.

Between seeing my grandma in such terrible shape, and having my life essentially turned on its side to care for her, I'm having a hard time trying not to just break down sobbing.

My mom is gone from the house about 12 hours a day for work. My dad is the supervisor of his office and they're short several employees, so he can't take much time off of work to help.

Extended family runs their own business and can work from home. Their kids are home for the summer since they're still in high school or middle school (can't remember).

My grandma can't climb stairs, and our only showers/bathtubs are on the second floor. We have no spare bedroom, so she'll probably be sleeping either on a couch or a mattress we put in the living room.

I love my grandma, but as a person, I am not equipped to be a caregiver at all. I'm pretty well convinced that she would do far better in an assisted living home staffed with medical professionals than she would do in my family's home staffed by me.

How do I even go about bringing up this conversation with my family? I don't want to be such a major caregiver but I feel like I have no choice. I can't force my extended family back into taking care of my grandma, but the other option is that I sacrifice the time I'd planned to spend building my future.

TL;DR: I just found out that my grandma had a stroke and I have to spend large portions of each day (basically, when I'm not in class) caring for her, to the extent that it will negatively impact my classwork, and I start being a caregiver tomorrow morning. Our house is not set up to be accessible to her, and I don't want this responsibility. How do I negotiate this with the immediate and extended family?

UPDATE: I talked to my dad and he agrees with me, since he would be doing the other major chunk of caretaking and does not feel even close to comfortable with it. It looks like he's going to lead the charge of finding a better situation for my grandma, so any advice on what to look for in assisted living or something similar would be very appreciated!

UPDATE 2: My grandma does not want to stay with us tonight, and probably not any night, because we don't have a bed for her. Looks like the parents will be sorting out what to do and hopefully it'll work out for the best."

wm0cs,21,2012-07-15,The Reich fell...,_dbb_,Civcraft,https://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/wm0cs/the_reich_fell/,"Well, that's it I guess.


I now say what I think in person, the rest of the Reich may speak for themselves, I have although the backup of most of them.

&gt;A world open to any idea, manifesto or philosophy, created by the players.

We joined with the intention to build up a nation that represents a counterpart to the mostly leftist factions, to quarrel with or to live by. We built our first settlement on the land of stevo_1066 without knowing it was his, and some of us griefed his home, that was sad for him and the more active of us. 

Thats the downside when you come from a chan, there are always some bad trolls. After our first time in the end, the ""trolls"" were gone and we started to build anew on confirmed no-mans-land, willing to live peacefully. We wanted to present a finished town with some left claims for new arrivals and we wanted to secure it against griefers before going public. Then something leaked, maybe it was even me being careless. The rest is so-called history.

Nice job, guys! We wanted to reestablish our faction without any hostile interaction and now we get pearled within a day.

You, Civcrafters, are liars. There is no way a wide spectrum of ideas can be displayed if one side is always grinded down. I stated clearly in my post ""The fourth Reich (second try)"" that National Socialism is only our form of government, intern cases and decision making only. All I got was a shitstorm, people sitting back with popcorn and finally a tiny amount of actual support.

Nevertheless, it was fun for a While, the resource gathering was much more challenging and the unity of my group was much better than on any other minecraft server I've visited so far. Congratulations for that server you got there.

I will be off for now. I first wanted to pledge for a return with another political structure like constitutional monarchy, feudalism or similar, but the group crumbled when the Jacks destroyed our village and most are unwilling to return to this server.

I am still trying to figure what I would like to do for my career, but as of right now I have a growing interest in the design, development, and improvement of renewable energy sources, most notable wind energy. Though this is an interest, I am more than willing to gain experience wherever I can.

My ideal situation would be to apply and get a position in the Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange for Young Professionals. I was offered a position this year, but due to grad school and other commitments I made, I declined and am going to re-apply this year. If I got this, I would cherish the experience, and do my best to find an internship in the program that could lead to full-time work in Germany. If I don't get this position with CBYX, I would like to get any amount of work experience in Germany. This could be through a rotational program, a full time position, or anything.
With this, I am looking to get a feel for the potential ways that I could start networking with companies in Germany. I have started approaching some companies, but the result of this is mainly applying to their online database, and hoping for the best.

This is my final farewell.,throwaway261985,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/wlkt6/it_has_to_be_tomorrow_this_is_my_final_farewell/,"I posted nearly 2 weeks back fixing the day I was going to end it. But I somehow could not get around to it. Feeling scared, lonely and also unsure of how to say the goodbyes. But I have been pushing myself in a deeper corner where the joy and the sunshine of life seem distant and almost dream-like. I thought getting few extra days would help me finish arranging my affairs, but now I can see that it has not. Things are as bad as ever. They might have even gotten worse since I now have exactly 5 euros on me, enough to get to where I need to go. But it also makes me sad. Not only the thought of never hugging my parents again but also the idea of never sharing secrets with my brother, never seeing my friends and never again wondering at the absurdity of life.

It was a short life. And a life that I wish I had lived with more gumption. I was scared of many things and in the quest to appear braver, smarter and tougher, I pushed myself away from the simpler joys in life. And that I will regret. I will also regret not taking risks like my brother and not having his tenacity to truly believe in his ideas and follow them through. I regret not being more compassionate like my parents who put my and my brother's wishes above everything and taught us to think for ourselves. I regret not living in the present due to the stress of the future. 

But I am also thankful for many things. I feel like I have lived through a plethora of emotions, places and ideas. I am thankful for the love of books, cinema and the arts. I am thankful for my family. I am thankful to the many friends I made in my life. I am thankful for the kind of person I turned out to be. 

But I am sorry too. Unlike others here, I do not have a moment in my childhood that I or others could point out and identify as the moment that scarred my mental health. I just have a sense of despair. I felt trapped by history and the political struggle of my people. I felt the brunt of being in exile. When your identity derives first from your political history, you are caught in the churning of history. It is a fate that you cannot escape; yet, I never thought that I would be here today. This sadness is not people-induced. It is not a sadness that stems from others behavior towards me, but rather from a self-realisation of failure. I will never be able to match the high standards and the harsh self criticism that I inflect upon myself. 

So, in all, I have had a good life. I feel very guilty knowing that I will be upsetting the lives of all the people close to me and especially my family. But I want them to remember me the way I was and not the weak broken person that I have become now. I want them to know that I am sorry that I did not tell them or confide in them my state of depression and nervous breakdown. 

Often I have seen or heard people say, ""Could I have foreseen this? Could I have stopped this if I just paid more attention?"". I want you to not be like me that way. I want you to forgive yourself. There is nothing that you could have done. Please do not live with this burden. I live with all my regrets and what-ifs bludgeoning my self-esteem at all moments. I do not want you to go through the same.

I love you. I really do. But I cannot see myself living another day more.  Remember I told you that even in my dreams I could never see myself aging. Maybe I was meant to join the 27 club. Maybe. If you miss me, know that I am around with you at every step. In that song by the velvet underground, in that chance you took in learning something new, in that extra smile at the new person in the room: I am there with you.

So, I have to leave now. I wish you happiness and the best of life. Hope you forgive me for this. It will be hard but one day you will get over this. Please don't forget me. 

love,
T

EDIT 1: I wrote this yesterday as I was desperately looking for a place to crash for the night. I woke up today and I really want to believe that things will solve themselves and that I don't have to do it. But I am running out of places to crash at and the chance to end on a high note. I fear that if I draw it out, I along with many others would suffer more. I am saving the last 5 euros I have for the bus that will take me to the end. But I hesitate. I really do. I saw my family last fall. I would be dead in an unfamiliar country and that does make me worried. Worried that they will get the news over the phone and imagine their failings, even when there are none. I wrote this not only as a farewell that I needed to get off my chest, but also as a place where my brother can find some answers. I created an account with deathswitch and he will get my account details. I hope that being on reddit and meeting some of the amazing people I did will help him through his loss of me, and then he would be strong enough for my parents. I wish for reddit's kindness and tenacity to get my family through this. 

EDIT 2: chatted with brother a little on facebook. He says he is proud of me. Nearly broke my heart. In library now in tears. It is 1.30 pm. Have to board the train at 1.57 to reach my final destination. So scared. Really want to talk to somebody and hear their voice and just tell them to tell my brother that I am sorry. But dont have a phone anymore, and might not be able to access free wifi once I get there. 

EDIT 3: Could not write out individual messages. But **thank you**. I hid in the library bathroom and cried a lot today, probably for the first time in three months. I came clean to a friend who is not in the city at the moment. She is arranging for me to stay over at her place. I will try to reconstruct my life. Going to see a counselor asap. Next week will talk to academic advisor and ask what to do. Finally asked my parents for money. Looking for paid internships for next six months. Still troubled, but I so want to live. Thank you for listening to my whining. I am not done yet. Not giving up on life just yet."
wlfyd,7,2012-07-15,UPDATE. Having a girl spend the night.,awwyeahhlife,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/wlfyd/update_having_a_girl_spend_the_night/,"For a little background on our relationship, feel free to see my last post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/sukkw/what_is_okay_while_being_on_a_break/). For those that are curious, I did end up following his ""rules"" for the break, because I know it would not be a good situation if I didn't.

So when my boyfriend (he's still technically not my bf, but I am just going to call him that for this post to make it easier) and I saw each other for the first time this summer, we talked about where our relationship was going. He decided that we were going to see each other and be exclusive, but not be officially boyfriend/girlfriend yet because I hurt him pretty bad. I thought that was a reasonable agreement and was excited to be able to talk and visit with him again.

We've been having a good time this summer, we went to bonnaroo and have done a lot of fun things. I have been enjoying a lot of my time with him.

Well he has had this friend that is a girl since he started going to college. He would hang out with her a lot, and when I casually mentioned it, he told me not to worry because she has a boyfriend (we talked about this while we were still dating).

So now that we've been exclusively together (his words), I've noticed that whenever we hang out, he's been texting her. I am not exaggerating when I say that it is LITERALLY every time we hang out. I have kept my mouth shut most of the time because I don't want to be an overly jealous girlfriend, and I've got a best guy friend that I see every once and a while (but I definitely don't text him every day). But I would be lying if I said the constant texting didn't bug me a little bit.

So recently he casually mentioned that he was asking off work next Friday. Just out of curiosity, I asked him why he was asking off. He then told me that his friend (let's call her Kayla) was coming down to stay at his house for the weekend. I was immediately taken aback. I asked where she was sleeping. He said at his house, in his bed, while he slept somewhere else in the house. For those that are wondering, Kayla still has the same boyfriend that she has always had.

Now if him and Kayla did anything on our break, that is his business and I don't care. But the fact that he is having this girl come visit, sleep in his bed, and is even asking off of his well-paying internship to spend the whole weekend with her does not sit right with me since we are ""exclusive"" (like I said, his words).

I tried to talk to him about it, and told him that this just wasn't okay with me. He went on to say that I needed to give a reason why, that simply my emotions were not reason enough, that I was being way too jealous, that Kayla would never be this jealous, and that her boyfriend is totally okay with this (I have a hard time believing that he even knows). He then went on to tell me that the only way that we would get back together is if I told him everything I did, with every guy, while we were on our break.

What the hell is going on here? He really isn't the cheating type, but this is just weird. Is it even worth my time to try and fix this anymore? Is it okay for him to think that it's totally alright to have this girl stay in his house multiple days while we're practically dating? Thanks for your input guys. I just want to make sure that I'm thinking all this through, and you've really helped me in the past.

Oh, and we're still both 20 and we've been dating over 2 years."

wle59,3,2012-07-15,Long Distance girlfriend of 10 months just diagnosed with 2 chronic illnesses. No idea what to do. ,milarya,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/wle59/long_distance_girlfriend_of_10_months_just/,"I'm 20 and a guy, she's 18 and a girl.

We met in August on OKCupid, even though I live in New York and she lives in Florida. 

We saw each other in November, December, March, and spent the last two months together. We fell madly in love with each other almost as soon as we met in real life, and have always wanted our relationship to last. 

However, throughout her life, she has battled depression. She hates where she lives, and she has had body image and self esteem issues. We had a chance to move in together for Fall 2012 in March, which I rejected because I thought it was too soon to make that commitment with someone who I'd only spent a total of 3 weeks with in real life. She resents me for leaving her stuck in a place that keeps her so depressed.

In March, she got a UTI. This UTI was persistant, and she had been dealing with pain since that date. She saw various doctors, and finally, a week ago, they diagnosed her with 2 chronic vaginal diseases (IC and VVS). These diseases mean she's in constant pain throughout the day, is urinating upwards of 20 times per day, and can't sit or stand for more than 30 minutes at a time. She can barely leave her house.

I had to leave her about 2 days before she had the diagnosis. In March I was offered a very good internship that was too good to turn down. It requires me to go to England for the rest of the summer. After this, I'm spending 4 days with her at the end of August, which include our 1-year anniversary and her birthday. 

The fact that we're long distance makes this issue even harder. She feels like I'm abandoning her, whereas I feel like I'm trying my hardest to help her even though circumstances have forced us apart. I've given her letters for every day that I'm gone, and I'm going to send her the odd present to cheer her up over the next month and a half. But still, this is not enough when she has basically nothing and I get to live a normal life and pursue my dreams. 

I'm trying my hardest to help her, but the fact that I'm not physically there to help her during this horrible time in her life is just too much to bear. The past week has been filled with arguments where she calls me names, says that she's done and that it's over. I'm worried about her mental state if we were to break up. Many IC patients commit suicide, and she is a person who has had suicidal thoughts before.

I'm scared. She's the girl I love, and I feel powerless to help her. On one hand, I could drop everything to be with her. But that would require sacrificing a potentially career-making internship and abandoning my schooling. For me, that's just not an option. But the alternative is just as bad -- it mean's letting the girl I love sit in a place she hates while in unbearable pain. All while I get to live my life and not have to deal with her problems first hand. 


I should make it clear that this isn't the first issue we've had. Even before this she was depressed, and blamed me for leaving her in Florida. 

Every conversation we have now is heavy and filled with the anger she has towards me. I try and be accommodating and understand that she's going through a tough time, but when she attacks me personally and tells me how horrible I am, it's hard not to take it to heart and be hurt by it. 

I honestly have no idea what should I do? Am I being emotionally manipulated? Or am I being extremely insensitive to abandon her when she's going through a life-changing ordeal that has ruined a lot of things for her? And maybe it would be better for us to break up. Perhaps her seeing me live my life causes her even more pain. But how can I break up with her at a time like this, when everything in the world is going against her? When the topic of breaking up comes up, as it often has in the past week, she says ""I'm sorry for what happens next."" I'm scared of what she might do while under the influence of this pain, anger, and the numerous medications she's on to combat her pain. 

I still love her dearly, and I don't want to lose her. But is breaking up for the best? For both of our sanity? And if so, should it be a complete break or could I still act as a friend to offer support? It's just hard to contemplate ending this with her when I feel that we were robbed of what our relationship could have been by this horrible disease. I appreciate any feedback, I'm drowning here. Thanks.

**TL;DR: Girlfriend has 2 chronic illnesses, would breaking up be best for both of us?**"
wlbbk,4,2012-07-15,Can I quit the job my father got me now?,ivehaditwiththisjob,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/wlbbk/can_i_quit_the_job_my_father_got_me_now/,"Dear reddit,

I graduated college in 2008, and was unemployed for 2 years. I had a one month internship which landed me a job offer in my field. I fucked up that offer by asking for too much money, expecting a counter offer, but never got one.

Since I lived with my parents my father pulled some strings with a business partner of his and got me a full time job which has nothing to do with my field of study(which pays on the low end of decent, crappy if you consider it's 60hrs a week)

I've been looking for a job, and was recently competing against one other person after being shortlisted, but lost to the other candidate due to his experience being more relevant to the position than mine.

I now have a year and a half worth of experience at a job I hate, which has no relevance to what I want to do, leaves me with little time to relax, let alone further my expertise.

at 4 years out of college, I feel washed up. Like my career was over before it began. at 26, I've gained 30 pounds, and am nearly completely bald now.

I desperately want to quit my job, but i feel like i should be grateful for having one, even if I hate it. I've used up all my sick days when I've been too depressed to go to the job. 

I'm tired of telling myself to ""just hang in there"" and keep applying to jobs I want to do.

has anyone else dealt with this kind of thing? I don't want to upset my father, but since he's not really speaking to my boss now, is it ok to jump ship and coast for a bit? 

I have money saved up, I don't want to waste it all, especially since it didn't come easy. I have a little over $30k just sitting in a bank.

No hope for a raise or promotion in this job too, since everyone in the company knows the relationship my boss had with my dad, and it will just cause issues."
wla2h,2,2012-07-15,Jobless and lost…,[deleted],aspergers,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/wla2h/jobless_and_lost/,"tl;dr aspergers+social anxiety among other factors have made it seemingly impossible for me to get a job and make it on my own, I am looking for advice.

I am a 27 year old aspie with social anxiety and I have found myself in a vicious cycle of joblessness. I am reaching out for either advice or information.

I have a traditional university BS and am currently working on a second BS in IT from an online (not for profit) university. I have quite a few IT certifications but am unable to find a job. My primary issue is that where I currently live there are very few entry level IT jobs. Unfortunately I can’t move as I don’t have enough money to live on my own. My second issue is that because of my social anxiety and aspergers I don’t come off as a good employee candidate (even though I know my stuff and am a very hard worker, I am not very social and get extremely nervous during interviews – I’ve even been laughed at once…). I also don’t have any references (social anxiety has not afforded me many friends). Lastly I don’t have a lot of experience (for some reason even entry level tech jobs around here want experienced workers, and internships are nowhere to be seen).

So to sum up I can’t get a job because there are so few jobs in my field where I live and I lack experience and references. I can’t afford to move where job prospects are better. If I am lucky enough to get an interview, I am quickly rejected because of my social anxiety (I don’t even mention I have aspergers). No one seems to be willing to take a chance on me. I thought getting degrees and certifications would show my willingness to learn and work, but thus far they’ve only piled up my debt. I am at wit’s end and I don’t know what to do from here – I continue learning (currently working on Java and SQL certifications) but I fear it’s for nothing.

Does anyone have any advice? I’ve thought about trying to get disability but that’s not a road I want to go down. Ideally I’d like to be a productive member of the IT workforce and make my own way in life. It just seems so hard for an aspie with social anxiety.

And one more note: yes I’ve tried medication and therapy. They did not help much and I’ve since had to quit both as without a job I can’t afford it. My state (Louisiana) does not offer any programs for people in my situation (aside for disability which I heard would probably be hard for me to get).

wl77r,3,2012-07-15,"Really want to go to therapy and see a doctor for possible depression/eating disorder issues, but am currently overseas living with parents.  Is there anything I can do in the meantime until I go back to school in September?",[deleted],needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/wl77r/really_want_to_go_to_therapy_and_see_a_doctor_for/,"&gt;**TL;DR: I am currently in my parents' homeland in which I do not speak the language.  The system is also so that every transaction at the hospital/clinic is recorded.  I don't want my parents to know I went to the doctor on my own.  I can't talk to them about these issues because 1) we do not have a close relationship, and 2) I've seen from the past that they do not react well nor act supportive (both sisters had eating disorders and had to seek treatment on their own).  I feel like my symptoms are getting worse, and worried that by September, things will be much harder to fix.  Is there anything I can do in the meantime?  Like-- are there online professionals who can have online sessions or something?  I'm getting desperate.**
*Also don't want to tell sisters (both at least 10 yrs older, by the way) about these issues because I'm worried they'll tell my parents.*

**Details**

A few months ago I was happy, motivated, feeling optimistic about my future and slowly gaining confidence in the way I looked.  I don't know what happened but now I'm just completely apathetic, I'm kind of becoming an asshole which is upsetting to me because before I was probably one of the nicest, most Zen people you'd ever meet; now I'm totally withdrawn and haven't seen any friends in weeks nor do I want to.  I don't talk to my parents and I spend most of my time in my room when I'm not at my cubicle at my internship.  **I notice I've become quite snappy and short-tempered and it's a complete 180 degree change from who I was just a few months back, where I was laid-back and chill all the time, just enjoying life and appreciating the world.**  For example, I'll become very irritable and easily angered in the kitchen and my parents talk to me about food.  It's very upsetting because I love them and I feel like it's not **me** saying those snappish responses back to them.

I'm also struggling big time with food and body issues.  **I think about food all day and it's what my day, and thus life, revolves around.**  I'm 5'2"" and as of this morning 79 lbs, and although I still feel gargantuan, I know it's not a good idea to eat as little as I have been eating.  But whenever I try to eat the way other people do, I just can't seem to do it.  I really want to because maybe it might help my recent mood swings and drastic personality change, but I can't!  **Eating more than half a normal portion floods me with anxiety** and sends me into panic mode, and I either don't eat the next day while exercising, or I end up throwing it up...something I never wanted to do, because my older sister was bulimic.  Needless to say I don't want bulimia in my life in any way, shape or form ever again.

I'm really concerned about my physical health because 1) my head hurts all the time and 2) I have been seriously constipated despite exercising plenty and consuming plenty of water and foods that aid digestion.  I'm not sure if it's because I'm simply not eating enough mass to produce a bowel movement, or because my colon has grown dependent on the laxatives and/or artificial sweeteners I may excessively consume in the form of gum and low-calorie candies that can produce laxative effects.  At this point, it is easier for me, and often more frequent, to throw up food than it is for me to pass a bowel movement.  I also find I can't enjoy life in general because food, calories, and negative feelings about myself have invaded my mind.  So I'm not getting as much out of this fantastic internship that I've gotten over the summer as I could.  And I avoid going out because I feel like people shouldn't have to be exposed to someone as ugly as me.  Despite everyone telling me how thin I've gotten and how pretty and doll-like I look, I still feel like a monster who is too ugly to be seen and everyone is conspiring to fool me into thinking I'm not, while they're all laughing behind my back.  Irrational, I know.

**I really, really want help.**  I've struggled with food and body issues the past two years.  Some parts were ""restricting"", some parts were ""overeating"", and some parts just ""obsessed"".  I never realized I might have an eating disorder, or a serious issue with food, but in retrospect I've probably had one for a long time now.  I'm also wondering if I have PMDD, because my sister has it as well and I wouldn't be surprised if I had it as well."

after a rather short first try to settle down we were quite disappointed of the server. Many of us didn't understand how one guy could claim such a big part of land without even marking it or why he had the right to imprison us and take our stuff. This was some days ago, we just didnt know better.

Now, the fourth Reich has established a new town. We would like to try anew, after we've been taught the posession rights of the server. We are an international community of about 15 active and 20 casual players, some are bloody noobs, some experienced since the alpha version. Our government is led by the Führer and his Ministers, but with equal rights for everyone, meaning the right to build a House and to access the community chests. National-socialist in its purest form.

We want to stay passive (private) at first, until we can make our entire town griefing-proof. We want to establish trade and positive relations to all factions. If any faction wants to put an embassy of theirs in our town, pm me, i will talk to the Führer.

At last, a word to people calling us racist, nazis or people with tasteless humor. 

We are not racist. Everything racist we say is most likely an intern joke of the community where we come from. We have people from Poland, Sweden, Germany, USA, Denmark, Israel and many other countries aswell as different ethnicities, so any of your arguments is invalid. Everything we might do that seems Nazi comes from the fact that we chose to roleplay Nazis. Deal with it. And if you say we shouldn't make fun of it all, that's your personal opinion. Noting less, but also nothing more.


Hail the Führer

---My current situation is that I am a senior in Computer Science at a University [In Texas if it Matters]. I love animation and modelling and want nothing more to further myself in the field. I have an internship during my last year here doing animations for games for disabled peoples (Kinect for wheelchairs and caned individuals). I **love** education, and I would like to think my work history is impressive. My question to you, /r/computergraphics is should I jump into the workforce right away, get a masters in a related field, or get another Bachelors? I would prefer a Masters but life is tricky and I'll go down whatever road I can. Money is not an option. I've worked a lot and saved up plenty. I'll spare no expense if my future depends on it.

Some good schools that I know have a Graduate Studies program are:

--Clemson [South Carolina]

--Texas A&amp;M 

--CalArt [California]

UnderGrad Schools:

-A&amp;M [Visualization]

-A&amp;M at San Antonio [Liberal Arts in 3D Animation]

-University of Incarnate Word (San Antonio) [Animation]

-CalArt

-Clemson

I am aware of the many'o'businesses that are located in Austin, TX. But heck I would pack my bags to Sweden if I got a good opportunity. So go ahead and educate me and the world. As information comes in I'll update my list.

Bonus Question!

What do firms look for? Is education all that? I know experience is awesome but do schools really even help?

My family thinks I'm going nowhere and I have to say I think they're right. My mom keeps telling me I'm gaining too much weight while my dad asks me if I'm anorexic. I constantly feel like shit and anytime I ask them to stop talking about my appearance or me in general they yell at me for being too sensitive.

My friends don't have time for me. They don't even try. I think they can sense how much I hate myself and don't want to deal with it.

My boyfriend is dealing with his own depression and family issues and, honestly, is just generally self-absorbed to begin with. He blows me off all the time and making plans with him is like pulling teeth. I don't think a relationship between the two of us is a good idea anymore. But I'm too pathetic and selfish to end it. He could be with any girl he wants. Anyone at all. He shouldn't be wasting his time on me. I should end it. But I won't. Because even though I know I should I can't let go. 

I'm doing horribly in school. I'll probably fail out after the fall semester. I hate it there. But I don't know what else I could do with my life. I'm not good at anything. Anything useful, anyway. I miss singing, and I loved it, but I couldn't make a career out of it.

I just hate myself so much. I can't make anything work. I can't do anything right. I don't want to pretend anymore. I'm constantly on the verge of tears. I'm tired of pretending to be happy. I just want to curl into a ball and fall asleep and not wake up."

I probably already was depressed last semester when I got burned out and really started to hate school, but this internship has just sent me over the top. I have came to terms with the fact that I hate the field I am in, but don't really have any sort of passion to strive for anything else. I hate math and science, but I am good at it, which is why I picked the field I am in. It doesn't help that I feel isolated here, the other interns seclude themselves. The only person I really talk to is guy in the lab I work with who also hates his job and this city.

I just don't know where I am going with my life, since I really cant do this for the next 30-40 years, but I don't really have anything else to turn to that I think I would enjoy. I am just getting restless here, I find myself going on long drives at 2am just to get away from this place. If I am not working in my lab, I honestly just lay in my bed waiting for it to get late enough to go to sleep to start it all over again. All I know is, I have one year before I graduate and am worried that my life wont improve after graduation.

I just had to get that off my chest, since I haven't really told anyone how miserable I was/am every day for the past 6 months or so."

I don't know why I kept asking her out when our dates really weren't fun, but I did.  And she kept accepting.  I guess I thought if we spent a little more time together maybe we'd start having fun.  What a dumb idea.




Anyway, a few days pass and one of the interns at work has found the girl's blog and twitter feed.  Turns out she's posted some bullshit about how much she REALLY didn't like me and thought I was awful.  She didn't use my name or pictures, but it was fucking harsh stuff.  I had no idea that was how she felt.  I also had no idea I was the polar opposite of the kind of guy she wants.  Even though there's nothing in her post to identify me, it's still a shitty thing to do to someone.




So, of course, I'm going to do the same:  The kind of guy you describe as being attractive is not going to go for you, except maybe to fuck you once and never call you again.  There will be no relationship with him because he's already dating a smoking hot actress/model/whatever type.  You're a brunette with a weight problem and no amount of hair bleach and makeup is going to change you into a thin blonde.  Why don't you go drink a few more cocktails.  That'll help your figure.

I'm currently a CS major living at home with my parents during the semester, and living in a nearby city every summer to intern for a software company (which pays rather well).  Working this internship during the school semester is not an option, as the drive between the city where I go to school and the city I work is over an hour.  I'd like to have some income during the semester that doesn't involve flipping burgers.

My school holds a CS job fair twice a year, and I've been to two of them so far to find possible semester jobs, however every company I talk to is mainly looking for summer interns or interns who can work year round.  My current summer gig pays a lot more than these companies are offering, so I don't plan on leaving it.  They also intend to hire me when I finally graduate, so I don't think it would be smart to take a different internship over the summer.

Is freelancing a viable option here, or would it be better to keep looking for companies who are willing to hire me solely during the semester?  As far as I can tell, freelance gigs can be kind of sketchy and may be offered by people with little experience hiring programmers.  I've briefly checked out sites like elance and odesk, however a lot of the jobs seem ridiculous (I want to make the next facebook, lolz!), or the developers offering public quotes seem to undercutting each other left and right to the point that there doesn't seem to be a point in pursuing such jobs.

Is there a more legitimate avenue for freelancing, or is finding a normal job/internship the best option?  Some guidance in this matter would be greatly appreciated."

wkoxg,2,2012-07-14,Some questions about sex and long-term engagements I'm struggling with. (Throwaway for obvious reasons),hereticalthrowaway,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/wkoxg/some_questions_about_sex_and_longterm_engagements/,"So, a little backstory:

My fiancee, who are both Christian, (she was raised Presbyterian, me Alliance, so pretty conservative.) and I met on a missions trip with our college's Christian group (Cliche, I know...) a bit more than three years ago, in the spring of 2009. Without going into detail, we ""hit it off"" so to speak, and kept in touch until we ""officially"" started dating that fall.

After dating for about 6 months, we were hanging out one evening in the winter at my apartment. She ""was bored"" and asked me if I had ever fingered a girl before. I hadn't, so we kind of played around for a bit. I felt that it wasn't really right, but unfortunately, I have testosterone, and sometimes I don't think with the right head. Fingering soon turned into something more, and it kind of went downhill from there, but we still had never had intercourse.

Fast-forward another year and a half. We're both looking at what could be our last year of school, and I proposed to her at the end of the summer. Due to financial reasons, I cannot get married until I graduate college. Well, things didn't quite go according to our plans, and with internships (among other things), I'm now graduating next may, in 2013. Which is when I was *supposed* to graduate anyway, but I could have done it earlier. So now we're looking at an almost 2 year engagement. 

Once we got engaged, the temptation to have sex just grew and grew, until just this past march, 4 months ago, we gave in. She was rightfully upset, and I felt quite conflicted myself. Since then we've only done it twice more, but both are apprehensive about it, because we were raised that any sex before marriage is bad. 

There's a few things that complicate this, though. First, is obviously the length of our relationship, particularly our engagement. We've started pre-marital counseling, but we feel that the couple who is counseling us doesn't quite understand it, as they were engaged for only six weeks after meeting a year earlier. Second is the fact that my love language is physical touch and hers is quality time. When you combine those two, particularly the way they are to each gender, it makes it EXTREMELY difficult to avoid this.

I mean, my biggest conflict with this is that we're engaged, and the only difference between engagement and marriage is a few legal documents, a fancy ceremony and dinner, and what Christians say you can do. I'll go into more detail if anyone asks, to a point, but basically, my TLDR is this: Has anyone in r/Christianity been engaged for over a year, after dating for two, and if so, how did you deal with the temptations?  It seems that most Christians I meet get married barely a year after meeting ""the one"" and, as such, find it (apparently) easy to stay pure."

deadlift: 60 lb
standing press: 45 lb (barely)
cleans: didn't do them, do barbell rows instead (45 lb)

wo5b6,2,2012-07-16,Confused after interview that covered several positions,dast1,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/wo5b6/confused_after_interview_that_covered_several/,"Last week I had an interview for a clerical job in a university environment. However, in addition to the typical interview questions, they discussed 2 other professional-level jobs that were potentially available. These 2 other jobs are more directly suited to my grad degree and internship experience. (I have been having a very difficult time attaining a professional-level job, so I had applied for the clerical position with the intent of working my way up through the department/university.) They never specifically offered me the other 2 positions, or even explicitly said whether I was being considered for them, but told me about the responsibilities of those positions in detail. In between these anecdotes, they asked interview questions for the original position I applied for. At the very end of the meeting, one of the interviewers asked if I would like my resume forwarded to the department that would be hiring for those other positions. I sent a follow up e-mail to my interviewers the same night.

I was very excited and expecting to hear something back soon after, but I haven't heard anything yet. Is this a common scenario? I'm not sure about the timeframe of the hiring process, but the unexpected addition of the other 2 jobs in the interview surprised me. (For the record, the original job is still listed as open on their employment site.) Any advice/similar experience?"

But after delving deeper, time and time again C++ gets labelled as a 'back-end grunt worker' for code, poor GUI capabilities and over all a tedious language to work in.

I am at a complete loss here as where ever I turn people are saying the grass is greener on the other side. I am trying to develop a respectable portfolio for a beginner so I can begin applying to Year 2 Internships and maybe get some work experience.

Can anyone provide some insight or advice where I should go from here?

So I'm a college student who moved here about four weeks ago for a summer internship, and let me start by saying that your city is unexpectedly awesome. I was amazed at how pretty it was on the ride in from the airport (bridges... bridges everywhere); PNC Park is great and I admire your much-tested loyalty to the Pirates in the face of - well, you know; your museums are fantastic, and oh yeah - Batman.

But part of my experience in your lovely city has been less pleasant. Over the past three weeks, there have been four separate incidents of men making lewd comments at me. All have been in the downtown business area during the daytime with plenty of people around. Two were drive-by shoutings and two were from guys walking past on the street. I wasn't dressed provocatively at all (either business attire or jeans and a T-shirt) and while I don't think I'm bad-looking, I'm *definitely* not attractive enough to merit that kind of attention. 

I've lived in cities much bigger than Pittsburgh, and I've never - not once - been catcalled or shouted at before. It's a little unsettling, and I'm wondering if there's something different about Pittsburgh culture that explains it or if it's just a coincidence that it's happened four times in three weeks. Again, I love what I've experienced of Pittsburgh so far - with this one exception (well, and your habit of putting french fries on/in everything). It's actually kind of frightening when a truck slows down next to you and a strange man shouts, ""Thank you so much. You have a perfect ass."" and then drives off.

So what's the deal, Pittsburgh?

I'm not trying to be accusatory here; I'd just really appreciate any sort of explanation or insight you guys could provide on the matter. Thanks in advance!

EDIT: Thanks for the responses, everyone! I think I understand a little better now and definitely don't generalize all Pittsburgh guys as creeps -- most of the people I've met have been super friendly and helpful. I think I was just caught off guard since I've never experienced anything like that before, and then it happened several times in a short period of time. I definitely won't let it take away from my enjoyment of your city though :) Go Bucs!"

This summer my roommates and I want to create a game. We're all programmers at a university, and want some fun coding to do after our standard internship coding. The lead programmer has been in the video game developer's club at our university for the past 2-3 years and has made a number of games. Our other roommate and I are new to the game development scene, but are learning from the lead programmer and hoping to expand our coding skills. Our intended scope of the project is 2-4 months (1 month in but if we decide to, we can develop until we want to stop).

**Project Name:** Dino Land

**Game Overview:**
&gt; Dino Land will be a 2D Platformer. The player will control 3 baby dinosaurs, each with different strengths, that the player must use to solve puzzles and defeat enemies. As the game progresses, players will be able to level up various attributes of their Dino's...

**Progress:**
Our lead programmer has been working on little things like menu functionalities, but as of today we have a working graphics and sound engine and a basic layout of the menu options and selection physics. We've been using our AMAZING art skills (stick figures) to use as place marks until we get the real art in.

We currently have 3-4 programmers, 4 sound designers, 1 (active) artist, and a couple story writers. As you can see, we're short on artists and are in need of some.

[Here is one concept.](http://i.imgur.com/R4wlX.jpg) It is not the exact design we're going for, but a similar style. Also, the main character is now female (this picture was drawn before any real decisions were made).

Anyways, this project is just for fun and mainly for the summer (longer if we decide to). We had looked for artists here before, but with a different game idea and trashed it.

If interested or want more details regarding the game, please contact me at jcdeng@uci.edu and/or our lead programmer/project head at navac@ics.uci.edu"

While we were catching up at this party, I had learned that he in fact, hadn't gone in far in life as I had thought, and was still living at home and still an undergrad at the local college because he had to switch majors 3 times because he kept failing math. I, on the other hand, attend a top university with a high gpa, am highly involved in campus life, have a good summer internship, and have my own place.

So today I was just doing some random research using excel and bloomberg at my internship and I came across some odd information. I was checking out relationships between exchange rates and US treasuries. Here's a little table of what I found:

http://i.imgur.com/rwHCg.png

sorry about how it looks, I got kicked off the bloomberg terminal and don't have my spreadsheet, but thats a screenshot I emailed myself. It's correlations, just to clarify. For example the correlation between a 10year US bond and the USD/Yen exchange rate over the past 5 years is 0.818

I thought it was odd that there were such highs correlations, especially with the 5yr and the 2yr over the past 3-5 years. There's even a high correlation over 10 years for all of them, but in the short run, there's pretty much no correlation for any of them. Barely enough for the .6 to count, although it's something.

Anyways, does anybody have any theories as to why I'm finding these numbers? I'm going start working on my own theory, but I have no idea.

So I am a senior at my university and I was looking about how to handle my finances for my last year.

I currently have $8000 saved up to use over the next 12 months (til I graduate).  This number will go up by at least $1000 as I am finishing up an internship this summer.  I have estimated that I will need $6,000 for housing over the next year.  Tuition will cost me $3,800 for the fall, $2,800 for the Spring and $2,000 for the summer (I will graduate at the end of summer).

So basically I will have about $9,000 after this summer, I will get my tax returns back in April (which will be additional income) and I already have an internship lined up starting in May of next year (making about $30/hour) and I have a full time position lined up for when I graduate next August.

So as you can see there is no way I am going to be able to pay for housing, food, other expenses over the next year while paying for tuition also.  I have a scholarship but that will really only help pay for my fees and such (and make a small dent in the tuition). 

I have the option to take up to $2,750 in subsidized loans and $1,000 in unsubsidized loans each semester.

How should I approach this situation?

wnqg3,3,2012-07-16,Student Seeking Advice (UK),[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/wnqg3/student_seeking_advice_uk/,"Hello, I just finished reading [I will teach you to be rich](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Will-Teach-You-Rich-Programme/dp/0340998059/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1342464549&amp;sr=8-1) by Ramit Sethi and I am looking for some advice and clarifications regarding what to do next.

I am a 20 year old Software Engineering student entering his final year at a Scottish University. I have no student loan, subscriptions or existing debt and I should have ~£3500 saved after completing my summer internship.  When I return to complete the final year of my degree it is likely that I will not have a regular source of income. 

I have a current account with the Royal Bank of Scotland which has no annual fees, no overdraft was opened 5 years ago. I am living at home with my parents.

* Opening an online high interest savings account.

What are the best resources for discovering those savings accounts with the best and consistent interest rates that have no fees and immediate access? Should I be aiming for 2-3%?

* Building credit with a credit card.

Ramit outlines that building credit provides significant savings in the long-term. He suggests obtaining and making regular purchases with a credit card to improve my overall credit score while making sure to pay off the balance in full every month.

Is it really worth doing so? Again, where do I look for those cards that are reliable and wont screw me over? The sheer number of options available is overwhelming.

* ISA

Should I open an ISA in addition to a savings account? If so, should I max my tax-free contributions before depositing anything into the lower interest savings account?

* Employer and personal pension plans

At the end of chapter three it is suggested that I join my employers pension scheme and contribute enough to qualify for matching. It is also suggested that I open my own personal or stakeholder pension account.

Why should I have two different pension schemes? I don't plan on joining a pension scheme until after I graduate and have a full-time position somewhere.

Joining a pension scheme that uses lifecycle funds seems like the easiest, safest and hands-off automatic investment method. Is this correct?

Finally, am I forgetting anything? After reading this subreddit the advice I see most frequently is to max your 401k and Roth IRA contributions every year. Are these the american equivalents to both a pension scheme and ISA respectively?

Thank you for your time and any insights that you can provide."

Honestly I'm tired and itchy from the fetal monitoring. My husband is at home cleaning up and will be back shortly.

A few intermittent ones after that. Sent husband home around 9, went to sleep a bit later. Midwife and intern came in to discuss cervidil. A little later,  intern came in with a really nice nurse who held my hand while I tried to breathe and stay still. My cervix moved from intermediate to anterior so that is good. I will probably start pitocin in a bit (3am my time now)  but they don't seem to be in any rush as the little guy is doing well.

I have to unplug the IV, disconnect the transducer cables and wrap them around my neck, demolish my pillow fort and move without setting the IV alarm off. Oh, and I found out that I'm GBS+, midwife thought I was told as did OB. 

Eta 2: 430am now. I've hit the wall. Normal tampons are not something I cope with well, no idea why I thought this would be okay. Husband is on his way in. Exhausted, at a 3 baseline and 7 when contractions come. Can't stop tearing up and I feel like my body let me down. 

Eta 3: 930am. Had a good cry when husband got here. Midwife was supportive and we agreed on a low dose of morphine to help me rest. Contractions are every 15 minutes or so and I feel a lot better as they let me lay on my back with a wedge under my side. "

During my schooling I started and sold my own tech firm (high school) and was a program manager of a prestigious program within my college that allowed non-profits to have ""interns"" that could mess up and do basic functions so that they wouldn't have to hire someone that they couldn't afford with myself as a failsafe and teacher (some of these kids didn't even know how to use ipconfig let alone what linux was). I was recruited into this role because the program adviser saw that I was going through the motions of college (which I was just to have a piece of paper) and that I knew what I was doing %99 of the time. I was in charge of roughly 30 ""interns"" at around 10 installations on 24/7 on call and no pay for about a year.

My question and frustration I guess is how are the kids that I taught how to do the jobs they're getting hired for (anywhere between $40-60k/yr jobs) when they couldn't find their own feet? Am I overqualified already to be a recent graduate? I feel like I shouldn't have even tried at all now as I keep seeing posts of these kids getting these jobs and being like ""if only they knew how retarded he really is...""

I'm a student who is going to be living in Syracuse for the next month or so while I work at an internship. I had an apartment up in the SU area, but now I'm looking for a new place to live short term.

Just wondering if anyone has any ideas on places I could stay very inexpensively. 

I've been toying with the idea of camping out for the month, but the challenge there is finding a place to stay (state forests limit you to three consecutive nights camping). I've always been curious about guerilla/urban camping, so I'm thinking maybe I could try it out in some capacity.

Any other clever ideas?"

I'm currently about £600 overdrawn with my bank (it's fine, it's interest free, but trying not to put any big dents in it) and the temptations that have come with this years summer sale have been unreal.

Me and a bunch of friends have recently discovered DayZ and have been itching to play it since. Well as soon as it came on sale they, of course, bought it and they haven't stopped telling me about how awesome it is.

I finish this internship in about 2 weeks and I will hopefully by that point be able to start the bar job that I've applied for. Until then though, I'm skint as anything.

I'll be able to gift you something back at some point, or perhaps just pass on the gift to someone else.

wndjw,11,2012-07-16,[FR] Week 2 after Seddit,wierdo5000,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/wndjw/fr_week_2_after_seddit/,"So this is my FR on how I did week 2 after reading Seddit. I hope everyone can help me get a little better. I have yet to close any girls, I think I have just had a very bad string of bad luck.

Day 1: Train Station/Train
So I'm waiting for the train back home which was to be a long 2 hour wait and I walk and sit down next to an HB7 blonde. I open her asking what game she is playing on her phone and we start hitting it off there. She talks about her job and how it sucks to be a teacher sometimes. She was going to be around my area for an internship. So I kept conversation moving until she said the magic words ""my husband blah blah"" I didn't completely cut off conversation but I called off any chance for a #-close. So I politely continued convo until she had to leave. Bummer, almost the same as last week (If you read my other FR on askseddit)

After that, I went to go to the bathroom. When I head back to my seat I found out someone had taken it. So I spot another HB7 and plop down next to her. I spent a good 3 minutes trying to find out how to open her and I come up with a ridiculous opener and comment on how beautiful her hair is. Although I don't nervously AFC say it. With that I open conversation. We talk for a LONG time. Turns out she lives in my town so we get on the same train and we talk there. However, I ran out of stuff to talk about (when I got home I read a post on conversation threading and I wish I would have done that). She shit tests me only twice. I pass the first one, and then the last one is the ""I have a boyfriend"" Some of you may remember my post on this shit test and taking that advice, I should have alphaed it. Someone said, ""unless they bring up there boyfriend right away, theres no reason to eject"" Anyway, I didn't get a number because of it and I lamely betaed off the train shaking hands and saying its been nice talking.

Day 2+3: Riding my bike
So I ride my bike to working out, and as I was riding home an HB6 pops up on my route but going the opposite direction. This is more of a question for help, but how would one Open in a situation like this?

Day 4: YMCA

There's this HB6 that works at the front desk and I have always thought about opening her, but I never worked up the courage until now. So I opened with ""Hey, isn't it funny that you know my name, but I don't know yours?"" and she gave me her name. Since I didn't want to stick around too long, I asked if she'd be interested in going out for a coffee or something. She instantly bought up that she had a boyfriend and hammered it pretty hard. So I naturally ejected and said thats cool and goodbye.

So Seddit, I hope I did all right, please give me some tips! THANKS FOR READING!"

wnde9,2,2012-07-16,I won concert tickets after a ridiculous series of events. What were the most ridiculous things you did for a contest?,tenentenen,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/wnde9/i_won_concert_tickets_after_a_ridiculous_series/,"So I was at work one day (Just some desk job where I sit at a computer all day), when for some reason my ""supervisor"" (only kind of. Also she's about 20 years older than me) was looking on Facebook for some reason. I get out of my seat and go walk up to see that she's on the fanpage of a country radio station (not really what I listen to). She also had headphones in. I ask her whats up, and she lets me know that this radio station was giving away concert tickets, and to get them, you had to follow a series clues (on Facebook) and locate the intern IRL.

She wanted these tickets badly, but strangely enough, she already had tickets that she had bought, but she was looking to upgrade to these, as they were much better seats. I agreed to help If I could.

So the first clue appears on FB and it tells us we need to go to a shopping center about 15 minutes away from where we work. So we just looked arround, and up and left work at like 10:00 AM. We got in my van (without AC on a really hot day) and  began to drive there.

On the way there, the next clue was revealed. It said ""One of the colors is red."" Immediatley I think Rainbow Foods (A grocery store in that shopping center) as red is in the rainbow. So we immediatley go into rainbow, and begin asking numerous employees if they were the Intern (I forgot to mention that the intern could be in disguise, and that it could be a worker or a customer or anybody.) We asked so many people, and none of them had the tickets, so we reasoned that it must not be in Rainbow Foods after all. 

So we left, asking other people around the store if they were the intern, including some window washers at Jimmy Johns, who were really confused. Then the next clue came. ""Another of the colors is blue."" So now were are.looking for things that are red and blue, or had red and blue associated with them. We also saw many other people also looking for the intern. All of them were teenage girls.

We went into resturaunts, nail salons, movie theaters, banks, and nobody seemed to know what was up. Then I had a Brain Blast (see Jimmy Neutron) and realized that parking ramps were often color coded. So we checked the parking garages, most of which were not color coded, but one was, and guess what? It had red and blue, but also green. So we looked in every single car and asked everyone we saw. Nobody fucking new ANYTHING about this contest, or the intern.

At this point we had spent an hour and a half looking, when we should have been at work. As we exit the parking ramp, we see a girl in a red shirt standing with her friend listening to a portable radio. They then informed us tgat the tickets had just been found, and they said so on the radio. So they get in their car, and we wqlk to my car, feeling shitty as shit, cause we lost.

As we are driving back, I realize that we never actually confirmed that these girls were telling the truth. They seemed really sincere, and sad that THEY lost, so we dismissed the idea that they were lying.

But upon arrival to the office where we work, we checked Facebook, only to find that the tickets HAD NOT been fucking found at all. I was honestly really upset. So I was like FUCK THAT SHIT, IMMA GOING BACK! So I leave work a SECOND time, by myself, and race back to the shopping center.

On the way there, I get a call fromy supervisor with another clue. ""Plenty of food to eat."" And I'm all like, I FUCKING KNEW IT WAS MOTHERFUCKING RAINBOW FOODS! And as I'm distracted by this phone call, I accidentally took the wrong exit. So mow im trying to reroute while freaking out that someone will get the tickets before me. I finally get there and park, and begin to jog up to the building. And guess who I see run into the store? MOTHERFUCKING RED SHIRT BITCH! So I start sprinting, and I run past the door she went in to the other door, thinking Ill have a better chance if im in the other half of the store. 

I run into the first isle I see, and ask this youngish girl, who was wearing a UofM shirt, shopping cart full of food, ""Do you have k102 tickets to see Kenny and Tim?"" And she hesitates for a second, and a smile creeps upon her face as she says ""I do."" At this point im hufging and puffing and super happy. I fall back onto some Uncle Ben's minute rice to rest. Then RED SHIRT Cunty McCunt turns and runs down the isle, and sees me with tickets in my hand and horror fills her face as she realized her evil plot had failed, and she had lost. 

I returned to the office in triumph with tickets in hand. I ended up keeping the tickets, because the very next morning, there was another hunt for the intern, and my ""supervisor"" and her husband found them on their way to work. Go figure. I gave the tickets to my sisters instead of selling them for like 200 bucks, cause thats just how I roll, motherfuckers.

TL;DR: I beat out the bitch, without profit.

wn9py,0,2012-07-16,[FR]s: GET YO SWAG ON!!!,[deleted],seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/wn9py/frs_get_yo_swag_on/,"Ok, I’m especially talking to you guys (and gals!) who are struggling with AA.  The attitude that I’ve adopted for this summer is one that I think would be helpful to anybody who gets the heebie jeebies from the idea of talking to a girl (guy) they don’t know.

I’m a 21 year old straight male student.  I moved to a new city this summer – for only the summer – for an internship.  Before I even arrived, I decided that summer 2012 would be the summer that I forced myself out of my social comfort zone.  I made a pact with myself that, each day in June, I would do one thing that forced me out of my comfort zone.  Here’s how I kicked it off… Prepare to laugh at me.

[FR1]: I thought of this the night before in my hotel room on the way to the aforementioned new city.  I would highly recommend it (but wait until you read it – you’re gonna think it’s goofy!).  I needed something that would simulate approaching a girl, but there was no way I could have worked myself up to do the real thing at that point.  So what would (a) make me say something that made me uncomfortable to a stranger (b) force me to be outcome independent?...

When I wake up in the hotel room the next morning, I'm already thinking of what I've decided to do.  I get ready, take my stuff out of the room, and throw it into the car. I head toward the hotel entrance, where my goal awaits.  A few steps from the door, I turn around, get into the car, and contemplate driving away.  I force myself back out of the car.  I kid you not; I repeated that same little dance three fucking times.

The fourth time I approach the entrance, I go all the way in, and wait for an older couple to finish talking to the concierge, who happens to be the subject of my scheme.  She’s actually probably about my age and not totally unattractive, but that’s irrelevant for my purpose.  When, they’re done, I approach the counter.  I look the concierge in the eye, and say in my best metallic voice, “I-AM-A-ROBOT.”  I immediately turn towards the door to walk out while the concierge stifles a bemused guffaw.  I don’t look back.

What I think is awesome about this exercise for people in the early stages of working through AA is that, yeah, you have to put yourself out there, but it’s much easier to convince yourself to do this than to walk up to a random girl in the coffee shop because you can tell yourself going in “Hey, [your name], all you have to do is look this person in the eye and recite this predetermined line, and then you can just walk away.”  Baby steps.  Also, it forces you to be outcome independent – because how the hell could you expect a positive reaction to something this dorky/weird?

Over the next weeks, I set more goals.  Sometimes, I chickened out.  Sometimes things fell into my lap and it was easy to ask for a girl’s number or flirt.

[FR2]:  Later in the month, I’m out with my cousin, who’s 32, but has the lifestyle of someone just out of college.  We’re at a bar near a large university, with a lot of students around.  Full disclosure: I’m about 4-5 drinks in, so some of this courage is synthetic.  We do some mingling with some friendly dudes and maybe a dudette or two, but it’s getting late and we both decide that we want to flirt with some girls.  We spot a booth of four girls (closer to my age than his), HB7, 5, 7.5, and 4.  He advises that we place ourselves strategically closer to them, so we walk over to sit at the booth behind them, him facing their booth and me looking the other way.  We debate whether or not a group of girls like this wants to be approached by a guy they don’t know.  

I say, “You don’t think that group would be receptive to me walking up and talking to them?” He replies, “Really, the best you can do in a situation like this is sit back and wait for an opening in their conversation that gives you a reason to talk to them.”  I guess I have a flare for the dramatic: As he finishes his sentence, I stand up and step in front of the girls’ table.  “Hi, my cousin right here thinks that you guys would not appreciate it if I tried to flirt with you” (he cracks up in the next booth).  They laugh, and ask me about myself and I do the same for them. Things start off hot, but I’m nervous and it shows.  I’m not sure who to look at and I’m super conscious of trying to keep the conversation going.  Eventually they pretty much stop taking me seriously and the bar closes anyway.

My cousin and I head to a restaurant near the bar and sit outside for some late night grub.  I say something humorous to him about getting relationship tips from Seinfeld and the HB7 sitting with her friend HB7.5 behind him turns around and smiles.  I jump on the opportunity.  “What, you don’t think Seinfeld can tell you how to run your life? (or something like that)”  Our groups converse for a little bit.  We end up leaving, but when we’re a block away I decide I want to do one more courageous thing for the night. “I bet you I’ll go back and ask for those girls’ numbers.”  My cousin doesn’t believe me (or he pretends not to).  I walk back to the restaurant and put my hand on the girls’ table.  “HEY. My cousin bet me I was too scared to ask for one of your numbers” (pretty much the same strategy as before). They laugh.  “Well, which of ours do you want?”  At this point I got super awkward and said something like, “Um, well, I guess yours (gesture to one of them), not that you don’t seem nice (gesture to the other)” (with a smile on my face, so they might have thought it was kind of funny). Obviously, I should have asked for both.  But I wasn’t turned down :)

The point is, follow my attitude, not my actions.  Right now, I’m super crude, and sometimes awkward, but I always say yes to opportunities to practice. I even called the girl from the restaurant the next weekend and left a voicemail inviting her to a houseparty, knowing full well she probably wouldn’t call back due to my awkwardness/the amount of time that had passed since we last talked.  Practice.  I haven’t read the book, but apparently, in The Tipping Point, Malcom Gladwell theorizes that you need to do a thing for 10,000 hours to become a genius at it.  I’m making it my goal to just get my number of approaches up.  The more times I do it, the better I’m gonna get at it.  Once you adopt this attitude, I swear to god, it’s so fucking fun.  You can do it in other arenas of life too: Whenever I have chance to call someone who I don't know at work (which, believe it or not, is something that used to make me nervous), I latch on to it.  I wake up every morning excited to find a new way to challenge myself.  And I have gotten a lot better at approaches, I’ve since gotten a couple more numbers/taken a girl I didn’t know home from a house party.
If I can do this stuff, you probably can too.  You aren’t a special case :)

P.S.: Any advice on approaching groups of girls?  What about on talking to girls older than me (25, 26)?  Any other thoughts?

tl;dr:  I worked hard – read the damned thing!"
wn8r1,0,2012-07-16,Investment Banking Opportunities,[deleted],finance,https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/wn8r1/investment_banking_opportunities/,"There was a post about an hour ago about the best ""route""  into IB. I won't limit myself to IB, because I also like the idea of working for a HF or in PE. I'm not really concerned with what major I'll be choosing since I'll probably choose an economics major/math minor.  I'm more concerned with what school to go to... 

My options are, roughly, these: Wharton, Stern, HYP (if I can get in), Stanford, MIT (Sloan), Dartmouth, Duke, U of Chicago, Northwestern, Williams and Amherst, Cornell, Brown.

Wharton and Stern are pretty much off my list because I realize most people there will want the same internships and jobs so i'ts going to be really hard to get an internship/job/whatever coming from one of these schools with all that competition. HYP are a good choice but I don't know the amount of econ majors at Yale or Princeton... I know economics is a really popular major at Harvard so I'm guessing the same thing, all those geniuses will be getting the good jobs.

Cornell is huge so I'll also be fighting for jobs against tons of people. Stanford and MIT are probably good choices since I don't think there's many people gunning for IB in these schools, but idk about the recruitment at these schools. Plus, people from MIT (same with U of Chicago), are generally not ""businessy"", I mean, intelligence + charisma + people skills, no offence. MIT is going to hurt my GPA though... I don't know about Duke but it's also a big school. NW, same as UChicago, don't know much. Dartmouth is one of my top choices regardless of IB, and I've heard BBs like to recruit there. But, economics is a really popular major there... Amherst, Williams and Brown will probably have few people who want to get into IB, but then again I don't know about recruitment at these schools.

I may come off as a slacker, but I'm really hard working, I just don't want to go to a school where everyone's really cut-throat and getting a job is way harder. Thanks in advance!"

I'm [22M] in a LDR with [23F] and we are 420 miles away.  She is off for a summer internship and I'm stuck here with classes and work.  We have known each other since Fall of last year, and everything else started a couple months ago.  She has been gone for three weeks and won't be back until September.  I've started writing to help get through things.  I am going to give her everything in a big book when she is back.


I live for the day we share a bed and I can feel your warmth next to me.

You roll over and kiss my ear and whisper the words I so desperately crave to hear.

I look deep into your eyes and can feel your smile inside.  

Your eyes so honest; unable to lie.  They tell me exactly where your heart resides.

We submit to sleep holding each other close.  So safe and comfortable.  

My heart on fire, but no longer in pain.  A feeling of completeness washes over me.

I listen to you breathe.  Feel your heart beat.  Such a beautiful body filled with such a bright soul.

I'm drunk off your presence.  High off your love.  How lucky I am to be chosen by you.

My love for you grows with each passing day.

Every word spoken brings us closer together.

When I stop to think.

My mind is filled with you.

Memories of the past.

Dreams of the future.


**I miss you so much today.**

I had my second bout of Optic Neuritis (started last month, first one was 6 years ago) and the neurologist says that the MRI I had a couple of weeks ago points to MS.  The reason I didn't have an MRI the first time I had ON 6 years ago was because my doctors never figured out what it was (nor did they feel like looking into it further, I was in Canada at the time, and my town was not the best with healthcare).

Now I'm in the US and the doctors are very concerned about me.  The Neurologist saw me last week and started me on steroids right away (I have 2 doses left, today and tomorrow).  Tomorrow I have a 2 hour MRI and a follow up Wednesday morning from the drugs.  Next week I have a lumbar puncture... that's the one I'm most scared about.  My mom works at a hospital and has told me horror stories.

Maybe it's just the steroids making me nervous.  I'm usually a positive, upbeat person.  There are people out there with Terminal cancer and other diseases that are much worse, but today I just feel like crying all day :(.  I'm at work with my door shut so that I don't have to see anyone, and I've told my intern not to let anyone in unless it's an emergency.

Sorry for the rambling, but I'm scared any worried.  Any kind words of advice would be appreciated.

This summer i've been living on a dropzone (skydiving airport) and jumping my ass off. Its one of the most amazing times I have experienced. We spend all day jumping from planes, then as soon as the sun goes down we drink and smoke the night away, pass out in our tents, campers, converted school busses etc, and wake up to do it again the next day.

Some people have been living there years and have quite nice campers with AC and other luxuries. This is my first season living on site which i spend about 5 days a week there, going back home a couple days a week to do things i must do. 

While I am there I have been living in the intern camp, which is basically a section of the woods where all the unpaid interns live. They have really taken me in which is great because I didn't have a camper before and now I have a nice tent which treats me great. We have a great time from doing crazy jumps, to smoking around our crappy fire pit.

Now comes the question I have for Trees. I want to do something for them for welcoming me, there had been talks of an intern bong, and I would like to fulfill this wish. But there is complication, just a few yards down the road there lives a gravity bong with a strong reputation. I would like something that would challenge this device for power and ability to get people fucked up.  I do have access to some supplies but I can't go overboard, and size is not an issues because its out in the woods, but power would be.

TL:DR  Living on skydiving dropzone, want to build bong for new friends, need something more powerful than gravity bong."

My girlfriend and I have Stafford student loans. Not a ton, about $58k combined, about half subsidized and half not. Pretty typical situation. We graduate next May (2013), and with the grace period, we will have to begin payments next November.

This summer, we are making quite a bit of money. I got a great summer internship that pays very well and I am thinking that it may be more frugal to dump some of my money into repaying my loans rather than saving it (where I'll get maybe ~3% interest, as opposed to paying about an average of 5% on loans).

Here's the question: If I make payments on my loans NOW, will I lose my grace period? Essentially, if I want to make a single payment of, say, $3500 just to slow down the interest, will they begin expecting monthly payments 13 months before I am scheduled to begin paying?"

To everyone in this subreddit that currently is/has teaching/taught in Japan, what do you suggest for me to have ready once I graduate? I don't really know Japanese, but from what I read on the JET site, that's not a requirement. Is it worth getting TEFL or CELTA certified since I don't know Japanese? Other than that, I'm not too worried about credentials or qualifying, seeing that I have a 3.9 GPA, member of honor societies, have had internships, etc.; I think I'll have the ""professional"" experience to be qualified or be considered for a position.

But what else should I do to bolster my chances seeing that Japan is a competitive destination? I'm pretty much in love with Japanese history (especially the Sengoku period) and want to immerse myself in Japanese culture and absorb the beauty of its mountains and shit.

Also, If I go the CELTA/TEFL route, how much does it cost and roughly how long does it take? And what is the difference between the two? Is it worth it?

wn15c,0,2012-07-16,"[24/M] hooking up w/ a co-worker [22/F] I'm moving away soon, don't know what to say",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/wn15c/24m_hooking_up_w_a_coworker_22f_im_moving_away/,"Hey- first time posting in here, thank you for helping me out.

So I've been working for the summer in Portland at an internship while I'm in between my 1st and 2nd year at a grad school in Boston. I hooked up with one of the other summer interns (who just graduated undergrad and lives in Portland permanently) about a month ago and we've been hanging out a lot since.
I don't think either of us would say we're ""a thing"" or more than just friends who have hooked up a couple times, but I'm starting to catch serious feelings for her. I move back to Boston in 2 weeks for my 2nd (and final) year of school. 
I know there's not much hope of us continuing anything while I'm back at school, due to being on literally opposite sides of the country. Also, just in hanging out, I get the sense that she is not as much into me and I am into her. I think in her mind we're just hooking up, but in my mind she's someone I could see myself getting very serious with. 

For example, we were hanging out in the park the other day, and I had one of those moments where I was looking at a beautiful landscape, on a beautiful day, and she looked amazing sitting next to me. I wish I had a picture of it. I leaned over and gave her a quick kiss (because it was one of those ""life is good"" sort of moments), and, while she didn't say anything, she stiffed up a bit, and seemed a little tense, just by body language. 

I don't want to freak her out by telling her I think about her all the time, especially since I'm leaving soon. But, I feel like I should say something. It's a significant possibility I'll end up in Portland after graduation in May, and I guess I'm just trying to feel out how she feels about everything- I just don't know how to put my feelings into words in a way that isn't too intense and won't make her feel pressured to make any promises or anything like that. 

Ideally, her response would be something like ""I've liked hanging out with you too and I really hope sometime soon we end up in the same city again. Let's stay in touch because I really like talking to you"" (as opposed to ""It was a mistake hooking up with you and now you've become way too attached. You're leaving in 2 weeks, and I was just trying to run out the clock, but now that you said something, bye and have a nice life""...I have a very ""worst case scenario"" kind of mind). 

**tl;dr:** casually hooking up with a co-worker- became attached- moving away in 2 weeks and don't know how to express my feelings without freaking her out.

Any advice?

I received the evaluation from the agency and found that the report described me as ""not showing any of the symptoms of autism."" I also visited the disability center on campus and was told that I may not actually be autistic and that I should look into having myself re-evaluated by a professional. 

I was diagnosed as a child due to ""aloof"" behaviors and got in trouble with school authorities a good deal as a teen for behaving ""abnormally,"" which included things like singing opera in the bathroom, making out with a statue of the school mascot, writing death threats to a teacher's intern and eating my own feces in front of the class.  All of these were chalked up to Asperger's. I was also ridiculed a good deal by my peers for seeming effeminate, hyper and loud. Once again, people attributed this to autism/Asperger's.  

However, the recent incidents with the agency and with the disability resource office on campus left me thinking, ""maybe I don't have asperger's?""

Between giving up my health, my already virtually non-existent social life, and my free time to work a job to pay for a school I can't afford, I've been feeling a little tired.  Not the kind of puffy-eyed tired you get from staying up all night, but an aching dullness and extra weight in every muscle that never goes away.
Anyway, I work 12 (sometimes 18) hour days with the saddest group of people ever.  Since the company casts a wide net and doesn't require many skills, I get quite a mix of coworkers: layoffs from every profession, elderly, college students that couldn't land internships, etc.  The worst are people with degrees (again, what I'm *aspiring* to) that can't find a better job.  

The only up side is that it pays well, which is a good thing considering the massive debt that I'm going to rack up from going to college.  The story behind that started as the basic highschool senior dream--I go out, find the school I know is for me, apply early admission and am accepted (early admission=if you are accepted you *have* to attend, withdraw all other apps).  To make a shitty story short, I get almost no aid, and am looking at upwards of ~60k in debt when I graduate On top of that, the social aspect of the school kind of sucks.  Like everyone, I went into freshman year expecting loads of friends and frequent intercourse, but turned out disappointed.  I got a few random lays with whom I immediately fucked up, and one or two people I hang out with mostly based on convenience rather than shared interests.  Feels bad.  I moved a lot as a kid, and was always kind of shitty making friends.

I've considered switching schools, but staying lets me do a special school-sponsored volunteer program at the local hospital (I'm premed, love that shit), which is basically what I look forward to every week.  It's a boss learning experience (probably illegal given all the shit I do-pals with the doc has benefits) and looks good on my CV (tune in again in 2 years for part 2, applying to and paying for medical school).  

tldrs: Don't want to leave, but staying isn't what I thought it would be.  Future looks bleak, greatest time of my life isn't so great.  $? no.

I just kinda wrote all this in one go, so I'm sorry in advance for the rambling, and the abrupt cutoff just couldn't think straight enough to articulate anymore.  Also with the pretty formatting; I dont bother with that shit.

I only had a couple of courses left to finish my bachelors so I took all (three) during this summer. Due to being unprepared for the load of 3 summer courses and premature celebration I will probably need to retake one, possibly two, of these courses which simply means I will not receive my bachelor's until December. 

Firm contingencies: The offer is contingent upon attaining 150 credits and successful completion of reference checks.

Before the summer courses: I already spoke with the firm about the credits of which I will not have 150 and they said it is fine as long as i provide documentation that I am close to, and finishing the 150.

The contingencies do not say anything about a degree.
Do you think that the continuation of my education to receive a Bachelors after employment will be a problem?

I am (usually) a smart kid and I know these classes are not a problem (none of them are core accounting courses) and I also made a pristine impression during my internship. I apologize for the choppiness of my information.

I will probably contact the person I know in HR at the firm to put everything up front and find out but I thought I would ask here first. Thanks for any input and I will be responsive if there are questions."

I am so lost Reddit! I have no idea what's going on. Part of me feels that we are just friends and he's hanging out with me since he's on vacation and he doesn't have much to do. But sometimes I feel like maybe there is something between us. However, he has not said or done anything un-platonic in the times that we've hung out. I feel like we have tons in common, he is super funny, intelligent, cute  and I'm sure I have a crush on him :) I know it seems pretty immature for a 26 year old but I feel like a giddy school girl. I have never been in this situation where I have absolutely no vibes at all from the guy. He could really like me or be completely uninterested! 

So what should I do?

1) Is it possible that he doesn't really like me and I'm reading too much into it?

2) Should I just enjoy hanging out with him as friends and not bother about where it goes?

3) Should I ditch convention and ask him out instead (if he sees this post, that might just accomplish itself)?

The only jobs I've ever had have been retail to cover basic living expenses while in school (Target, dollar general, etc). 

Honestly, I don't even know where or how to begin looking for a job related to my degree. Ultimately I'd like to go to either law school or, more likely, get my masters in public administration. But everyone I've talked to has stressed the importance of getting some work place experience between undergrad and graduate school, so that's my current goal. 

What resources are available to me in terms of looking for a position. Ideally it will be a paid position as I have to work to support myself, but I can intern for free as long as the hours are low and flexible enough to maintain another full time job (such as retail) on the side.What positions can I reasonably expect with my degree but no current experience in the field? I didn't intern at all during undergrad, but between working full time and class I didn't really have the time without getting burned out. I still regret not doing it though.

A little background info:
Male, 21, 5'9, ~215lbs, Vegetarian (no fish either!)

Coming into the year 2012 I was around 240 lbs. So far through the year I had lost 25ish pounds. This sounds all well and good, except that was pretty much done in the first two months of the year. I made pretty drastic changes... such as cutting out soda completely, eating super fresh and healthy, and going to the gym.

Well, my gym buddy and I kinda tapered off because we had two totally different schedules, and with that kinda came everything.

I stopped eating as well and kinda just slid by on junk food. I still don't really drink soda (maybe 1 or 2 a week). 

How do I restart and get back in the game? I currently live with my family while attending school, so it's harder to get my way when buying food... especially in the summer while I don't really have a job but am rather doing an internship. 
Edit: I should mention that my internship is a desk job, so not on my feet at all there.

My family typically just buys quick and easy food and doesn't cook, things like oreos, cheetohs, crackers, ice cream, etc... Very little fruit and veggies.



I know this isn't structured the best, so I'll try to outline what I'm asking:

1. How do I restart a weight loss and convince my family to buy some healthier things at the store?
2. Does anyone know a good place to find lower carb vegetarian recipes that aren't too difficult to make? 
3. Focus on Cardio or Weights for weightloss? Or both?

Thanks for any information you can give me!

I create unique cover letters for every resume I send out, which at this point adds up to 500-600 of them. The worst part is not receiving any feedback, not even rejection notices. I know my education was valuable, and there is a lot of competition in this economic slump, but lately it has been really hard to keep my spirits up. 

I feel like the problem could be a number of things. It may be the fact that I went to a for-profit university, or it might be the fact that I'm not as outgoing as most people so my personal connections are lacking - especially since I just moved to a new city. I can't even get responses from entry-level jobs or internships. I can't apply for better jobs because of my lack of experience, but there might be a problem with a company hiring me for lower-level jobs because they know I'll leave for a better job the moment I find one.

Also I feel like these job aggregator websites are terrible. It's so impersonal, and the moment a job is posted anywhere the employer is flooded with so many resumes they don't know what to do with them. This results in companies using software to eliminate resumes if certain keywords aren't found, which seems to be unfair. Any time I've ever had an interview I've been able to knock it out of the park because the employer gets to meet me, see how personable I am, and hear directly from me how genuine I am in describing my work-ethic and dedication.

tl,dr: Jobless guy is jobless.

wq4kn,5,2012-07-17,I've had two partial lung collapses and a thoracic lung surgery in the past two years. AMAA,JesmasterAgain,IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wq4kn/ive_had_two_partial_lung_collapses_and_a_thoracic/,"Since people are interested, I going to tell the ordeal from the beginning.

The pain started Feb of '11 as I was walking home from the bus stop.  I wouldn't really describe it as much as pain, but more of an ache, and it almost felt like my left shoulder joint was sore, almost like I had pulled it.  The pain became a little worse, but never more than a 4 (out of 10) that night, and neither I nor my mom (a retired navy operating room nurse) was worried.  Early that morning however, things got interesting.  Well, it was more like 1 am because I had procrastinated on a school project.  Anyways, I called my mom because my heart was sounding funny.  Funny as in you could hear it making a little farting noise from 5 ft away.  Also, it was bouncing against my chest wall, and I could almost feel bubbles in my chest.  We decided to wait a little while for me to try to get some rest; if I was going to die, I wasn't going to die tired.  

We drove to the hospital that morning, and the pain had increased quite a bit.  It was more of searing stabs than moderate aches and throbbed, especially when I breathed in, but lessened when I breathed out.  It seemed worse when my heart raced faster, like when I got out of the car.  The pain felt like the artery at the top of my left shoulder was being pressed.  When I got in the emergency room, they hooked me up to the normal monitors.  I was pretty chill at this point.  I'm thinking, if I die of a heart attack, at least I'll be over it.  The heart rate monitor starts beeping.  I was so chill I was at 45 bpm, and it thought I was in trouble.  The older ER nurse had a pretty good idea about what I had, but the X-ray confirmed it.  I had a very hard to see partial collapse.  I also found out, after getting a cardiograph, that the air had caused a meniosteinal crunch from air being near the heart cavity.  Just my luck, every doctor and intern in the hospital wanted to hear it, and I was inundated by countless stethoscopes.  The treatment involved an oxygen mask and rest.  Sadly, I did miss going paintball with my friends that weekend for my birthday, but I was back to running a few weeks after.

Skip ahead 11 months.  I had a bit of a cough, but nothing too serious.  I did have another school project again though.  I began to get the ache again one night.  When I layed down, the characteristic bubbles in my chest returned (think having gas, but near your sternum).  I immediately guessed it was another one of these (same lung, same pain) and wondered if I could just ignore it.  The pain soon became heard to ignore, and the next morning I was back.  Since they  definitely knew what it was this time, I didn't have to deal with all of the heart-related stuff.  They put me on oxygen again, and scheduled a VATS( no not fallout, but video-assisted thoracic surgery).  I had to wait for the surgery in February (thankfully after exams).  

February, and my birthday, finally came and I had to go in for surgery.  They put me in a bed, my friends dad, the anesthesiologist, injected a bunch of syringes in my IV, and I next woke up really cold in recovery.  The guys there were just covering me with blankets.  My memory was fuzzy, but improved after getting to my room.  While I was out, they had put my chest iin a clamp, made two holes through my chest wall for chest tubes, and used a camera as well as a cutter and titanium mini staple sewing machine to cut out my bad tissue, bubbles in the lung called blebs, and then put it back together.  It sounds bad, but they only removed a very small amount.  They also roughed the lung wall up at the top so it would heal and cling to the lung, keeping it from falling down. When I woke up, I had two drainage tubes going throughout the left side of my chest cavity.  Both started midback, with one reaching the bottom of my lung, and the other the very top.  The tubes were the thickness of garden hoses, but less forgiving.  When I moved, I could feel them pressing against the chest wall.  They also went between my ribs.  Try to put a thumb between your ribs and you'll know how this feels.  After a couple morphine infused days I could go home.  After getting the tubes out, I felt fine.  I still have  numbness and soreness on my chest because some nerves were severed, but for the most part I'm fine and back to normal, able to run 7 min miles, etc.

Before I went to surgery, I thought of a joke to tell the staff, something like ""surgery?  I'm going to miss my Pilates."" I'm a guy, btw.  When my mom and I went back to the follow up, we saw a couple of guys from recovery that recognized me.  I had no idea who they were.  They had helped when I had first come out of surgery, and then we had talked for almost an hour.  I had no idea.  They asked if I had made it to my Pilates."

So around march I started experiencing jaw tenderness on my left side. I didn't think much of it and when I went to the dentist she thought I clenched my jaw at night and gave me a night guard to wear. It didn't help out much but I figured it would take a little while to kick in. Summer rolls along and I am going to an internship abroad for a few weeks. Before I leave I go to my family physician to get checked up and some congestion before my flight. She was aware of my jaw pain as well. She gave me some antibiotics and that was that. I get to my internship and about 2 days in lose hearing in my left ear. I went to the doc there and they prescribed more decongestants. Those didn't help at all so 1 week later I went to an ENT specialist. She took one look in my throat, saw that a good 3/4 of my throat is closed off due to a giant growth. Immediately recommended an MRI, turns out I have cancer. So I cancel the rest of my trip, head home, and am now starting treatment.

My question is, shouldn't the dentist or doc have checked my throat and noticed the growth? I mean the size of it is like a large egg and is clearly visible when looking through my mouth! I didn't notice because you don't look down your throat often and when a dentist tells you the pain is from clenching your jaw you kind of take their word for it. Am I wrong here? What do you think?

TL;dr: Dentist says jaw pain, gets checked by doctor too. They say nothing. Go abroad, see doc, it's cancer! How could they miss that??"

Thinking it through, or over thinking it?",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/wpx78/to_take_the_offer_or_not_thinking_it_through_or/,"Every job up until now when offered a position I was on board, ""Fuck yeah I want that!"" was the essential feeling. I got an offer today, but the reaction was more of, ""Oh, that's nice.""

I'm unsure if the reaction is out of general complacency or experience talking. Other offers were shortly out of school and during my internships in the university program. This offer comes after I've been in the industry for a short while and I am not sure if its just skepticism speaking or a general reaction to the job.

**The facts:**   

- I am displeased with my current role. I *will* be taking a new job and moving on when I find the right one  

- I have no rush to get out of this job beyond my own patience. There's no current threat to my job security and for the most part, my employer is not aware of my job hunting  

- I have been looking for a while with very few bites. I have been mostly looking non-local and this is one of the only jobs I looked for locally

**My question to the community:**  
What questions should I be trying to answer for myself to decide if I'm just being negative or if this really is a job I want. Do *you* still get that ""fuck yeah"" feeling about jobs or are things more mellow after seeing the field for what it really is?

Essentially I'm asking is if its alright to trust that gut feeling? The doubts I have about the new job mostly fall along the lines of ""what if it isn't any better? Is this the direction I really want to go professionally?"" which can be said about *any* job. Turning this down now because there was no spark doesn't mean the next one down the pipe will change that. 

Ask questions if you have them. I'm mostly looking for the voice of reason from more experienced professionals who have made that switch mid-career and aren't just searching for that first job outside of university."

That's why it's safe to write this down. If you spot one, they can imitate what it looks like when someone is reading. They'll hold the book, or newspaper, or laptop or whatever the appropriate distance from their face. They'll scan back and forth with their eyes. They'll even move their lips sometimes like they are saying the words and smile or frown like they are reacting to something , but it's a sham. They aren't absorbing anything, or learning knowledge. It's a fake. A clever ruse. 

I first ""saw"" one four years ago. I was at a concert in Detroit and was blitzed as fuck off a couple of lines. I accidentally walked into the women's bathroom and saw this bitch just melted onto the fucking mirror. I could see her cheekbones underneath her split open skin cracking and grinding to splinters from the pressure. Her body was just, flopping around like some kind fish out of water. There was this other chick, standing next to her at the mirror, putting on makeup, and she was just getting smacked on the side of her face by a thrashing arm. She didn't even LOOK. It was like she was just ignoring it, like somebody could possibly ignore a chicks eyeball dangling down the side of her cheek after smashing into an unbreakable mirror at 100 mph. Bitch called me a ""pervert"" as she walked out, no care or concern whatsoever. I ran to get a bouncer, but by the time I got back, the thing was gone. He kicked me out of the club, and I swear, I saw the same chick (at least one wearing the same dress) just grinding some dude's leg at the bar. 

I watched them for years. I saw people get, infected, or whatever you want to call it. Just staring into a mirror like a crazy ass clown. Mouth open in a giant toothy smile just looking at themselves like they are tits and cake on your birthday. No one seems to notice them when they are like this. I don't know if it's a mental wall that everyone puts up, or if they are doing something to just fuzz your brain out. But whatever you do...don't fucking let on that you know. I saw one other one so far. This eleven or twelve year old girl saw one of them, buried ear deep into the reflective bank window. She just starts screaming her head off. There were three others around the one being, switched, giant creepy smiling watching that shit go down. They just turned on her, faces never changing, one grabbed her face, wrenched her neck so hard that I thought her head was going to pop off, and tossed her body in front of a passing car. I listened to the driver give a report to the cops that showed up. He said that the girl just walked in front of his car. It was broad daylight, and he had a clear view of them on the sidewalk snapping that girls neck, and it didn't even register with him. 

I caught my first one last year. It was a young intern that worked in my office at my last job. I knew he was turning. I'd watched him staring into mirrors and reflective surfaces, for longer and longer each time. As soon as he would start, he would just...disappear to everyone else. I followed him home every night. Finally caught the bastard making the switch in his bathroom. I waited until he pulled back from the glass and nailed it in the back of the neck with a baseball bat. 

I worked on that fucker for 17 days. No shit. I started to wonder if I had made a mistake, but no human could have survived what I put that thing through. It almost tricked me. Played on my emotions, cried, passed out, whimpered. Stupidly, I unhandcuffed one arm on the fourth day, I guess it forgot the tazer I had in my back pocket. But it reached up and grabbed my forearm and crunched both bones in there (I still can't grasp anything real hard with that hand), looked me in the eye and said ""Mistake"", right before I planted that tazer into its temple and activated it. By the end, there was nothing left but a torso, a head, and a little nub of left arm. That's when I figured out they maybe can't hear. The ear holes ( I took the ears off) were all grown over with flesh. I got some good information in that last 12 hours. They are, like, drifters behind the mirror. They can latch on to people like a lamprey eel on a shark. You don't even know it's happened. Eventually they grow strong enough that they can short you out for a little while, use your body to ""look"" at themselves. They fucking LOVE looking at themselves. They get stronger that way, mentally you know? Like psychic weight lifting. It said they just want a place to live, to be at peace. That they didn't want to harm anyone, just live in our world. I asked it why they didn't just come right out and announce themselves, how snapping a girls neck and throwing her in front of a car was peaceful. It just smirked at me twisted its head further and further until it's neck broke and it went limp. I got after it with a chainsaw before I untied it though.

I've been to New York, and only seen one or two in all the crowds. Last week, In Spokane, the whole town...the WHOLE town is swapped I think. I was driving through and I got pulled out of my car by a group of them. There were literally thousands of them just watching from the sidewalks. I had a .45 tucked into the crotch of my underwear. They took me to a warehouse and stuck me into a room with two of them and a giant mirror on one wall. I plugged the two in the head, then shot the mirror for good measure. Found a truck outside and managed to get out of town that night. 

I shot the mirror

There was one smiling at me in the mirror."
wpvyo,9,2012-07-17,I'm feeling meh today and I need to vent to somebody.,ireallylikebeards,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/wpvyo/im_feeling_meh_today_and_i_need_to_vent_to/,"Sometimes I get into these random funks, even though I have it really good in my life (close friends, lovely boyfriend, my own apartment in a great neighborhood, full-tuition scholarship at a selective school, great internship, etc.). I cannot help but feel perpetually inadequate, and I wonder if there's any way for me to be truly happy.

I have pretty bad anxiety, and I have a tendency to believe that the worst is always going to happen. I'm seeing a therapist for my anxiety, but it's been three and a half months (about ten sessions), and I don't feel as though it has helped at all so far. My best friend just finished her therapy sessions after nearly a year of going, and while I'm extremely happy for her, I cannot help but feel jealous as well. I don't want to mar her happiness by saying anything, though. Also, she's one of the finalists in a massive competition, and again, same sentiments—I'm happy, yet jealous. Sometimes I feel as though I'm not accomplishing anything with my life.

It also seems as though so many of my friends (we're all in our early twenties) are moving in with their boyfriends. My boyfriend and I have been dating for just over a year and a half, but we are nowhere near ready to do that. We love each other very much and our relationship is great, and yet, I cannot help but wonder if something is wrong with us for not wanting to move in with each other. I feel bad because one of my friends is getting ready to move in with her SO, and every time she brings it up, I have to steel myself from starting in on how I don't feel ready to do that yet (I was pretty repetitive about it for a while). I don't want to be a downer.

I really try to be there for my friends, but it's hard for me to be excited for them without lamenting my own ostensible lack of progress.

I just feel as though I'm not going much of anywhere with my life. I have a great, high-paying student internship in a field that I'm contemplating pursuing, but I get so bored with it, and nowadays, I'm dying to take a vacation from it. Sometimes I just want to take a whole vacation from my life and go away to some abandoned, isolated location for a week. I want to stop talking to everybody and clear my head. I had so many plans for projects I wanted to work on this summer, but I always wind up hanging out with friends or procrastinating on the internet instead. I'm not quite sure what I want to do with my life after school. I'm fed up with school, but I'm afraid of what my life will amount to once I graduate. I'm a bit terrified of graduating, actually.

Just felt like venting. If any of you can relate to any of this and have some helpful words, I'd appreciate it. Thank you."

wpqtg,13,2012-07-17,I just had to explain what wrestling was to someone at my job who has literally no idea what it is or has ever seen it.  Need help showing them a match.,Johnny_Holiday,SquaredCircle,https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/wpqtg/i_just_had_to_explain_what_wrestling_was_to/,"So I'm on my lunch break and I'm talking to the intern here.  We get into what her plans are for life (she's 18 and not in college).  She asks me if I'm going to be here in a year when she comes back next summer and I told her no.  She asks me where I'll be and I told her hopefully with the WWE (I'm 29 and I've been trying to get in their media department). 

She gives me this look and says ""What's that?""  I said wrestling.  She continued to stare at me confused.  ""World Wrestling Entertainment?""  Still nothing.  ""Have you heard of Hulk Hogan, The Rock, John Cena, Stone Cold Steve Austin?""  She tells me she saw the Rock in a movie but doesn't know which one and had no idea that he did anything else.

r/SC, I was beside myself.  I have never bumped into anyone who hasn't at least seen a little bit of wrestling.  So trying to explain it came off very strange because I've never had to explain it from the ground floor to anyone.  Eventually she said she wants to see a match because she just doesn't understand what I'm talking about.  So here's where I need some help.  I'm looking for a match that's a good example of what wrestling is (WWE style), that isn't anything too over the top, amazing, or too bland.  I'm not trying to get her to watch wrestling, I just want her to get an understanding of what it is.  I've been watching wrestling for about 25 years now, so trying to narrow it down is proving to be difficult.

And it also has to be on youtube so I can show her here at the office.  Any suggestions?

tl:dr Met someone who has no idea what wrestling is and I want to show her an average match on youtube.

Edit: Thanks for all the suggestions.  I'll think it over tonight and should have something to show her by lunch time tomorrow."

She gave me her number, but she works 2 jobs and goes to school so I've been unlucky on finding a time to get together.

  So here's the deal, my friends and I frequent a sportsbar during the school.  There happens to be this cute waitress that works there.  At first I think, ""whatever, don't be the corny guy hitting on the cute waitress.""  As the year went on, my friends and I started becoming the ""regulars"" and we become friendly with cute waitress.  I start to become interested, but figure she's just so friendly because she's nice, and good at customer service.    
Well toward the end of the year, she is taking off from her shift and I decide to just try something so I go and take a shot at getting her number.  She must have had a momentary lapse in judgement, because it worked.  Well, I try to set up a time to get together, but she starts taking on more shifts at work, then finals come. I was hoping I would have a better shot as summer started, but she is working two jobs along with taking online classes, and I am doing an internship.  
Anywho, we've been texting on occassion, and whenever I go eat at her restaraunt, she always comes and talks to me whenever it gets slow.  Her other job is at a gas station and I've stopped by there a couple times.  I think it'd be obvious to her that I am interested, seeing how every week or two I try to set something up for us to get together.  I don't know how to walk the line between showing enough interest and coming on too strong.  I feel like my best opportunities to get to know her at this point are when I see her when she's working.  Still, I don't want to be a creeper always coming by.  
So, yeah, I know I overanalyze the situation, but I would like to hear some input from women.  "

I am an unpaid intern. It does qualify for unpaid, I checked those rules. They have trained me in video editing and such. That isn't the issue.

Basically, the show has a host and producers and whatnot, like a total of 10 people. I am in charge of various things, some of them being their social media and YouTube accounts.

We do have a good deal of commenters on the videos, and I respond to them. The host tells me not to answer certain stuff, which I understand. Same goes for on Twitter and Facebook.

However, when I comment about something using my own personal account, it seems like a no-go. For example, he wears a lot of x brand clothing. People always ask if he is sponsored by x brand clothing. In my own personal account, I say I don't think the show or he is sponsored by this brand. 

He emails me telling me I shouldnt speak for the show, as if a potential sponsor, possibly that brand, sees MY comment, they may not want to sponsor the show. Seems ridiculous.

 If I'm home and using my own personal account, shouldn't I be able to say whatever I want as long as it isn't revealing or somehow major?

I've told him sure, whatever my bad. But it seems more often he does this. I love working at the show and everyone is great, it just seems like there is too much restriction and he thinks he can control what I say.

What should I say to him? I don't want to get him pissed, but I don't really want to put up with it. I'm a shy guy and non confrontational.

I just wanted to surprise him when he came home. Ended up telling him about it anyway and he just laughed and told me he loved me. He didn't say ""YES I WANNA FUCK OTHER GIRLS"" he just said he loved me, and then we went on talking as normal. I'm not worried about my relationship."

A friend of mine recently got a decent degree in web development at 35 and said he has the hardest time fitting in at his new job since most of his co-workers are 10 or even 15 years younger than he is, and they like to make snide remarks now and then about his age and when he finally got a degree.

That being said, I was wondering if you guys can give your opinions on which would be better.
Just a heads up, I already have an internship lined up (6-8 hrs a week;but more/less if requested) and a job (5-10 hours a week; but more/less if requested).

I was thinking that with my open schedule and my flexible work hours, I can either dedicate the rest of my time to either a frat or becoming an RA.

I want to be an RA because I think I'd be good at it, and it seems chill. But I'm not sure how frat housing is - I couldn't find anything on the few that I looked at (plus, I'd prefer a business frat, but honestly, whichever seems the chillest - i.e. hazing-free/chill people). So would you guys be able to tell me about housing for frat members? I mean, I'd assume that it wouldn't be available for underclassmen - but hey, why not ask?

wolel,1,2012-07-16,Working in California under age 18?,walkerneo,legal,https://www.reddit.com/r/legal/comments/wolel/working_in_california_under_age_18/,"I'm 17 and have been looking for work or an internship in programming / web development. 

The first company I applied for interviewed me a couple times and didn't know much about what needed to be done considering I'm a minor, so they did a quick search and printed out a work permit and permit to employ that I needed to fill out and have signed by the school district. This seemed to be in line with what I thought needed to be done to work as a minor. 

Now, I applied recently for another job to help construct a website for a lawyer firm. I interviewed with them today and was told I would intern for a week to see if I could do what needed to be done. The only thing I'd filled out for the firm was a basic application. I was given a desk to work at and spent today installing the software I would be using and reading api docs for the various services that would need to be utilized. I told the guy I interviewed with about the other internship I applied for and mentioned that, because of certain things, one of them being that it's a paid internship, that were I to be accepted there, I wouldn't be able to intern for him. I had mentioned that the other internship was paid because, during the interview, when asked about pay, I had mentioned that my primary goal was experience and was under the impression that said internship would be unpaid. In responding, he said that the internship WOULD be paid and that they don't do unpaid internships anyway. 

The lawyer (man above) has been really nice, and I like the office, so I am in no way under the impression that I'm going to be cheated for whatever ""work"" I'm able to do, but I still would like to ask about things for the sake of knowing about them. 

First, can I be considered employed or interned there without having filled out and signed the work permit papers? 

Second, is there something in the laws about the first week, where after the first week I would need to sort things out? And are internships for minors required to be paid? 

As I said, the guy is a lawyer, so I would bet that he knows what's needed and what isn't, but again, I'm asking for the sake of my own knowledge."

wofsk,6,2012-07-16,"Chicago, I have an idea for a ""business"" (more of a nonprofit) and I figured coming to you would be the best bet.",[deleted],chicago,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/wofsk/chicago_i_have_an_idea_for_a_business_more_of_a/,"I need your input.

I have this really big idea and I am trying to figure out if it's too fantastical before really getting into it. I've been toying with it for months and months now.

Let me give you a little bit of backstory about myself and why I want to do this- I am 25 years old. I moved to Chicago when I was 19 to attend college (Columbia) for interactive arts &amp; media. I have loved graphic design since I was 13 and first discovered it was a *thing*. I ended up hating Columbia and also due to money, had to drop out. I became disinterested in art for a few years due to my bad experience in college. After a while though, I missed it and I decided to go to school again. I started attending Harrington College of Design for Communication Design, which I loved. However, again, I had to leave due to financial reasons. This has led to extreme frustration on my end not being able to get a job in my desired field due to not having a degree. I looked into going to community college for web design and it seems that the program is only offered once in a blue moon, so I started thinking.. how can I change this. Art school is expensive. Community college doesn't seem to cater to artists. I want to make a change.

I have lots of friends from school/personal life who I know that are amazing artists but don't have jobs in their field for the same reasons as me or because jobs don't want to give people a chance without any prior experience, but how can someone get experience if no one gives them a chance? This leads people to using craigslist or crowdsourcing sites as a last hope in making some money and gaining some experience for their career. This is where I believe design as a profession/passion is going down the drain. There's a big difference between genuine artists/designers and people who happen to know how to pirate photoshop. All of these lines are becoming blurred due to a need for degrees, experience, people not understanding the importance of good design, etc. Design skills used to be proved by portfolios/work rather than a piece of paper that says you spent 4 years in school. Most of the people I went to school with had 0 talent and were skimming by in their classes, yet they will get a degree, while someone like myself, who has a real passion and knack for design, will be stuck working at a retail job because I don't have said piece of paper. Granted, there are some people who work their asses off without a degree and do land awesome jobs. I commend those people, but they are the exception, not the rule. I really want to change things in the art community and I feel like since I live in such a big city, I have the chance to if I really work hard to make my little dream a reality.

So this is my big idea-
I want to start what I would like to call a design co-op.
First, it would be a place that people could come and collaborate on ideas, get to know other artists.
Second, it would be a design studio where, as a group, we would do design projects for clients.
Third, it would be a place to learn. I would like to find people who would teach ""classes"" to people who want to learn whatever (*read list of the subjects I'd like to have) who would be paid a fair hourly rate.
Fourth, barter knowledge. Share what you know with each other. You know photoshop, someone else who knows illustrator wants to learn photoshop and you would like to learn illustrator, so you both work together to teach each other. (This is just an example)
Fifth, a studio for people to come and work. Maybe you don't have a fast enough computer to use the certain program you want to use, or to render something. We'd have high end computers. Photography... a dark room for analog photography (something that is dying) and a studio for digital.
Sixth, a space for art shows/theatrical performances that you wouldn't have to sell your soul to use.

*Subjects to be taught/utilized/shared here
Photography
Graphic/Web Design
Web Development
Illustration
Drawing
Painting
- whatever else people would bring to the table as we expanded as a company

The main goal of the company would be for people to educate themselves without paying for college, gaining real world experience by working on the ""design panel"" when we do projects for clients, a studio space that doesn't cost an arm and a leg to use, creating a network of artists, and lots of other things as the company expanded

I'd also like to be able to have internships where people actually LEARN and aren't treated like SLAVES, what an internship should be!

There would be a fee to use the studio/gallery but I'd like it to be based on a sliding scale and it wouldn't be to make a profit, but rather to be able to pay for more resources/""teachers""/etc, so it would be a small fee and get smaller the more members who joined. I'd also like to be able to run this as a non-profit if I can make it fit so that we would receive grants and end up being able to be free to people.

If people actually show an interest in this, I am thinking of spending some time writing up a legit business plans, designing the website (I already have the domain and everything, even logos!), finding people to be on the ""directors board"", and I will be submitting it to IndieGoGo to try and get it funded as well as use word of mouth and promotion to find people who would be interested in donating for a membership/just donating out of the goodness of their heart.

Please if you are interested, let me know and ask other people if they'd be interested! I think Chicago could benefit so much from a place like this."

So, I finally got what feels like my first real assignment. I'll be travelling to a third-world country with a team of doctors and dentists who set up free clinics for the poor.

This is EXACTLY the type of journalism I want to be doing. Since I graduated college, I've been stuck in a weird, pseudo-journalistic world of a niche sport. It's boring and unfulfilling, but they pay me. 

I feel I've gotten a bit rusty on my serious journalism skills and I don't want to mess this opportunity up. They're also expecting me to take pictures and I have no clue how to. I bought a entry-level DSLR and was also hoping for some tips and pointers in that department.

I've also asked one of my medschool friends if I could shadow him for a day or two. He's doing an internship at a fancy, expensive hospital in NYC and I think it'd be an interesting comparison. 

Is there any advice, tips or pointers you guys have for a young journalist hoping to make the world a better place one clip at a time?"

[i]I am part of the Marketing team here at TGN, and have been tasked with recruiting new partners to help grow with us, and start a career on YouTube! If youre interested in partnering your channel through our Network, feel free to contact me![/i]

[b][size=18][color=darkred]Below Are Some Highlights of What TGN Has To Offer:[/color][/size][/b]
We do not have a set rate for monetization rates, so you get 80% of whatever TGN receives. In one recent case, a TGN partner made $10 CPM, meaning $10 per thousand views. He received over $2000 on his 200,000 views for the month. Most networks place an artificial earnings cap of $2-$3, but TGN has none. Whatever TGN earns, you get 80% of. 

Also, unlike many other networks,TGN currently has no Perpetuity Contract, meaning you may cancel your partnership in anytime, until the beginning of January 2013. This allow for a lot of flexibility, and many options if you are not satisfied.

I am about to enter my (gulp) third year of college and I hope to transfer next fall, so that I am only a year behind. The problem is that I no longer want to be a nurse. Last fall, I took a phlebotomy course and got my CPT 1 license. I had to do a 100 hour internship in a hospital and realized that I am really good at drawing blood, but I hate working in the medical field. I realized that being a PR major is more up my alley, but my mother refuses to let me do what I want. I registered for classes this morning and most of my classes this semester are communications courses. I plan on telling her tonight that I when I apply to schools this fall I willing be applying as a comm. major and not a nursing major.

**TL;DR** I am going to become a communications/PR major against my mother's wishes."

(First a bit about myself) I'm a very ambitious computer engineering student currently attending The College of New Jersey.  I'm the top engineer in the class (3.95 cum, 4.0 in-major GPA) and going into my junior year.  I'm getting ready to take the GRE's in the fall as well as put some serious work into keeping my GPA where its at.

My question is what I would need to do in order to get into one of the top programs in the nation for either a masters or Ph.D. (I really like what I do :)  When I say top, I mean Stanford,  Berkeley, Carnegie Mellon, etc.  Any advice/criticisms would be really helpful!  If you don't think I should even get my hopes up, let me know that too!

In addition, I have an internship with the FAA this summer and am doing Cloud computing research up at school.  Please, I'm the first in my family to go to college at all, so any advice goes a long way!"

I can't find any motivation at the age of 23 with just a semester left to complete my CIS degree. Right now I'm currently working for a manufacturing company as an intern at the IT help desk.  It's simply boring.  I'm not given enough permissions just because I'm an intern. I feel as though I'm stuck.  Can't do any minor tasks such as laundry, dishes, cooking, practice programming, or working out (given up on this fairly recently). When I get home there is nothing I want to do except either lay down or play video games (I love them but I feel like they'll get me nowhere. Playing too much LoL at times). It's one of the reasons I got into computer programming, but I feel like I made the wrong choice and I'll just be stuck in a cubicle.  I know the field is very promising I just can't seem to motivate myself to expand my knowledge on the subject.  I want something to live for just can't find it.

Don't really have a girlfriend just been sexing up this older woman about twice my age although she is quite sexy I can't see myself relating too much with her.  Weekends are literally a blur because I'm getting drunk at night then dealing with hangovers during the morning and day.  The only thing I'm looking forward to is a vacation, which is only about 2 weeks away just to get away from the norm.  

Maybe I have one goal, but I can't seem to figure how I'd go about doing it.  It requires money and lots of time.  I'd love to travel to different countries.  Just to meet interesting people from different cultures, but I got a little bit of social anxiety with not knowing what to talk about half the time when I'm spoken or approached to.

Arrrrrgh. I just feel really stuck in a routine that will never end right now and I can't stand it.

I am a US citizen and currently intern for a US based company who happens to have an office in Geneva. They have never taken on an intern at one of their international offices. They are looking to create an intern exchange program where we send US interns to Geneva and Swiss interns to our US office. They have tasked me with finding out all the details and figuring out the logistics. In my research I have found out that the Swiss are very hesitant about people outside Switzerland and the EU working in their country, which may impact the ability to create this program.

As of right now, the two main things I'm trying to figure out are: 

Do I have to apply for a formal work visa or are there other options for students? 
What compensation/salary is normal for interns in Geneva to live comfortably?

I worked for about 6 months at a full time internship for a small business after graduating. I did all kinds of projects from product renders, banners, display stands, t shirts, product labels, ect... and the company really liked my work. Unfortunately they don't have the budget and possibly work load to hire me full time. I was paid $20/hr during my internship. 

They recently had me back for another week, and I informed them that I could do most of the work from home remotely, since I don't live near the company right now. I'm still seeking full time employment, but I really enjoyed working for this company. That said, since its no longer really an internship, would it be a good idea to see about increasing my rate? I see many freelance designers charge around $40 an hour and up, but I don't think they'd go for doubling my rate. What do you think a fair asking price would be, and what would be the best way to go about asking?

On that note, why is there such a large pay disparity between freelance and full time employment? Obviously freelance isn't necessarily steady work, but it seems like a quite a large difference between a full time position where you make 40k a year and charging $40+ an hour. "

* Is it a satisfying and fulfilling job? Better than sitting in a cubicle for 8 hours a day?

About the same time, a cute new girl out of college started and sat in the desk next to mine. We've been flirting since we started but a few weeks ago that changed. I found out she had a legitimate crush on me and when the opportunity arose, she jumped my bones.  I think the built up sexual tension exploded into the last few weeks having really good sexy times pretty regularly. I enjoy it and I enjoy her company and personality very much so far. 

Before any of this turned physical I reviewed all our company policies I could find and didn't see anything relating to dating coworkers. That eased my mind a little, but honestly I think being in an extremely small town for over a year without finding one available girl (all engaged, married, or about to be engaged or on the opposite end, are still in college doing an internship- much more inappropriate in my opinion) has made it so I'll take whatever I can get to an extent. That point has nothing to do with her though because I would still date her if the situation were less questionable, just wanted to illustrate how I'm not thinking with the most clarity and hence why I need any advice or input. I am looking for a relationship right now as it seems much more appealing than a random hookup now and then. Plus it would be nice to share the boringness of where I am with someone else. 

Last night one of my friends quite literally flipped out at me for being extremely stupid. His opinion was that when we do break up, we will be screwed as we'll either still be sitting next to each other or working together.  In his words, ""my exit plan sucks and is littered with horrible flaws."" So far, nobody in the office except our friends know about it and we talk to each other almost never during the day just so no suspicions arise and it doesn't affect our work. And it honestly hasn't.  It sounds cute in tv shows like the office, but it's more stressful in a fortune 500 company where I could have my professional life affected by this...

So reddit, why advice can you give to two young professionals like us? Am I being stupid like my friend says? Should I stop this before we get emotionally attached? 

Tldr; I'm hooking up with the coworker that sits right next to me. We're both young professionals just starting our careers. Is this a bad idea?"

My previous living situation isnt going to be an option when I return so I am looking for a place. I return on Aug 26th and have a place to crash for a week or so, but I am on the lookout for a room/apt. 

I'm perusing through craigslist quite a bit and am quite familiar with the apartments around UTD; thought I'd give this a shot anyway. I prefer to live &lt;5mi of campus so I can bike to school (or take the shuttle). I have 2 cats with me! Rent negotiable within reason. It would probably be a 9mo-1yr lease. 

About me, I'm a PhD student, 24M, fit (workout [no not the gym rat kind] and bike regularly), very quiet (when home), neat and clean and financially stable. I drink socially and dont use drugs. I cook often - for myself and others!

If you guys have anything in mind, please throw it my way!

thanks!

I am applying to medical school this year, but for some schools, I ran into a problem when I began to work on secondaries. For several schools, for example, they require four letters - three from academia and one from a clinical experience. I have four letters. However, only two are from academia. The third is from a hospital at which I completed a volunteer internship program with, and the fourth is from a surgical nurse. If I continue to submit my secondary, would they accept my application, or simply toss it out because it did not meet the letter of reference requirement?

Thanks in advance."

wrlh3,5,2012-07-18,Nervous about interviews,mwd410,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/wrlh3/nervous_about_interviews/,"Hi all,

I've been teaching myself programming for some time now. I've developed a flash game that's 90% complete called [Block'Ems](http://mwdgd.blogspot.com), I have 2 summers of internship experience in Java where I single-handedly designed, developed, and piloted software for an engineering company. I have taken two classes at my University in C++, and two classes in LabVIEW. I'm working on an Android app on the side while finishing up my senior project--the last thing I need to get my degree...

in Physics.

I don't have a BS in CS. I've taught myself 90% of the programming I know--through trial and error, and through reading links here and elsewhere, and of course some books.

I feel I'm worth a decent paying salary for something in Java. I have learned so much especially very recently. I'm just nervous I'm seen as this Physics major who's done a little programming on the side and thinks he can command a CS degree's salary. I want to be taken seriously.

I've been in contact with a recruiter for a little time now, and today I've landed an interview with a staffing agency. I worry that these sort of interviews never come to fruition. I worry that I'll make a fool of myself. 

I can code. I definitely have an ability to jump into a job that's over my head, hit the ground tumbling, but eventually get on my feet and sprint. I learn new things very quickly. Two weeks ago I had never heard of Filemaker, which is a relational database program, and now I'm doing some advanced scripting and charting. 

How do I sell myself in an interview? How do I make them feel confident in my programming ability, despite my lack of degree? Is the degree even that big a deal?"

*2) is it even feasible to contact her and 
*3) how do I go about asking? I called her Judy at work but that seems too casual a way to begin since it's been so long. In addition, I don't really know how far to go in terms of trying to jog her memory as to who I was. 

I know this probably seems unimportant but acquiring her as a reference I think would really help me.

What are your interesting stories or advice to situations you've encountered with ""The Game""?",ultra_vires,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/wr23q/work_politics_what_are_your_interesting_stories/,"I first started working in banking as an intern right after graduation. I was able to advance quickly and given lots of responsibility due to my friendship with the boss and a family member in the same department. Ultimately, I took over the position of my mentor who was relieved of his duties. Not many of the staff knew my background or experience nor did they know anything other than I was the son of another employee and friends with the CFO. I typically keep my business to myself and don't really talk to the other employees. I guess you can say I'm the mystery man that they cannot figure out. I was essentially forced to learn how to play politics quickly.

**Catching the Rumor Source**: I forced myself to go out with co-workers after work for debauchery. At first, I made sure that I was able to talk to each of them separately and feed them different pieces of false information to eventually see if I was able to hear rumors about what I told them. Be sure to drink enough to convince them that they're at least a bit buzzed to make it seem like you just like to talk and be sure to remember what you told each of them.

**Gathering Intel**: I'm the only one in the office who listens to music with my headphones. I guess you could say my actual work allows me to do such a thing as I only answer to the CFO. Most of the time I'm just pretend that I can't hear what all the executive assistants are gossiping about. They know almost everything going on and they're a great asset.

**Gaining Assets**: Best way other than common interests and working together is to help them out. Typically I will help people out in the departments I work with. If someone's doing a report that could be more efficient or automated, I'll just create a custom automated report or build something in Excel + VBA to make their life easier. Giving them a few extra minutes in the day to browse Facebook or talk to their children will make your relationship easier with them. Sooner or later it will pay dividends.

**IT is Your Skynet**: They control everything you have access to and making friends with the staff is essential. I'm one of the younger ""nerds"" and I get along with them due to common interests. I find that a lot of employees treat them like trash and aren't very respectful. This eventually means they'll dump your support ticket to the bottom for someone who has treated them better. Not only that, they'll hook you up for new equipment and software before anyone else if they're on their good side. They also know things going on before they happen because they have to set up or remove access for certain employees.

**Planting the Seed**: You want to start a rumor? Leave some printed documents at the copier to get people talking on the work that you're doing if it is out of the ordinary. If you find out those gossip people and just talk about something nonchalant or say you heard it from someone else. This can easily get you to manipulate people into situations for your own bidding (gg themselves). *evil laugh*

I'm sure a few of you already know this and a lot of these seem like common sense. Not many young professionals or maybe some older ones understand that these dynamics will make or break you in the working world. Not just my industry but others as well. I was hoping that you would all share some interesting things to help each other out. Looking forward to your responses."
wr0zq,1,2012-07-18,"Hey guys, I have been frequently getting depressed episodes punctuated by violent feelings of frustration and anger.  Anyone else deal with this or have an idea about what's going on?",[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wr0zq/hey_guys_i_have_been_frequently_getting_depressed/,"A bit more background - I'm 21, living in a college house with a few good friends and am generally well liked by almost everyone I meet.  This only feeds some of my feelings of guilt and frustration, however.  In these moments of racing thoughts, my mind bounds like a pinball between different people in my life and different situations.  I know in the rational part of my mind (which I've worked hard to keep at least some connection to in these episodes) that they love me and like me, but then it comes out of nowhere sometimes.  I'll become despondent, pull away from all my friends, not talk to family members, drink, miss class, and generally be a piece of shit.  The worst part, however, is this feeling of frustration that has been starting to well up during these periods.  The depressive episodes last from a few days to a few weeks, and the frustration or anger come out of nowhere (or are set off by truly disproportionate setbacks).  I then become destructive.  I've destroyed my computer at least 4 different times (although Dell has been really good about replacing it), threw out vacuum cleaner through the banister by out stairs (breaking both in the process), smashing the taillights and denting the shit out of my car with a pot, self harming, and all that good stuff.  Sometimes I'm under the influence of liquor, although tonight I had a couple beers and 5mg of xanax to calm be down before I broke anything because it was shaping up to be one of those nights.  Anyway, to finish my rant I suppose I just want to know if anyone has similar experiences and how they get through them.  I'm a uni student, and it has had disastrous effects on my gpa seeing as I have no direction in life while everyone else I know is getting internships building spaceships and running nuclear plants.  I'm stuck working with the university cafeteria, which has the most inefficient scheduling system ever.  I'm out of there as soon as I find something else.  $9/hr is not enough to warrant going in to a shit job with no structure and working for 3 hours before being told that the rest of the schedule is filled for the next two months.

Sorry for the rant... You guys are always awesome from what I've lurked and hopefully you can help me figure out what is going on or at least point me in the right direction.  BTW, I've been diagnosed with major depression and am taking 150 mg of Zoloft a day for that, panic disorder which I take .5 mg a day of Xanax, and allergies for which I'm on singulair.  Any help or insight would be appreciated.  Thank you so much for being here for me.

wqzxe,2,2012-07-18,"Reddit, I need some ideas",uncreative_intern,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/wqzxe/reddit_i_need_some_ideas/,"Dear fellow redditors,

I hope this post finds you well. I am a college-aged intern at a start-up online business. I don't want to disclose too much info because I'm not sure how this will play out (don't want to make the company look bad and get fired). I am also using a throwaway because if this actually works I don't really want the people I work for to see my real account.

Now, onto the part where I need your help. Basically the higher-ups at my workplace have tasked me and some other interns with creating a piece of content that gets 1500 upvotes. The ideas we have come up with frankly have not been great, and as a redditor I can't see any of them getting more than about 5 upvotes.

This may not be received well, but I figured where better to ~~solicit~~ ask nicely for ideas for such a piece of content than Reddit itself. 

So tell me reddit. What do YOU want to see a bunch of college kids make with a few days?
Also it's going to have to relate to our company somehow so I guess I can tell you that we are in the business of eLearning and online training.

All ideas are welcome (unless they suck)"
wqygg,0,2012-07-18,How do I find a job in IT/Web with lots of experience before I graduate in may? ,snow_mac,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/wqygg/how_do_i_find_a_job_in_itweb_with_lots_of/,"I am graduating next May (2013) with a Bachelors of Science in Applied Computing Technology (CS/Biz hybrid) from Colorado State University. I have 3 years IT &amp; Network Support experience and just about 2.5 years web development experience through Student positions. I've done the whole freelance thing for the last 5 years as a Wordpress theme guy. How do I approach getting a full time job after college?
I've got some experience with startups, I spent almost a full year in startup mode trying to start a social networking company with some friends &amp; we even got some money. Before that tried to start two other companies and I have done a ton of freelancing.

Skills: PHP, Ajax, C, SQL, Assembly, Coldfusion, Java, HTML, CSS, jQuery, Javascript, Bash and Wordpress.

My main interests are:

1. Web Development (lots of jQuery, PHP &amp; Coldfusion) 2. Mobile Development (No experience) 3. Security (No experience) 4. Parellel Programming (No experience)

Beyond course work my internships entirely consisted of web development and IT support, I've done lots with OOP and MVC (building a CMS for the USDA), YII, Coldfusion etc... but I am not sure how I can tailor that to applying for jobs.

My main questions are:

1. How do I find a job before I graduate that will start after I graduate?

2. I'm going on a fantastic honeymoon, and won't be able to start for 1 month after graduation. Will this be a problem? Graduation is around May 10, I won't be able to start until after June 10. Will most employer's care?

3. When do I start applying for jobs?

4. I have lots of experience, lots of people have told me to come talk to them at the career fair when I'm ready to graduate--How do I sell myself to them?

5. I'm looking at Continental United States, but will prioritize companies in Arizona (Phoenix area), Colorado (anywhere), Dallas or Austin or somewhere without beaches or snow. What's the job market like for Web Developers across the country?

6. How hard will it be for me to get a job given 6 years IT/Web experience + a 4 year degree @ 24?

Any tips or advice is greatly welcomed (other then, don't married so soon)."
wqwve,3,2012-07-18,"my partner wants to go from living together to apart, is this normal?",rshipsthrwy,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/wqwve/my_partner_wants_to_go_from_living_together_to/,"Right now my partner (m/21) and I (f/22) live together with separate rooms, along with his friend (m/19). We have been together about 7-8 months. 

It might be important to note that we have separate bedrooms and only got together after living as housemates for 1.5 years. 
we are both very busy, he has 2 jobs and goes to college full-time and is starting more extra-curricular activities soon, and I work part-time, have an unpaid internship and also have full-time college. 

The guy we live with is aggressive and rude, and in his most recent incident went from being nice to throwing furniture around the living room within 3 hours. He earns more than me and is eating my food and making my partner and I pay bills he should be contributing to.

Our lease ends in December and I began asking my partner if he wanted to live with me if I moved out of our current place, considering how unsafe I feel here. Originally my partner said yes, but then changed his mind and waited a few weeks and told me a few days ago that he wants to live separately next year. 
The reasons he used were things he had never brought up before - that he feels like he's walking on eggshells (I have PTSD in regards to previous sexual and physical abuse and have recently asked him to not do drugs around me right now, I think that was the main reason he said this though I'm not sure) and ""feels like we're married"" but won't elaborate on what that means. He has also said he ""feels it would be better for the relationship"" because we wouldn't be able to fight if we lived apart (?) and that he is worried about breaking up while we live together.


I feel abandoned. I genuinely feel unsafe here and I think that's reasonable. But I know that despite my boyfriend thinking he will be able to find time for me between post-grad work and 2 jobs, we won't see each other much at all. and without him, I don't have anyone I could live with. He is really bad with time, and is always dramatically late for things, is generally unable to keep appointments, and doesn't have any time for anything as it is. honestly, I don't want to deal with that in the future.

I have told him I feel abandoned, and that it's unfair he is choosing to live here instead of finding a place with me, and that the reasons he's using could have been fixable if he'd just told me. I have also said I'm unprepared to move this relationship backwards but he doesn't seem to understand any of it. I have also said that I don't know if I want to be with someone who is willing to leave me out in the cold like this - I don't have much chance of finding a place with my financial restrictions and no friends that are able to move out with me.

Is there anything I can do or say to fix this situation? Is there any sort of compromise possible that I'm overlooking? Is there any way I could magically make him understand and still want to live with me?

I don't want to break up with him when I move out and he can't find time for me, but I don't want to be the girlfriend sitting at home waiting for her boyfriend to be free either, especially after he's just left me to fend for myself like this.

TL;DR boyfriend has decided we should live separately despite me wanting to live with him. he has 2 jobs goes to college full-time and won't have enough time for me. Is there anything I can say or do, or any compromises that we could reach?"

[Hi! I created a Reddit account just to respond to this. Long-time creeper here.  I'm in roughly the same position as you--I've read this whole thread and we sound very similar :\) However, I am a girl and I'm going to graduate at sixteen instead of fifteen. I'm currently going into my junior year. I play League of Legends as well and love music. I skipped a grade and started school fairly early--I should have skipped more grades but didn't. I'm surprised at the lack of torment you got--I got a ton of shit growing up as the young kid. Still do.  What was the hardest subject for you in school? Were you relatively ""popular"" or well liked? Have you always felt more mature than your peers, and had friends older than you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wpkqp/iama_15year_old_high_school_graduate_who_skipped/c5fh22u?context=5)|Marry me.
 |I'm good at ignoring things. I stopped getting shit when I didn't react to it. I just said ""k"" and went on my merry way.
 |Hardest subject: English. I'm terrible at writing in a time limit.
 |I was fairly well liked.  I've felt as mature as my peers (my grade level) and usually more  mature than most my age.
 |Seriously, marry me.
[Now kiss.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wpkqp/iama_15year_old_high_school_graduate_who_skipped/c5flize?context=5)|I just impregnanted her. AMA.
[How do you tell your school ""You know, I just finished 5th grade. I think I should be in 8th now""? Because seriously, I don't think my school cared if you were learning anything or whatever, you went where your age said you went.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wpkqp/iama_15year_old_high_school_graduate_who_skipped/c5fbql3?context=5)|Aptitude test scores, I.Q. scores, my mom's advocacy, and one of the best middle-school principals in one of the best counties in the country.
[What is your IQ?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wpkqp/iama_15year_old_high_school_graduate_who_skipped/c5felvv?context=5)|The scale stops being accurate at around 130, so I'm not sure of my score.
[How does it feel to know that you're the reason why I'm not good enough for my asian parents? Just kidding, what's your favorite subject?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wpkqp/iama_15year_old_high_school_graduate_who_skipped/c5fctxc?context=5)|Math and music. :P.
[Do you regret it? Do you have Friends your age?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wpkqp/iama_15year_old_high_school_graduate_who_skipped/c5fbp6j?context=5)|No and no.
 |Edit: I thought a bit more.
 |The real answer to the second question is kind of. As I progressed through highschool, the incoming freshman got closer to my age every year, but even in my senior year, when I was their age, I felt older than them.
[What about athletics? No interest?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wpkqp/iama_15year_old_high_school_graduate_who_skipped/c5ff6gg?context=5)|The only sport I participated in in high school was the Rubik's Cube team.

I sometimes forget how old I am.
[Which grades did you skip, and how did the other students treat you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wpkqp/iama_15year_old_high_school_graduate_who_skipped/c5fbmtz?context=5)|I skipped kindergarten, but that's fairly negligible. The big skip was 5-8. I skipped 6th and 7th grade entirely. I was treated like shit in 8th grade, because I was so full of myself it was absurd. I learned to fit in and was treated like a peer instead of ""that one annoying kid"" by the time I was a sophomore.
[Sounds like your mom's a little pushy.  Is she a 'helicopter parent'?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wpkqp/iama_15year_old_high_school_graduate_who_skipped/c5fdvtk?context=5)|She only pushes me to honor my commitments.

[Do you ever think you are going to miss out on anything? Like Prom, or crazy highschool parties. You even mention that you will be coming home on weekends from college.

The weekends home is probably only the first year, so I can adjust well to college life. It may not even last more than a semester. I don't care about parties.
[I thought since i skipped one grade i was smart :(  Anyway...what do you want to do with your life? does it bother you that all your college peers will be drinking legally WAY before you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wpkqp/iama_15year_old_high_school_graduate_who_skipped/c5fd3fd?context=5)|No idea what I wanna do with my life. With my degrees I'll be able to go into a dozen fields, and I'll cross that bridge when I come to it. And I don't care about alcohol.
[What's the big hurry?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wpkqp/iama_15year_old_high_school_graduate_who_skipped/c5ff1vl?context=5)|There is none. I've done what feels like a natural pace to me, and ended up where I am.
[Going to college as a 15 y.o., do you think that you will be missing some of the experiences that college has to offer? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wpkqp/iama_15year_old_high_school_graduate_who_skipped/c5fcrg1?context=5)|You mean the booze, women, and weed?

What is your strongest area and what are you going to study in college?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wpkqp/iama_15year_old_high_school_graduate_who_skipped/c5fbm8h?context=5)|I took one when I was ~4, and I don't know my actual score but they said that the test begins to be unreliable after ~130, so my score's inaccurate.  In college I plan to do a dual degree for a total of 3 majors: a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.A. double major in music composition and mathematics.
[Is there a reason why you're wanting to triple major?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wpkqp/iama_15year_old_high_school_graduate_who_skipped/c5feuaz?context=5)|3 things I love, can't pick which one to make less important, so I just do all 3.

[I will be also attending Hood College part time this upcoming fall, so it was pretty much a pleasant surprise once you said you were going, too.

[I went to your high school (before you did, I was in the class ahead of your brother\) and saw this on your Failbook. Good show on making it through, man. I don't know you directly, but all of our mutual friends have spoken very highly of you :\)  I don't think that people should be so critical of your age. You're fifteen, so what? That doesn't mean that you're mentally/socially/whatever that different from ""college age"" kids. I'm 20, about to be 21, and I have close friends that range in age from about 16-25. I don't feel any different chilling with people younger than me or older than me. Age is just a physical thing. I don't imagine that it will be too difficult to meet people that won't give two shits about your age, and will just treat you like a normal peer.  Also, watch out for the choir teacher at Hood. Since you're partially a music major, I assume that you'll probably have to take some sort of ensemble (idk what Hood's comp requirements are\) and I guess choir is the ""standard."" My community college choir sang Handel's Messiah with them (which they've done every single year for the past forever\) and we put them to shame. And it was definitely not the vocalists' fault. I guess just remember she's not the most...knowledgable vocalist out there. Or most in tune, haha.  And to throw a few questions in here, since this is an AMA after all, who are your favorite classical composers, and what is your favorite era of pre-modern music? Also, what kind of music do you like to write?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wpkqp/iama_15year_old_high_school_graduate_who_skipped/c5fmh2w?context=5)|I'm a big fan of the romantics. Rachmaninoff, Chopin, Paganini, et. al just make my day. I usually write classical/acoustic rock/metal.
[Do you look your age?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wpkqp/iama_15year_old_high_school_graduate_who_skipped/c5fhyn0?context=5)|Yep. Some people say I look older, but I think I look about 15.
[I only skipped one grade (graduated at age 17 with seven months until my next birthday\) and I had a problem working well with people in my grade socially. Has this affected you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wpkqp/iama_15year_old_high_school_graduate_who_skipped/c5fgd5g?context=5)|I had trouble adjusting and being treated like a peer, but I adjusted and ended up fine.
[One more question. Did anyone tease you due to jealousy on their part? (this is being asked based on a personal experience I had with a certain kid from my grade; every time I out-witted him he would judge me because I was a year younger\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wpkqp/iama_15year_old_high_school_graduate_who_skipped/c5fgicd?context=5)|Occasionally, but sticks and stones.....

[No offense either, but some of you that skipped multiple grades ended up doing your undergrad at Average/Relatively Poor schools. Even Hood College is a bit average. If you were as smart as you think you are why not attend a better school? Do you really think that in the end skipping the grades will be worth it if you don't do go to a college thats as reputable? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wpkqp/iama_15year_old_high_school_graduate_who_skipped/c5fyi9y?context=5)|I didn't wanna go to a big ""reputable"" school. You can get just a good of an education, if not better, at a small school. Besides, where you go for your Undergrad doesn't matter as long as you go to a good grad school.
[I moved up grades in individual classes, so I will be taking math and language courses at university this fall, along with the classes at my ever so lovely focus high school.  Anyway, for a question, Have you ever had really teachers that treat you differently because of your age?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wpkqp/iama_15year_old_high_school_graduate_who_skipped/c5fe3n6?context=5)|The policy for me was that since I had taken on the burden of a normal-age high school student, I would be expected to be as mature as one and treated like one.  Good luck with your university classes!

[Would you agree that American school system is a waste of time with summer breaks and re-learning the first 6 weeks of the last 6 weeks material.

Everyone should have time to be a kid, but it is true that eliminating summer breaks would drastically improve the quality of our education.

I was recently offered an internship by a guy at a company I've known quite awhile. Officially, I don't know if the position is technically ""web development"", but I figured given what I'll be working with it would be close. My primary duties would include:

Source Code management (Git, SVN, JIRA)

Bug ticket management

HTML5

Learning stuff by playing with code

CSS/JS/AJAX

Python

Linux/Puppet admin

Cloud stuff (Amazon EC2, Linode, Heroku)

NoSQL databases

RDBMS

Documentation, diagramming, flowcharting

In addition to some more ""interny"" jobs such as taking the office dogs out for a walk, picking up lunch, and listening in on client meetings just to get a feel of what the company and I will be working on.

The job requires no prior knowledge of any of the above languages or frameworks. It's really a great opportunity I want to get involved in, but how much should it pay? 

Looking at [this](http://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/web-developer-intern-salaries-SRCH_KO0,20_IP2.htm) site reveals somehwere in the 12-20 dollar range, but I feel anything above maybe 13 is too high. I do know some people currrently in internships getting paid $15-$20. 

For reference, I live in Southern California (Orange County) and I'm a third year CS student at UC Irvine

Thanks!

I do Proteomics research (research into proteins) about a certain family of proteins called Tropomodulin which ar einvolved in the muscles. Basically what I do is mutate a certain spot in the protein sequence, purify it, and then test it against the normal protein you see in nature. This can tell us reasons why proteins act in weird ways which can help figure ways to cure diseases that involve that mutation.

As for proof, i'll upload my ID card. As for why I'm drunk, my labmate said I should try Sangria, a wine combo with fruits and stuff. So here I am.

Now, I know that in the past modding has been a huge source of business for certain Secondlife users. But i seem to remember hearing something a year or so back along the lines of the people in charge were going to be banning or otherwise limiting modding.

I have a bachelors degree from a moderately rated state school in biology and attended Logan College of Chiropractic.  During my time there I tutored, participated in an internship, and what the school called equivalent to residency (totally not).  I argued with teachers who presented crazy stuff with no proof or evidence and was even threatened for this by a 'professor'.  About 1/4 of my education (~4500 hours) was crap that could be thrown out and evidence based medicine taught in its place.

I often get asked why I went into chiropractic and I had a great experience working in a chiropractic office after undergrad so I really enjoy what I do, but not the closed doors and instant skepticism of me based upon my profession.

In the end I like what I do but wouldn't recommend it to most people, lots of other professions out there with less hassle and better job prospects.

FWIW I will never use the term subluxation unless we are talking about a TRUE partial dislocation but I have only seen that in radiology cases and never in practice, if I did they are getting referred to the ER.

Well enough about me, bring on the questions.  I promise I won't be offended so ask anything about chiropractic education, practice, quacks (I have met my share), its future, or its past.

Edit: Alright folks it is about 1 AM in my neck of the woods so I am going to call it a night.  Feel free to post up more comments/questions and if I get time tomorrow I will be sure to respond."

So much differently that i always felt as if i was pushed into a corner and forgotten about. It wasn't only my father, though, it was my mother. Several fights ensued because of this feeling and i was just forced to deal with it. My grandpa, who is my fatherly figure kept telling me ""One day you'll understand why it is like this."" I always assumed it was one of those ""when you're a parent you'll understand"" type deals.
When i was 16 i moved to Virgina, with my uncle, and did some internship work. During that time my great grandmother died. We were trying to make arrangements to get to the funeral. My mom, refused to let me go to my grandparents with my uncle for one night. An argument developed between my uncle and mom. My uncle (mind you my uncle is an awesome man who means no ill intentions), in a fit of rage, said ""If you don't settle down i will tell him."" After the argument came to a halt, because mom hung the phone up on him, i said to my uncle ""Tell me what?"" He looked at me and said B(We will call him B, the man who i thought was my father) is not your real dad. There was the huge wave of emotion that hit me. Confusion, frustration, sadness, and yet a feeling of understanding, overwhelmed me to the point where i lost it. I couldn't eat, sleep nothing. It was such an odd and unsettling feeling.
Mom has only admitted to me once that Bill is not my father. She still tries to suck me into her lies and deceit. When she admitted i tried to have her help me find out who my father is (she knows and I know now.) This has ruined my relationship with my mother, even 10 years later.
When i was 18, i went on a mission to find out who he was. Through talking to mom's old friends, and finding old admission papers to the college she went to, i ended up finding out that it was a middle eastern fellow. He moved over here from Kuwait to attend college. Him and my mom had a fling for quite a well and out came me. This man left my mother once he found out she was pregnant. Because that is completely against their beliefs (Sharia Law) and could not accept me as a son. My search wasn't done though, i wanted to know more. I ended up finding out that i have a sister through him. A girl that i thought stalked me throughout my teenage life. I would see her everywhere, staring at me. Driving past my house etc. She knew i was her brother, but i didn't know that she was my sister. She was afraid to say anything, and her mother advised her to not approach me as she didn't know what kind of damage it would do if any.

Many secondaries ask if I was employed this summer. I feel silly/inadequate stating that I was a waiter/bus person, but often do not have the opportunity to explain why I'm doing that rather then some medically relevant job. 

My question is: Will med schools see that I'm currently a waiter and think, what is this kid doing? "

I come from a college town where the average age in the city of 100k and the median age is 29, compared to 35 in the rest of the nation. It's a very young atmosphere and all of my interactions have been with girls in their late teens early 20's.

Once I got to the city I started going out very often trying to meet people. Women seem to assume I'm well into my late teens, they say I can hold a conversation, have many life stories, and I carry myself like I'm not in college. This is usually what we talk about after I reveal that I'm still 21 and finishing up University. 
I don't mind the compliments of acting older than my age, but I would rather avoid that topic all together, I feel like after I reveal age the conversation dynamic shifts for the worse. 

I don't want to lie about my life, and when talking about what I do it's hard not to incriminate myself as a student transitioning into graduate school.

How should I deal with the women who persist to know my age, or know about things that may incriminate me about my age.
I am leaving to go back to my university town soon, so I don't think this problem will follow me there, but I would like to know anyway because it will help in all future interactions"

I'm currently in the market for my very first dedicated macro lens. 
Options- (leaning sigma or nikkor)
90mm tamron
100mm tokina
70mm sigma
105mm sigma
85mm nikkor micro
Used (older version sans VR) 105mm nikkor micro AF-D
*Also open to other suggestions*

I've been looking into reviews and people seem to be saying the sigma 70 is the sharpest- but is this a noticeable improvement over the other macro lenses? 

Also, working distance isn't as good with all except the sigma 105 and the nikkors- the others extend during focusing enough to where it cuts down on WD. Is it worth sacrificing the sigma 70's sharpness and going for the 85 micro's WD for the same price? Or should I shell out the extra money for the sigma 105, combining sharpness AND working distance? 

Note on money- I have enough to easily afford any of these, maybe a little more, but I'd also like to buy some other things potentially (College student spending leftover internship money)

Sorry, that ended up being more than I initially planned for.

wtrsq,0,2012-07-19,"I was just given an expensive ticket for not coming to a complete stop at a stop sign, however I don't believe I broke any laws...explanation inside.  Am I right?",riccarjo,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/wtrsq/i_was_just_given_an_expensive_ticket_for_not/,"Last night, after a long day at work at around 10 P.M., I was driving home when a cop pulled me over. He claimed I completely ignored a stop sign.  I had seen him sitting next to the stop sign when I was walking to my car, and so I'm almost positive he was scoping people out who did this.  

I did a rolling stop, not a complete stop because I did not think that the stop sign was in use.  It was a 4 way intersection, with two one way streets (one being the one I was on).  The kicker however, is that one of the two-way streets was completely closed and fenced off for construction, and the stop sign was on the same corner as this.

Thus, there was no reason for there to be a stop sign, for it was impossible for any car to come within my lane due to the construction, thus I did not think a complete stop was necessary, and therefore it was not against the law.

wtq8a,0,2012-07-19,Help me maximize my internship!,hellorabbit,finance,https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/wtq8a/help_me_maximize_my_internship/,"Hey guys,

I am a rising senior at a NY university and am currently interning full time at a security lending services company for the summer. I am nearing the halfway point (5 more weeks) and was wondering if r/finance had any advice on how to utilize all this internship has to offer/gain relevant experience for future internships or jobs. Regarding career goals, I am very interested in the quantitative analyst path and am researching graduate programs in the area for post undergraduate, but as of right now I am trying to learn anything I can . I used to be a Computer Science major but have since switched over to Economics (looking back, sticking to Comp Sci would have been the smarter choice). 
_______________________________________________________________________________________
Anyways here are some things that I have access to:

* Bloomberg
* Crystal Reports
* Series 7 Study Guides
* Accounting (financial statements, cash flows, expense reports, I assume)

I may be missing some but this is all I can think of right now
_______________________________________________________________________________________

I wanted to learn more about Excel but unfortunately there isn’t much use in my department. I’ve since bought this Excel Book to learn some more. I also wanted to pick up C++ as well but the developers here mostly use Java.

Of course, all of this will be supplementary to my work in case anyone is concerned.  Thanks for all your help and let me know if you need any more info!

I am curious about a new salary figure.",job1234,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/wtnsi/just_started_a_new_position_will_be_doing/,"I started at a new company about 3 weeks ago, and since then my IT manager left to go to a new company. I actually inherited all of her past SQL tasks and maintenance in the companies data base. Since she has left my boss is looking for me to continue to do these tasks and develop the database more and create new automations. Well this is well and fine, but I was hired on as a help desk employee. I *am* the help desk, I work along side one other person in the IT dept. and he is the sysadmin. 

Some background on myself, I actually have experience on both sides of technology. I went to school for programming (Associates Degree in Web/Application development) and I have always done IT work for outside customers. I have been doing software/hardware troubleshooting for about 6 years now. I did two internships during college, one was an IT job in a school system and the other was a programming/project manager job for a non-profit. My last position I was a project manager for web development for about a year. I have not done a lot of SQL work outside of college but I am pretty fluent in there pulling information and reading/changing stored procedures.

So as you can see I am all over the place, and I didnt even mention that I have worked in many different fields other than technology. We wont get into that though.

Before my IT manager left I had a talk with her about the company and how much power I have behind position changes and salary compensation. She mentioned that since its a smaller department and a medium size company that I could basically present my research and work my way into anything I want. Since then, my boss has asked me to look into some SQL classes for a refresher in the ""language"", and I will be starting one in the next few weeks. Now for the questions:

1. I am trying to figure out what my title will be. I will basically be doing SQL procedures every morning, adding new procedures to the database for new clients, maintaining the current procedures, and creating new automation. What sort of title might this be?
2. As far as salary goes, after these next few weeks I will be deep within their database and I know they will not want to train another person in there. So I know I have some leverage, so I know that I will be seen as an asset. With my education and experience, what salary range should I be looking into here?

I will also mention that I am working on the state line between NH and MA if this helps.

I am therefore interested in a paid internship or an entry level position as Software Engineer in an English speaking country.

What I can offer: I have some experience with a broad range of languages. However, most larger projects I have worked on so far were written in Java, Scala, Matlab or C/C++. I know basic technologies like ER, UML and have the theoretical background in Algorithms, Maths (Linear Algebra, Discrete Maths, Statistics etc.), Object Oriented Programming, Concurrency, Functional Programming and so forth. Unfortunately, I have little experience with specific frameworks (e.g. .NET). I have put a few code samples up on my [github page](https://github.com/dkgi/).

What I am looking for: A chance to get some practical programming experience within a motivated team working on challenging problems. My primary interests are in software architecture, software engineering, formal verification, concurrency, simulations and computer graphics. I am, however, always eager to broaden my horizon.

In short, I have a solid theoretical foundation and I am a quick and eager learner looking to get some practical experience.

Please pm me if your interested in working with me. If not, feedback about what put you off is welcome as well.

About a month ago, my girlfriend broke up with me. I stopped caring for a bit, I thought that I could give myself a little personal satisfaction and love. I thought that I could be all I needed from the world. I was wrong.

I gave in, nofap. And I failed in other ways, too. I went to bars, and I got drunk, and I fooled around with some people. I didn't study for my LSATs. I didn't do my debate-team assignments. I quit one of the two internships I had this summer, so I could focus more on my studies - but also because I was lazy and didn't want to do it. And because I was scared that I will fail if I tried.

I've never had a relationship last longer than four months, nofap. Sometimes I wonder if it's because I'm broken.

I fapped every day, multiple times a day, for a month. My room is a mess; I haven't cleaned in ages. I'm afraid that I'm sick - like, really sick, and not just physically (though I made some really fucking stupid choices and I might have given myself an early death sentence). I stay up late at night worrying about myself. I'm scared. I feel lethargic and dead inside in the middle of the day and I get nervous and energetic at night. There might be something wrong with me - I see that now.

I want to be better, nofap.

No one can help me. Maybe I can't help me. And I used to be the guy that other people went to with their problems. I used to help people. These days, nofap, I worry that I can't do anything right. I spent a couple days not texting any of my friends and none of them texted me to say hello. I'm scared and alone.

I don't want to die. I worry that I'm going to.

I don't want to be a loser.

I just want to be able to cry without feeling like I'm weak. I want to be able to cry without feeling ashamed, without pulling back.

Okay, so when I was 18 I started a venture in online advertising, I didn't make millions but I made enough to be able to invest in a very bull market and accumulate $100,000, along with setting aside enough to live off of and pay for college.

About two years ago, my ex-girlfriend of 5 years broke up with me while I was trying to grow my business, go to school full time, and work various management-related internships. It killed me, my heart was broke (I stayed in bed for a full day, dry heaving and not eating a single parcel of food). And she even took my dog (A beautiful red Doberman named Ella). I told myself I would never be fucked with like that again. Ever.

Cue to today, my girlfriend of almost two years now, and I, click. I don't know how to explain it but we just get along very well. We don't plan on getting married any time soon but are very comfortable talking about it. Mostly in a joking manner, with *very* little serious talk.

But, I told her, in a serious manner, that if I bought a house 100% with my money, that I would request she sign a prenup on the house (and it's equity) because I don't believe I should have to give something up I paid for 100%, just in case shit does hit the fan. But I said everything else like my savings, retirement, etc. would go through divorce court as per usual and as per Michigan law, she would still get a shitload of stuff. She says that it isn't fair because she would have to leave her place of residence for years, uproot all her belongings, find an apartment or house of her own, and leave all her memories behind, etc. I cited that if we loved eachother, we shouldn't worry about a divorce any way, and that a prenup on 1 asset is nothing.

We both really disagreed with eachother but stopped arguing about it because I don't own a house, nor have I proposed to her. Plus, we were just sick of arguing and went out for ice cream. But, it has been bothering me. I just don't think there is anything wrong with not wanting to get fucked over and protecting yourself a little bit.

Am I right or is she? If anyone could offer some thought or insight, that would be greatly appreciated. It's 2AM and I'm usually in a dead sleep but it's been bothering me so much I have to post this question here."

I'm a third year undergrad hoping to go into psychiatry. I have some shadowing and I'm hoping to get some clinical experience in, but I'm also really interested in looking for a mental health policy internship during the school year. This would entail stuff like advocacy, community outreach, meetings, etc., for a nonprofit or something, so definitely not clinical. As far as my research goes, it would be to advocate for better mental health policy (of course), raise awareness, put on events and such.

I'm a strong proponent of the whole ""do what you really want to do and not JUST for the application,"" but of course a balance would be the best! And since I only decided on premed recently I'm a bit late and really need to optimize my time. This type of thing really would take up a large chunk of my extracurricular time, and I'm wondering if maybe I should shelve this desire for now if this experience isn't a good enough balance of what I want vs. what's good for my app.

So basically: Is it worth it? I'm pretty much leaning towards yes but I am fairly clueless.

Here's my problem: I want to win by ex back, but I've hurt her emotionally.

This is the story.  My ex and I met at school and dated smoothly for about one school year.  Things got a bit rocky towards the end of the year and we hastily decided to break up. That's where the trouble started.

I made the stupid decision to get drunk for an entire weekend to ""get over the heartbreak"" and ended up dancing with a few girls at 2 different parties.  She heard about me dancing with her friend at the first party and actually saw me dancing with a random girl at the next day's party.  And thus, her emotional pain began.

And what would you know, when the weekend ended I realized how stupid I had been.  I hastily gave myself a remedy to heartbreak before giving myself time to consider how I REALLY felt.  I suddenly felt lonely, sad and beaten down.  I wanted her back, but I knew I had hurt her so much...  She basically hated my guts for the rest of the school year.

And then comes summer.  I got her an internship prior to the break up and we end up working together.  I try to show her that I am willing to change and better myself to get her back.  I had several different situations over the course of the summer so far that began with me in high spirits and ended completely crushed... but I would get back up and try again after every attempt.

But tonight, she brought up every bad emotion she has ever had.  She said she hated me, she called me a monster and that she never wants to get back with me again or have anything to do with me.  I dont know what to do reddit...

PS. She has stayed with me several times over the summer and we've also had sex on occasion.  I've also been going out of my way to give her free transportation tickets ($200 worth) and have taken her out on several ""Dates"".  All while me and her were not together and I was trying to get her back...

As it turns out, he and I went to high school together and live in the same town (what are the odds?). To say the least, the kid was an entitled prick in high school and was not a fan of me or my political views. From the second I realized that they would talk to him about me, I knew I was dead in the water. Since then, the job hunt has been one of the most frustrating and depressing things I have ever gone through.

So could anyone possibly help a Democrat entrenched in blood-red land find employment in DC....?"

wslap,11,2012-07-18,"Ok Ents, time to let it out. All of it.",eldudemanbrah,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/wslap/ok_ents_time_to_let_it_out_all_of_it/,"Wall of text incoming, so beware: Recently I've been doing a lot of thinking and reflecting on my past, mostly because that's just about all I can do at my job. I have also been told that it's better to let your troubles out than keep them bottled up, and since I am a generally lonely person I figured the most tolerant, friendly, and caring community has to be r/trees, so I figured I'd make this a nice community experience. EVERYONE: Post what's troubling you. It doesn't have to be trees related, and it would probably be better not to attack anyone, but still I suggest you let it out. I'll start.

This is the story of *Dr. Nolove: Or How I Learned to stop Self Sabotaging and Love the Friendzone.*

I lived in a small town where, if you've lived there for more than a year, odds are your reputation preceded you. Starting my freshman year, I was coming off the heels of being a weird kid. I mean, public-freakout-two-months-earlier weird. So I went in with that just calming down. Anywho, I hadn't hit puberty quite yet so I was a 5' 2"" skinny kid who was also quite obnoxious a.k.a. not very popular. I'm doing marching band, so I have no outside life and I'm happy. No one bothers me and I live life. I hit on girls, but given my stature and squeaky voice, I fail constantly. Finally, a breakthrough: A fellow bandie. She's 2 years older than me, so that adds to my already heightened nervousness, be she's very nice and she's been giving me *the look*. We go on a date, I get cold feet after that and break it off (A year later, she'd tell me how much she was into me at the time, so fuck me right?). **Confidence level:** Exists. She noticed me and said yes to a date, so I was pretty jazzed.

Begin sophomore year, and I just grew 7 inches and my voice dropped at least 2 octaves. Holy fuck, I was ready to go. I hit on girls in my class all the time, which probably factored into my lonliness when I was an upperclassman. I was awkward, lanky, and my voice cracked every other word. I tried to make a move on a sexy colorguard lady who was clearly attracted to me not two weeks prior to the incident, but she said no. **Confidence level:** Dropping, but still hopeful. I recognize I have yet to hit my adolescent prime, so I say fuck it. Later that year, I am witness to a very unfortunate event, which get a teacher fired and my ass out of band. I joined the improv team and started working at my school's theater. It's like starting anew. 

Between my sophomore and junior years I become best friends with he-shall-be-known-as B. This guys awesome, and aside from physical and very minor personality discrepensies, we're practically carbon-copies. This friendship would later factor into my issues, but I wouldn't realize. We'll touch on B more towards the end of this tale. **Confidence level:** Tony Stark. B has brought me out of my shell and we both start in every Improv match we attend. We chill every weekend, at least, and start becoming occasional ents.

Junior year; what I'll describe as my best year in high school. It's basically my emotional senior year because almost all of my friends are seniors. We hang everyday, love improv, and manage to restart our school's Drama class. I talk to a girl  everyday (who's still one of my closest friends), but she was taken so I'd bide my time. She was worth it; kind, beautiful, caring, adventurous, the whole package. About 4 months into the school year, she comes back into the market and makes it obvious she's interested; I'm oblivious. My absent mindedness lost me a great catch (I still get shit about it from my parents). **Confidence level:** Audible ""fuck me."" Self- loathing ensued and I essentially friendzoned myself. It sucked but I could still salvage it. I enjoyed the rest of my year and was hopeful for the next year. I'd be big man on campus and I was finally showing people I was more than an obnoxious loser. Life could be better, but it certainly wasn't shitty. 

Senior year: All of my friends moved out of town. B and my 4 closest went two hours north just to go to a specific community college. I was devastated. I had maybe 2 good friends and they were very much part of a group I didn't fit very well into. I became **the** group-hopper: I'd never eat lunch with the same people two days in a row. I developed a horrible fear of rejection and it fucked with my sleep, my friendships, and my leadership in Improv. I stopped going to meetings, I'd sleep through my classes, and I was quiet. I became a recluse for the most part. On weekends I'd play video games with one of my close friends from school. I was baked out of my gourd 24/7 and I almost was suspended for it. I pulled a 4.3 but how, I'll never know. **Confidence level:** Mao ze DONE. I was dead to the world. I wouldn't speak unless spoken to, and my answers were usually really terse. I ended up not applying to any UC's or Private colleges and I'm still regretting it now. At the end of the year B and the crew moved back down, but I was pretty bitter still.

During the summer I started to brighten up. I'd hang out with some of the semi-friends I made during the year, but for the most part I'd chill with B. He started smoking more and I slowed down to his pace; life was good. About this point I realized my poor choice of college.

Freshman year again and I meet people like me. They were nerds, we played games erryday, and we'd occassionally play ""basketball"" as we liked to call it. I'd talk to people but my senior year fucked me. I was so afraid of people I couldn't make conversation with most. My life consisted of movies, video games, and class. About 2 months in I meet a girl. She's shy, but gorgeous, and we talk for a bit. Eventually she comes to my room. I'm fucking terrified. It's the first time I've been remotely intimate with anything but my right hand and the nerves get the best of me; I don't finish. I guess she felt bad too, because she wouldn't let me walk her back to her dorm. She didn't answer texts or calls, and she'd avoid me if she saw me on campus. **Confidence level:** *Deliverance*. And if you don't get that reference I'll explain: Raped while my friends looked on in horror. They saw me go into that room and they saw me come out. I didn't have to say anything for them to know. I hated myself. I was confused. For two weeks all they saw me for was lunch and dinner, and I didn't say anything. I'd play games with them after that, but I was the worst. I'd swear if I fucked up at all, and I'd brag if I won. I was a total douchenozzle. Sometime around the release of Skyrim, I realize what a dick I've been and I lighten up. They welcome me back with open arms. Beginning the next quarter, I realize I've developed some pretty crippling nervousness when I deal with attractive women. I clam up and can't look them in the eye; it sucks. After a bit of coercing, I manage to ask a girl on my floor to go smoke with me. She says yes, but our schedules are really conflicting. We manage to get to watch Breaking Bad for an evening, but my oblivious roomie manages to inadvertently cock-block me. She gives up on me. **Confidence level:** [Just about here.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djZFHTa6TfA) It was around the end of the year and I knew I was moving home. 

I got the job I currently have, and other than my video game friend previously referenced, I can't seem to get out that much. B is at an internship out of town, and almost everyone I used to know treats me like a leper. I constantly put open invitations to see movies, or hang out on facebook. I've managed to see maybe 4 other people for a day, but that was a month ago and now they don't talk to me too much. My parents are moving over 9 hours away and I have to find my own place to live in a month or so. **Confidence level: Like I'm starting all over again.  Some of you may be all like ""BUT WHAT ABOUT B? YOU SAID HE FACTORED INTO YOUR ISSUES!"" and here's how he does. He's like my clone right? But successful. Every one of those situation I failed in he would've prospered. He's got something I don't and I've played second fiddle to him all these years. It's neither of our faults, but it really hit close to home once I realized it.

ANYWHO, now I feel awesome. Finally expressing why I've been so jaded and awkward and nervous for the past year has been like lifting 1,000 pounds off of my shoulders. And I invite you to do the same. Let it out, but don't let it go. Write it. Feel it. Learn from it. That is all.

[Do you believe marijuana should be legalized? Why or why not?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5frr0g?context=5)|Even though I don't smoke weed, I do think it should be legalized. There are so many benefits involved even excluding medicinal purposes.
 |If you legalize weed, you legalize hemp. Hemp oil is a natural competitor against modern oil companies (who fund a shit load towards campaigns supporting marijuana prohibition). It could potentially bring the costs of oil/gas down.
 |Open the market on weed, tax it, you collect revenue and alleviate some of the financial burden our society is currently experiencing.
 |Less people are getting locked up for selling weed = lower incarceration rates = lower taxes because you no longer have to pay for that weed distributer's 3 hots and a cot.
 |Those are 3 big ones that I can think of.
[Hemp is legal to grow in a handful of states now. But, I think it's misunderstood and frowned upon -- therefore most of the hemp products in stores still come from Canada. I like how you can buy hemp products in any state but only grow hemp in some.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5fswj4?context=5)|You can't even get high off hemp. I don't get it either.
[Its really hard to imagine where the stigma came from. Normally you'd think it was a holdover from an older generation, but the parachute that saved George Bush Sr.'s life was made of hemp.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5ftst0?context=5)|It has very very small traces of THC in it. That's my guess.
[How easy, or difficult, is it to cheat? You won't get fooled easily, right?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5frhnu?context=5)|For the procedure we go through, it is very difficult to cheat. As I mentioned before, our clients report anywhere from 1-7 days a week. Our tests are ""random"". They could get tested on any given day at any given time (that they're in the facility). This is to prevent them from flushing their system or ""preparing"" for a test. I also have the unfortunate privilege of dong-watching. I have to actually see them take their dick out and pee in the cup.  Other procedures are easy to cheat, especially if it's a scheduled test. It all depends on the organization or company that is administering the test.
[So, is there a girl that cootch-watches?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5g551e?context=5)|Yes. It's called clam exam.
[Military calls you guys meat-gazers.  enjoy.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5fscbe?context=5)|I've been in the military. Though it wasn't common, I had a meat-gazer while when I was peeing in a cup. 
[*I love my job... minus the dong-watching.*  Some people would consider that the highlight of the work day. What's wrong with you? ;-\) Just kidding.  How's the pay?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5frn69?context=5)|It's alright. It pays the bills. The benefits are amazing though. And I get a shit-ton of PTO.
[What unexpected things have happened while dong watching?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5frodq?context=5)|I made the mistake of turning my back on a client for a few seconds. When I turned around, he handed me the cup. It was a crystal clear liquid and I didn't even have to look at the temperature mark on the cup. It was ice cold. He basically tried to pass off toilet water as his pee. I told him that I was insulted that he thought he could try that on me. 
[As a professional in a related field, do you think people on welfare should be required to take drug tests? Or do you think the costs would outweigh the benefits.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5fryv3?context=5)|I think people on welfare should have to provide proof that they're actively looking for work. Using drugs can often prevent an individual from finding work, so in a way, yes. I do think they should drug test people on welfare.  On the flip side, a lot of people on welfare have problems with drugs. Problems that they can't afford to get help for. Cutting them off welfare would only perpetuate those problems.
[I think you're making the assumption that all people on welfare are drug addict-low lifes and that all people who use drugs are no good burdens on society. There are rich people on drugs and good people on welfare. That's  just my two cents though :/](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5fsjbz?context=5)|Not even close. A lot of my close friends use drugs and they function just fine in society. Hell, I've used drugs before.
 |And I know that people on welfare aren't drug addicts nor are they low lifes. I'm saying that I believe that people on welfare (that are physically able) should be looking for work to get off or decrease the welfare they're collecting. I also think, they should provided proof to Social Services that they are actively looking for work. If they're using, it could hinder them getting hired. That's why I think welfare should test people.
 |But of course, there are also a lot of negative social repercussions to that so it would have to be a policy approached with extreme caution.
[Just a question about your line of work.  Does it get tiring?  I know it can be quite a tough job at times but what would be your greatest moment in the job?  How much time do you take for self care? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5frs6s?context=5)|It does get tiring at times. Sometimes I feel like I'm babysitting a bunch of grown-ass men. But when all is said and done, I'm trying to help these guys get back on their feet. Our main goal is to help them reestablish their lives post incarceration. I love helping people, especially those people who society often shuns and neglects. People fail to realize that they're people before they're criminals and some of them genuinely need help. When they say ""thank you for that"", those are the best moments in my life. I think the organization was onto something considering I get plenty of PTO AND a 4 day weekend every 15 weeks, so that gives me plenty of time to recharge the batteries.
[What is the worst drug test you have ever seen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5frima?context=5)|One client tested positive for PCP, cocaine, and weed. I'm sure there have been worse, but that was the worse I ever seen.
[Are you guys dick heads like that one from Workaholics?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5frp57?context=5)|Haha. I love that show. But not usually. I'm only a dickhead if the client is a dickhead. We'll occasionally get a client that will act like an asshole because he knows he's going to fail. Then he'll get pissed when you told him he failed. And that's when I usually start giving him a hard time.
[Is it a legitimate excuse for someone to not be able to urinate because of a shy bladder? What do you do in that situation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5fs2c7?context=5)|Yes that is a legitimate excuse. They'll just wait in the designated are for clients that need to be tested. 9 times out of 10, they'll have to pee so bad by the end of the day, it'll just come out.
 |If they do continue to have a shy bladder, we usually send them to take a test with their parole officer. What they do over there, I'm not sure.
[What are your views on individual freedom, civil liberty and the right to alter the state of your mind as you wish as moral and ideological arguments against drug tests and the illegality of drugs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5frv6b?context=5)|Good question. I have no issues with people experimenting with drugs. Hell, I've smoked weed, opium, salvia, and even done shrooms. I have no qualms with that. It becomes an issue with me when people abuse drugs. The most common example of abuse I experience is through my clients. They're on parole and KNOW they're going to get tested often. Why put yourself in that positition? That's just stupidity. Other examples of substance abuse include use leading to damaging relationships (family, friends, spouses), poor performance in school/work, and causing more harm to your health. When somebody uses and has one of those results, that's when they have a problem.
 |I also have a problem with certain drugs specifically. Some narcotics are incredibly dangerous. Take the Miami face-eater guy for example. When an individual uses and then proceeds to impose on another individual's freedom, that's when I have an issue. Those kinds of drugs SHOULD be illegal.  
[Umm.. the Miami face eater only tested positive for cannabis, the whole ""Bath Salts"" thing was made up by the police and reeks of Reefer Madness.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5fvns3?context=5)|Well if he can't handle his weed, he shouldn't be smoking.
[*Some narcotics are incredibly dangerous. Take the Miami face-eater guy for example.*  You think marijuana causes cannibalism? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5fsu1f?context=5)|A combo of marijuana and some serious mental health issues could.
[ a combination of parsley and a bullet could kill you. Let's regulate parsley!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5fykgc?context=5)|Regulate parsley bullets. 
[(I'll just make my bullets out of perfectly-legal HOPS! woo-hoo!\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5g177m?context=5)|Dude, you were just shot 3 times! Are you hurt?
[Do you have female clients? If you do, does a female colleague administer the drug test? With no dong to look at, how do you check for pee legitimacy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5fsce4?context=5)|Occasionally we'll get a female client and yes a female colleague will administer the test. They do have to... clam exam?
[Do you smoke marijuana yourself?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5fs4r1?context=5)|I did when I was in high school and shortly after. I stopped because I did not like how it started to make me feel. I began to think to much about past failures and alway thought people were judging me.
[If totally free access means you overdose and kill yourself, it's a Darwinian self-solving equation. Some people are just that way and their bad genes will go with them. It's all the petty crime to keep the dribs and drabs flowing, and the criminal empires built on that, that are eating at society.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5fxzif?context=5)|For me, I was relatively unsatisfied with my life. I was making a lot of stupid decisions and hurt a lot of people (friends and family). I also wasn't applying myself. I knew I had a lot of potential, but I was just lazy.
[So say i ate a poppy seed muffin then had a drug test. Does it actuallly fail people?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5frtub?context=5)|It usually takes more than 1 poppy seed. They did it on myth busters and it only took 2. However, the opiates from poppy seeds should exit your system in less then 48 hours. Opiate based drugs usually take 3-5 days.
 |Say a client did use that excuse, I'd instruct him to lay off the poppy seeds because that excuse won't work next time and then test them again 3-4 days later.
[Do you think forcing treatment on an addict that doesn't want help or hasn't ""hit bottom"" is any help? To me it seems like a waste of resources, and probably detrimental to others in treatment who are actually serious. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5frxvi?context=5)|I personally don't treat addicts, but yes, I do believe it's a waste of time. Most addicts will ""fake it to make it"" until they genuinely want to quit. Unfortuntely, that's usually when they hit rock bottom.
[Have you ever felt bad for one of the people who failed a drug test?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5fs4fe?context=5)|A few times. Mostly because they were guys who are doing well in the program and know better than that. Now that they tested positive, they've taken a step back. 
[Ever had false positives?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5fskwy?context=5)|I've only worked here for a year. So far, I've had 2 false positives. That's out of A LOT.
[What happens when someone fails a UA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5fs5nq?context=5)|Depends on their current progress. If they have been fucking around since they came in the program, their parole can get revoked and they will either be sent back to jail or to a halfway home.
 |If they have been making progress and there has not been a history of behavioral issues, they may get a slap on the wrist or get referred to a substance abuse education class.
[I have a couple of questions relating to drug testing.  How long does it take marijuana to get out of your system?  What's your personal stance on people who test positive for drug use? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5fsag5?context=5)|Depends on how much you smoke. Daily use for extended periods of time can take about 4 weeks to get out of your urine (longer if testing hair or fat). Occasional use to a couple times a week can take about 2 weeks. 
[What is the accuracy on drug tests?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5fsag5?context=5)|I honestly don't know the exact accuracy percentage. However, most of the time when a client tests positive, they eventually admit to using. 
[What's the worst drug test you've ever come across?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5fsag5?context=5)|The worst test was a client who tested postive for THC, PCP, and Cocaine.
[An idiot? Try ""legitimately addicted and not being able to stop"". But if you aren't addicted, yeah it's not very smart.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5fwst2?context=5)|Most of them test positive for weed which is not physically addictive. If they have legitimate addiction issues, they get referred to a more intensive program to address those issues.
[Why do you hate my cat? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5fs47k?context=5)|It threw up on my rug.
[Did it really tie the room together?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5fthpk?context=5)|No, it just left a wet, mushy spot on my rug for me to step in. And it stinks.
[What percent of positives are cannabis?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5fvl84?context=5)|I'd guess about 60%. PCP is a major issue right now so that may contribute to positives for weed being higher.
[Are you in Florida?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5fvl84?context=5)|Not in Florida.
[Do you think all government employees should be random screened?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5fvl84?context=5)|No unless drugs are negatively impacting their work or their job includes enforcing laws against drug distribution and use.

[*I'd guess about 60%. PCP is a major issue right now so that may contribute to positives for weed being higher.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5fwozp?context=5)|A lot of people have been using PCP. This has recently been an issue. Before it was an issue, THC tests were probably around 75%.
[Wtf? I don't see how those are related, can you elaborate? this is what I think of when PCP is mentioned.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5fwozp?context=5)|AND a lot of people smoke wet. That's PCP and THC combined.
[One time I took a drug test and it said I'd failed for meth and cocaine. I only smoke weed (which surprisingly didn't show up\), and take prescription vyvanse every day. Can you explain this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5fsbnx?context=5)|No I can not. However, for our guys, we normally know their drug of choice. If something like this occured, it would appear out of the ordinary and we would probably retest.
[Because proof?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5fskzh?context=5)|I messaged the mods.
[Do any of your female co-workers have any interesting snatch watching stories they've told you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5fsdsb?context=5)|I have not heard about any interesting stories... only about interesting smells. 
[I have beat drug tests a few times. But for getting a job, not parole/probation/social services.  I had about 2 hours between the job offer and the test. I just drank 'The Stuff' (there any many drinks you can buy to beat tests\) and have passed every time.  Just Marijuana, although a heavy smoker at the time. I have even beat tests just by drinking a lot of water (constantly, not just before the test but all the time to constantly flush my system-I am a heavy water drinker anyway\)  How long do the people have between getting asked to take the test and actually taking it? hours? minutes? If they come in weekly basis, it is feasable that they drink 'stuff' before each visit, right?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5ftlyv?context=5)|Their progress in the program determines how many times a week they visit. The more progress they make, the less they have to report. When we do drug test clients, they're not given any warning. They're told as soon as they sign in for the day and report straight to a waiting area where they're given a certain amount of juice to drink. When they're ready to go, we do the test. Any client can be selected for testing at any time if he or she is suspected of using. They would have to constantly be ready if they're using that much and a lot of these guys can't afford those drinks for every time they use or they just don't care enough. I'm sure a few have gotten by, but the odds aren't in their favor.
[How did you become a case worker? Did you work your way up at a facility, go to college, get certifications...? This has always been something that sort of interested me. Any help would be great. Thanks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5fsfi4?context=5)|A 4 year degree in Sociology and a little luck. I entered my job as a Case Worker. If you want to up your chances, study sociology, maybe volunteer somewhere and GET AN INTERNSHIP. Internships help a lot with finding work after college.
[Did you do an internship in college?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5fsz9b?context=5)|Yes I did internship. I was doing research for the a project that worked exonerating wrongfully convicted individuals.
[What should I search for on job sites to get into your line of work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5fsz9b?context=5)|You can search for non-profit and social work.
[What makes you excited about your job? (besides the pto\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5fsz9b?context=5)|I love helping people. And as much as a pain in the ass the clients can be, they make work interesting and sometimes entertaining.
[BS in psych and trying to figure out wtf I'm doing with my life. Also if you have any cover letter advice that'd be awesome :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5fsz9b?context=5)|Psych relevant to my field of work so you're on the right track. Unfortunately, no cover letter advice. I have not written one of those god-awful things in quite some time. 
[Does your occupation require that you be drug tested?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5fshro?context=5)|It did not, but I can be tested if I'm suspected of using.
[How often do people with kids fail drug tests vs childless?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5fsf9k?context=5)|They're about the same to my knowledge.
[Asked this in an e-mail, but to repeat: when they tell you not to flush the toilet and there is some blue liquid in there, does that liquid have any detection properties? (This would apply to unsupervised tests.\)  E.g., you've smoked pot all month, give synthetic urine as a sample, but then actually pee into the toilet, too. Will this give some indication, such that they retest you or use a different method, or supervise, etc? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5fxh9a?context=5)|For the tests I administer, there is no blue liquid. Sorry but I honestly don't know if there is a kind of liquid that can detect fake pee or not. We judge by color and temperature to determine if it's real. I also have to watch them actually take their dicks out and keep watching as they pee in a cup. It's real difficult to get something by when there is that much supervision.
[Lets say they tape it to there leg in a baby bottle would it still be warm and have you ever let anyone ever slide?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5fv5ep?context=5)|Probably not warm enough unless they're walking around and it's real hot out. Since I have to dong watch, I'd see the baby bottle.
[EDIT: spelling ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5fv5ep?context=5)|Also, I never let anyone slide. If I got caught, I'd be fired immediately. Just not worth it.
[Ever seen one of your friends ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5fveqt?context=5)|Nope. None of my friends have been locked up then released on parole.

But anyone with a chronic illness that is eligible for a weed prescription won't likely be referred to our program.
[Okay you wouldnt happen to be in ny lol.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5fvpyb?context=5)|Nope.
[So you've never had a client that had perscription for weed. I know plenty of people that have a script for mmj but don't have a ""real"" illness. wouldn't some of your more enterprising clients try to use this as an excuse? I know I would.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5fy0dm?context=5)|You can try, but you better provide medical documentation and a copy of the prescription.

Which position do you think is better if the pay is comparable?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5fs822?context=5)|You probably make more managing a group home.

[Is your job really that much about drugs? Somehow, almost all the questions are.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5fyv8d?context=5)|It actually isn't. I do drug test a lot of people which is what most people seemed interested. My job is mostly establishing treatment plans to address any issues, whether it be anger management, drug abuse, domestic violence, cognitive behavior, etc. they come in, i do an assessment, and then I refer them to group counseling, classes, more intensive care if necessary to address the risk areas that pop up during the assessment. Then, I moniter their progress. That the gist of my job.
[Basic Services/Support Staff here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5fsqrh?context=5)|We only test for certain drugs. The only drugs that can come up positive for any prescription a client may be taking are opiate based (pain killers). If that's the case, the client is required to provide us with a copy of his or her prescription.
[How do you handle clients with medications? I had to deal with one individual in the past who we were mostly sure was using off-premises, though couldn't effectively drug-test him because he was abusing the same type of drug he was prescribed.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5fsqrh?context=5)|For all other drugs we test for, there are no medications that will show up positive.
[Ah, so you have the same policy of 'Well I guess you can go wild with the stuff because we have no way of proving abuse from proper usage'?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5ftuhe?context=5)|I mean, we moniter their use while in the facility and note how much of their prescription there is. There isn't much we can do when they leave. It is also a state law that if you have a history of drug abuse for any drugs under the drug classification you are being prescribed (for example, a heroin user being prescribed any kind of pain killer), you have to inform your doctor. We will sometimes call their doctor to confirm that they did in fact inform their doctor. 
[So I've gotta ask, anyone tried the whiz master on you? For those that don't know, the whizzmaster is a synthetic penis device used to fool drug tests with clean piss stored in a bladder device similar to a miniature camel back, for your cock. A cock camelback, if you will.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5fsskt?context=5)|Not that I know of. Our tests come at random. Clients don't know they're getting tested until they enter the facility that day so unless they carry one of those at all times to be safe, I doubt they have used it.
[Do you ever fear for your life in the course of your work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5fs9hh?context=5)|Not really.

[What is cognitive self change groups in a jiffy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5fyhxm?context=5)|Social skills and problem solving skills. It's basically trying to teach them to think before they act and to get them to understand that they can only control their own actions.
[What kind of past stories?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/wrayq/iama_case_worker_parts_of_my_job_include_drug/c5fvyoa?context=5)|One client got shot outside our facility as a retaliation for some dumb shit his brother did.

Most of my clients are actually pretty good. For the ones that may want to extract revenge, by all means. The odds of them running to me in a place that isn't public is not likely. There'll most likely be a lot of potential witnesses. If they want to go back to jail for some kind of revenge, by all means. I've also been a wrestler and in the service so I can typically handle my own.

I'm a Youth, Young Adults, and Internship Director at a church in Frisco, Texas called Elevate Life Church. Anyone who wants to email me can do so joshc@elevatelife.com

i'm not selling anything, or proselytizing my viewpoint. I just want to talk to some other people about what life looks like inside this kind of culture, and answer any questions you might have. 

A couple things first,
I'm not too involved in the financial aspect of our church (partly by choice, partly because it is better that way) I know where our money goes, I don't know percentages, but I can tell you that we do an audit every year, and share it with the church. You can ask any questions you want about this, but I might not be able to answer because of my lack of knowledge. I have a budget, and have to get every purchase approved. Haha. 

I've been a PK for 12 years, before that, my dad travelled a lot as an evangelist, and spoke a lot, so I grew up on the road. And I've seen a lot of church cultures. 

I have a degree in Film/Graphic Design, and a minor in Psychology
I am paid a relatively modest salary commensurate with my education/experience (nowhere near 6 figures)
I'm 6'5"" 230lbs. haha. 

I was going to post on r/iama but based on the suggestion of redditors, and others, haha, I feel like r/Christianity would probably work out better in terms of healthy debate, and the specific nature or this AMA. 

This AMA will consist of my opinion, not the opinion of Elevate Life Cburch

We make little boxes that suck up your data and spit it up into the cloud.

We need people to help us with both the little boxes and the cloud.

**Little boxes:**

You'll be hacking on an Ubuntu-based appliance which has the job of accepting data via Samba shares and pulling it in from machines running our agent software, stashing it, snapshotting it, virtualizing imaged machines, and syncing everything offsite. There is high demand for rich new features, speed optimization, better UI design, you name it. We work a lot with Bootstrap and jQuery.

On the back-end you'll be dealing with Ubuntu, Debian package repositories, ZFS, VirtualBox, Samba, OpenSSH, rsync and lots of other great open source projects.

Some of the cool things that the device team does:

* ""Hardware independent restore"": We figured out how to take almost any Windows image and make it boot anywhere. Using Linux to hack Windows installs is a big deal here.
* Spin up a VM from any amount of time ago, in under 30 seconds
* ""Bare metal restore"": set up a PXE boot OS that lets you re-image a machine from a backup

***Requirements:***

* Excellent communication skills.
* At least a little bit of Linux knowledge. The more the better.
* No knowledge of specific technologies like ZFS or VBox is required but if you're familiar with them it's a **BIG** plus.
* PHP and shell scripting knowledge are both required. Helps if you know OOP.

**Cloud ops:**

We operate over 500 servers with over 10PiB of storage in several datacenters, and we need some help designing better ways to manage and monitor them. Cloud ops typically is a mix of longer-term projects and putting out fires. Some of the things we want to work on are full use of IPMI across all datacenters, better server-to-server communication (for better resilience during offsite virtualization scenarios), improved monitoring tools, cleanup of old facilities, IT/office network optimizations, and more.

Some of the cool things that the cloud team does:

* Keep 500 servers synced, alive and happy
* Work with customers to recreate a destroyed site entirely in the cloud
* Make occasional trips to datacenters to install/swap hardware
* Keep our gigabit office Internet connection happy (we receive seed drives here, and need fast tubes to get their contents to the datacenters)

***Requirements:***

* Excellent communication skills.
* Moderate to advanced Linux knowledge.
* At least some grasp of designing things that scale
* Some familiarity with PHP
* Strong acquaintance with shell scripting

**General:**

* Location: 101 Merritt 7, Norwalk, CT
* We're looking primarily for co-ops, but full-timers are welcome to apply
* Our biggest need is for fall and winter interns
* All the start-up perks:
 * Two soda fountain machines
 * Awesome company outings, like seeing The Dark Knight Rises in IMAX on premiere night
 * Fairly loose management structure, ability to choose your own direction with projects
 * Low bullshit factor
* Very competitive pay + opportunity for housing assistance

**Tips for getting hired:**

* Show us your personal projects that you cut your teeth on. Pretty much every dev here was hired because they had a kick-ass project they worked on for the hell of it, not because a professor assigned it to them. Startups have a huge need for initiative and enthusiasm.
* Let us know when you're available, and whether you're a co-oper or full time
* Show networking knowledge
* Show good communication skills. I can't emphasize this enough.

**How to apply:**

E-mail your résumé and a cover letter to the head of development, Greg Gage: ggage@dattobackup.com

Thanks!"

I'll still end up smoking it eventually and it looks like a pretty solid cigar (triple cap but probably made with short filler and stems). I was wondering if anyone knowingly enjoys smoking fake Cubans."

Please help Reddit.,JBoone,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ww4ph/i_am_burned_out_and_completely_disheartened_at_my/,"To start:
I am 20, living in LA going to community college and feeling completely burned out on the way things are going. I have ambitions to become an engineer but keep running up against obstacles. I've already spent a lot of time fucking up my life in highschool with drugs and alcohol Enough to warrant being sent to a wilderness treatment program and 9 months of in-patient rehab after that. My life is back on track but it doesn't feel like it. I have a tendency to go all in. I have (against advice) stacked my last few semesters full of hard classes, swim team, and lifeguarding. The reason I did this is because I used to be able to handle all of that! I feel like I fried my brain and it can't quite handle the study skills, motivation, time management etc. that it used to.

All of this adds up to an overworked, underslept (and I have fucking obstructive sleep apnea, fuckk), frustrated and demotivated kid who just wants a break. I thought by now I would be back on track with the people from my highschool class but it.seems I keep falling further and further behind. I am so incredibly disheartened at my inability to manage my life. I feel like a lazy stoner student except this time I'm not even high! Is it crazy to want change? I want to do something DIFFERENT reddit! I'm a big dreamer so taking time off to do nothing isn't an option for me. I would love to do something with my life that doesn't involve sitting in a classroom failing Calc 2 for the third time. I desperately need a change of scenery.

I am here to ask you for ideas! Where should I go? What should I do? where did YOU go? I need motivational stories, fun ideas, internship ideas, jobs, volunteering opportunities, backpacking trips. just tell me I'm not a quitter for not being able to fit into this mold right now. anything would help. 

thanks.

Ps. I value my education greatly and have no intention of being a drop out. I just need to redirect my attention to something I don't.suck at for a little while."

I was an intern at Valve a little while ago. It's the best place to work even if I didn't get paid. I've followed my dad's footsteps in the gaming industry and he eventually got my foot in the door.

I was fresh out of college and still green to the world. This would eventually get me in trouble at Valve. So college was a blast and pretty easy for me since I've been studying game design and have been an active gamer for pretty much my whole life. 

So I happened to be on /r/gaming when I get a beep that says I got a new e-mail. I got called in for a 1 on 1 with my boss. Ugh..

I guess I was in trouble for browsing the internet too much (we're allowed to take intermittent breaks during the day so we can ""freshen up our minds"") So I hesitantly walk over to the office and knock on the door. Lo and behold Gabe is sitting in the chair. Now I see him every once and a while around the building but it's only a little hi and bye so this was scary and exciting.

He sits me down and the first thing he says to me as he turns the monitor around, ""So is this what the internet thinks of me?""

Apparently they saw some Gabe meme from monitoring my net usage. My voice cracked and I whispered, ""um, I guess..""

Gabe bursts out laughing so hard and I let out biggest sigh of relief. Well then he told me to keep on the project we were working on and try not to ""take breaks"" as often.

So now every once and a while I get an email from him with some meme about him and it kind of became our inside joke. I'm pretty sure he's a Redditor now since he would always send me stuff that I just saw earlier that day.  And I thought I only had to deal with this on FB.

By the way, Gabe gets the 3 jokes. 3/3/13"

People from companies always tell us: grades don't really matter and all of us had the same education, so it's up to something else that differentiates people.

So far I count this into my portfolio:

 - english courses

 - swedish courses

 - training seminar for a calculation software for the construction industry

 - training seminar for a project planning software

 - 3 years of work experience at the waterways construction institute

 - opening a small company in IT business, not really related, but mjeh, an accomplishment.. shows initiative



Planned on in near future:

 - internships, maybe Nigeria, building an anti-corruption center

 - rhetorical training

 - learning AutoCAD or so

Can you guys help me come up with some other elements about the positions I should consider in my decision-making process. 

Job 1: Organization is a large national non-profit, Fundraising position.  I would need to take a 15 minute bus ride every day (not a huge deal). Not related as much to my major (they do community based charity work), but the work they do is very honorable and I would be happy working for them. 

Job 2: Small nonprofit historical foundation where I live. Walking distance from my apartment. Also a fundraising position. I feel a closer connection to what I studied and want to work in (museum work). Also they are located in a huge awesome historical building. 

any advice/ideas?

I met a girl, 21, at a party and went home with her (we actually met about a month before, but she recognized me at the party and we started talking). We hook up a few times during the semester, but she makes it clear that she's only had sex with guys she'd been in a relationship with. Seeing that we both had a strong connection, I eventually sack up and ask her on a date. The date goes better than I could have hoped for.

I keep up contact with her, but it was roughly 7 weeks after our first date - already into summer break now - that we had our second. Life just seemed to get in the way with her internship and other things. The second date goes great, and I could tell she wanted to see me again. I keep texting her and getting warm responses, but same thing happens and a month passes before our third date, which was last night.

When I texted her, she seemed cold at first but eventually opened up and agreed to see me. I had her over for dinner, and I was a little nervous at first (as usual) but everything seemed to work out fine. I tried really hard to set everything up nicely, and I may have actually overdone things in her eyes. She works every day and I could tell she was getting tired, but at the same time not wanting to leave. We start making out on the couch close to midnight, but she stops me from moving things further.

She said ""you don't want to do that."" I obviously did, but then she said that she hasn't done this in awhile. I stop and we sat together on the couch for awhile, until I eventually decide it's late. I get up and lead her to the door and we hug and share one last kiss before she leaves. Still, I was left with the sinking feeling that things are over and that we're not going and further than this third date.

**Some possibly important things**
* Part of why she was so attracted to me early on is because I'm a year younger than her, and she thought my ""innocence"" was adorable. She would also call me out jokingly to stop being so nervous.
* She told me last night that I need to be more self-confident (this was before I kissed her).
* I asked her if she wanted to leave after she stopped me. I probably shouldn't have worded it so strongly, but she said she wouldn't be there if she didn't want to be. Still, her body language told me she was either uncomfortable, or that she lost the attraction she had for me a few months earlier.
* She also said I tried too hard, and that I shouldn't have because she's easily impressed. Basically, I went a little overboard with preparing dinner and everything. She said that my hard work didn't go unnoticed though, and that she appreciated it.
* I asked her if she wanted to see me again. The last few moments of last night are a little blurred, but she made some joke about playing hard to get and didn't really give me an answer.

**TL;DR**
* Met a girl, we hooked up, we liked each other, I eventually asked her out.
* Things progress slowly over the course of several months. On the third date she didn't want to move things further, and I think she may have lost attraction for me.
* Is it over, or is there a glimmer of hope? If you didn't read the entire post, at least look over the important things I listed to get a better insight. Thanks for any advice and input.

I Don't Want to Burn Bridges,[deleted],internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/wvstp/should_i_quit_i_dont_want_to_burn_bridges/,"I am working in an ***unpaid, unsupervised and undirected*** design internship for a *startup*.  My bosses are one businesswoman and one product designer but they are really big in my city and have a lot of connections in the graphic and web design industry and this is part of why I wanted to intern for them.  (Also I applied to 15 paid internships and had no success.)

Unfortunately, they don't have experience hosting interns, as this is their first company, and it's only been around for a year.  They have me producing web mockups in Adobe Fireworks for their site, which is something I am good at.  But the problem is that I am not producing anything that will actually be built, because they don't have a developer yet and they don't expect to get contact from their hopeful developer for three weeks.

Due to me not getting paid, not seeing my bosses all day (I've worked 20 hours so far over three days and had a total of 15 minutes of actual interaction with my bosses) and not learning anything I want to quit...I also don't expect this to get better even if I ask them for more learning experiences, because their other intern spends all day on Facebook and Pintrest.  I really want to learn more about design, but I don't think they are up to the task to provide that for me.  *Another unfortunate thing is they are big about publicity and have been telling a lot of people that I am working for them as an intern, so it's hard to ask what follows.*

Should I quit? I feel like now that I've started the internship it is unfortunate to quit immediately because they'll bad-mouth me.  On the other hand I feel like this is exactly the opposite of an opportunity, and just a waste.

wvrvf,2,2012-07-20,Would like some input,[deleted],needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/wvrvf/would_like_some_input/,"I don't have anyone in the meatspace to go to/talk to about this sort of stuff (or, more accurately, that I'd *want* to talk about this to), so I figured this is the next best thing. I'm probably going to have trouble typing out how my thoughts/feelings actually are, but I'll try to the best I can. This type of emotional stuff I have better time explaining when I 'shut my brain off' and just let my mouth flow, but again, there's no one I want to hear it. I tend to just talk out stuff like this myself to release it so I can stop worrying for a while.

I am (almost) twenty years old, and I and I'm looking for any input/suggestions/ideas/help/general chat about what I should do somewhat education/career-wise. 

To put a long story short, I had issues with school and completely stopped going when I was fifteen. I got my GED at seventeen, and instead of going to college that fall, I took an internship, with somewhat of an intention of taking classes the next summer. That never happened.

My family constantly harasses and pesters me about school. It makes me feel so overwhelmed that I want to cry. Whenever someone talks about it I either get angry or to the point of tears. The problem is I don't *want* to go. Not very much, anyway. I like learning, I had been in many advanced classes/groups over the years, but I don't think I will do well in typical classroom setups, particularly since I haven't been in one for a while. There's also the issue of actually getting to the school every day there's classes (which don't offer *anything* that I'm interested in) which no one seems to recognize while they're harassing me.

It makes me want to hide away from the world, live in the forest. It makes me wish I'd somehow fall possession to a some millions of dollars so I can avoid all this, do things/work I like and learn new things in ways that are not teacher-students. I don't like the feelings I get when the topic of schooling comes up. Also, online classes offer even worse options than physical classes, so that turns me off.


 I don't just bare my soul out to people, I don't like people knowing stuff. I'm having a hard time trying to type this up, and I'll probably come to my senses and end up deleting it an hour after I post, but I don't know. Maybe someone will say something that clicks and this will be worth it.

There are lots of things I'm interested in or kinda like. There are lots of things I can do with those interests, but the issue is, I don't know what to do with that. Well I do, but I don't know if it's what I **want** to do. I tend to get bored of things quickly, and I fear (almost legitimately fear) that while I'm on my way of doing something with that interest, I'll become less and less enthusiastic about it and eventually just quit. This is another big reason why I'm stalled where I am.

So, I guess here's what I'm trying to get at. I'm stuck. I'm stalled. I'm scared. I'm overwhelmed. I don't know what to do. I worry a lot. I don't know what people could say that I already don't know, but I'm still going to post. Maybe it'll help me get over this skyscraper-high speed bump/wall/sleeping bovine in the road. I can post of list of some things I like if people want, like in case they can offer more specific/tailored advice or something.

My account is a throwaway.)

I've been dating my boyfriend for about a year and two months.  He is 21 (his birthday is this weekend, actually) and I am 22, also male.  We have broken up once before for six months. We have always been a fairly problem-filled couple.

We were doing fine for a really long time, but it all came to head when we decided to move in together.  I told him I wasn't sure if I was ready, but he was belligerent and said that it would be fine so I trusted him and we went through with it.  Now we live together and it is pretty awful.  We fight practically everyday.  I really feel like he is just always angry with me for something all the time.  

We went to the store the other day and he said he was in a bad mood, so I tried to help by giving him suggestions of what food to get (we were looking for a quick meal) and he said no, rudely, to all of my suggestions.  He then snapped at me and said I wasn't helping.  A majority of our fights are stupid things like that.  God forbid I have a problem with him though, and then he just gets really pissed at me and is in a sour mood for a really long time.  He blames me for absolutely everything, I feel like he accepts no blame.

He says he can’t trust me, but I’ve never done anything to warrant this.  I have always been a trustworthy boyfriend and been there for him in many situations.  This was an instant red flag for me.

He requires that I check in when going out, and I basically have to check my schedule with him whenever I go out.  I'm going to Batman tonight with some of my friends and I told him I might hang out with them for a while after, and he told me ""That would have been nice to know more than a day before now.""  We didn't have plans.  I understand not just disappearing for hours, but I didn't see the harm in what I said.  It’s like that with everything.  He gets mad when I stay out passed two, and bothers me constantly asking me where I am.

And then now: He wants me to commit to him.  Like, wedding ring commit to him.  I absolutely don't want to because I feel I am way too young and I still have a lot of exploring I want to do before I settle down.  He, of course, gets really mad at me for this and asks why I need time.  I try to explain I'm just not ready but he doesn't understand, he just gets upset.  

I've been feeling like breaking up for a while.  It’s just so stressful.  My life is already completely jam-packed (I'm a supervisor at work, I have an internship, trying to get a student group off the ground, and write in my spare time which I'm trying to get better at) and this is stress I just don't need.  I don't think understands that I'm having a hard time with this.  I try to explain, but it doesn't seem to work.  

I'm afraid to talk to him about all of this because if I tell him I'm thinking about a break he's just going to get so upset and probably start crying...which, sadly, is something I don't want to cause.  As much as we are having problems, it was really great before.  I still do love him, and I’m not sure if we can recover from this.

And the last part:

I have an enormous crush on a guy at work.  I don't know or not if he is straight/gay/bi or whatever, but he's just so funny and cute.  I feel like I’m basically cheating on my partner with the feelings and everything.  I haven't done anything to make an advance for the guy at work.  From personal experience, when I start developing a crush on someone it is usually because my boyfriend and I are fighting or I am starting to feel disconnected from him.

I just don't know what to do.  I still love my boyfriend, but I'm getting physically sick from all the stress.  I'm almost always tired, sore, tense, or sick to my stomach because of it all.  I don't want to hurt him, ever.  Unfortunately, I feel this is the way it is heading.

Maybe I should try telling him about my feelings?

**tl;dr** --- I'm in a long-term relationship that isn't going very well anymore, its stressing me out more now than anything.  I find my attention wandering to other potential dates.  When is the best time to call it quits?

Every one of the interviewee's  are working on or currently possess a Network+ certification or degree in networking and cannot even describe the difference between a symmetrical and an asymmetrical internet service and why one would be better than the other.

God forbid that we ask them to describe Domain Name Service as it applies to a non-Microsoft based operating system.

In my opinion, the colleges are not teaching these folks anything that will help them in their careers except if they plan on working in very specific fields (Windows, Cisco...) and even then they have no practical knowledge of any related area's or how to apply the little knowledge they do get to anything beyond a lab project.

We have an intern project that we'll be presenting at the end of summer and alread you can see people trying to hog all the work and pretty much preventing other interns from being able to contribute. For the presenters, you can tell they want to be the ones presenting the project and they want to be the ones to hog all the glory, and so when they're thinking of ways to ""fairly"" choose who will get to present its obvious theyre trying to skew it in ways for their favor.

Whenever you talk with them (or at least I talk wtih them) theyre very abrasive and have a very ""i'm better than you"" and opposing attitude, even if you're agreeing with them... thing is, its not just ilke 1 person but theres this small group that kind of runs together.

And the thing is theyre all girls. I'm one of the 2 guy interns here at this agency, and i'm really starting to think that if this were a group of guys it'd just be a lot more chill and accomodating.

Here's my start:

[Appropedia](http://www.appropedia.org/):  I consider this website a mixed bag, but the best there is.  I was recently really helped by an article on [gravity feed drip irrigation](http://www.appropedia.org/CCAT_gravity_fed_drip_irrigation), because it was chock full of 'lesson learned' type material that I was near to doing myself.  I consider the article on [Chickens](http://www.appropedia.org/Chickens) to be a mixed bag, though I don't have a superior resource.  I certainly haven't written that much about my chickens, so take my complaint with a grain of salt.

I've started using [Plants for a Future](http://www.pfaf.org/ Plants for a Future) after an intern of mine planted [Elaeagnus x ebbingei](http://www.pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Elaeagnus+x+ebbingei) and I wanted to know more about it.  I'm less impressed with the page on [Azolla](http://www.pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Azolla+filiculoides), which is squeezed a bit uncomfortably into the site's template.

I'd love to use [BugGuide](http://bugguide.net/) more, but for some reason I don't.  There's just something about it I'm missing.

Finally, I've been influenced by [CommunityWiki](http://www.communitywiki.org/), an offshoot of [Meatball Wiki](http://meatballwiki.org/).  They are both essentially archived at this point, but material here sent my work in a direction it would not have otherwise gone, by helping build a taxonomy of (human) communities.

How about you?

If you could, rather than just dropping a link to a site, please describe your relationship to it.  What you like about it, what you don't, your experience of using it, the story of finding it.  Fill in some degree of context, links are cheap."

Here are some highlights:

* **Over $1.3 million to the National Republican Senatorial Committee**
* **Over $1 million to Progress for America, a right-wing 527 that contributed $38 million to the reelection of Bush in 2004**
* **Over $250,000 to Citizens Club For Growth, which is devoted to deregulating business and promoting Reagan-era right-wing economic orthodoxy**
* **$100,000 on a plate at a general Republican Congressional fundraising dinner, because fuck it**
* Despite spending millions on Republican candidates (including several thousand to **Rick Santorum**), Singer is pro-gay because his son is gay and married to his partner in Massachusetts.  To that end, Singer contributed $16,800 to the campaign of Mark Grisanti, the pro-business anti-raising-minimum-wage Republican State Senator swing vote who helped pass the marriage equality act in New York…and then another $16,800 in the name of his gay son, and then another $16,800 in the name of his son’s partner, and then another $16,800 in the name of his other son who lives in London.  Yeah.

And these are just the personal contributions made by Singer in his own name.

And the scary thing is that Paul Singer isn’t even a metaphorical big fish when it comes to this kind of thing.  His net worth comes out to “only” $900 million dollars.  Each of the Koch brothers could buy and sell this guy 10 times if they wanted to.

This—corporate money in politics—is what’s wrong with our democracy.

wvbtw,8,2012-07-20,Personal victory leading to awesome chocolate orientation-internship.,Zylll,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/wvbtw/personal_victory_leading_to_awesome_chocolate/,"Heyy guys, 

A while back I've posted in a win-wednesday (or whatever it was) that I threw my application for school in the mail. After some long weeks of waiting around I finally got an intake for becoming a pastry baker. 

I'm at the intake with the same person who gave me some info at the information evening some weeks back, but apperantly she somewhat changed her mind. While she said I knew what I was getting into and had a realistic view of my jobchances and what not, she decided that now I don't. 

I felt they focused very much on the stuff I ""can't"". I'm a bit older (25 in august), while most first years for this degree (somewhat of an associate degree) are around 16. I know it's quite the age-diffrence, but I already have another degree, even a bit higher, but I want to do something that I wouldn't choose because I ""had too"", but because I want to. 

Besides the age, which could cause some problems in terms of working experience when I'm eventually looking for a job, they focused very much on my ADD. My ADD expresses itself in me being easily tired. I sleep around 10-12 hours a day and I can't maintain a fulltime (five days a week) schedule. 

Seeing as I've already gotten a degree at the same level and doing a lot of the theory at home, I didn't think this would be much of a problem. I've managed before, I'll do it again. They weren't so convinced and it all ended in a negative review. That means I'm not ""allowed"" to start (YET). In theory a school here is required to just hire any possible student who wishes to join and has the level to start (a.k.a. you need to have a highschooldiploma). 

They told me I should do an orientation internship, but even then they saw small chances. A negative review automaticly leads to a conversation with someone of the ""succes centre"" to perhaps give you other options that might be more suitable. They came up with the most insane ""solutions"" that didn't suit me at all. 

So stubborn, old, ADD impared me (or how I felt they viewed me) planned to walk in some bakeries this morning to ask for a possible orientation internship. The first one also was the last one. For the next three weeks, I'm going to do two days a week at an awesome chocolate/bonbon/icecream store that also makes weddingcakes on order. I'm SOO much looking forward to it and even though it might not be huge, I'm very excited and it feels like a personal victory. 

After I've completed the orientation, I can just re-apply again, have another intake and the whole thing starts again, but I do feel I'll be more confident with the orientation behind me. I'm really looking forward to making the most amazing stuff and I just had to share my good news of the day. I truely feel I'm on a roll again :)

Thanks so much for reading (if you still are, haha)! And please, feel free to share your moment of personal victory. I love reading feel good stories :D"

I am not trying to brag or boast, just motivate or help.

Anyway, if you think it might be a good idea then let me know, or if you want to ask anything then ask away.

EDIT:
As some are asking for the story before questions or whatever: I went to uni for Industrial Product Design. Graduated last June and like a lot of people I had no job lined up. 

Mid way through my 2nd year of a 4 year course I realised that graphics was where my passion lay, not product design as it was too much engineering for my tastes and not enough on the aesthetics where in my opinion my skills were.

When I graduated I had done an internship as a marketing + design assistant at an education company in Coventry which taught me more about business, working environments, attitude and organisation than I would have ever learnt in my degree. 

I graduated and sat down and thought, right I can't find any full time positions that don't require vast experience that I just didn't have. I was freelancing during my final year but not enough and it wasn't giving me enough experience to get the junior positions that I saw advertised. 

I declared my self self-employed to the HMRC and set out on my own. Garnering the contacts I had from friends, lecturers, business people I had met I whored myself out for cheaper than local freelancers. This led to a steady influx in work and allowed me to keep freelancing for 6 months where my portfolio got off the ground to a better standard and more importantly it was paying the bills. I will never understate the power of contacts, I could only do it because I asked everyone I knew if they had any work needing doing, I spoke to people I hadn't seen in years, some balked at the idea, some wanted free work, some hired me on a fair hourly rate. I never did free work and I never did spec work. I realised early that to be respected I had to charge, and I had to charge a fair amount otherwise the relationship between myself and client wouldn't work. I still freelance now. 

One of the clients, a company that was 18 months old at the time but with large turnover for it's age, wanted me to do more and more work. I knew them through a friend, but I never treated it as a favour to me or as a friend. I treated it as a large company who would get rid of me at the first chance if I didn't perform. After a full redesign of their site, and an ecommerce system set up for them they were more than pleased. NB: I had never ever done a project on that scale and that was the first ecommerce system I had setup. I think the key here was honesty, I told them from the off that I hadn't done an ecommerce site before but I knew that I could, even if under the surface I was panicking and wildly stressed and worried about whether I could do it. They understood this and liked my drive. I mention this because if you are applying for a job that you are fully comfortable with and won't challenge you then you ought to be aiming higher in my opinion.

In February 2012 they sat me down and wanted to offer me a full time salaried position. I replied with that's great I'd absolutely love to help you develop your company further, but I don't want to work 5 days a week as I freelance and want a balance between the two. We settled on 4 days a week. They offered me a fairly crappy salary. I told them what I wanted to earn, they said they couldn't do it, after two weeks of negotiating we met just below what I wanted as I stood my ground and made it clear that I wasn't going to take what they wanted to pay me for as I believed my role deserved more. 

Fast forward a bit, I was working with them for a couple of months as a designer but not what I am now. There were a couple of other people of similar ages to myself who were doing other work across the marketing and design spectrum. We all worked together and it was good. With everything the company did from that point of view I tried to explain from my perspective whether things could be done better, as I'm young, somethings I suggested were wrong, the director explained why, some things he loved and we instantly started doing. Marketing drives, sticker mobbing, tightening up our brand style, etc. 

After a short while this was noticed and I got more responsibility, a higher paycheck and a promotion to managing the other designers. It didn't happen over night, there was a lot of work and I barely did anything else for that time apart from work for them during the week and freelance at night but it paid off and I'm now a marketing and digital design exec at a growing sports brand that have high projections for their future. Whether it will happen or whether I will get frustrated in-house and go out on my own freelancing again I do not know but there are places out there that want young people and driven people. You just have to get in front of the right people and impress them.

The four things that I think helped me from starting out to now over a year down the line of graduating is that I read all the design books I could find, I did a lot of personal side projects and I had the guts to suggest improvements (backed up my reasoning) and had the guts to say I'd do something even if I didn't know how to and I networked my god damn ass off to get the clients in the first place which led to being brought in on a salary. Also don't let your degree pigeon hole you, go with the flow of what you find and apply for things in a similar field, not just strictly what your qualified in.

That's my story, sorry if it was a bit summarised (yes I know there's a lot of text) but I didn't want to write the whole time span out. And I apologise if I sound full of myself, I don't mean to be, there wasn't really a way of writing that without sounding a little bit arrogant."

So, IT seemed like the natural choice for me. But I'm having second thoughts. Is it really still a good career to get into? I'm already about 1/3 of the way towards my B.S. in IT, and I also will be getting an internship at a computer company as tech support/help desk kind of situation.

Okay here's the deal:

I'm from California, but I am currently spending two months in Shanghai for an internship program. For this, I applied for an F type Visa, allowing me to stay here for 60 days. It is near the end of my program and I was interested in going to Hong Kong for a few days before I left. The plan is this: Go to Hong kong July 30-Aug 2, come back to Shanghai for 1.5 days, then leave for America on Aug 3 at night.

However, due to the nature of my visa, which was only single-entry, I needed to go to the security bureau (or whatever it is) and apply for a multiple entry visa. I went, filled out forms to the best of my capability, and handed my passport and necessary forms in. Barely looking at it, the security guard put it in an envelope and handed me a receipt telling me, in Mandarin, to come pick up my passport next Friday. I looked at the receipt and it says this (other than passport #, name, date of birth, etc.):

Application Type: 旅游签证 Entry(s): 一(1)次有效

Now I'm freaking out because from what I understand, they only gave me a single entry visa on top of another single entry visa, but I hear you have to get a MULTIPLE entry visa. Is it safe that I go to Hong Kong under this visa, or will I be unable to return to Shanghai afterwards?...

Is there anyone who's been in a similar situation that can help shed some light on this?

Thanks."
wv1nd,1,2012-07-20,Should I quit?  I Don't Want to Burn Bridges,[deleted],internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/wv1nd/should_i_quit_i_dont_want_to_burn_bridges/,"I am working in an ***unpaid, unsupervised and undirected*** design internship for a *startup*.  My bosses are one businesswoman and one product designer but they are really big in my city and have a lot of connections in the graphic and web design industry and this is part of why I wanted to intern for them.  (Also I applied to 15 paid internships and had no success.)

Unfortunately, they don't have experience hosting interns, as this is their first company, and it's only been around for a year.  They have me producing web mockups in Adobe Fireworks for their site, which is something I am good at.  But the problem is that I am not producing anything that will actually be built, because they don't have a developer yet and they don't expect to get contact from their hopeful developer for three weeks.

Due to me not getting paid, not seeing my bosses all day (I've worked 20 hours so far over three days and had a total of 15 minutes of actual interaction with my bosses) and not learning anything I want to quit...I also don't expect this to get better even if I ask them for more learning experiences, because their other intern spends all day on Facebook and Pintrest.  I really want to learn more about design, but I don't think they are up to the task to provide that for me.  *Another unfortunate thing is they are big about publicity and have been telling a lot of people that I am working for them as an intern, so it's hard to ask what follows.*

Should I quit? I feel like now that I've started the internship it is unfortunate to quit immediately because they'll bad-mouth me.  On the other hand I feel like this is exactly the opposite of an opportunity, and just a waste. (And I don't want to litigate them not paying me even though it's against the law for them to derive benefit from unpaid interns etc.) ***How do I get out of this pointless labor without losing credibility in my local industry?***

**TL;DR** I started an unpaid internship at a place where my bosses have lots of connections.  The internship isn't anything like what I expected so I want to quit without burning bridges.  How can I do that?"

The printer next to my desk broke down, so a tech guy came and literally dismantled the entire thing, all the screws, and then rebuilt it. It took like two hours. So many creaks and small sounds and scratching. 

Also, and this may sound weird, but he was slightly overweight so there was slightly audible breathing too. For some reason hearing someone slowly/heavily breathe while putting a lot of attention something is super relaxing for me."
wuzxi,15,2012-07-20,Davis from the Institution ,randomfiction,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/wuzxi/davis_from_the_institution/,"A friend of mine had to intern at an asylum to qualify for her CNA degree, she told me a few creepy stories, one of which sticks out.



There was this patient named Davis, she couldn't say whether that was his first or last name, as that was the only name she ever saw on his charts.  His incident record was all but blank, save for a note from the admitting physician that Davis was extremely dangerous.  She said he was always quiet and well behaved, but that his eyes had some sort of vacant look in them, likely due to the drugs he was on.


Davis had the highest prescription dose of haldol of anyone in the facility, as well as a heavy tranquilizer regiment at night.  The nurses in the medication line always took special care to ensure he always swallowed his pills, as he tried to hide them in the past.


During a particularly bad flu season, several members of the nursing staff were out sick, including a lot of the senior staff.  They managed to get some extra help during the days but the night shift was left understaffed for a few days.  

My friend was working the night shift when another patient noticed that Davis hadn't been seen in awhile.  She went to his room and found it empty, save a small pile of pills in the middle of his unmade bed.


She called up to the nursing desk and requested an orderly or two to help find Davis and forcibly medicate him if needed.  They sent two orderlies, one huge black guy who apparently looked like a parolee and a tall husky white guy who was in some sort of motorcycle club.
She said she felt more than safe with the two huge guys, so they went room to room, searching for Davis.  


After checking each room in the ward, then made their way to the end of the hall near the bathrooms and heard a noise.  She said it was splashing, following by furious sounds of eating.  Like a hungry dog eating wet food, wolfing it down.  They found Davis.

He was on his knees in front of a toilet deliriously eating the contents inside.  Either one of the other patients or Davis himself, had shit in the toilet and he was eating it.  Grossed out the white orderly grabbed Davis by the waistband of his pants and pulled him away.  Davis responded with a inhuman roar, and with one hand pushed the orderly hard into the bathroom wall.  Hard enough to break some of the tiles on the wall and knock the wind out of the guy.  

The black orderly straight up ran at the guy to tackle him, but Davis batted him down like he was nothing.  The dude just slumped to the ground, out cold.


My friend was screaming at this point and tried to run to the nurses station but Davis was on her too quick.  He grabbed her by the throat and pinned her against the door.

Then he became still, relaxed almost, yet his grip on her neck was firm.  He began to sing, so soft and gently, from a mouth covered in shit.  He sang her a Celine Dion song, the one from Titanic.  


Near the end of the song people started banging on the door, other nurses and concerned patients, brought by her scream.  He started laughing through the end of the song, as if the pounding on the door was bringing him a lot of joy.  He then leaned in close to her ear, and frantically whispered something to her as the door was forced open.


In the end it took 5 men to subdue Davis.  A mishmash of patients and staff.  It took 3 times the normal dosage of their strongest tranquilizer, injected into his shoulder muscles, to finally drop him.


She quit that night and enrolled in a dental assistant program offered by one of those for profit schools, and is now a happily employed dental assistant.


I asked her what Davis whispered to her.  She never told me.

wuvr1,6,2012-07-20,My girlfriend of 3 years has cheated on me twice in the span of the 2 months when she moved in with me. Please tell me this shit gets better.,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/wuvr1/my_girlfriend_of_3_years_has_cheated_on_me_twice/,"So a little back story. I met her while I was living in Florida 3 years ago, We instantly hit it off. According to her it was love at first sight. And it really was great, after about a year of us being together and happy and awesome, she moved to Chicago and I moved to Washington state (because of parents) this caused a little rift. But we did the long distance thing and it worked. We flew any little chance we could to see each other. Skype every night you know the works. 

During that year, I was 19 and started working. I worked 2 jobs, Macy's and Panera. So I would open Macy's 5 days a week and closed at panera  5 days a week. I still barely made friends because I was focused on moving to Chicago, and starting school in Chicago.

And I did it, exactly 1 year later (btw still together) I moved to Chicago leased an apartment July 1st and started possibly the coolest experience ever. My girlfriend was close to me, I worked at Panera (ended up eventually quitting that and working at an Apple Store, best job yet) 

Although she was close to me, she still lived out in the suburbs which took a 1 hour long train ride but fuck it was great. After a while she finally had enough money and had finished school so she could move in with me. In retrospect: what the fuck am I doing why did I do this. 

I have a little studio but the space has not been an issue, the issue's started with her job search. She was feeling down and Looking for a job, as you can guess it took her a good long 2 months to finally land something. During this time I was stretching myself financially to feed us and still pay for the apartment. Eventually she finally had 2 offers on the table, My Apple Store actually called her for an interview, as well as the Lego Store. I wanted her to work at apple, I new she would love it and it payed more as well. But because she knew it would take another month for the interview process with them she chose the Lego Store. I mean I can't control her so that was that. Now I was really happy because that means I was gonna have some money for myself finally. But little by little stuff started changing. She never payed for half of the apartment. she helped me with as little as she could because she knew I made more money. which although not that bad a problem, it took its toll on me. I was starting to become unhappy, I was wanting a break, some money for myself. At that time I started to have some feelings for one of the girls at work, She reminded me of My Girlfriend so much. But that went to nothing because I did not want to cheat on her, I felt like she may have had an interest but I killed it by playing dumb. 

I felt horrible for even having a crush on someone else. And decided to tell her, she was hurt and I understood why. But I did not do anything, I have always been the best boyfriend I could be, Treated her to the best I could do. But because of this we took a little ""break"" 3 days tops. On this break she ended up visiting and fucking someone at her work place. The asshole, as any good asshole would do, fucked her and dumped her easy as that. She thought he liked her, she thought it wouldn't be this way. But it happened. because of the circumstances. and because dammit I love this girl, I forgave her (Another huge mistake.) I mostly forgave her, because she felt horrible for it, she came crying to me that night when she got home and told me everything. But here is the kicker, she had sex with me before she told me anything.

So whatever that was that, I forgave her I felt she deserved it, I did not help the whole situation with my little crush. But as time progressed, she still had a crush on this asshole, she told me so, she hated it but she wanted him. But he was done with her, the last time they saw each other was when she STAYED OVER HIS HOUSE about 2 weeks later. She tells me that she did not do anything but I don't know if I believe that anymore. 

So meanwhile this is happening there is another asshole lets call him #2, now this one was not too bad, he would just text her constantly. And I mean constantly there would be times when we are at home or hanging out somewhere, and he would text and she would text back and it would be like that the whole night. It infuriated me, but like a dumbass I let it slide because I did not want to hold her down (Because I was afraid that might push her away... I know I am a fucking dumbass anyway) Eventually, after many a seen text by mistake on her phone. that's right she did not care enough to hide them, and to clarify I did not go through her phone. I saw that #2 was calling her babe and she was sending him pictures in some lego tshirt he bought him. GOD DAMN IT I was so mad. So I confronted her about it, and I told her I saw the picture and she got mad, she said it wasn't what it seemed like. But she eventually dissented and stopped talking to him.

And life was finally starting to take an upturn, it was great for a short while, it was me and her. she was finally happy with me. until 2 days ago. Now during the summer she has been working as an intern at United Airlines, causing a lot of travel for her. Which is great. but 2 days ago on the weekend she had an office at Lego (she is keeping the FUCKING job when she starts school since her internship ends after the summer) and proceeds to tell me she is going to hangout with the crew and go to TGIF which is cool whatever. That was the last I heard until the next morning. I stayed up waiting for her, Called her once and texted her twice, and nothing, I was already expecting the worst. 

And in comes asshole #3 that is correct folks #3. So when she finally got home that day she told me what happened. she left TGIF with about half the group to #3's house and did some hooka and proceeded to spend the night making out and staying over at his place. Yep she made out with asshole #3. 

But the worst part about all of this is that. I still want to be with her. What is wrong with me Reddit? She has hurt me so many damn times in such a short span. But I still love her, of course we broke up. But damn it I act like such a little bitch and want her back.


 But I am still so angry about all of this. I don't fucking deserve this. I just don't, in fact right now she is staying over at #3's house again. And she wont be moving out, to dorm into her new college. until august. I can possibly take this shit anymore. 

Edit 1: sorry for the wall of text.

**TL;DR My girlfriend is slowly turning into a slut, cheating on me with 2 assholes, after 3 years together.**"

The only problem is that they want me to ask people I go to school with. Now, I know I have a great opportunity for some people, but I honestly feel like a dick to offer a job to somebody. Is that cocky? For some reason I feel like it might rub somebody the wrong way. ""Hey man, you want a job you bum?"".

What do you guys think? How would you feel if somebody you only slightly knew came up to you and offered you an internship/hire once you graduate deal? I mean its a real job in EE and will pay $15/hr starting. 

Just some things about me:
-I do NOT like to brag
-I am very fortunate and am somewhat ashamed by it (and I only say this becuase I am a non-traditional student who has worked their ass off and feel like people already think I am a snob becuase of where I am (when It has been honest hard work to get where I am))

wutjy,2,2012-07-19,"Ted's journey. A story of love, regret, and acceptance.",[deleted],atheism,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/wutjy/teds_journey_a_story_of_love_regret_and_acceptance/,"Let me tell you a little story...

Once upon a time, there was a young man named...well, the names not important. If it's ok with you, let's call him Ted. Once upon a time, there was a young man named Ted. Now Ted wasn't a special boy, he was the monthly cover of Average Boy Magazine. Ted had two parents, one brother, one sister, a dog named Timmy, and lived in a small house in a small town. Now, you're probably telling yourself, ""Wow, how did Ted get so lucky? Two parents and a dog named Timmy?"" Don't get the wrong idea about Ted this early into the story, wait till the end.

Ted grew up sharing a room with his brother. Ted reigned down from the top bunk of a bedroom which should not have housed two growing boys. Ted stayed this way until his freshman year of high school, when his sister moved out to escape the terrorizing man she called Dad. Ted ended up with the big room and his brother the small room. Teds sister ended up an 18 year old girl working full time to pay rent. Ted, being the young man he was, did not understand the situation of his sister’s departure. Instead, sat in the glory of finally achieving the impossible...Ted's own room.

Ted had his freedom and took full advantage of it. Never was his room empty of friends. Never was Ted’s room vacant from glaring blood shot eyes and screams of his father. ""Music? Turn it OFF! Friends? Make them LEAVE.""

Ted found safety in a new skill called skateboarding. He chose to escape rather than face the demon at home. This became an expensive hobby, causing a chain of events, ultimately ending in the only answer allowing Ted to continue his pursuit of excellence...a job. Ted became a dish washer.

Ted's Mother was Christian and his dad...well, that's a good question. Ted was always pulled in two opposite directions, but one always suffocated the other. Ted was terrified of Hell. Ted was terrified he might die and end up trapped in infinite suffering. Ted's Mother was relieved. ""A good sense of fear will keep a boy hanging onto God"", she would always say. Ted was taught that having Jesus in his heart meant salvation from the eternal torment and fiery pits that are Hell. Ted believed this as reality and never questioned it. Why would his Mother lie to him? Isn't lying a sin?

Ted grew up having Christian and non Christian friends. Ted never preached Christianity but instead kept it to himself. Ted never worried if you believed or not, but sadly understood that his non Christian friends, were headed to the blood dripping gates of Hell.

Ted graduated Highschool, went to community college, applied for a University, and found himself surrounded by young adults. Ted was finally free to feel, think, and do as he pleased. Ted partied, he fucked, and he made unfortunate choices, but never failed. Ted's grades never suffered, he was promoted at work, and found himself an internship. How could be so lucky? At night Ted would pray, ""Thank you God for supplying me with such amazing gifts. I will live in your word and show the world who you are through my actions."" Ted continued to fornicate.

Ted eventually realized that beer and masturbation were ruining his life, and found himself back into the loving arms of God. Ted became a youth leader at a local Christian church. Ted also became a member of a skate ministry. Ted spoke about his life with drugs, an abusive father, and a child hood filled with regrets and sadness. Each time Ted spoke, he felt God lifting weights off his shoulders. ""I'm such a good person!” Ted would tell himself. Ted pursued this until school and work became priorities again. Ted left church, left skate ministry, and found sex, drugs, and rock &amp; roll all over again. Teds penis became the only roll model he needed.

Ted graduated from college, proposed to the love of his life, and found himself a job traveling the United States. Ted had finally made it; He was at the top. ""I knew God had a plan for you."" ""God has blessed you with amazing talents."" ""Jesus, he just keeps on giving."" Ted received these words of encourage from his Mother and friends. Ted believed them.

Ted worked, traveled, bought nice things, and witnessed his bank account increasing in size. Ted felt nothing could get better. Eventually, Ted found himself surrounded my Christian billboards somewhere in the Bible belt. This was a new experience for Ted. Never had Ted ever felt crushed by the idea of God. In that moment, something changed in Ted. A seed was planted.

Ted kept working, kept traveling, kept living this false sense of reality, but he slowly began to see it. The seed in Ted had started to grow. Each week, the smell of manure fertilized this seed. Each month, the roots searched for nutrients. Eventually, the seed became a living and breathing idea. Ted felt this idea grow directly through a sheet of glass, shattering it into pieces. Depression, anxiety, fear, hate, regret, shame, and disgust, this was the new Ted.

Ted dreamed of a razor blade, a hanging noose, and a twelve gage shotgun. Ted trusted no one. Drugs, that was the answer to these unrelenting screams. Ted drowned out the voices and opened the door to others. Clearer voices, logical voices, Ted’s voices. Eventually, Ted no longer needed drugs. The screams were gone, but the voices of logic remained. What was Ted to do with this new understanding?

Ted confronted his friends and found acceptance, discovering they had seeds of their own. Ted felt loved. Ted felt relieved. The new idea in Ted grew fragrant and beautiful flowers. Ted was no longer surrounded by fear. Ted no longer felt tormented. Ted decided to dedicate his life to showing others that Human beings alone can love unconditionally.

Ted had found his Atheism."
wurkq,1,2012-07-19,Halfway!,TheMortifyd,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/wurkq/halfway/,"Hey there fellow nofappers!

I'm halfway through my 90 day summer journey. Day #45 without fapping. The days don't matter to me anymore, though. Here are some improvements I've picked up: I want to be more extroverted &amp; outgoing, I am happier and more content with my life in the past month than I have been in my entire life, I'm working out much more, and life just feels great! It's getting easier to stop associating women to sex, and admire them for the people they are. I feel comfortable asking a female friend to hang out now :-) . There's been nothing but good in the last 45 days. 

**To those struggling:**
If you're having trouble getting past a week, I have two pieces of advice for you. 1) Don't give up. I have stuck with nofap for well over half a year. Last December I gave up porn, but I couldn't shake fapping. Sometimes I could make a week or more, other times it was torture making it over a day. But I stuck with it and have gotten this far. Advice #2) Find something to occupy yourself. I'm sixteen, so this is my first year I am working. It's an internship so it's full time, and I've been so busy with work and going to the gym I just dropped fapping and it wasn't even difficult at first because I had so much to do. 

I'm not done yet and still have a long way to go. I read a great quote on this subreddit a while back I would like to share, 
&gt; I didn't say it was going to be easy. I said it was going to be worth it."
wurao,1,2012-07-19,Biology/Lab Resume - Would appreciate some help!,[deleted],resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/wurao/biologylab_resume_would_appreciate_some_help/,"Hey all. I have been lurking both /r/jobs and /r/resumes for a while now. I have been really nervous to post my resume and ask for advice but any nervousness I have needs to go away because I am having an extremely difficult time finding a job. Helpful insights and advice would be most welcome, I really need to land a job there and move! I've applied to over 40 positions and have only really heard back from recruiting agencies (which I do also speak to in addition to applying to jobs myself). No calls from anything else. Is it my resume? A while back someone helped me write it but I'm not sure if it's just not doing the job or what...

Basically I am planning to move to San Diego once I have landed a job there, which is obviously not easy since things are a little rough right now. I already have the resources to move there myself, so I do not want/expect an employer to pay for relocation. A close family friend who lives near the area lets me use their address for my applications, and would be comfortable with me staying there if I needed to.

The thing I struggle with the most is that I have absolutely no work experience. My degree was a bachelor's degree in both biology (with a focus on cell and molecular biology) and forensic science. I did not intern at a laboratory when I went to school for various reasons (I could not provide the commitment that professors expected due to constant travel to see a terminally ill parent). I regret not taking these opportunities any way I could, I feel like it would have made this whole process so much easier, but that's how it went and here I am so I am just hoping to find a way to work around that. Currently I am volunteering with an organization unrelated to my degree, just so I have something to do. I took multiple laboratory courses throughout my stay at school, so that is really where I pull my skillset from.

The type of work I am looking is really any entry level laboratory related work: cleaning glassware, pipetting, preparing solutions, organizing samples, etc., really anything that could get my foot in the door for this career.

Sorry this was long, here's my resume (I have a references page but that is separate):
http://i.imgur.com/YzPLx.jpg

I also have a rough ""template"" for cover letter I usually send, but I customize it to fit every job listing I reply to. Usually my cover letter starts off general with interest in the position, etc., and then becomes specific, listing some examples of experience or skills I have that would be applicable to the job I am applying to.

Feedback would be great, I really appreciate what you guys do. I know no one has to help, and if they decide to, I'd be really grateful. At this point, I really just want a lab job. I'm looking for both part time and full time work, whichever I can get. Thank you.

I went and got some very nice cards today. But now I'm afraid that I may be saying 'thank you' too many times.

I got a general 'thank you' card for the entire group of employees, a little card for my supervisor, and then little 'thank you' notes to send to my coworkers whom I asked to be references.


Too much?

EDIT: Came in today to ANOTHER bouquet and a card. And a breakfast feast for me and the other employees who are leaving.

We got hit with a $44 million dollar bugdet cut, so the paid student interns are the first to go :P"
wuqit,9,2012-07-19,Lack of money and boyfriend's lack of ambition is hurting our relationship,sadlyfrustrated,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/wuqit/lack_of_money_and_boyfriends_lack_of_ambition_is/,"Sorry about the throwaway...I really don't want him to know I'm posting this.  I'm a female in my mid-twenties and he's a male in his late twenties.  We have been dating for 2 1/2 years.  He and I get along great.  We have similar interests, we're both intelligent, we have fun together etc.  I'm trying to keep this as vague as possible but I'll try to convey the situation.  

I am currently in professional school.  I intern full-time and take classes and am generally always working.  I am nearly guaranteed a relatively high-paying job upon graduation.  However, I currently live off of student loans.  Many professional schools, mine included, do not allow full-time students to work more than a certain number of hours per week because the workload is too vigorous.  So, we full-timers live off of loans.  I borrow around $26k/year for living expenses (don't even ask me how much I borrow for tuition..ugh) and we live in a very expensive city.  

On to my boyfriend:  He works in a skilled trade.  He's been working in said trade for less than ten years.  He works 8 hours/day 5 days a week like any other person.  He devotes nearly all of his free time to hobbies. He has no college degree.  The pay in this trade is not regular; he is only paid when there is work available.  There is no salary or hourly.  He sits around for the majority of the day at work eating, drinking and hanging out with his coworkers waiting for customers. It is really undependable.  He brings in maybe 1/4 of what I borrow/earn if he's lucky.  His 1/4 barely covers his food costs.  Thus, I support us.  I pay rent, insurance, bills, gas, most groceries, etc. He uses gas when he drives my car, I almost always pay when we go out (rare).  Nearly everything I pay for is x2 because he cannot afford it.

This is the problem:  When we get really poor, we rely on my credit cards and it's hurting my credit. I also am just frustrated that he thinks it's ok that I contribute easily 4x what he does.  I have little ""free"" time because I'm always filling my free time with productive things.  Working, school, extracurriculars related to my profession, honors groups etc.  Anything to help me get a fantastic job when I graduate.  I'm working hard to ensure our future.  His free time is spent doing hobbies.  Only.  Hobbies or hanging out with his friends/drinking.  I know it's important to have free time and hobbies, but he spends most of his day at work just hanging out having fun.  I have asked him so many times to help me out, but he comes up with excuses.  Even when he does work more hours, the business is so uncertain that we never know if he can even contribute.  Essentially, if I'm going to marry this man, I want to make sure that if something happens to me/my job, he can take care of me or our future children.  If I all of a sudden left the picture right now, he would be homeless and screwed.  He hates it when I bring up the issue of him working harder and us being poor because he feels like it's a personal attack.  I used to feel bad because I don't want to make him feel worthless or anything, but I don't feel bad anymore.  I don't think it's too much to ask him to be an adult and pay his own way.  A friend of mine suggested I move out and separate all of our funds to show him I'm serious.  I just don't know if I could do this to him. I really do love him and we get along great.  I just feel like he's got it so easy because I've enabled him (and I knew he was in this trade when we first got together) so why would he want to change? Please help me. 

TL;DR I work really hard and my boyfriend doesn't work that hard.  I contribute financially 4x more than him in direct proportion to our incomes.  So while it seems ""fair"" to pay proportionally, I work very hard and he coasts along on my hard work (which I unfortunately have enabled).  Love him though.

I'm babysitting while a friend of mine is doing an internship. Everything has been great for the past month. She gets along with my cats, no worries. All of a sudden she is chewing off all the fur around her right armpit. I thought it might be fleas or mites, something along those lines, so I gave her medicine for that. Now it's way worse. The raw area she's been chewing went from the size of a quarter to about the size of my palm.  I asked a vet and she said it was anxiety. I'm pretty sure it's getting infected now. Any advice or treatment I can try?

Edit: For update- I ended up taking her to the vet, She has a stapph infection. Vet says it was given to her by the vet that spaid her. She's been given a shot and should start recovering."

I'm literally flying cross country for this interview CA-&gt;NY because I really want to move to NY. My GPA is fucking abysmal ~ 2.1. My core GPA is around a 2.6. 

I mean, obviously they called me because they saw something they liked in my resume and cover letter (2 internships, as well as a 6 month long senior project with a company). I'm terrified that I'm going to fly across the country only to get rejected. 

Please give me advice on what I can say or do in order to take the attention off of my GPA and more on to me. I honestly believe I would be a great employee, and that I would be able to apply everything from my major to the job. Just because I'm a C student, doesn't mean I'm not an A+ worker.

Advice?,PharmDvsTRex,pharmacy,https://www.reddit.com/r/pharmacy/comments/wxnnf/as_a_floating_intern_pharmacist_i_see_a_lot_of/,"I work for a major chain in California. I float from store to store. Here are a few things that make me quite uncomfortable, but I'm not sure what, if anything, I can/should do about it.

1) California law mandates that if there is only one pharmacist on duty then there may only be one technician. There may be as many clerks as the rph feels comfortable with, two pharmacist interns, one technician extern. When there are two pharmacists there may be three techs. Clerks may ring up scripts, type scripts, and accept refills. Now in this chain I constantly see two techs per pharmacist. One of those techs should be working as a ""clerk,"" doing nothing but clerk duties in order for it to be legal. But both the techs do tech work (ie filling scripts, restocking drugs, etc).  An inspection by the board could land me fine if I'm the rph on duty at the time. 

2) California requires mandatory counseling on ALL new scripts, copies, and changes in dose or directions. Techs must instruct all patients to go to the counseling window if their script falls in these categories. I routinely see/hear ""do you want a consultation with this?"" I rarely see a tech direct the patient to the counseling window unless the patient asks for it. Not only is this illegal and could result in a fine, but it is dangerous! As an intern I've learned that patients don't know shit about their drugs or their side effects. It's important they talk with a pharmacist. 

I'll leave it at two. These are the things that bug me the most though there are a few other things that strike the wrong chord. 

Once I am working as a pharmacist I will demand any tech I work with to follow the laws. If they don't I'll report them. If I'm a manager I'll write them up. If corporate doesn't do anything to remedy the situation I'll report the pharmacy to the board.  This makes me seem like a bitch, but it's my license on the line. 

*tl;dr* I know counseling takes a lot of time, we are slammed with scripts, have corporate deadlines and goals to meet, and are usually understaffed, but I don't think that is sufficient reason to blatantly ignore the law. People are going to hate me.

I'm currently doing a summer internship and decided to use the money to finally dive into photography. I'm doing a lot of reading in my free time (trying to focus on 1 article per day) and practicing my shooting outside at least once a week usually.



**1) Gear:**

A little bit about some of the (relevant - ie: other than backpack, memory cards,  cleaning kit) gear I've purchased this summer:

Camera:  

* [Nikon D5100 16.2MP CMOS DSLR](http://www.amazon.com/Nikon-16-2MP-Digital-Vari-Angle-Monitor/dp/B004V4IWHY/ref=sr_1_2?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1342887713&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=d5100)



Lens:

* [Nikon 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G AF-S DX VR Nikkor Zoom Lens (kit lens)](http://www.amazon.com/Nikon-18-55mm-3-5-5-6G-AF-S-Nikkor/dp/B000ZMCILW)

* [Nikon 50mm f/1.8G AF-S NIKKOR Lens](http://www.amazon.com/Nikon-50mm-NIKKOR-Digital-Cameras/dp/B004Y1AYAC/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1342887450&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Nikon+50mm+f%2F1.8G+AF-S+NIKKOR+Lens+for+Nikon+Digital+SLR+Cameras)

Misc:

* [Manfrotto MKC3-H01 Compact Photo-Movie Kit](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004MKNJ84/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00)

* [Hoya 52mm HMC UV Digital Multi-Coated Slim Frame Glass Filter](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009R98A/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00)

* Wireless release remote - almost done building


**2) Background Info:**

I've been seeing a lot of semi-professional photoshoots popping up on Facebook recently of friends and thought they were really sweet - things like [this](http://imgur.com/a/MfCjT#2).

I thought it'd be nice to have some shoots of my buddies and myself where we're not all wasted or at the bars. Would also make for some nice momentos for after we all split ways this coming year, post-college. Would be neat to maybe do one of those side by side photos for one of our group reunions in the future.

I talked to my friends and they all loved the idea, one buddy even asked if I could possibly do some shoots of him and his girlfriend and another asked if I could do shoots for his music/sound projects. Point being here is that maybe I want to venture a little bit into some crude semi-professional portrait/cover photography. Not looking to do anything that looks like photostudio work, but just more on the slightly humorous side, like [this](http://tampabandphotos.com/wp-content/uploads/images/Mighty-Mongo-vans-warped-tour-600x436.jpg). 

There's about 6-7 of us in our close group of friends that would be included in the shoot. We were thinking of all suiting-up (HIMYM &lt;3) and putting on some WWII gas masks to achieve a quasi-steampunk effect.

**3) The Question:**

I understand that I'm going to need to invest in some studio light kits and/or external flash to achieve the right amount of light exposure to give off the semi-professional look. I've been doing a lot of research and read up on hotlights, strobe lights, umbrellas, reflectors, hot shoe mounts, and the likes. Obviously each offers their own unique advantages, but I can't afford to buy them all. 

So my question is **what sort of items you would consider to be essentials for my purpose** (models/links would be greatly appreciated)?

I have my eyes set on the [SB-700 AF Speedlight - **$330**](http://www.nikonusa.com/Nikon-Products/Product/Flashes/4808/SB-700-AF-Speedlight.html).

I was also looking various light kits - a la

[Cowboystudio Triple Lighting Kit - **$60**](http://www.amazon.com/Cowboystudio-Photography-Portrait-Continuous-Umbrellas/dp/B003WLY24O/ref=pd_sim_p_1)

[Cowboystudio 4 Piece Light Kit - **$84**](http://www.amazon.com/Cowboystudio-Continuous-Photography-Umbrellas-Background/dp/B003VBKSWK/ref=sr_1_17?s=photo&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1342656606&amp;sr=1-17&amp;keywords=photography)

[ePhoto 3200 Watt Lighting Kit - **$200**](http://www.amazon.com/ePhoto-Photography-Continuous-Lighting-H9004S4/dp/B005HFB4KS/ref=sr_1_28?s=photo&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1342656730&amp;sr=1-28&amp;keywords=photography) 

[CowboyStudio Triple Light Kit + Backdrops - **$148**](http://www.amazon.com/CowboyStudio-Photography-Lighting-Backdrops-Background/dp/B003G9DRPC/ref=sr_1_5?s=photo&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1342656933&amp;sr=1-5&amp;keywords=photography), 

but I don't know what sort of items would make a real difference for my application. Most of these shoots would probably be done indoors in an apartment setting, with some moderately large crowds of up to 6-7 people.

What suggestions can /r/photography offer?

**4) Budget:**


Bottom line is that I'm comfortably willing to budget **up to $500** for this purpose,  but I'd rather have a few quality items than a bunch of low-end crappy ones that become obsolete/useless in a short amount of time and end up piling up in the garage.

This is my first wedding out of college, and I have no idea what I'm doing. I can't afford another suit right now, so this is going to have to be what I wear. I'm willing to spend some money to get stuff tailored a bit, but this is a relatively cheap suit that I don't wear much, so it wouldn't make sense for me to go crazy on it.

* I just got a new ""slim fit"" dress shirt because the one I got before was way too loose on me. The slim fit one still looks a little baggy to me. Is this something I should get tailored?

http://imgur.com/a/eJbWQ#x3Elx

* With my new shirt I got a new tie, without thinking much about it. It's a slimmer tie than the other ones I have, but I really like the colors. I've read that slim ties should only go with slim lapels, which I don't think I have. Does it work? Or just look silly?

http://imgur.com/a/eJbWQ#pL5hf

* How's the fit on my coat? I think the sleeves may be a touch too long, since no cuff is showing when I have my hands by my side. Or are my shirt sleeves too short? I also think the shoulders might be a hair too wide, but from what I've read, fixing that is not trivial for a tailor and so I figured it's probably not worth the money.

wxbzl,27,2012-07-21,I just had a very interesting night....,Malencius,gaymers,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaymers/comments/wxbzl/i_just_had_a_very_interesting_night/,"So for the past few weeks during my summer internship, I've been helping my boss keep her cousin entertained while he's visiting, and I was very pleased to figure out he's very attractive :D

Our time together was a bit strange, because I told him I am gay (at least I'm very sure I did) but he still thought I was straight. He would scope out women in the city and try to find dates for both of us (one of his missions while visiting was to get laid, which never actually happened). However, I didn't really mind his obliviousness and proceeded to subtly hit on him for his entire stay. I don't know if he picked up on the fact that I found him attractive, but he acted rather flirtatiously at some points as well, which made it all the more fun.

Last night, which was also the last night of his stay, I took him out with me and my sister to an Irish pub in the city. Much alcohol was had, as well as merrily dancing to the live band. However, due to my lowered tolerance due to not drinking that much recently, I got drunk conspicuously quicker than the others, which led to vomiting in a McDonald's bathroom soon after leaving the pub (first time I've ever vomited from alcohol). Luckily my very nice and caring sister was there, because otherwise my friend would have just kept laughing at my drunken misfortune. After purging my system, I felt much better but still rather embarrassed that this happened in front of the guy I've been flirting with for weeks, so I decided to head home a bit early by myself, while my sis made sure my boss's cousin got to public transit safely as well (who was also a bit drunk as well). 

I felt kind of bad at leaving the night like that and not saying a proper goodbye to this guy, who was leaving in the morning, so I called him up and told him goodbye via phone. Since I was still ever so slightly drunk, I just decided ""fuck it"" and told the guy how I thought he's attractive, which is normally very uncharacteristic of me, because I normally feel uncomfortable being blunt about my attraction with the person who sparks my interest. Amazingly, luck was on my side and the guy was not offended by this and thanked me. The call ended with me feeling very satisfied with myself and relieved that the guy was not offended.

To be eligible I'll be taking some random community college classes for credit to get student status. In the interest of making the best use of this opportunity, are there any that can actually enhance my job skills? Not any kind of degree/certification program or adult enrichment stuff, just literally individual classes (I'm open to furthering my education later but after I'm working so I can make sure it fits in with a career path and even possibly get support from my future employer and/or have some money saved).

**My background:**
Majored in Political Science and French (I know, but I fell for the whole ""just get a degree in anything and your future job will train you"" lie). Studied abroad in Paris and taught English there. Fluent in French and started learning Spanish (would love to add Portuguese down the line). I started doing tutorials at codecademy.com but have no idea if that would teach me enough to be useful in the workplace.

**My work history:** 
Did customer service in a theme park and later in hotels (front desk, night audit, PBX). Did an office job supporting sales staff at a small marketing/branding business and later started managing their horribly neglected social media. Did an internship at a French consulate where I did some translating and had to teach myself Final Cut to edit videos (something I had never done before) and just for fun I learned to create subtitles. I've also been tutoring languages and blogging to support that and checking out my local parks and rec district and adult school to look into teaching language learning classes.

So I'm like a lot of liberal arts majors with mostly soft skills that a lot of other people have. I can see myself doing freelance work at least part time so skills that would enhance that as well would be useful. I'm still a little directionless (ok, a lot). I would be interested in translation and language education but I'm unsure as to how stable it is, what the market is like, the future outlook, etc. Plus that would entail some more future education so I want to be pretty certain so I don't end up wasting time on a degree/cert that will be useless to me. It'd be great to get my foot in the door at a great company and work my way to a fulfilling position. Which I know is vague and what everybody wants but looking for anything that'd make me generally useful."

Anyone need a summer internship w reduced rent? Here ya go:


Hola! I've rented my place for a long time! My landlord lives next door. I went broke from a video game start-up but never, ever want to give up my place. I can rent 1/2 to you if you're cool for $675 (inc wifi, water, gas, parking)

Recovery is slow but I'm also an indie film producer and we've been winning BIG. I also produce website content. Are you a programmer?

I need help w/ booking my speaking tours, secrets of Hollywood industry nights, and film fest workshops... The more you help me book, the more you get my place to yourself. And again, my place is AWESOME! 

Full bath+shower, free wifi, big tv, projector, couch, fridge, dishwasher, stove, oven. Unfortunately no laundry-- but I'm cool w/ weird late night hours from coming home from bars, dating drama w/ your ex, etc.

Plus, you'll never need a car in LA again! Walk to Sony, Culver, TJs, Rush. Expo line to Downtown LA. Culver City bus TO THE BEACH! Bike path!

How much furniture do you have? Where did you grow up? What's your favorite movie? Where did you go to school? What job have you hated the most? What's your other favorite site besides reddit? :-)

Perfect if you're a photographer but sooo choice if you like messing around w Wordpress, php, etc. Accountant, CPA, business minded even better.

I'm a female entrepreneur w/ a solid track record who refuses to give up... A roommate would really help right now. My biz partner screwed me but I'm already positive I'm on the next big project-- after several months of coconut ice cream, yoga, gym membership, and sleeping it off ;) 

If you need to hide out and get your life together, too, I won't judge. I can even make sure my place is dark enough during daylight hours if you need to sleep... Game... Edit your film, code your website, be socially awkward, artistic, creative, or be an all around introvert. 

Tons of historical stuff nearby if you like to get out and explore. A few gyms nearby, too.

Just checking to see who's out there. I can sign off on your school credit; I'm legit in this town. 

Thanks!

So last summer I meet this girl who goes to Harvard. I'm in Portland. We dated last summer for a few months and things seemed to go well, but I'd never really consider getting serious with her - she's kind of inexperienced and annoying and scatterbrained in a way that isn't cute, but she's also a fucking genius and an enthusiastic lover.

Summer ends, she goes back to school and we talk pretty rarely because neither of us really initiates it. Towards the end of the school year we pick back up and we've been dating since she got back in town.

Flash forward to tonight. I come over for a dinner party she's having with some other interns at her company who she knows from school. Her roommate seems eminently surprised to see me - I haven't come over in a few weeks, we mostly meet elsewhere - and her friends seem to have never heard of me, which is weird because last summer all her intern buddies knew probably more about me than I'd have liked.

The night goes pretty normally. She's as into me as ever, and after she falls asleep I (with permission) hop on her laptop. She's automatically logged into Skype when I start up the computer, and this dude messages me like ""Hey babe, you free tomorrow?""

and I was like Whaaaaaaaaat is this?

So I do some snooping and find out two things.
1. She's been dating this guy for like four months. I'm reading chat logs and they seem to talk every night. He flew out to Portland last week to see her and spend the night on Wednesday (roommate must think this girl is super classy amirite).
2. My girlfriend has more issues than I realized. I did some more snooping, and she keeps a daily journal on a word document which is one of like two things on her desktop. Shitty security if you ask me, but that's kind of her style. Apparently she's pretty seriously bulimic, which I guessed, and cuts/self injures in various other ways. I knew she cut because I'm not a fucking idiot and I know what it looks like when you fall down some stairs, which she used to explain her injuries.

I'd like to make my exit as gracefully as possible. I'm typing this on her laptop and plan to bounce in the morning and not look back, but I'm wondering if I should tell homeboy that he's getting fucked around on, too. On the one hand, from reading the chats he actually seems like a nice guy and I can tell he really cares about her. She's been open with him about her issues and from reading her journal it seems like he's a huge support to her. I don't really blame her for having no social skills - I think either she doesn't realize that what she's doing is wrong, or that she's narcissistic enough not to care. She needs a support system other than her mother, and I don't want to fuck up the only good thing she has going for her. On the other hand, I feel bad for this dude. If I were him, I'd want to be told about the situation and know that I was getting played.

For the record I've been having unprotected sex with this girl and so has he. She's got an IUD so pregnancy isn't really an issue, but now she's exposing me to potential STI's from other people without my knowlege or consent.

I've also considered testing her a little bit to see how far she's willing to take it. Maybe dropping the L word and talking about moving in together. That seems kinda immature and not really worth the trouble but it'd be amusing.

**tl;dr Girlfriend has been in two relationships for the past few months without either of us knowing about it. He's the only person she talks to about her mental issues and I'm not sure whether telling him that he's been getting played is worth screwing her out of her only support system.**"

We primarily produce television programs, so we have no connection to The Dark Knight Rises, but everyone in the industry is connected to everyone else, so my boss, among others, had already been in contact with friends over at Warner Brothers by the time I got in to the office.

Last night after the midnight screening I spent the rest of the night thinking about the lives that had been lost how tragic it all was. But when I got to work I started to think more about some other ways this whole event is devastating. This film - which is, in my opinion, a masterpiece - is one of the most anticipated films of the year, if not the decade, and had already begun to generate Oscar buzz. It was set to break box office records. But on a personal level, appreciating the movie or talking about it in any cinema context without reference to the massacre seems obscene and inappropriate. I am certain that the effects on the number of people who refrain from seeing it, whether out of fear or because it reminds them of the tragedy, will be significant. And though you may not think it for such a highly anticipated film, advertising *does* make a big difference, and the pulling of ads from the airwaves, not to mention the [cancelation of the Paris premiere](http://insidemovies.ew.com/2012/07/20/warner-bros-cancels-paris-premiere-of-dark-knight-rises-following-shooting/), will undoubtedly have a further negative impact.



I just keep thinking about the hundreds upon hundreds of people who worked on this film - everyone from Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale right down to grip &amp; electric PAs and extras, as well as the producers, studio execs, and marketing and promotion team. They have been working tirelessly for four years to make something spectacular, and let me tell you, having all that hard work culminate in a single weekend premiere is a thrill and a terror. And to have it all tainted by this...I can't imagine what it was like at the Warner Bros. offices today; the feelings of guilt and responsibility, the need for public action, the scrutiny, and of course the overwhelming sense of failure on what was supposed to be a very rewarding day for them.



On a more personal level, I am very involved with fandom and cosplay, and I live for midnight premieres. To have this happen at the premiere of The Dark Knight Rises instead of, say, a mall or parking lot, is just so much more catastrophic because it has targeted something so complex and connected to so many people. I was on the verge of tears all day, not just because I was mourning the needless loss of so many lives, but also because this feels, in a way, like the beginning of the end of moviegoing as we know it. Of course, things like pirating and netflix, as well as the bad economy have all taken their toll of ticket sales, but no one has ever been afraid of going to the movies before. And the culture of midnight moviegoing that is so important to so many of us is going to be tainted for a long time; [AMC theaters have already banned costumes and masks](http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-amc-costumes-20120720,0,5806267.story).




The shooting wasn't just a massacre of human life; it also marked the destruction of something very important to many of us. I keep thinking how sad it is that so many people not only lost loved ones, but many of them probably were avid fans of these films, and they can probably never watch them again. People find solace in books, movies, and music in times of loss and heartbreak, but that distraction has been stolen from them too. And even for those of us who don't know a single person directly affected, it's hard to enjoy this film we were all so eagerly anticipating. 




This has been a loss on many levels, but above all I am keeping my thoughts with the family and friends of those whose lives were taken.

wwx2n,2,2012-07-21,"Soon to be LDR, College advice?",underley,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/wwx2n/soon_to_be_ldr_college_advice/,"(Apologies in advance for the wall of text, it's late and I tend to ramble.)

So i'm extremely new to both reddit and the LDR community, so please forgive me if I'm doing any of this wrong.

A little backstory: I (18/F) and my boyfriend (18/M) have been together for about a year and a half now.  We met about 2 and a half years ago, started dating immediately, but soon broke up because we were both too nervous to make any moves.  He dated someone else very shortly, before realizing he had made a mistake (his words not mine), and after a few months of getting to know each other better as friends, we got back together.  Everything was going amazing for the early months, finally fell in love and both had sex for the first time, etc.

But this is where we start to get backlash about wanting to try for a LDR.  Basically, in short, about 3 or 4 months after we had gotten back together, he cheated on me.  He was really drunk and high at the time, and he didn't have the courage to tell me about it, I had to hear from a friend of the girl. He's worked unbelievable hard to help us work past it and trust each other again.  He swears he has changed since then and he realizes how much he never wants to lose me etc. etc.

Now, we're both going off to college this year.  He's staying closer to home, while I'm going about 12 hours away by car, or a 3/4 hour flight away.  I'll be home for thanksgiving and christmas and such, and as a graduation present I'll be able to fly him up to visit me once or twice throughout the school year.


We both think our relationship is definitely strong enough to last long distance, however we both have slight jealously issues because of our past. We've talked about anything and everything but sometimes jealousy can be tricky for us, though we've gotten much better over the past year.

I saw that he had posted on the overall relationship advice subreddit about basically what I'm saying now, and the overall response was guys saying we should break up so he can enjoy college.  He responded sweetly saying that was never his intention and he really thinks we can work.  Still, the 'advice' he was getting broke me up inside.  He's going to a school known for it's partying, and though I know he's definitely not a partier himself, the tiny bit of jealousy that still exists in me is scared for us.

TL;DR Boyfriend and I are going to college, cheating happened early on in the relationship, jealously can still crop up on occasion because of it.

I guess what I'm really asking for is if you think we're crazy for trying to make this work, from people who have a real perspective on LDRs.  I'm also wondering what you guys do to make each other feel more secure when you're far away. Thanks guys :)

EDIT: My other fear is feeling like being long-distance will take away from the ""college experience."" It's a criticism I hear a lot but I've never known how it feels first hand, so if anyone has any experience that'd be amazing.

DUALEDIT: Woke up to this text this morning: ""___....I want us to stay together more than anything....you wouldn't be holding me back. I wart to talk to you, I want to spend time and Skype.  It might be hard but what else would you want to do. I want to be with you. I want to try. If anything we will grow more mature than any other couple. We will have trust coming out of our ears. And if something happened (which I don't believe ever will) then we'll have to do something. But ___, we are strong. You can't let fear let you falter. What we have is a relationship that will be taken to a new level. We will have harder times being away. But that will make seeing each other oh so much more special. So many people do it now with marines and college and even moving to a new country. So many people do it and work things out. We will still see each other. I'll see you at thanksgiving, Christmas for like a month, spring break, pax, summer all the time, and the same over and over. Maybe we will both get internships out in California. But what I know is that we will work it out and be together. I want that. You want that. Nothing can or will stop is. No girl can be you. No person can replace you. You, ___, are the girl I love. And no one else. And that will never. Never. Change."""

Post all and any interpretations. I'm just very confused.

Edit: The more I think about it, the more I think I should add context (briefly).
Very emotional break-up for both of us, me 21f, him 20m, relationship was going on ~1.5 years. He claims he did not want to have to do this, but due to pressures from work, parents, and the ""next level of responsibility in our relationship"" (still don't know what that means), and lack of romance (being long distance with our incredibly busy lives over the summer - internships for him and course work for me), he believed he should end it now before the school year starts. This would avoid both of us falling academically if the pressures of life/school were too much for us to handle. Can't help to feel as though I have been lied to in our entire relationship, even though this is probably not true. We're young, and both were in love; very emotionally dependent on each other. His logic makes sense but it breaks my heart, especially about the romance. We've reached a stage where the honeymoon phase has ended, and perhaps he wasn't entirely prepared for that.  Debating about whether to keep him in my life or not - I truly respect him as a person and still love him, even though he has hurt me so. Cut off communication about 2 weeks ago. I told him no contact until semester starts, if that - it made him very upset emotionally. 

TL;DR: Lots of mixed feelings, really wish he would have given it another chance, given the fact that summers were always a challenge for us, especially this one. "

Let me preface this wardrobe with some quick facts about myself.

1. I'm 19 years old, about to be a junior in college, but am currently interning at a Fortune 50 company in an eCommerce office, where it is jeans casual and super relaxed. However, during the school year, I do consulting where most of our clients are Fortune 500 and business professional to business casual is required.

2. I'm 5'2, 110 pounds, wear 34B and am a pear shape, meaning that my hips and legs are where my fat is stored, but I'm relatively slim elsewhere. Forgive me if this seems as though it's focused on one body type-- I've tried to include examples of others as well!

3. Budget&amp;Style wise, I shop at H&amp;M, Forever21, Nordstrom Rack a lot. But whenever I buy anything from these shops, I am thorough with checking the construction of the garment, as well as the material it is made out of before buying it. I'm a college student, so everything is budget constrained.

I'll try and go through all the basics a young professional should own.

*Let me also say one important thing: before you go out and shop, you look at your body with a non-critical eye and pick out the things that you like best about yourself. Keep this in mind as you dress yourself and go shopping and pick out clothing that showcases these parts! *
___________________________________________



&gt;**Business Professional
**

**Jacket**

I find myself in a suit often, whether I'm presenting deliverables or interviewing for my next internship. I only have it in black, but a dark grey would work as well, if you wanted to wear it for other occasions. I also looked for a good weight to the fabric. As a pear shape, I also make sure my jacket ends before the widest part of my hips start. Otherwise, I find that my hips are emphasized and I look fat.

I also make sure that the fit is right, meaning that the arms are not too long. The arms should cover your wrist bone, but not extend down your palms or more. The shoulder seam should lay right next to the little bump, toward your arm, not your neck. It should not lay on or inside, otherwise it won't fit right. I'm not sure if everyone has this bump on their shoulder, but I just checked my sister and she does.

[This](http://bim.shopstyle.com/pim/56/32/5632b7a9368adf74eefda09f7bbc8201_best.jpg) is the exact suit jacket that I have from [Express](http://goo.gl/QHBA5) in black. I button it when I'm standing, and unbutton it when sitting down.

For more well endowed girls, you would probably benefit from a jacket that is a 2 or 3 button jacket, such as[ this](http://goo.gl/X9UwK) one. The problem with this example, is that the lapels might be a little bit too wide. Look for a jacket with narrow ones, as well as ones WITHOUT pockets on the top half. Simple pockets for the bottom half are okay. *--Thanks Jamanduh!*


**Trousers**

I have two pairs of trousers that I wear, but only one that I pair with the suit for a business professional outfit. I have [this in black and a dark brown](http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/img-thing?.out=jpg&amp;size=l&amp;tid=51371615) which I got again from [Express](http://goo.gl/xYmrZ).

When trying these on, I make sure that they are not too tight in the crotch. If the fabric wrinkles or puckers when you're standing up, then they don't fit right. They should fit perfectly on your waist and not require a belt. This gives me the most trouble, since my hips are bigger than my waist, so I'd advise going to a tailor to get anything fixed. As for the length, this wholly depends on whether you prefer to wear flats or heels to work. Regardless, your pants should not be long enough where you'd start to step on them. They should not touch the ground, or be close to touching the ground. They also should [not drape](http://us.123rf.com/400wm/400/400/nruboc/nruboc0611/nruboc061100010/603454-a-woman-carrying-an-umbrella-going-to-work.jpg) over the top of your shoe, because you want clean lines. Refer to the picture of the pants above.

Whenever I go out to buy trousers and try them on, I make sure to wear shoes I would wear to work. I also sit down in the dressing room with the pants on to see if they gape in the back. This way, I can also check length based on what shoes I plan to wear often.


**Skirt**

For hot days, or for when I want a different look, I pair the suit jacket with a pencil skirt. As always, when shopping, I look for fabric weight and content. For skirts, I check to see if it is lined, just due to personal preference of not wearing slips. The skirt I have is high waisted, but again, this is due to personal preference.

Fit-wise, I don't want a skirt that is too tight to my body. The fabric should not pucker when standing up. Sitting down should be comfortable. If you feel like the skirt suddenly gets tight when you sit down, then it does not fit. You should also be able to walk normally in them. If your stride is cut down, then the skirt is too small for you. A pencil skirt should also not hug your legs. It should hug your hips and slightly hug your butt. If it hugs your legs as well, then it's a bandage skirt, not a pencil skirt, and is inappropriate for work. The fabric should hang from your butt.

My skirt ends at the top of my knees. When I sit down, it does not pull up past mid thigh, because that would be much too short. It has a slit in the back that facilitates walking. Your skirt could be longer or have two slits by each leg, or be a dark grey or a dark brown. It could be high waisted or not. What matters is that it fits and flatters.

[This](http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/img-thing?.out=jpg&amp;size=l&amp;tid=9191912) is a skirt similar to the one I have, and it should fit like [this](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/318SXNVuBxL._SY445_.jpg).

Not like [this](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dq4uLVj7DxU/Tp3q9tCaZSI/AAAAAAAAAaQ/B96HuP3cwh8/s640/GG-8.jpg). The weight of this fabric is much too thin, and you can see the outline of the shirt that she has tucked in here.

Or like [this](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Xa1aoSEldMs/TLVNCNyjZcI/AAAAAAAAAH0/sNHKFzA_KAE/s1600/pencil-skirt.jpg). This skirt is too tight and the fabric is puckering.


**Shirt or Blouse**

I say shirt or blouse here because some people cannot wear button up shirts without getting them tailored. It just makes sense financially then, to avoid them all together.

The classic white shirt is button up and made out of a high quality cotton with a decent weight to it. Ideally, it shouldn't be too see through. [This](http://bim.shopstyle.com/pim/7b/53/7b53d10bce9a81d32ee813ae23b8f83d_best.jpg) one from [The Limited](http://goo.gl/5Lb59) fits perfectly, as well as [this](http://goo.gl/QyuZb) one from H&amp;M. The arms hit the top of the hand and should peek a little bit out of your suit coat. The buttons in the chest area should not gape. The fabric should not pucker. It should be fitted throughout your waist. If when you wear it, it does not satisfy these requirements, you either must get it tailored, or not buy it at all.

This is when you should wear a blouse underneath your suit coat. This obviously can vary widely and is up to your personal tastes. It helps to pick something in white, or another lighter color, especially if your coat and trousers are in black. But for business casual, you can wear pretty much any blouse, as long as it fits, is modest, and is flattering. Cleavage should not be shown. I like details on my blouse to be part of its construction, and not in the pattern of the fabric. Personally, I think patterns aren't business professional.

[This](http://resources.shopstyle.com/sim/76/18/76187294483213072c30266166cd2604/express-tees-lace-yoke-ruffle-sleeve-easy-tee.jpg) from [Express](http://goo.gl/ZBYlp) is appropriate under a coat, as well as [this](http://goo.gl/gL1gU), [this](http://goo.gl/9XKQs), [this](http://goo.gl/Y28qb), [this](http://goo.gl/iEgnM), or [this.](http://goo.gl/ZIYJa)

Basically, any blouse will do, as long as **fits, flatters, and is appropriate**.

**Shoes**

Close toed shoes are business professional, however these days, I find that an open toed shoe has also become accepted. However, I was taught that they weren't appropriate for business professional. Shoes should be in a solid color with minimal hardware. Flats or heels, just make sure you can walk comfortably in them. Nothing is more unprofessional than hobbling around on heels that you clearly haven't learned to wear. If you do decide to wear heels, there is a line to be drawn for what is appropriate and what isn't. Obviously, 6 inch platform heels are not appropriate for the workplace. My rule for shoes is this: if I bought it with the idea of going to a party/club in mind, then I shouldn't wear it to work.

I have [this pair](http://a2.zassets.com/images/z/1/3/0/4/1/3/1304139-p-MULTIVIEW.jpg) of low wedges from [Cole Haan](http://goo.gl/4vlw3). Honestly, this was the most expensive thing I've ever bought ever, but it was so worth the price. They are the most comfortable pair of shoes I've ever set foot into, but I've also heard good things from their line of Nike Air bed shoes. If your suit is black, so should your shoes be. If your suit is brown, brown shoes.

wwo7q,8,2012-07-20,Probably been posting before but...I think my dad is screwing up on his taxes by claiming me as dependent.,taxeshelp,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/wwo7q/probably_been_posting_before_buti_think_my_dad_is/,"So I'm currently 22, in college in another town from my parents (but still same state), and I live in my own place probably 10-11 months out of the year. I don't have a job but am starting a part-time job next week, and last spring I did a paid internship. Obviously there is a lot of oversight on my part, but honestly I didn't know much at all last year about taxes (unfortunately).

So long story short, my dad has been still claiming me as a dependent. And he never reported the $4,000-ish I made in my spring internship because he wanted to still claim me as a dependent for the tax write-off.

So tonight, from a cursory google search, I'm confused about what defines a place of residence. My driver's license is still my parents' home address, and basically they do support me financially with a monthly stipend for rent/utilities/etc (and yes I know this is terrible of me, hence the new job and loans), but in terms of where I'm actually living, it's in an apartment complex where the rent checks are in my name and my name is on the lease, etc.

So, biggest reason I'm concerned is that this new job requires a moderate-level security clearance and, while I've gotten clearances in the past, this is a bit more than before and I'm concerned that this will turn up and work against me. Particularly with when I actually get this job, I will be working as a 1099-contractor and will have to report all income.

So can anyone actually clear this all up for me and convince me that I'm not getting cheated in my taxes from all this, or if so, how to fix this? Thanks!"

wwl49,0,2012-07-20,Bane's not too shabby for a fifty-something.,Scottama,TheDarkKnightRises,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDarkKnightRises/comments/wwl49/banes_not_too_shabby_for_a_fiftysomething/,"So, let's think this through.

In Batman Begins, when we first see Bruce, he is at Princeton and Rachel is an intern at a law firm.  This would have to make them at least 18 or so.

Bruce returns after 7 years, so by the time he was Batman he was 25 at the youngest.  [Apparently](http://batman.wikia.com/wiki/The_Dark_Knight), TDK takes place about 9 months after Batman Begins, so let's call him 26.  There's then an 8 year gap, making 34 at the very youngest in The Dark Knight Rises, and it is here that he is old and out of the game.

Then, there's Miranda Tate.  Less information to go on here, but she looks about the same age as Bruce Wayne, and she is played by the 36-year-old Marion Cotillard, so let's go for 35.

And then consider the fact that [Miranda Tate is the child who climbed out of the prison, helped by her adult protector, Bane](/spoiler).  [Apparently](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/social-network-actor-lands-role-176577) this took place 30 years before the story of the Dark Knight Rises, which would put her age at about 5, which seems about right.

[Her *adult* protector,](/spoiler) Bane, certainly looks to be at least 20 when his hood is removed.

Which would mean, of course, that Bane is at least 50 years old when he's beating Batman to a pulp in The Dark Knight Rises.


EDIT: It's been pointed out that Bruce has his 30th birthday party in Batman Begins, making him 39 or so in TDKR."

I'm a Youth, Young Adults, and Internship Director at a church in Frisco, Texas called Elevate Life Church. Anyone who wants to email me can do so joshc@elevatelife.com

i'm not selling anything, or proselytizing my viewpoint. I just want to talk to some other people about what life looks like inside this kind of culture, and answer any questions you might have. 

A couple things first,
I'm not too involved in the financial aspect of our church (partly by choice, partly because it is better that way) I know where our money goes, I don't know percentages, but I can tell you that we do an audit every year, and share it with the church. You can ask any questions you want about this, but I might not be able to answer because of my lack of knowledge. I have a budget, and have to get every purchase approved. Haha. 

I've been a PK for 12 years, before that, my dad travelled a lot as an evangelist, and spoke a lot, so I grew up on the road. And I've seen a lot of church cultures. 

I have a degree in Film/Graphic Design, and a minor in Psychology
I am paid a relatively modest salary commensurate with my education/experience (nowhere near 6 figures)


Full disclosure, I hope we can have healthy debate, I originally posted this to r/Christianity because I was a little concerned about trolls, but, whatever, hopefully we can have good conversation even if r/circlejerk shows up. 

anyway, tolerance is cool, love is great too. I'm
a 25 year old conservative independent, and I wouldn't classify myself based on r/atheism's definition of a ""fundie"" I've had some pretty cool experiences, and thought reddit might be interested in what my culture looks like. 

This AMA will consist of my opinion, not the opinion of Elevate Life Cburch

EDIT: I think 7 hours is good guys! thanks so much reddit, that was much better than I thought. great questions and debate as well. look forward to seeing you out there in the internets! 

**EDIT 2: I thought i was done! i'll continue to answer questions as much as i can. I'll probably take a little break from reddit tomorrow.

He places people in one large governmental bureaucracy. He is a very forceful personality and I usually just let him do what he wants while I man up and take it. 
I just graduated from college and he being very well-intentioned, told me that he would help me find my first serious job in this awful job market. I agreed, I thought  what's the worst that could happen?
He has been giving me shoddy advice, for example he will tell me that I should say that I worked at internships two years before I actually did work at those internships (He wants to list them as 2008 when I actually worked these internships in 2010). None of the dates on his version of my resume are fucking accurate, they are all way off by several years and even the cities are mixed up. He says its fine, and don't worry about it. Then he puts very personal and cheesy stuff in my cover letters to give the impression that I'm this stupid ditzy girl who needs tons of guidance. Seriously, I could not believe what I read. Then I find out (he never told me) that he's set up a gmail account in my name and has been writing to potential employers, and filling out applications in my name without notifying me. None of this stuff was ran by me before he did it and I found out after I sent in my self-created applications to most of the same employers he applied to as ""me"". SERIOUSLY?? He's been doing this for about three months. I think he just seriously fucked my chances. What are they going to think when they see all the same jobs in completely fucked up ways and completely different cover letters with the same name. I'm so humiliated. 

The thing is I want to do this on my own. I want to be able to find a job through my efforts. I've already done several interviews and hundreds of applications. I've heard back from several very famous organizations and I'm excited to see what my prospects will be. I've taken over the fake email account, but he still hacks into it. I know because he emails me his reactions to every move I make. WTF I now have the phone verification on gmail activated and I hope it works.

I'm just so fucking tired of this. I hate that he doesn't believe in me. I hate that he's been impersonating me without my consent. I hate that I didn't get the fresh start in the job market that I wanted. I hate that he feels entitled to do any of this to me WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE. I know he loves me, but he's manipulative and too stubborn to even admit to himself that he's in the wrong. I know I can succeed on my own, I've been working my way through college. I just need him to understand that I'm an adult and I can do this on my own. I've talked to him multiple times about this and he doesn't understand, he thinks I'm not serious WHEN I FUCKING AM!

td;lr my helicopter parent is sabotaging my attempts to start my career and live my own life.

My daily Indeed search dug up a great opportunity today for a junior engineering position, but the company that made the posting is just a headhunter Human Resources type company. As I have learned to do with such postings, I simply Google'd some of the wordings until I found the actual company they are representing. (It's not hard when they don't bother to change any of the wording except replacing the company name with ""our client""). Anyway, it's one of my dream companies. I haven't applied there yet, but I've been watching them.

I tend to see if I can apply directly with the company in these cases. But in this case, the listing on the actual hiring company's website lists it as requiring 5 years of experience, whereas the staffing agency only listed 2 years, and claimed to be a jr. position. I know I can use my master's in very related subjects to claim 2, but 5 is generally where I don't bother trying.

So, what should I do? Should I try applying to the main company's more experience required ad? Or should I risk going through this mystery head hunter company who may or may not actually be able to get me this position and thus risk losing all chances with the actual company I want to work for.

**tl;dr: Through some sleuthing, I found a job listing at one of my dream companies via a poorly-worded HeadHunter company ad. The HeadHunter ad requires less experience than the dream company's ad. I meet the lower requirements. Which should I apply to?**"

I'm learning a lot, but not all of the things that I NEED to learn. I'm trying to get into journalism and I'm having a lot of trouble conducting interviews, which is something we've never really gone over in any class. This is extremely concerning to me and I feel like my interviewing abilities will not be up to the same standard as the other potential journalists coming out of my school. 

Speaking of living up to the same standard, there are some guys who have gotten ridiculous internships and I haven't been in one decent one yet. Best I've done is work at a local museum pointing people to the bathrooms.

On top of all of that is the tanking state of journalism and the lack of trust in media in general. I have my morals and values, but I'm terrified that an editor might squash all of that in the name of making a few bucks.

I'm trying to learn another language as well and potentially move out of the US thanks to this new skill. However, even after learning the language for 3 years, and studying abroad in another country, I'm not sure if I'll ever be ready.

My medical stature is failing as well, as my kidneys are tanking and I will probably need a transplant in less than a couple years. I'm not sure what that will mean for my professional future.

Lastly, my girlfriend and I got into a heated argument Friday night which lead to a horrifying discovery as to how far my girlfriend's depression goes. It's much, much worse than I thought it was, and she can't get any help due to insurance issues. I'm also worried that she won't be able to go to another country with me as she gets panic attacks when she leaves her hometown, and she'll be terrified if we stay in a hostel somewhere since she'll worry that everyone in the room will be talking about her and she won't know what they're saying. She's on the heavy side so she's worried that she'll be made fun of and have a mental breakdown. 

So, I'm freaking terrified about a bunch of crap right now. If you want to give me a motivational speech, go right on ahead. I need it."

For reference, some of the following things I've done over my time in admissions: give tours, direct tours, plan major admissions events on campus, work at college fairs (locally and a bit of travel), amusingly bad social media projects, interview prospective students, file individual student folders, read student folders (basically all the information you send us), and make recommendations for student applications (admit, defer, deny).

(Pst - AMAA because I think the two things I won't answer are basic identity stuff, like the name or location of my university, etc.)

LET THE GAMES BEGIN! And if anyone knows what the best kind of proof (if reddit demands it) would be to submit, please let me know!

Edit: I'm back from making dinner and have a few hours before I've got to run again. Ask away, and I'll be getting to them as quick as I can!

**Edit 2: I'm off to see TDKR, but I'll be back later tonight and answer as many as I can. And because, hey, we're all redditors and it's the middle of July (slow season), I'll answer some questions tomorrow during work in case there are any left or pop up during the night. See if you a few hours, and NO SPOILERS! :(**

**Edit III:** In case you hadn't noticed, I'm back and ehmahgerd. 149 comments AND front page of IAmA? Hahah, didn't expect it, but keep 'em coming! Also - **if I didn't reply, please please please message me, and I'll be happy to respond!** Also, TDKR is worth the money. *You should see it.*

**Edit IV:** Hey everyone! I'm crashing for the night (I've gotta be up in just a few hours for work), but **I will be back tomorrow ASAP**! Any questions that haven't been answered, I'll get them as soon as I can. After all, like I said earlier, it's a Monday, we're all redditors here, and if there's a month where admissions workers aren't doing much, it's probably July. Thanks for all the incredibly interesting questions! This got way more attention that I thought it would, and I'm happy that I can help with any inquiries. And if I haven't gotten your question yet, no worries! I'm trying to answer all of them, and **keep asking!**

**Edit V:** I'm back! Answering as quickly as I can!

**Edit VI:** I see that there's a LOT of graduate questions now (compared to earlier at least, hahah). I'd like to point out, and I should have made this clearer, that I work in an undergraduate admissions program. Most graduate admissions are based internally, within the department hosting the grad program. Good luck to all those applying to grad school - I'm doing the same, and *I know your pain*."

So, I was approached by a colleague who specializes in supply chain IT issues, who said she received a static IP address for a new scanner she and her intern were trying to install, but she could not ping it.  

Since she also didn't know the IP off the top of her head, I took a walk over to the intern's cube with her.  Where I found the piece of equipment sitting in the box it came in.  Now, at this point, I made the erroneous assumption that **both** someone who worked in IT for 25 years and a third year IT intern must have set the intern's PC to use the static IP and were unable to ping it.

But I was wrong.  They were attempting to ping a network device that was no connected to the network.

Bonus points:  The scanner didn't even have a NIC in it and was USB only.   "

I slowly started programming and reverse engineering on my own time about five years ago and I have learned that I have a true passion for these activities. However, even though I love programming, my true love is for reverse engineering. When I want to grow up, I want to be a reverse engineer.

The problem is that I have no idea how to get myself into that industry. Unlike programming in which programmers are literally everywhere, reverse engineers are rare. I have never met anybody who has interest in low-level code such as assembly, let alone a reverse engineer. I have searched for reverse engineering job applications and internships, but as you can imagine, these applications are rare and have high requirements. I simply do not know how to find an internship or entry-level job that can give me experience with reverse engineering.

Another problem is that I am not sure how to display my reverse engineering abilities. I have had a couple of programming jobs in the past and while I am sure that experience will help me find any type of job, I do not feel like it is enough to show employers that I am a competent reverse engineer. Most of the things I have reverse engineered include games, anti-cheats, a few viruses, a few applications, and a few crackmes. Apart from reverse engineering viruses, I do not believe any of the things that I have reverse engineered can be looked at as professional because my activities can be viewed as immoral or even illegal. Everything I have reverse engineered was primarily to learn and to practice something I enjoy doing, but also because I wanted to hack/crack an application or because I wanted to satisfy my curiosity. If programmers want to have something truly professional on their resume, they can always contribute to open source or start a project that can help people. I was wondering if there was something similar that a reverse engineer could do.

I was wondering if a professional within the industry could give a young reverse engineer some advice. Thanks for reading,

So should I buy a laptop now or later?? I will be a senior in high school next fall, so I will definitely be getting a laptop for college at the latest by next Summer. I am working all this summer at an internship, and will be making around $3000, the majority of which I am looking to invest in a high performance laptop. My parents agreed to pitch in $500, so budget isn't really an issue.  So by the end of August I will have the ability to get a laptop for myself.


What I really want to know is... will it matter if I decide to buy a laptop this year 2012 (September-December), or early early to mid next year 2013(April-June)? Will the hardware/software be that much better that I should wait? I have never had my own computer before and I am really excited to get one.

* Must be a **single game**, cannot be a bundle. :\ Sorry!

That should be it? Hope this works out before the sale ends! &gt;&lt;

""The past is the past. You must now dare to win."" Well, thank you Chinese food. 

I'm faced with a difficult decision. I'm not one to hide in bed and cry, or to give up, but today I'm just kind of...sitting in bed and thinking. 

I have spent a whole metric fuckload of money on college thus far. Less then certain people, and it hasn't gone to waste - I've learned things, had experiences, increased my employablity. I have about 5 years of experience in marketing and project management, extremely solid communication skills. As mentioned in the previous post, I sought to go to Rutgers because it seemed like the best option. 

When you change majors, when there's bumps in the road of life, the road becomes abit longer. 

Between major car repairs, books, etc. and being more or less self sufficent, the income I currently have just isn't working. Internships are great experience, but they haven't brought in enough to keep me afloat; and because of a lack of parental assistance and the derped system that is college financial aid; the school is only giving me about half the amount I would need for tuition alone - not including the cost of being alive. 

That leaves me with alot of big decisions to make.....

* Forever A-loan: I need to pay back part of my current loan before taking out more. I can do this with my next paycheck, and I've also been selling things off - there was a point in time where I wasn't as money conconcious, and I wish I could go back in time and punch myself in the head. But that's over. 

* Forever A-loan, Part 2: If I do get a loan, do I take it? My courseload is lighter, and I could wrangle significantly more hours at some kind of job and pay for living expenses myself, only leaving tuition to be covered. But that leads into a different topic.....

* Climbing up the ladder: I like my current job, but it is an internship that doesn't pay a boatload. Plus, it was desiginated as being only during the summer. Do I ask my current boss to be promoted to full-time? If that isn't feasible, do I leave? Do I look for another office job? I didn't hate retail that much and I'm pretty good at it, so that's an option too. 


Basically, there's alot going on here. I'm slightly nervous. Has anyone taken a year off of school to save up money? Has anyone worked full-time while going to school? Exactly what am I up against here?

Any advice, well-wishes, stories, etc. would be appriciated.

wynnn,1,2012-07-22,[20/F] I think I'm becoming unhappy with my bf [23] of two and a half years - am I overreacting?,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/wynnn/20f_i_think_im_becoming_unhappy_with_my_bf_23_of/,"My emotions are still a little shaky.  I'm considering that it could just be hormones, the time of the year, etc etc.  The thought of breakup has come to my mind more frequently lately, and it both scares me and comforts me.

I'm a fairly attractive female, graduated valedictorian of a class of 3000 seniors, and am attending a prestigious university, have a job, an internship, etc etc - I've got options with guys, they approach me all the time, and I always turn them down.  I know the guy I'm dating is an asshole (typical story, am I right), and yet because he's my first long term relationship, I feel so attached to him, and have put up with verbal and mental abuse for over two years now.

I've always been aware of abuse - whenever we argue, he resorts to calling me names he knows will crush me, telling me about how i'm a failure, and will never go anywhere.  This may seem like a typical fight, but I've never talked to someone who so maliciously wants to beat the other person down.  

If I have a problem with his actions or decisions, and I want to discuss them with him (and I really have to walk on eggshells when I do), he turns it around, calls me selfish and immature, and I end up apologizing.  I know I'm not wrong in these arguments, and that he is to blame, but it's just not worth getting my feelings hurt.  

I certainly am not totally innocent in our relationship - I freak out about stupid shit sometimes, and overreact (especially when I'm PMSing).  Let me give you an example of what happened today:

A couple days ago, I tried to talk to him about how I feel very poorly when he refuses to go to the beach with me every time I ask (especially since he knows the beach is my favorite place to go, and I am rarely able to make it there), and yet when his friend asks he jumps out of his chair and runs out the door to get there as fast as he can.  I tried to explain to him that it is not a problem I have about him hanging out with friends instead of me, but rather that I don't understand why he never wants to go with me - I seem to be only an option, and he obviously doesn't have a problem with the destination, so it must be with me.

So today, he goes to the beach again with his friend.  I have been one to sit at home when he refuses my invitation, but today I decided that I'm not going to let my summer slip by because he doesn't want to do anything with me.  So I texted him and told him I was going to the beach (at a different beach than the one he was going to, so as not to disturb him).  The response: anger, call me a slut and just wanting to pick up guys by going to the beach alone, etc etc.  

As he always does, he calls back an hour later, apologizes, and then offers something stupid as an apology ""Wanna hang out tonight?"" - as always, I accept, and feel terrible on the inside.  As I am on my way to his house, he calls me and tells me he is going to a bar with his friends.  

I suppose I'm just getting sick of being put second when I put him as the primary concern in my life.  

I tried to write the above as unbiased as possible, but of course it will be biased.  Just considering the events of today, do you think I am at least justified in my drifting away from him?  Am I just being selfish..."

I just want to play music. That's what I realized when I talked to my childhood best friend Curious George. :') i use to envy this guy a lot growing up but i simply couIdnt just because he was always so nice to me. i hated it how good he was. but he was like, im not that special, I just believe in Christ. He said Lust was one of his biggest sins, and that it was all worth it to give it up for Him. 

And Honestly, like I thought I was having visiions dude. I thought i was going crazy, or they were good or bad, idk man, might just be from the family. my dad has eplilsphy so idk if its from that. i thought i had died. i wasnt evn on fucking drugs. i was just thinking about life. its just from the breakup.

 And the thing is, no one will fucking believe you. You are so fucking inteliigent. You have suffered 

Well, sorry, man, I have to disagree. agree to disagree.  ILL SEE YA ON THE OTHER SIDE BROTHA! :) Goodbye. 
 
""Professor , 


I won't be able to come in today. I have to meet up with my childhood best friend that is leaving in a few days for a mission trip and I don't know when he will be returning. I really wanted to come to office hours...but sometimes friends and the time spent with them are more important than education and profession. That's what I learned after taking the 3 classes I took this summer. English, Entreprenship, and music/business. I failed every single one of them. (Entreprenship teacher didnt care/ however music/business got super bitchy at me/ very unprofessional), My parents are frustrated with me. But sometimes YOU have to do what you know is right and what will make you happy and what will make you grow. It might upset other people, other peers, because they don't understand where you're coming from or why you are doing what you are doing. They are not you. I have been struggling with my identify for the longest time ( being mixed Filopino/Italian American), I have not quite ever fit in. Plus I have my learning problems( as we discussed earlier). I take education very seriously and learning very seriously, I sometimes just don't take the formal institution seriously ( well I do, I just don't fit in. I just don't work well in it. I am different. I have to accept that. I have TRIED SO HARD MY WHOLE LIFE TO FIT IN, to please my parents, my peers, my religion, but I just don't fit in. I tried to fit into the ideas but I have tried to so hard I just can't take English and pass it. You don't understand how hard it is for me. I might put out that front that I don't care, but I do. I just can't do it. I am an artist. That is my identity. 


I fucked up my future job with PwC because I can't pass college. I have dissapointed my parents and I just want to make them proud. That's all I want to do. I grew up extremely shy and didn't have many friends. I was fine but then we moved from LA, cali to kingwood, tx when I was 8 and had a very hard time making friends. I made a few, but I didnt have a normal childhood. I stayed at home with my bros playing videogames. eventualyl we grew apart for wahtever reason and I just played games by myself. I also grew a love for music when I was 8 cause my mom gave me piano lessons and I got a teacher. My mom couldnt pay for it anymore so we had to stop. my mom was busy with 3 boys and so she couldnt teach me. Since I loved music so much and was so curious by it i learned how to play, and how to improvise. I was prtty bad at it but i kept it up. I stopped in middleschool because i pickced up viola in orchestra. I was bad at it and my peers were significantly better. However, for football the coaches loved me jsut because i was naturally an athetle. but i didnt like it as much as music. i still enjoyed it dont get me wrong it was just w/e. i was god at it. Move to highschool, I was in athletics namely football and track and was extremely good and talented at it  and the coaches loved me. I was rank 200/1000 got a 1210 on the SAT and had a dream to go to a great college. I was a self starter in business( made about 5k...didnt tell anyone though) and I knew mccombs had a great school. I applied with all my heart but didnt get in. I was dissapointed but i didnt let that deter me. I knew that if I went to utsa for a year and worked my ass off I could get in. Well, I got a 4.0, interned for a startup(had to work for free though), joined many clubs and got involved, volunteered over 50 hours which I loved btw, and submitted my application. I got in, and not only that I got into the prestigious BHP. I was so jubilant! and my parents were so proud of me. Anyhow, UT came, and it was so different. much faster paced, and I have trouble fitting in( in a good way) it was so fast paced compared to San Antonio. ----(friend just called me rigth now, i think ill be meeting him up. i was actually really emotional right now, cried some, but he cheered me up even though i didnt say a word, weird how friends do that). Anyhow, I met a girl, eventually started to go out. Got stressed out again because i couldnt time manage, plus i accidently took a bad a drug and that messed me up for a while. i got kicked out of bhp, wrote a 6 page note to repeal to see if i could get in(didnt, because they play favorites and politics, its fucking bullshit) fell into depression, almost dropped out of college it was so bad had my worst semester yet, spring started, life got better, got the internship, interned(was good but it kind of sucked tbh), had a good senior year until the end. 


This video explains the rest: 
https://vimeo.com/46040517 



My Entreprenship (Mercer)teacher was something else. He was inspirational. He is a phenomenal teacher, however, i guess i got too prideful but really i just got too excited because earlier me and 2 friends were trying to work on a music/business startup that was going to change the world( or at least I thought so). One of the friends was my bestfriend that happened come to austin graduating weekend, we met up(damn my friend who is also doing startups(diffeerent startup) just made a post about whenever we went to emos and saw that concert(mstrkrft) jasneet is his name(crazy how i was just thinking about it). RI. anyhow we worked on it for 3-4 weeks got really excited about it. turns out 3 day in my entrprenial class, some other company came public with the same idea. i was heartbroken. i was like shit what do we do. do we try to compete? i was like competing would be too hard, lets just collab. i emailed them, thinking we could team up. they didnt respond. EDC(electric daisy carnival) was coming around, and i was thinking i could just publicize them so much at that they wouldnt have a choice but to collab with us. I could be the promoter. It was actually because of my office conversation with you, that I decided to embark on my journy. I realized some very important things about life, and I just wanted to go for it. looking back it was the most important thing i couldve done and i dont regret a single thing. 





Talk to you soon? Ill be free in the evening, or tomorrow. I want to hear your story. I need to hear your story. 








Friend me on fb, add me on twitter @z0tt1, or call/txt me 2817709947. lets have food soon? Anyhow g2g friend is about to call me. Cant stay bogged down and depressed. gotta go and experience life :)

Oh, btw, I just checked my grade, and saw that I have an X. Is there a mistake? I think I should have received an F. Can you please fix the mistake?  (Not sure if you just forgot, but I rightfully accept the F. I am responsible. It is my fault. And I accept my fate.)

wyekw,25,2012-07-22,Pokington's Eviction Notice,stephyt,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/wyekw/pokingtons_eviction_notice/,"I had a midwife appointment at 1045AM on the 16th. My blood pressure was high so I was sent to the hospital. Honestly I'm  not shocked it was high as I found out my mother-in-law showed up at the office the day we were in the hospital getting our NST/Ultrasound asking for us and basically annoying the office staff. Essentially she threatened to ""get the baby out herself"" should she be picking me up at my appointment so we told her she would not be needed the same day we asked - within hours. My husband had even called her and told her that morning when we had the NST/Ultrasound. Fortunately he didn't tell her where it would be (hospital vs one of the clinics) and though she called him AND me twice ""checking up on things"" (we declined to answer) she STILL showed up at the clinic and tried to say she thought she had to pick me up. Then I find out how irritating she was to the poor office staff who were all ""WTF?"" and couldn't release any of my info to her (thank goodness) - welp... yeah.

I'd already been pissed off at her and I'm sure part of what I had was reactionary and part was because I'd been taking Benadryl for the PUPPPs rash I had.

We stopped at home to get paperwork and take care of the cats and dog. I spoke with the midwife here and we agreed that induction was a good idea. After an hour, I had my husband tell his mom what was up and go home to clean the place with her.

I had my first dose of Cytotec to assist in dilation. I was at 1cm and 50% effaced (thinned) and my cervix was just starting to move anterior which is where it should be for childbirth.

I found out the cramping I'd been having were in fact contactions. I was hooked up to fluids via Iv and was on continuous monitoring. To get up to pee, I had to disconnect myself from the monitors but keep them on my belly, wrapping the cords around my neck loosely. I would have to unplug my IV pole and wheel it in. It was really, really irritating but contractions plus a full bladder would make them worse.

I was asked by another midwife if I wanted to use Cervidil and I agreed. It was placed and it was painful. When it was removed, I screamed. I have a pretty darn high pain threshold but it felt like sandpaper with fishhooks. As it turns out, the midwife intern had heard of people reacting like this to it before. It was inserted without any lubrication and coming out, it was scratching at an area you REALLY don't want scratched. I bled a lot. They then did an exam and I had to breathe through that and hold my husband's hand while staring at his eyes to distract myself from the pain. My cervix had become anterior and softer, so there was a bit of progress.

After this, I was given Cytotec again. I was having pretty painful contractions and had to call my husband in to help me after he had four hours of sleep at home.

Tuesday morning rolled around and I hadn'y slept due to the pain. The midwife on duty agreed that I should have some morphine and explained the risks and was very apologetic about my experience with the Cytotec. 

I slept for a little bit and was allowed to lay on my back with a wedge underneath so I wasn't all the way flat, but my hips no longer hurt from putting all my weight on them.

Honestly I was thankful that they were going so slowly because the little man was tolerating things fine and they didn't want to rush him out if there was no need.

I had more Cytotec Tuesday evening and agreed to Pitocin on Wednesday afternoon. Unfortunately the midwife on duty was a lot more of a ""medwife"" than any in the practice and the nurse on duty was a cunt. There really isn't a better word for it, and you'll see why I didn't use the word bitch or whatever later on. So this nurse, ""C"", keeps upping the Pitocin and says she wants me to be uncomfortable because that means it is working. We ask how long it takes to kick in. She doesn't really answer.

I start having contractions... contractions... more contractions...contractions that don't stop. I am in so much pain and the midwife is acting like it is not a big deal. ""C"" acted thrilled that I was in pain but within a few hours she left, leaving another nurse ""V"" to tend to me. She was REALLY nice and funny. I was given a water heated pad which was heaven and she was working her best magic to try and coax the little man out.

I was examined again by ""medwife"" and there was no real change. We agreed that I'd try Cervidil again only if she used a ton of lube to put it in and I was allowed to remove it myself (that was ""V""'s idea, woo) and I was given Pitocin for a couple hours. I was also told I could have dinner. They ordered for myself and my husband and ten minutes later, while I was crying due to what we thought was back labor and the water heating pad was there, I felt a pop.

Yeah, that pop.
My water broke.

No dinner for me wednesday night.

""Medwife"" kept the Pitocin on and I was having landslide contractions again, worse than before. V kept encouraging the woman to turn it off. She said that I'd be allowed a ""sleeping dose"" of morphine. I was crying, so upset and in pain. I was told my options were to breathe through it or get a c-section.

V went to the OB and the OB agreed to give me an epidural even though I was only 1cm dilated. Pitocin was turned off. The epidural was scary but the man administering it was amazing. I shook a lot right after it was done and again my husband was amazing and helped me focus. 

I was excited about the prospect of sleeping and that my little man might be on his way soon. Unfortunately he wasn't tolerating the Pitocin-induced contractions and was having decels (his heart rate was decreasing) after most of them so I was being moved every 15-20 minutes.

Thursday, I had progressed to 3cm. I had a catheder in and I started feeling contractions in my bladder (OW!) and it was removed for a bit. ""C"" was there and didn't seem to believe that what I was feeling was honest feelings and after the catheter was removed, she shoved her fingers into my vagina without any warning, causing me to yelp in pain. At that point, I did not feel comfortable around her and I made that pretty damn well known. The catheter was reinserted and the epidural was boosted. The midwife who I really liked was assisting and noted that my labia were swollen, probably from the Cytotec and the ""exam"" I had. When the epidural was boosted, I had an episode of the shakes and that was really, really weird. My heart rate went nuts for a bit.

A few hours later, my blood pressure went scary high. It was over 170 on the top and nearly 100 on the bottom. The midwife, my husband and I talked at length. I'd made no progress even with being on Pitocin more and we agreed with my water being broken, my blood pressure being high and being on the fourth day of an induction that it was time.

We planned a c-section.

Midwife explained everything and I was wheeled in. My son was pulled out of me at 2:19PM. He was 7lbs, 12oz, adorable and I was able to give him a kiss before he and my husband went off for other stuff.

I was doing okay, focusing, breathing... and then the epidural started wearing off. I could feel pushing on my organs that progressed to feeling pins and needles and then pain. The anesthesiologist had done a test prior and I could feel from a few inches below my breasts and above. As the midwife told me later, there are nerves that branch out from the area they were working on to that area so that was the reasoning.

I was asked ""stabbing or pressure"" and I couldn't think of anything but A or B, so I said ""stabbing"". The midwife said she was confused because they were using hands. I also had abdominal edema and that was causing issues closing me up. My husband heard me scream when my composure started to fail me and asked to come back in the OR. He sat with me and had me focus on him and breathe and we got through it.  don't remember being wheeled back to my room really. I remember the second anesthesiologist being asked what she gave me and she said she'd upped the epidural and given me two doses of morphine and something else. 

As it turns out, my son was wedged in my pelvic bone and started developing a welt on the side of his head. That's gone down considerably, but there was next to no way I was going to get him out vaginally since I wasn't allowed to move around much due to the constant monitoring.

I couldn't feel anything anymore and after a few minutes, I asked to feed my son. He started rooting immediately.

I blame being high on a bunch of drugs but I allowed my in-laws to come in and visit. Unfortunately they did so for hours and MIL asked if she could invite her pregnant niece who lived across the street. I like her and her husband so we said okay. She managed to get her aunt (my MIL) to leave and that was nice.

I am flying across the country for this interview, and I am terrified that if/when they ask me my GPA, they will immediately reject me. Is there a good way to answer the question? I have a few internships under my belt, as well as a six month long senior project that I did in coordination with a company. My Core GPA is a little higher (around 2.6), but I know my GPA is still horrible.

Does every company ask this question? I mean, I didn't include my GPA on my resume, and from what I've heard, they pretty much assume it's below a 3.0 at that point.They didn't have any GPA listed under their qualifications requirements. There was no pre-screening phone interview or anything like that. All I got was a call asking me to come in for an interview next week. I don't want to make any excuses or tell a sob story, but honestly, I KNOW I will be an excellent worker. I struggled in school because I didn't see the practicality in most of the things that we had to learn. I obviously don't want to say that, because it undermines the degree I'm holding.

When they order dinner (since I'm pretty sure I'll be staying past 6 most nights, if my office visit was any indication), do you usually get to pick what you order (like could I submit a special order for brown rice and steamed veg? could I get something delivered from a healthy restaurant instead of whatever place they pick?) or do they just bring in catering trays of pad thai and pasta and burgers?

I know this is pretty inconsequential but I get really stressed when I don't eat well and I feel like if I go in prepared I can maybe fight against it a little.

One thing i was thinking about earlier is how gender quotas might increase the 'wage gap' in certain fields where women aren't applying to jobs (and/or college programs) in those fields as much.

Lets take stem fields: say Microsoft decides its been getting too much flack for their gender numbers and puts out a policy telling all HR managers that they have to hire equal numbers of men and women for tech related positions.

So now we have the hr recruiter going to a college job fair. say, 5 women graduating in comp sci apply, and 20 men do. (i don't know what the numbers of tech program enrollments are, so this is just a example situation)

That hr manager can now only hire as many men as women, so only 5 of each can get hired. This means that only the top 25% of men applicants get hired (they would all be equally rated in terms of degrees, but there are other things to consider such as certifications, intern work, gpa, etc ).

One year down the line: the effect of only hiring the top 25 percent of males, but all qualified females has lead to more males getting promoted. (although to be fair, if this happens, some of it would also be from a unfair bias view on women as having only gotten in due to gender quotas.)"

wy66o,2,2012-07-21,How should I learn Computer Science/Programming?,summereddit,IWantToLearn,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantToLearn/comments/wy66o/how_should_i_learn_computer_scienceprogramming/,"I'm interested in learning more about computers and programs. I understand that this question has been asked before, but it's a pretty broad topic so I'm looking to get some advice, given my specific aspirations and interests.

I've had a little programming experience but I'm looking to expand upon it. I learned BASIC and C-based language in grade school, and then had a little more C-programming in a college-level intro to robotics class a couple years ago. Recently I've been talking with some CS majors and realize that I kind of wished that I took the opportunity to take more programming classes when I could have.

I'm interested in machine learning and seeing how a computer takes a big input from a database and recognizes patterns and can predict things based on it. I'm also interested in artificial intelligence and how computers can seemingly learn things simply based on its environment (I'm thinking kind of with robotics, but also other more generic applications of AI. It's all pretty awesome). My goals are: first, being able to experiment with these things as a hobby. Write some code, test things out, see how it learns (and make a computer do awesome stuff; let's be honest, this stuff is cool); secondly, I'd like to learn enough to be able to get a CS-based job in the future. Although my undergrad degree isn't in CS, I was in engineering and I'm guessing that if I can show people that I know computer science (through experience, I'm thinking working on open source software and maybe getting an internship? There always seems to be a demand for people who know CS...), I will be able to go to grad school for CS or maybe even get a CS job without that. 

My question for /r/IWTL is how should I go about doing that?
I'm thinking that I will teach myself either Java or Python (suggestions appreciated) and watch some lectures to introductory CS classes from free online resources (MIT OCW? Saylor.org maybe?). Then move on to algorithms, maybe a software engineering class, and then find some classes on AI &amp; machine learning. Is this the right order of classes to take? Is there anything else I should add? Am I totally off-base? Let me know!

Thanks for all the help!"

I wanted to get some advice on what I should do this year. I'm currently working at a Top 100 public accounting firm doing pension plan and not-for-profit audits. I graduate with 121 credits in December, and have an offer signed for a Big 4 internship Summer 2013. 

My question is...what do I do in the Spring? I don't think I want to go into a Masters in Accounting in the Spring and Fall 2013. Don't really feel like loading up with 30k in debt at a private institution. I think I want to just take 20+ community college credits and then another 9 in the summer during my Big 4 internship. What have some other redditors done in this situation? I think getting the 150 credits as fast as possible is the #1 thing for Big 4 and I do think eventually I'll take night classes towards an MSA. 

Second question - What do I do now in terms of the Big 4 people and recruiting events. I met a lot of people at an externship and got all of their business cards and thanked them all via e-mail and got many replies. I thought about e-mailing my recruiting director at the Big 4 firm asking for wisdom of what to do in the Spring. Do you guys think that might show initiative, etc

I expected to mostly work with handlers and PA's as I have this image of Celebs sitting around smoking cigars lit with gold plated matchsticks talking about this party and that gala but was shocked by the fact that she shares her office with her production crew and spends a great portion of her day answering fan mail (personally I might add), writing posts for geek nation and helping the editor edit other peoples posts. She is an amazing lady that works extremely hard and puts on no airs at all. I think it is cool that all of her posts, tweets correspondence and Facebook updates are written by her not a PA or some intern. 

Full disclosure, I have never seen an episode of Buffy so maybe I should have been more awestruck but I am a fan of hard work and being a genuinely good person so I am totally a fan now. I really got a kick out of watching her get excited about her website traffic growing so if you want to stop by www.GeekNation.com and share a few posts or register and leave a few comments feel free to do so knowing that she will see them personally and not hear about it second hand. I think it would be cool to have her come into work on Monday and find out that Reddit made her site blow up.

How can I help her?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/wy1dg/my_sister_is_experiencing_the_worst_summer_of_her/,"My older sister is 24 years old. She and I are incredibly close. We had an emotionally abusive childhood thanks to our lovely father. You know those people with literally zero redeeming qualities? That's him. Because of this we were pretty fucked up for a while as teenagers. My sister had it the worst, and as a result was depressed for most of her teen-early adult life. However, once cutting herself off from him, she became a far more happy and healthier person (we all did). The past few years have been pretty good to her. She met and fell in love with one of the most amazing men I've ever known. They became engaged last year. Soon after their engagement, my sister and our mother had a huge falling out. This all occurred over a single night that was supposed to be her and her fiance's engagement dinner. A celebration. It became anything but. Mind you, we do not have a lot of family, so the loss of this relationship has left a huge hole for each of them. Also, my sister has worked incredibly hard since graduating from college. It's so hard for me to see her work her ass off constantly, and yet she still lives each day knowing that she is never going to be able to finance the simple wedding she wants with the man who would give her the world if he could (he is currently still in school, thus leaving her to be the bread winner). This brings us to this summer. Her fiance is in New York for an amazing (but unpaid) internship. He isn't happy there without her. She isn't happy here without him. About a month and a half ago her closest friend passed away. It was sudden and unexpected and awful. She called me the night before I was to leave on a trip with one of my friends. As soon as I heard her voice I knew I had to leave to be with her. We left early the next morning to drive to NY, where her best friend was from. She and this girl had been inseperable since they could walk. Our families grew up together. It was one of the most surreal things I've ever been through, and it was heartbreaking for her. She has since been back at home in her apartment with her dog and cat. She works during the day, comes home, cuddles with them, and that's the day. We speak almost everyday and I fear she is slowly becoming a shell. She is dealing with the losses of the people and relationships of those closest to her. I know it's a healthy thing for her to be dealing with this, but I don't want her to feel lost again like she did for those years as a teenager. 

I'm sorry this was all so long, I just wanted to cover all of the bases. The only thing I know right now is to be there for her, but I don't want her to shut off. She's worked so hard to be where she is, and still she isn't happy. I'm supposed to be her maid-of-honor for the most important day in her life. A day she doesn't even want to think about because it's just a reminder of the things she can't have.

If you've made it this far, thank you for putting up with my venting. If you have any words of advice, I would be incredibly grateful.

TLDR; My sister has lost two important relationships, fiance is gone all summer, and can't afford a wedding- how can I cheer her up?

She said she's definitely interested in a threesome, we just haven't found the right person since she lost interest in the first person we had lined up. Now, due to the strain this distance has put on the relationship she wants to wait until we're better off.

That doesn't help with the fact that I'm unhappy with sex only once a month (or only a couple times this summer) and I'm a little nervous of the possibility of not being able to explore a little. At the same time, I'm really reluctant to break up with her just to fuck around a bit, because we truly do have something special.

Anyone have some thoughts on this?"
x1iw6,1,2012-07-23,"I haven't had sex in a year, and I'm not happy about it.",throwaway8275927,sex,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/x1iw6/i_havent_had_sex_in_a_year_and_im_not_happy_about/,"I don't know where to post this, but I really like the community that is /r/sex and I don't know if I'm looking for advice, but I want to at least complain.

I'm a 23 year old male, and as of yesterday, I haven't had sex in a year. I was raised in a church setting where sex was bad, so I never really pursued sex until I was 19 and living away at college and my beliefs tended to being more atheistic. To add to that, I'm pretty introverted and socially awkward, and I don't consider women a strong suit of mine. I dated a few women, but they would always end the second or third date by telling me how nice I am and how they don't see themselves dating me. 

I met a girl when I was 22 through OkCupid and we developed a relationship. The nature of the relationship was always long distance because we lived an hour apart from each other, but we saw each other most weekends. We eventually got comfortable enough with each other that we had sex four or five times. We were both virgins, she was my first girlfriend, and I was her first boyfriend that lasted more than a month. 

She went to study abroad for two semesters after we had been dating for seven months. We decided to stay together through the distance. When she was gone, we talked a bit about sex. I compiled a list of things that I wanted to do with her and she responded positively. There was never any cyber sex stuff, though. Due to the poor internet connection, we were rarely able to Skype, and when we could Skype, it never turned sexual because neither of us wanted to be nude in front of a camera.

Then she came back to the United States after eight months and our first weekend together we barely even kissed. We tried to sleep together one night (not sex, but actual sleeping) and the other night she slept on my couch instead of in my bed. Then about a week later, she suggested we break up because she took an internship in a city about five hours away from where I live. She said she wanted to break up because she couldn't give me what I wanted and what I deserved and she said I should have other experiences and not wait for her. I was expecting to have at least a summer of being with her and exploring her, and myself, and how sex works. I wanted to finally be intimate, both physically and emotionally with someone, and I felt like she was as close to perfect as possible.

I feel like having sex is such a big part of the human experience, especially because it's necessary for reproduction and all animals have been doing it for tens of millions of years. I feel like I'm missing out on physical and emotional intimacy. I want to love and be loved or at least be able to have fun and use my body, but there's perpetual rejection around every corner.

tl;dr after eight month of studying abroad, my first girlfriend breaks up with me. my expectations of finally being able to experience regular sex fail. i feel like i'm missing out on a huge part of being a human, and i'm really frustrated"
x1ig2,2,2012-07-23,"Long Story, Not sure what to do?",poopcookies,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/x1ig2/long_story_not_sure_what_to_do/,"So there's this girl, let's call her Kelly. I met her through my cousin in 7th grade and she lives about 2 hours away from me. We started talking and we became friends and talked on the phone and on the internet A LOT.  We stayed friends through most of high school, but around 11th grade we kind of grew apart. Nothing bad, we just kind of got busy and stopped talking to each other. By my sophomore year in college, we began talking again, but this time it seemed to be more than just friends. When I moved to NYC for a summer internship, I was living only 30 minutes away from so we used to meet up to get dinner and some drinks. We would just spend hours walking through the city together just enjoying each others company. 


Fast forward a couple of months, she told me that she liked some guy. I was pretty hurt but I kind of shrugged it off because I figured it wasn't a big deal. A few weeks after that she started dating him, but we still remained pretty close. She would call me almost every night and want to talk until the wee hours of the morning. I thought this was kind of weird, since if it was me, i'd be mad if my girlfriend called another dude late at night just to talk, but I just ignored it. This kept on for a couple of months, untl one night I was drunk and just told her that she was being a complete bitch. I told her that what she was doing was fucked up, and that I didn't want to talk to her anymore because I felt she was using me. She was dating someone else, but keeping me on the side for her own reasons (one's I still do not understand). 

After I flipped out on her, we stopped talking for probably 6 or 7 months. Then one day I see on facebook that she broke up with that dude. I didn't think anything about it, I definitely missed her, but I was over her by this point and was enjoying life and meeting different girls.

One day I'm just hanging out with my friends getting good and drunk when I get a text message from her. It said nothing  but ""Hey."" Drunk me decides to respond, and now she's been texting/callling me for the past 2 weeks. She has yet to mention anything about her ex bf or us not talking for the last 6 months. I'm not sure what she wants, and even though I've tried to move the conversation in the direction of getting some answers to her motives, it seems to get brushed off.

So /r/relationship_advice, I humbly come to you. What the hell do I do? I still have feelings for her and I think we would be great together, but I have no way of figuring out what's going on in her head. She doesn't seem to want to talk about anything involving either of our feelings. I honestly believe she doesn't think of me as any more than a friend, but her actions say otherwise. 

There's alot more to our relationship than what I've written (yeah sorry for wall of text) so I can clarify anything for you guys if needed.

**TL;DR Girl I've known for a long time is confusing the hell out of me.**"
x1e0g,6,2012-07-23,Can I make this function better ?,cyberbemon,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/x1e0g/can_i_make_this_function_better/,"I'm currently doing my internship, today I had a code review, one thing I was told during this was there are too many for loops and if statements. The code is written in python and for the task I thought what I did was good, I'm fairly new to python, but I picked it up faster than other languages and I'm very comfortable with it. My task was to test installation of a particular program(SCons), in order to do that I have to compile few .cpp files using this program.


There are about 6 .cpp files, the first test uses the default compiler in the system, the second set uses visual studio.

Here is how I approached this problem

* I made 4 lists that contain 1) files for default compiler, 2)files for Visual Studio, 3)names of .exe file from default compiler, 4) names of files from VS

* I have 2 functions, one for the default compiler and one for VS
* I use a for loop to Iterate through the list and compile each file 
* once that's done I look for the path where the compiled exes are saved, I can't hard code this because the folder names depends on few settings, so they are different each time!
* So I look for two keywords one at the start and the other at the end (it ends with an exe file ), based on the info I get from using 'tree=all' 
* then I iterate over each line and use if statement so look for the keywords, then add them to a separate list and run it at  the end.

So here is that in code 

**List 1**
[file1,file2,file3]

**List2**
[file4,file5,file6]

**exelist**
[exe1,exe2,exe3]

**exelist2**
[exe4,exe5,exe6]


**keywords**
dir_key = ""/out""


    def fun1():
         for f in list1:
		try:
			treeinfo = 
    subprocess.check_output(['C:\Python27\Scripts\scons.bat','-f' ,f,'--tree=all']).splitlines()	
			for afile in exelist:
				for line in treeinfo:
					if dir_key in line and afile in line: #Parsing scons output looking for 'out' AND and 'exe' file
						exe= line.split('-',1)[1]
						print ""Compiled file %s "" %afile
						print exe

						try:
							with open(exe) as f:
								exe_paths.append(exe)
						except (IOError)as e:
							print""File %s doesn't exist""%afile
					else:
						pass		
			print ""\n""
		except(subprocess.CalledProcessError,OSError) as e:
			print ""ERROR %s\n"" %f
			

Any Input on how to make this better ?

i graduated high school in 2003 and took a few years off from college, realizing i needed to escape my deadend town i went back to school starting at a community college and eventually working my way to a 4 year school where i majored in mechanical engineering. its been a long road but i am finally going into my senior year.

the university offers an accelerated masters degree program that will only take an extra year to those who have a gpa over a 3.0. i am qualified to do this but unsure of whether or not it is worth it. my original plan was just to get my bachelors and start working but one extra year to get a masters seems very tempting

pros: 1.) masters in one extra year 2.) dont need to take GRE or write essays to get into program 3.) further my education

cons: 1.) i am already 27 and not out in the work force yet **2.) financial aid is already giving me trouble and i am afraid i will not be able to pay for it

the main reasons i am second guessing myself as to whether or not i should go for it are the two things listed above as cons, the main one being financial. i dont come from a lot of money and grew up in basically the middle of nowhere. this has made it impossible to find an internship and very hard to find work lately. I am tired of being poor and struggling to find little shit jobs that are meant for 18 year olds.

so my question is; how much of a benefit would it be for me to obtain the master's degree over a bachelors degree in the field of mechanical engineering?

x1819,676,2012-07-23,Guide to having a hot girlfriend,weddingthrasher,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/x1819/guide_to_having_a_hot_girlfriend/,"Having a hot girlfriend is different than having a not-so-hot girlfriend.  If you're like me, you have been out picking up women for a while, but found someone that's just so awesome, cool, and attractive that you decide to make her your girlfriend.  This guide is about what to do AFTER you get the hot girl to agree to be your girlfriend.  I haven't seen a lot of guides on how to handle this situation, so here's my stab at how to keep her attracted and keep the relationship flowing smoothly.  It includes some observations I've made, but feel free to add your own:

* Don't be needy.  Ever.  Even for a second.  Hot girls can sense neediness and they respond negatively to it.  This is especially true when you're in a relationship with one.  Don't beg to spend time with her, don't fish for compliments, and don't call/text too much.  Give her space; this shows her you are secure in your relationship, and she will respect you for that.  If she decides to travel or go out with friends without you, let her do that, and go do your own thing for a while.  If you aren't with her and you feel yourself getting needy, leave your phone at home and go do something without it for a few hours, even if it's just going for a run or going to get a beer by yourself.

* Continue to demonstrate abundance and value.  Have lots of friends that you spend time with.  Provide value in every situation.  Make memories that you can share. 

* Don't let her be your purpose.  She's there because you're a complete and centered person, that's what attracted her to you in the first place.  Don't let this slide.  Have hobbies, business pursuits, passion for something besides her.  This will allow you to keep her respect.

* Other women will hit on you when you are with her.  Often, this will occur when a woman comes up to you and says 'your girlfriend/date/friend is really pretty,' or something similar.  To be clear (and it took my girlfriend to point this out), this is not them hitting on your girlfriend, *this is them hitting on you*, albeit indirectly.  Women, especially ones less attractive than your girlfriend, get insecure, and they will try to put chinks in your relationship armor.  Don't let them do this.  Deflect and ignore, but be cordial and maybe set them up with your single friends if they're around.  Having a hot girl with you conveys loads of value and women respond to this, it's their nature.

* Men will hit on her when you are with her.  You need to step up to this.  Most of the time, the dudes that hit on your girlfriend will be total chodes and it's likely that your girlfriend has been dealing with these types for years.  She knows how to handle / deflect them, but if they get annoying or clingy or creepy, you need to step in and make some kind of move, physical or verbal, to indicate she's with you.  Be the alpha and befriend, ignore, or tool on the guy (tool on him only after you've tried the first two).  However, be on the lookout for a signal from her (especially panicky eyes that are scanning the room or looking straight at you - it looks reactive).  If you see a signal like this, step in right away.  One time, I saw this happening and literally pushed another girl we were with between some dude and my girlfriend (in a playful way).  The dude backed off instantly and my girlfriend came up to me and I got a very appreciative makeout.

* A hot girlfriend will test your testicular fortitude on a frequent basis.  For me, this usually comes in one of two ways.  First, she will make some snarky or bitchy comment to undercut you in a small way.  Not a mean comment, but something borderline funny/snarky/bitchy to see how you respond.  You can do one of three things that seem to work to keep her respect and keep her knowing you are in charge and centered: a) ignore and don't respond - change the thread entirely, b) reward her in some fashion - a kiss, a squeeze of the hand, a smile.  Choice (b) may seem ridiculous and counterintuitive, but it works, I promise.  Getting rewarded for being bitchy short circuits her brain: she doesn't get a negative reaction from you (in fact it gets a positive one), so she realizes you aren't affected or made insecure by her comment, so she backs off and doesn't do it again.

She can also test you by trying to get lots of things from you.  You have to draw a line in order to show you are not a pushover.  Be nice and do things for her (she's your girlfriend and you - presumably - care about and respect her), but don't be too nice.  It's a fine line to walk.  Let me give you an example.  My girlfriend wanted a ride home from a work event, and doesn't have a car.  I agreed to pick her up.  She later asked if I would take her two interns to their respective houses, kinda far from where I live.  I straight up said no to this, but agreed that I could give them all a ride to a bar after and we could all hang out.  Nice, but not too nice.

* Show her off and be proud to be with her.  Most guys never get girls like this.  Take her out dancing, to bars, have her meet your friends.  This lets her know she's important to you and keeps her in the social loop.  She likes being out and about, I promise.  

* You don't need to buy her stuff.  Buy a drink or two when you're out, but you should be equal partners in who pays for things.  If the expectation becomes that you pay for dinner, then you become the guy who just has the hot girl because he has money to spend on her.  If you travel together, you get the flights, she gets the hotels, etc.   Give gifts sometimes, but make them meaningful and spontaneous.  If you are a pushover and pay for everything, she will lose respect.  

* Tap. That. Ass.  Seriously, she loves sex and you should be doing it frequently, improving your skills at it, and figuring out how you can have better sex together.  Dominate sometimes and do what you like doing, but be sure to keep her satisfied.  No one ever broke up because the sex was just too good.

* Overall, keep it spontaneous and fun, but with a punch of drama once in a while.  Women don't just like the super happiness bit all the time.  Once in a while, a little drama doesn't hurt.  Doesn't have to be anything serious, just something where you come off looking awesome.  For example: we were grabbing the last train home the other night, she was able to get on and I, (two seconds behind her) got the door shut in my face.  I literally screamed at the conductor to let me on, and he did, I got on the train with my hands in the air like Rocky and I made out with her in front of everyone.  The entire train was cheering (this was a 1:30 train home from the bars).  Be her champion.

* If she fishes for compliments, don't take the bait.  She gets enough positive reinforcement (especially about her looks) elsewhere.  But, offer up spontaneous and serious compliments that you truly mean.  If she acts a way you like, tell her.  If she's being bratty, treat her like you would treat a bratty little sister.

* Improve yourself and encourage her to improve, she will respect and love you for it.  There's always a harder workout to do, a run you can go on together, a new skill to learn, a new activity to try.  

I'm sure this guide is incomplete, and my only disclaimer is that some of these things only work for VERY hot women.  Minimum of a 9 for some of this stuff.  Otherwise you're just going to end up hurting her emotionally.  Some women who are very attractive have never heard a negative thing in their life, and rarely get told 'no.'  You're going to be the guy that doesn't put her on a pedestal.  Do this, and she'll stay attracted to you for the duration of your relationship.

EDIT: BadGirlThrowAway brought up a solid point, and I want to clarify.  Don't confuse neediness with being emotionally open.  These are two different things.  Being emotionally honest in a relationship is vitally important.  Neediness ruins relationships, emotional honesty sustains them.  "

I learned how to program the month before college so I could pass placement exams, so I don't have the experience that many of my peers do. I am immensely interested in the subject and have surpassed most of my peers who are only casually interested, but there remain those intimidating few who have a very large knowledge base. I know that knowledge isn't nearly as important as creativity, but when it comes around to applying for top-notch internships for next summer, I feel slightly insecure with my relatively limited resume of knowledge. Also, when I sometimes see someone mention an interview question unfamiliar to me, I immediately research it and understand, but I'm not sure I'd be able to hold my own in an interview.

All this to say, I want to know how to best spend my time over the next 6 or so months before I apply for internships and have these interviews. I plan to create personal projects in the languages I do know, and r/programming and related subreddits have really expanded my knowledge. However, I don't know the best ways to learn Linux, web programming, and the intricacies of operating systems (specific system calls and all) within such a brief time.

I hope all of this came off sounding the way I intended, but the interview processes of Google, Microsoft, etc. really seem intimidating from my perspective right now, and I want to figure out how to best prepare.

Thanks."
x13ge,3,2012-07-23,Dealing with lingering sadness and depression that I can't seem to kick. Any tips?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/x13ge/dealing_with_lingering_sadness_and_depression/,"I've been dealing with a bout of depression lately. Growing up I was made fun of sometimes for my height, and it wasn't until I was about to graduate from college that I finally went through the end of puberty (grew taller and lost baby fat). I also did not have any luck with girls, and so for years I thought I was ugly. 

After college I landed an internship in Asia for a year and went there. There, I started to pay more attention to how I dressed and took care of my appearance. I started to get more attention from girls, and even had some pursue me although i was not interested. But I still had a hard time believing that they could find me attractive, even though girls always gave me compliments and would openly flirt with me. 

Then towards the end of my job I met a friend of a friend who was an exchange student at a nearby university. I fell for her that first night, and after 3 weeks of knowing her we were inseparable. it felt like we were a married couple. But I thought that maybe she didn't know I felt about her in a romantic way, so I made it known through physical contact, etc. She reciprocated, but I still wasn't sure so I built up the courage to tell her directly how i felt. 

She told me that she liked me too, but that the distance (of our home countries) and the age gap would make it hard for long distance to work out. She said that we should just enjoy the time we have together. The way I took it was that she didn't really like me, but that she wanted to let me down gently. But when we hung out after that we would still act the same way so I took the leap and believed her even though every thought in my mind was the opposite of that. 

Eventually she got busy with her schoolwork so we hung out less and less. I was sad, but I preoccupied myself to take my mind off of it. But lately I noticed that she had been hanging out with another guy from her class, and it is clear that he likes her. She always hangs out with him like we did, and she never responds to my messages or calls asking if she wants to hang out. I've been busy as well so I only contact her like once every few days or so, but she won't respond until a week later or something. It drives me crazy that I was so close with this amazing girl and now theres nothing left of it. I feel like she doesn't even care about maintaining contact with me even though we used to be so close. It's been about 3 months now since then and I still feel bitter about it. It's shattered what little confidence I gained here and I just feel so depressed. Sometimes I think about ways in which i'd die and how much easier that would be...I just feel like I'm not successful, good looking, or will ever amount to anything due to my past experiences (not just with girls). Anyone here with any tips or advice or a story to help me get over this? 

TLDR; been depressed and having confidence issues lately, feel like it would be much easier if i were dead"

I've been looking to build a PC to complement my Late 2011 i7 Macbook Air. It's an awesome machine, just too slow for some applications. I'll be using it mostly for software development and hopefully in the near-future some bioinformatics, computational neuroscience stuff (I'll be starting my MSc. in September). 

The Intel Xeon E5-2620 was chosen because it's the cheapest (reasonable) 6-core Intel, and although a lot slower (and without OC capabilities) than its i7 counterpart it does come with the perk of ECC. 

I'm Dutch so some of the parts are more commonly held in stores than in the US I've noticed. 

What do you guys think?"
x0xu2,4,2012-07-23,"My roommate has become an unbearable shithead, I dont know how to deal with it any more. ",Hu_dat,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/x0xu2/my_roommate_has_become_an_unbearable_shithead_i/,"I've lived with this guy for about a year now. He's always been messy and has contributed a decent amount to the awful state that our house has been in. He eats out all the time or eats food from disposable containers and leaves the trash everywhere. He chews tobacco and leaves the spitters everywhere. He leaves his shoes everywhere. We have other roommates who are shorter tempered than I who have blown up at him in a less couth manner and he always ends up rationalizing it because he's being yelled at. We've made house efforts to clean the house but he usually sits on the couch and when asked to help tells us that we're the ones that want it clean. He doesnt go to class and lies to his parents about having a job because they would have made him move home for the summer otherwise. He doesnt really have much money as a result, but still scrapes together a few dollars in quarters when he wants to drink. 

Now, the situation at hand: we have two new roommates moving in and they hired a cleaning service to tidy things up. I've made an effort to clean substantially before, but it always gets muddied up by the aforementioned roommate. I've been telling him to pick up his stuff ever since then because I want to help keep things clean, but I dont feel its my place to pick up after my roommate. I tell him to pick up his shoes, or trash and he either tells me to ask nicer (asking nicely doesnt usually work) or tells me he will do it later and doesnt. For what its worth, asking in a not nice manner for me is usually limited to not including please in whatever I'm asking of someone. Now yesterday he left out a half eaten burrito all day as well as drank several cans of pepsi which he left about as well. I asked him to pick it up early in the day and he said he would later. Fast forward a few hours to about midnight and I point out the fact that his stuff was strewn about in front of our friends. He then went off on the fact that I have left dirty dishes in the sink recently. I explained that I dont rinse them off immediately because I was always taught that putting pans and dishes immediatly in the sink after use causes them to warp or crack and havnt been able to get around to washing them lately because I've been going to class every day of the week, have an internship, have been helping my new roommates move in, and studying for the LSAT. I have had a significantly busy schedule while he sits on the couch all day. I dont think my inability to wash the dishes is justification for him not wanting to clean. Our friends agreed as well as our roommates and I was yelled at when they supported my perspective. He ran upstairs and slammed the door and proceeded to yell at us when we came to clarify the issue. I just dont know how to go about this anymore. I admitted that the dishes were my fault but that I felt I had a decent reasoning for it. Any advice on how to proceed would be greatly appreciated. 

tldr; roommate wont clean up after himself, got mad when i pointed it out and used the dirty dishes I've left as justification for his actions. "

x0tpe,2110,2012-07-23,"Our summer intern is extremely lazy and spends far too much time browsing the internet and reddit and generally not working. He thinks we don't notice, but we do. How should we confront him?",iaacp,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/x0tpe/our_summer_intern_is_extremely_lazy_and_spends/,"So for the summer, we've had an intern. He started around June. He's a pretty cool guy, and he gets along well with the office. The first few weeks, he was fine. We gave him simple tasks to ease him in, which he picked up on. Over time, we gave him more and more, but nothing too hard or too high a work load.

Now, for the past month or so, he's been completely slacking off. I noticed the work flow coming from him has slowed dramatically, and he seemed a bit more lazy in general. So, I asked my friends in the IT department to give me a report on his internet usage. Surprise surprise. Browsing the internet, plenty of reddit, even some youtube here and there. All times of the day, at a high volume. When we last talked, I brought up that work had slowed, and asked why. His response was that he felt his work had gotten more difficult - which is BS, because he's very qualified for what I've assigned to him.

I'm not a tough boss, and I've never had to confront a worker before - our office has always had really great employees. So, how should I go about this? Give him a stern talking? A friendly one? A joking message through reddit that says ""Get to work!"" anonymously? He's a good kid, he's just been lazy lately.

**Edit:** OP has not abandoned you all, don't worry. As for all the comments about interns shitting yourselves - good. It might be you I call into my office later today or tomorrow. Straighten up, and get to work. The more I from interns here, the more I want to prank him!

Yes, I plan on talking to him either this evening or tomorrow morning. Yes, I will update. Some have asked how much he makes, and if it's for free: definitely not free labor - THEN I would probably understand. He makes around $18/hour if I recall correctly.

**Edit 2**: [The hour of reckoning is near.](http://www.vh1.com/celebrity/bwe/images/2011/03/prairie_dog.gif)

**Edit 3:** Edited the poor bastard's name out because the sound of so many interns shitting their pants in this thread is too beautiful. Unfortunately, there won't be time to call him in today - a meeting came up and I have other stuff to do by the end of the day. He'll be called in first thing tomorrow morning, and I **will** update you beautiful sons of bitches. Going to try and keep it light hearted, but at the same time keep firm that he *does* need to get more work done and that his browsing needs to decrease drastically. We are okay with some browsing, just not the amount he does. 

One last gem: called friend in IT, had him check again since he did earlier today. Looks like he  cleared his browsing cache and cookies, probably upon seeing this thread. Stay tuned...

**Edit 4:** Guys, we aren't hiring right now. I'm sorry :( Please don't PM me, I can't get you a job. If I could, I would - but you'd probably go on reddit as much as this guy. And then I'd have to come to /r/askreddit on how to deal with the situation. And then I'd get more PM's asking to be hired.

**Edit 5:** Really, we aren't hiring. I promise I can't get you a job.

**Update after our talk:** So, I met with him in our small conference room this morning. He seemed really nervous. Asked how he was doing, how work was going, etc. Asked if he had anything to air out, if he was happy with his work, interested in it, etc, etc. He gave me mostly small answers like 'yes' and 'no', while remaining a little nervous. So I asked the ""okay, well do you know why I asked you here?"" while remaining friendly, not stiff (heh) or anything. He had this shit eating grin on his face and said ""uhh, you don't go on reddit, do you?"" to which I also had a shit eating grin on my face. We laughed, and I said how browsing the internet is fine, and I don't want to have to monitor him, but we *need* more work coming from him.

So then I asked if he has trouble focusing, or is bored with work or whatever. It mostly came down his lack of focus, which I can completely relate to (I was very recently diagnosed with ADHD as an adult, and we are close in age). We talked about things that would help him stay on track. I recommended getting up out of his cubicle every hour for 5 minutes, or walking around on our floor, and drinking plenty of water. Maybe take 5-10 minutes at lunch and go for a walk. He responded well to all of my suggestions, and I feel like the talk went great. 

Then I had to inform him where we go from here: like someone suggested here, I told him we're not here to baby sit, but to help him grow and learn as a programmer. We need to make sure his time is being used appropriately. If I notice another decrease in work, that's when the the punishments are going to have to get serious and I'm going to have to inform *my* boss about all of this, which will likely result in early termination. You know, to let him know we're cool, but we are still professional and work has to be done. I also told him if he feels like he's drifting again, or needs more assistance, to contact me before he goes back into this loop.

As we parted, I said to take 10 mins to browse reddit or whatever, and then continue on his assignment. Little did he know I had my IT friend redirect reddit to his own ""GET BACK TO WORK"" page, just for a short while.

I believe the problem is fixed. Thanks to all who gave input on the situation, to all interns who shat their pants upon reading this, to the few that sent me some seriously awesome FBI-level interrogation techniques, and to the many of you that inquired about jobs. No, I still can't get you one. I'm sorry.

**tldr: Thousands of interns produce brown fruit that flows into their sabatons upon reading this thread. Our guy was one of them. We're cool now. I'll leave it up to him if he wants to out himself here.**

While idling sitting in the back of the room as every intern does, the meeting started to heat up and some of the sales team were getting quite animated about their commission not being appropriately distributed.

And it hit me, their commission isn't being properly distributed because of an internal database error on our program we use to log sales. Everybody knows that the territories are mixed up and do nothing about it other than vehemently complaining.

After 45 minutes or so of this complaining, I had mustered up enough courage to speak up about their problem. My solution verbatim : "" Could I interrupt for moment please? I was just wondering if (company name) had ever thought of hiring a computer programmer/ scientist to simply write some code and fix this problem"". ""I mean I took basic computer science programming in college, and this code would not be entirely far fetched, plus it would save hundreds of hours.""

The room quiets down....

And then erupts into laughter. FUCK THIS. These old school internal sales people fucking laugh at my suggestion to fix their fucking problems. I can't even begin to tell you my pure frustration, I wish I had a massive barbell that I could just smash windows with here.

I send emails to candidates that we have contacted in the past(2 of my colleagues have connected with him in the past 3 years), to reconnect and see if they're interested in finding a new job, or not.  It's pretty simple, if they're interested, I send them a job description and forward their resume to a Sr. Recruiter.  If not, they normally just don't reply. 

But, last friday, I received a response email that kinda made me tick.  As always, I take my time writing emails, and I make sure they are carefully worded not to offend anyone, or present false information.

Subject: Reconnecting - New Job Opportunity

*Kevin,* 

*I am writing to you today in hopes of reconnecting and introducing you to a new opportunity that may interest you.  Your experience as a project manager and business analyst is very relevant, and I was wondering if you are interested in a position to work as a PM/BA at a major consulting services firm located in Secaucus, NJ. 
Also, it has been a several years since we last connected, so if you could please send a current resume, we will more accurately match you to your desired position. 
Please contact me at your earliest convenience to discuss this, and future opportunities.*

*I hope to hear from you soon.
Regards,
ME*



So, I have drafted a response, but I wanted to know if you think I should respond to him with all the reasons he's wrong, or just forget about it?  **Below is the draft i want to send to him:**



*Kevin,*

*First of all, nowhere in my email did I say or imply ""we did business"".  All I said is that we were connected at one point, inferring that myself or one of my colleagues contacted you in the past.  In this case, my co-worker M. contacted you last year, and another colleague, P. received your resume through Dice in 2009.  You are also connected with her on LinkedIn.  Calling me a liar is impetuous and completely false.*

*Secondly, there's no need for arrogant, hateful racist comments.  If you don't want to do business with me that’s fine, but bringing race into a professional place of work is out of line.  Also, I was born and raised by my legitimate parents, in America, so unless you're calling me a 'bastard' in the slang term, indicating that you think I'm a vicious, despicable, thoroughly disliked person (which could also be seen as racist, and absolutely hateful since you don't even know me), you are foolish and presumptuous.  Either way, I can confirm that, yes, you are an arrogant prick.*

*Thirdly, learn how to spell.  It's 'lying' not 'lieing'.*

*Finally, I would be happy to 'reconnect your ass', since dealing with racist, ignorant assholes like you isn't part of my job description.*

*Have a great day!*
*Me*


**Is this response appropriate?  Do you think I should respond with everything but the profanities(calling him a prick and asshole etc.), and just tell him why he's wrong and ignorant. Or just drop it :(**

Thanks in advance, racism makes my blood boil, so I want to call him out, but I also don't want to become the bad guy. HELP PLEASE!


**EDIT:  Thanks for all the responses; It seems we have come to a conclusive decision.**

I guess i posted to see if his comment warrented a response, and the consensus seems to be NO.  

So thanks for the responses, I will take everyone's advice and just forward it to my boss, without responding to Kevin.  


I appreciate your input and I'm glad I asked Reddit before doing something stupid lol.

Also i'll probably delete this soon, just a heads up.


**EDIT 2:**  So I added him to our 'do not call list' as he requested, and responded (with permission from my boss) saying:

*Check your grammar.* 

*Regards,*

I won't be posting my resume because I don't want to give out personal information, but here are the responses for the two questions they asked. The nature of the position is to manage student campaign interns on my college campus, train the interns, keep them on task, and coordinate with the state campaign weekly to ensure that we're all on task and aware of what we need to be doing. Please not, that text in italics is info I'm omitting for my privacy, but I've included text that gives a general sense of my response. 


**Why do you support Elizabeth Warren? Please tell us a little about yourself in this response. What does it mean for YOU if Elizabeth is elected to the United State Senate? (250 words or less)**


As a first-generation college student in the middle class, Elizabeth’s election to the Senate is extremely important to me. While I am fortunate to go to a college with excellent financial aid, student loans are a part of my aid package and Elizabeth’s commitment to giving students access to low-interest loans will ease the burden of paying for college for both me and for my parents. My mother is a public school teacher in *city omitted for my privacy*, and Elizabeth’s strong support for public education will ensure that my her school district continues to be an excellent and well-funded place to teach. My father was recently laid off from *public sector job*, and I know that Elizabeth will be a strong advocate for the unions that keep fighting for people like him as well as for the unemployment benefits  that help my dad and the many others who have been losing jobs in the past few years. As an ally of the LGBT community, I think Elizabeth’s commitment to repealing DOMA is vital to continuing the advancements President Obama has made for equal rights. I support Elizabeth because she speaks for all Americans, especially middle class families like mine and will work to rebuild the economy and tax system in a way that is fair for all all Americans.

Throughout high school, I worked at *major retail chain* where I had the opportunity  to talk to a wide variety of customers every day and learn the communication skills needed to connect to them. This summer, I co-founded *name of business omitted for my privacy*, an SAT preparation company. This experience has augmented my communication skills and helped  me become highly organized and effective at marketing techniques through social media.

In high school, I held numerous leadership positions. In the theater I was stage manager for three shows and managed casts and crews of up to 40 people, keeping everyone aware of what needed to be done. I also worked on my high school’s community life committee and worked to organize and advertise events that brought the school community together.

x0blr,12,2012-07-23,I have been in an exclusive FWB relationship with my best friend for 2 years. Should I ask him to become an official couple or is it better to not fix something that's not broken?,doremifasolathrowawy,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/x0blr/i_have_been_in_an_exclusive_fwb_relationship_with/,"I'm 20F and he's 21M. Let’s call him Henry. We have a really complicated past and FWB relationship so I fear there is something glaringly obvious I’m not seeing and that my other friends feel too awkward to tell me. Give me some tough love, Reddit. And brace yourselves for this long HIMYM-esque plot.


I’ve had a crush on Henry since we met in middle school, as our friends ran (and still do) run in the same circle, but we never got to know each other until college since I was painfully shy up to that point. The day after I broke up with my last ex, he started asking me to hang out. We went to get ice cream. Best decision of my life. He was actually incredibly easy to talk to and we had long conversations even though we didn’t have a lot in common.

We actually “dated” for 8 months. I say “dated” because though everyone else considered us a couple, he never called me his girlfriend. We spent every waking and sleeping moment together for the first 4 months. He even made us wait a month to have sex. He introduced me to his entire family, including extended relatives. The whole nine yards. So when he tried to get some time to himself, I started hanging out with other people but secretly thought he didn’t like me anymore and was seeing other girls. I guess I’ll also mention that we both have a lot of platonic friends of the opposite sex. This led us to become crazy people having crazy fights. When I finally asked him if I was his girlfriend and he said no, we really started falling apart. We had a rough “break up” a couple months later. I’ve only ever seen him cry once and it was when he was telling me he couldn’t do this anymore because he felt like a fuck-up for not being able to make me happy enough. After a week, we ended up hanging out all the time again, just without the sex and PDA.

Fast-forward 3 months. We got trashed at his house party and ended up having sex. Then he asked me to stay the night, which led to sex again (yes, we have awesome sex; he can give me multiple orgasms with only one finger). A few days after, I asked him for a relationship because I am still madly in love with him, but he said he wanted to be exclusive friends-with-benefits because he didn’t like me that way, seeing that he didn’t even know what he wanted to do with his own life, much less someone else’s. Then he said loved me, took a deep breath, and followed it with “as my best friend”. My heart seriously shattered all over the floor, but I agreed to being FWB. 

Here’s where it gets complicated: despite the fact he says we’re not in a serious relationship, he treats me like we are, especially in private (he doesn't like PDA unless he's drunk, but when we’re in his room, I can ask him to do anything sappy and he usually will). We still spend at least a couple hours together every day and I sleep over at least a couple times a week. Our friends consider us together. We can communicate with glances. He notices all the tiniest things no one else does, like when I get my teeth cleaned or that I trimmed my hair, and is always telling me how pretty I am without makeup. He comes to every event I invite him to and tells his parents every big thing that happens to me, like when I got my first internship, and they are very supportive of me too. 

I had shitty luck recently (family issues, illness, car accident, serious crime) and every time, he was the first to comfort and cheer me up with things he knew I liked. I went to the hospital once and he convinced all of his roommates to stay up all night so they could come get me in the morning. Then he made me food, put me in his bed, gave me my favorite bear (which he’d gotten from my apartment), and held me while I slept because he knew I didn’t want to be alone even though I didn’t tell him. For the last 3 years, he has always shown up right away wherever I need him without question, no matter the task, to help me. 

This is why I believe that deep down, Henry also loves me back and eventually he will make the move to make this FWB thing something more. The only thing is that I don’t know if I can invest anymore emotionally into this relationship without it being official. I’ve gotten so depressed and anxious when I think about this not working out in the end that I have started to see a counselor. When I’m not with him, I really really miss him, and when I am with him, I’m so incredibly happy and my heart still gets all nervous. 

Should I ask him to be my boyfriend, even though it’s very likely he’ll run away, or is this relationship a good thing I should just leave untouched and wait? If so, how much longer should I wait before it becomes pathetic? Is there a reason he won’t say the words he knows I want to hear? Is he just not that into me? Thank you for reading all of this! Please help :(

TL;DR: FWB of 2 years I’m crazy about treats and is committed to me like a girlfriend, but won’t say the words and I’m not sure why or what I should do about it."

Informality and general friendliness in relationships of all age, economic and social groups characterize the Thai culture and people. Thai people are tolerant of almost all kinds of behaviour and never expect foreigners to understand the intricacies of Thai social customs. But by following a few simple rules for conduct, and adopting a few Thai ways, you can quickly and easily gain respect from the people in Thailand.

A Thai greeting
In Thailand people do not normally say 'good morning', 'good afternoon', 'good evening' or 'good night'. They greet each other with the word Sawadee, and instead of shaking hands, they put their palms together in a prayer-like gesture and bow slightly. It is customary for the younger or lower in status to begin the greeting. When taking leave, the same word and procedure is repeated. This gesture is called a Wai. If you are greeted with a Wai you should reply with the same gesture, though it is not necessary to return a Wai to a child. Think of a Wai as you would a handshake. Initiate a Wai because of sincere pleasure at an introduction. You will not cause offence if you Wai inappropriately in Thailand, but you may create confusion. Don't return a Wai from waiting staff, drivers or other help. You might hope to strike a blow for equality, but will in fact cause embarrassment. A Wai to your teacher (any kind of teacher) is definately appropriate; any smiles you receive in return are of appreciation.

Sanuk means fun
One of the first things you will notice when you visit Thailand is the Thai people's inherent sense of playfulness and light heartedness. Sanuk is the Thai word for fun, and in Thailand anything worth doing, even work, should have some element of Sanuk. This doesn’t mean Thai people don’t want to work or strive. It is just that they live more in the moment, and do their best to enjoy it. The famous Thai smile stems partly from this desire to make Sanuk.

The concept of saving face
Thai people have a refined sense of public image and believe strongly in the concept of saving face. That is, they will go to great lengths to avoid confrontation and endeavour not to embarrass either themselves or other people (unless of course it is Sanuk to do so!). The ideal face saver does not bring up negative topics in conversation, or talk in an argumentative, judgemental or aggressive manner. Raising your voice or losing your temper will never be constructive in Thailand. It will result in loss of face for everyone involved, and you may be ignored as a result. You may notice Thai people smiling in the face of another’s misfortune. This is not a sign of callousness, but an attempt to save face for the person suffering misfortune. Saving face is the major source of the famous Thai smile. It is the best possible face to ease almost any situation.

shout out to me for not killing myself yet.

Yalgoo is an Aboriginal name first recorded for Yalgoo Peak by the surveyor John Forrest in 1876. The name is said to mean ""blood"" or ""place of blood"", derived from the word ""Yalguru"". An alternative view is that it is derived from the Yalguru bush which abounds in the area, and has blood red sap.
The spelling Yalgu was used because of spelling rules for Aboriginal names adopted by the Lands &amp; Surveys Department (the letter u best representing the ""oo"" sound). Within a month the Lands &amp; Surveys had decided reluctantly to use the original Yalgoo spelling, and this spelling has been used ever since. Some doubt about the spelling being officially changed resulted in an amendment from Yalgu to Yalgoo being gazetted in 1938.

So here I am, being paid less than minimum wage, when the business guys start questioning my production. To put this in perspective I've put in 55 hours the past week alone, but the stuff I'm working on isn't readily visible to them(business guys)  so now they don't think I'm doing anything.

wzzz0,0,2012-07-23,How Washington Works,[deleted],politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/wzzz0/how_washington_works/,"Oh reddit,

Before the last presidential election I heard Gloria Steinem compare Barak Obama to Jimmy Carter on a radio show, to the effect that Obama didn’t know how Washington works. In Steinem’s mind Hillary Clinton was the better candidate at that time, for her political finesse.

It must never occur to East Coast sophisticates that out here in the middle most of us are sick and tired of the way Washington works. As a result of the way Washington works, with its majority politics, toleration for superfluities of presidential signing statements, and other use of privilege by individuals superior to the law, the day Obama took office this nation was in full bank bail-out and newly involved in two wars.

The way Washington has worked since Jimmy Carter left office has been as demoralizing as any process possible. Men and women go to congress, get seduced by lobbyists and seduce interns, and with their pockets full of cash soon discover they just plain lack the backbone to stand up for any sort of principle. Talk soon turns to compromise and bipartisanship.
 
We’re left to read headlines that don’t deal with any real issues, but only scandal. At election time Americans are routinely served distracting sexual fare like abortion rights and gay marriage to keep our minds from going down to the deep end where no politicians dare to dive, among complex expensive problems such as poverty, judicial, educational, and prison reform, and corporate corruption.

Meantime every administration since Carter’s, who stepped into office as Pol Pot’s regime was winding down, has witnessed brutal genocides during which the United States stalled  interminably, evaluating its economic self-interests rather than providing humanitarian assistance. While the Kurds were exterminated in Afghanistan, while girls and women were held in rape camps and thousands of men and boys were systematically slaughtered in Bosnia and Srebrenica; while millions were hacked to death over months in Rwanda and Burundi, while the United States itself was implicated at the highest levels in war crimes in Afghanistan, and now, while in Darfur and the Congo not a day goes by that we don’t read of unspeakable atrocities occurring in particular or en masse, where are our armed services and why are they there instead of interfering for justice?  The wars undertaken on the basis of systematic and calculated lying by homicidal bunglers in the White House and Pentagon, who had to phony-up an emergency to meet their ends rather than risk exposing the actual merits of their designs on Iraq to fair debate, have inflicted long term consequences on our country and on the entire world.   

If slick ambition is what it takes to do Washington, it is also what distinguishes a politician from a real statesman. The role of a statesman is to transcend him or herself and find identity in a larger more noble meaning than personal gain. A statesman pursues ideals, for the good not only of his own soul but for his fellow’s sake, for his country and for all.  Statesmanship requires a person of fundamental goodness, intelligence, nuance, and skill. Today, politics is all about cynicism and celebrity, it’s about wealth but not about nobility. 

And that has come about because the idea of statesmanship embarrasses us. It’s too romantic. If we are satisfied to let politicians' publicists frame our issues, to be fed slates of easy positions on matters of marginal relevancy, we will never see big changes in the world.

A statesman needs a citizen. We voters have got to demand that fundamentals (like health care incidentally) be addressed, avoid dynastic leadership, step out of the machinery and drive the political process. If instead all we do with the information in Human Rights Watch reports, and books like Gourevitch’s We wish to inform you that tomorrow we will be killed with our families, Power’s A Problem from Hell, or Danner’s Torture and Truth is to award those writers prizes and scold among ourselves at book clubs, we will never advance in our own lives, let alone in Washington. 

Romney probably knows how Washington works.

I'm 23 years old and halfway through a dual degree in International Business/International Relations. My main areas of focus are foreign affairs, trade and finance. I'll be finished by June 2014, so two years down, two years to go. 

I worked in a really well paying job from ages 18-21 but hit a bit of an income ceiling with that and decided to go to university to further my career opportunities. I was making great money for a young adult, but there wasn't much room for more and I wasn't happy to be on that money for the rest of my life. Now I've gone back to study after those years, and I'm having a lot of trouble finding work. Internships and Cadetships tend to want people who are in their last or second last year of study, which I am not as of yet. Simple unskilled casual jobs are also hard to come by because they're either going to younger people or to people wanting full-time work. Furthermore, I can't really get back into anything like my old job, and because I worked that job during ages 18-21, I haven't got much experienced in lower-level casual jobs that the average 23 year old might have (barista, warehouse work, hospitality etc.) 

So I'm at this real crossroads where I want to get a job that furthers my career but I can't. I also can't really find an unskilled casual job because I haven't been suitable for the role due to my previous work experience and age. Has anyone been in a similar situation to this? How did you react? I'm still trying extremely hard to get any sort of job or internship, but I've had countless knockbacks even with good work references and a GPA of 6.0 (out of 7).

I have been living in Houston for the last two months while completing an internship that was supposed to end at the beginning of August but was recently asked to stay for the entire month of August. 

My problem is that when I originally came to Houston looking for a sublet (I am not from here), I only found a lease for June/July and no longer have a place to stay. I was wondering if anyone knows of any housing options that offer month-to-month leases or what some good options are? I know if I had to get a new lease I would have to go through deposits, applications fees, and background checks - which aren't a problem, just extra expense and time. I have been looking for rooms and sublets on craigslist but they seem kind of sketchy. 

I would like a place within 25-30 or less (preferably less) minutes of downtown in a safe neighborhood. I would like a 1br/1b to myself since it would more comfortable but at this point, I would consider a place where I have a private locking door in an apartment so that my things are safe such as a garage apartment, a shared apartment with private door, etc. 

Anyway, I am a SAP who plans to be working long hours archiving information, spend limited time at home browsing the internet and watching TV/movies, I am very quiet and clean and do not go out much. I may have friends visit me on weekends so would like to be able to have that option. For these reasons, I have been hesitant about living in someone's home. 

I am looking for something between the price range of 300-650 (depending on what utilities are available) but really need to keep a budget because I am going to be dipping into my savings since the internship is unpaid. I may be able to work a bit though with the price. 

Does anyone know of anyone that would be willing to help me out or can help me find a place that meets my needs?
PLEASE AND THANK YOU IN ADVANCE!

Did I make the right call?,drmagoo,rescuedogs,https://www.reddit.com/r/rescuedogs/comments/wzsn6/just_spent_two_days_with_a_wonderful_stray_bull/,"Came home yesterday to a filthy, adoring goof ball of a bull terrier sitting on my front porch. After some searching and asking around the neighborhood, I bathed her and set her up in the rear landing of our apartment. Despite the lost sleep and trouble of keeping her happy and exercised without allowing her in the house (she had a large skin problem and my room mate's dog was inside), the room mates and I fell in love with her. Took her to the animal hospital, got her a prescription for staph, hoping that will help the rash because I especially can't afford more diagnostic work. Called Humane Assoc. which offered to see her within the hour.

I knew from the start I would try to get her into one of our city's no-kill shelters, seeing as she is very adoptable, but I can't help hating myself for being unable to take in this dog that quickly became attached to me. She was so happy to be taken care of again that she was already extremely receptive to training on walks and general obedience. 

If only I hadn't taken so long to take school seriously, I'd be swimming in well-paid engineering internships. If only the past year hadn't been such a series of disasters so I weren't totally hollowed out by depression, I might have been able to adopt her despite being broke as hell.

Can anyone tell me I made the right decision to let Humane Assoc. take care of her? My primary concern was that she be comfortable and find a good, loving, and permanent home.

For one, I feel as though the only people that I mean something to is my family.  Secondly, the only thing I'm somewhat good at is computer programming and I feel as though all it has done has hurt me.  I'm planning to major in computer science and I love it (I graduated high school this year); however, in high school all it did was drive me to isolation because no-one else there shared the interest as me and I was socially outcast by them as a nerd. Never had a girlfriend or even kissed a girl for that matter.  Right now I'm an intern at an IT company for the summer, but all my co-workers are 40+ years old so I can't gain any friends from the one field that I love.  I enjoy music; I've been playing guitar for 5 years and started taking drum lessons next month, but because of my nerd stereotype, it seems as though the skills are worthless because no-one will even consider me to play in a band.  I used to be really addicted to video games, but have since broke said addiction.  However, the time that I used to spend playing video games is now spent doing nothing and just sitting on the couch makes me feel worthless.  Every forever alone meme I have read perfectly describes me.  To me it just feels like my life was built to fail.

We met in college in our home state of Tennessee; I was a junior and she was a freshman. We've had ups and downs, but generally a very secure and loving relationship with great chemistry between us. We have talked marriage, children, careers, etc. She is my first real girlfriend, and she was a virgin before we were together. I graduated in May, and she still has 2 yrs left.

She went to New York this summer to pursue a summer internship. After about two months without seeing each other, I finally bought a ticket to NY. I was there for a week and we had a wonderful time (romantic dates, sight-seeing, cuddling and sex). I just got home 2 weeks ago.

She has been distant since I left. I called her this morning, and it all came out. She felt like we had lost a spark. Our week together felt like one between ""very best best"" friends to her. We didn't have any deep conversations anymore. Her feelings of being let down coincided with her fears that, with a boyfriend, she won't get as much out of college as she wants. (We talked about that a lot at the beginning of our relationship). 

Now, I'm feeling incredibly frustrated. I know she wants to go out with her friends and not lose touch, and she has told me that it's not fun for her to go out with them when I'm not there, so I offered all last school year (and this summer when I visited) to go out partying with her group. She took me up on this once the whole year, and never during my week in NY. I've been doing all I can to give her space, but it seems like all she wants is an opportunity to shop around. She's very afraid of divorce and regretting the fact that she's only had one sexual partner. She also revealed to me that she hadn't been planning on staying together when she starts her dream internship in California, which would last about 3 months starting in January.

What should I do? This morning I proposed that we cancel all communication until she returns to TN in 2 weeks, as sort of a trial separation. She agreed that this might be a good idea. She said she loves me very much, but wants to get the most out of college.

I love her too. I want her to be happy, but at the same time I don't want to lose her. Up until today, I had no idea that those two were incompatible. I am lost and afraid and I would very much appreciate some advice.

**tl;dr My gf told me this morning that she would like to break up with me. This is all very sudden. How do I deal with this situation, and is there any way I can still show her that we can exist as a long-distance couple?**"

A few hours after that, I get an e-mail from the library asking if I can interview with them, too!

Presumably, the library will be reporting to the coordinator. Should I say yes to them, too? 

The problem is I'm an anxiety-ridden worrywart, and nervousness sometimes just paralyzes me. They're both excellent positions in museum administration, and I'd be happy to do either.

So I'm in a bit of a life predicament. I am about to graduate in Fall 2012 from a Big 10 University with a BS in Mathematics (concentrated in applied math) and Economics, and I am planning on applying for some graduate programs in Applied Math and pure math aswell (I loved my analysis and algebra based courses). I so far have a 3.62 cumulative with a 3.57 in math.
The thing is I am slightly on the fence due to finances and debt, so I was planning on searching for a job.
 Thing is I havent had an internsip in my last four years, I am not sure how heavy this will affect my search. My first summer of college I worked at a pharmacy helping out some pharmacists deliver medicine and stuff, my second and third summers I worked at a few retail places. Some I left on good terms, some I just left. Although for the last semester and this summer I have been tutoring students in elementary algebra to CALC 2. Will my lack of experience hurt my chances for jobs? I am really worried my lack of internships will have a severe effect on a search. If I can't find much I will probably just put an intense effort to my GRES in math and hope for the best when applying to grad schools in January.
I am putting my feet into a few applications for positions, but no luck (then again I had to rework my resume and I just recently got into the habit of writing cover letters, been lazy in the past).

So reedit, what do you think I should do here? I can possibly extend my graduation to the spring aswell and try to get a coop for the spring, but it seems like that would be difficult/ spending more money on credits.  

Thanks guys and girls.

I've been living in a new area for work and I've moved into a flat owned by a woman often not around (she has various things going on).  Anyway, with two or so months left until I will be returning to my usual place of residence, my landlady informs me that her mid-30s ish friend will be moving in.  No mention of when or for how long, just that she will.  At first I thought it'd only be a for few days, but a month later I'm pretty sure it's a permanent thing.  This is all fair enough, but there are a few main reasons why I'm really REALLY fucking annoyed.

Firstly, I'm 99% sure that her friend isn't paying any rent, while mine stays exactly the same.  It's a two bed flat, what I've been paying for it to myself has been perfectly reasonable, however now somebody else has moved in, I feel a little cheated. Especially considering I'm on an internship and my rent is a considerable expense at this stage of my life.

Secondly, she has two dogs.  Fair enough, I don't mind them, but she does very little cleaning up after them and they make a complete mess.  She just got two cats as well.  In my opinion, on a ground floor flat with no catflap or anything like that, it's unfair on the animals having to lock them both in and out (dogs and cats respectively).

My next major gripe is that she's one dirty bitch (kinda following on from my last point).  One thing I learnt from my up bringing is that you keep clean things (cutlery, plates etc) separate from the dirty things or things that don't matter (washing powder, shoe polish etc).  Yet, in her mind it's acceptable for cat hair brushes to go in the cutlery drawer, cat foot on the dining room table, the list goes on.

Le sigh, I'm sorry for troubling you Reddit.  I'm sure some of you have got equally bad or probably worse experiences with living with complete slobs. To put a positive spin on it, it's good experience in the field of how-not-to-live-your-life."

When I asked, they said that everyone at the company loves me and I've been awesome to work with and I have an open invitation to work with them. It was along the lines of ""you'll definitely be hired if you want the job."" That they'll definitely be happy to have me back and I'll probably even be paid more than other incoming designers because they already worked with me and know what I'm capable of. 

This morning, I got a Skype from my mentor saying that she had a wonderful time last night. And ""And just so we're clear, that wasn't an official job offer - but if you do decide to move back here, we will do our best to try to hire you."" 

What should I take from this? My internship ends in about a month. I'm going back to school for one year and then I wanted to come right back in May, after I graduate. However, I also know that until I sign something, I should take it as not being hired. I love the company I'm working for. I don't want to apply for other companies and seemingly blow them off.

(http://www.dailypaul.com/246012/shooter-james-holmes-and-darpa-weird-science)

Wayne Madsen Report

July 23-24, 2012 -- Aurora massacre: several links between James Holmes and U.S. government research (Salk Institute involved in neurologically enhancing soldiers' abilities on battlefield...connections to DARPA)

James Holmes, the 24-year old suspect in the mass shooting of Batman ""The Dark Knight Rises"" movie goers in Aurora, Colorado that left 12 people dead and 58 injured, has had a number of links to U.S. government-funded research centers. Holmes's past association with government research projects has prompted police and federal law enforcement officials to order laboratories and schools with which Holmes has had a past association not to talk to the press about Holmes.

Holmes was one of six recipients of a National Institutes of Health Neuroscience Training Grant at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Denver. Holme is a graduate of the University of California at Riverside with a Bachelor of Science degree in neuroscience. Although Holmes dropped out of the PhD neuroscience program at Anschutz in June, police evacuated two buildings at the Anschutz center after the massacre at the Aurora movie theater. Holmes reportedly gave a presentation at the Anschutz campus in May on Micro DNA Biomarkers in a class titled ""Biological Basis of Psychiatric and Neurological Disorders.""

Initial reports of Holmes having an accomplice in the theater shooting have been discounted by the Aurora police. However, no explanation has been given by police why the Anschutz campus buildings were evacuated after Holmes was already in custody in the Arapahoe County jail.

The Anschutz Medical Campus is on the recently de-commisioned site of the U.S. Army's Fitzsimons Army Medical Center and is named after Philip Anschutz, the billionaire Christian fundamentalist oil and railroad tycoon who also owns The Examiner newspaper chain and website and the neo-conservative Weekly Standard. The Anschutz Medical Campus was built by a $91 million grant from the Anschutz Foundation.

In 2006, at the age of 18, Holmes served as a research intern at the Salk Institute at the University of California at San Diego in La Jolla. It is noteworthy that for the previous two years before Holmes worked at the Salk Institute, the research center was partnered with the Defense Advance Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Columbia University, University of California at San Francisco, University of Wisconsin at Madison, Wake Forest University, and the Mars Company (the manufacturers of Milky Way and Snickers bars) to prevent fatigue in combat troops through the enhanced use of epicatechina, a blood flow-increasing and blood vessel-dilating anti-oxidant flavanol found in cocoa and, particularly, in dark chocolate.

The research was part of a larger DARPA program known as the ""Peak Soldier Performance Program,"" which involved creating brain-machine interfaces for battlefield use, including human-robotic bionics for legs, arms, and eyes. DARPA works closely with the Defense Science Office on projects that include the medical research community. Fitzsimons was at the forefront of DARPA research on the use of brain-connected ""neuroprosthetic"" limbs for soldiers amputated or paralyzed in combat.

According to his LinkedIn profile, James Holmes's father, Dr. Robert Holmes, who received a PhD in Statistics in 1981 from the University of California at Berkeley, worked for San Diego-based HNC Software, Inc. from 2000 to 2002. HNC, known as a ""neural network"" company, and DARPA, beginning in 1998, have worked on developing ""cortronic neural networks,"" which would allow machines to interpret aural and visual stimuli to think like humans. The cortronic concept was developed by HNC Software's chief scientist and co-founder, Robert Hecht-Nielsen. HNC merged with the Minneapolis-based Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO), a computer analysis and decision-making company. Robert Holmes continues to work at FICO.

It has also emerged that Holmes, when he was 20, worked as a camp counselor at Camp Max Straus of the Jewish Big Brothers and Sister of Los Angeles. According to the Jewish Journal, among other tasks, Holmes helped to teach boys between the ages of 7 to 10 archery. In another unusual detail, the car Holmes used to drive to the Aurora movie theater had Tennessee plates. Holmes is originally from San Diego.

James Holmes is the grandson of Lt. Col. Robert Holmes, one of the first Turkish language graduates of the Army Language School, later the Defense Language Institute, in Monterey, California. Graduating from the Turkish language class in 1948, Holmes spent a career in the Army, which likely included more than a few intelligence-related assignments. Typically, U.S. military officers conversant in Turkish served with either the Defense Intelligence Agency or the Central Intelligence Agency at either the U.S. embassy in Ankara or the Consulate General in Istanbul, or both.

Terrence Sejnowski, the Francis Crick Professor at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies and the director of the Computational Neurobiology Laboratory, in an interview with Cognitive Science Online in 2008, had the following comment about recent studies of the human brain: ""Alan Newell [cognitive psychology researcher at the intelligence community-linked RAND Corporation] once said that when AI [artificial intelligence] was founded not enough was known about the brain to be of any help and in the early 1980s, symbol processing was the only game in town. That has changed and we now know a lot about the brain, perhaps more than we need to know [emphasis added].""

More than we need to know!

The links between the younger and elder Holmes and U.S. government research on creating super-soldiers, human brain-machine interfaces, and human-like robots beg the question: ""Was James Holmes engaged in a real-life Jason Bourne TREADSTONE project that broke down and resulted in deadly consequences in Aurora, Colorado?"" In any event, if the Batman movies are now serving as a newer version of J.D. Salinger's ""Catcher in the Rye"" subliminal messaging triggering mechanism, -- Salinger's novel was of interest to a number of American political assassins --

Holmes seems to have received a research grant from the National Institutes of Health, 26 Grand IIRC. According to budget information, the NIH is partially funded by public/private donations, but also shares funding and real estate with The Department of Veterans Affairs, and multiple DoD entities, including a Cybersecurity Department,DARPA and the Office of Security and Strategic Information. (OSSI)

DARPA’S BIO-REVOLUTION
DARPA is hard at work spearheading a “Bio-Revolution.” This broad-spectrum strategic thrust
develops and leverages advances in all areas of biological and medical sciences to improve
Department of Defense (DoD) capabilities. http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CEsQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.darpa.mil%2FWorkArea%2FDownloadAsset.aspx%3Fid%3D2581&amp;ei=pxIPULTHKMie6gG5xYHADA&amp;usg=AFQjCNGtA635l_MstYxLa02sMtrJIkjDTg

Perhaps the most frightening of DARPA's weaponized science projects are those that deal with militarily enhancing that most violent of apes – man. In its 2003 strategic plan, DARPA touted the ""Enhanced Human Performance"" component of its ""Bio-Revolution"" program whose aim is to prevent humans from ""becoming the weakest link in the U.S. military."" Lest rats, bees, and trees become the dominant warriors, Enhanced Human Performance will ""exploit the life sciences to make the individual warfighter stronger, more alert, more endurant, and better able to heal."" Yes, what now captivates DARPA researchers once captivated comic-book readers – the dream of creating a real-life Captain America, that weakling-turned-Axis-smashing-super-patriot by way of ""super soldier serum.""

1. How much time should I dedicate to studying for p and the fm exams?

2. Is it possible to obtain an internship without working toward a degree? "

So, I will now be graduating in January 2013, rather than May 2013.  I'm super excited, but I'm also abit overwhelmed and nervous.  I was just wondering when the great minds of reddit think an appropriate time to start applying for entry-level positions is?

My mother, who is my ultimate source of wisdom and guidance, says September seems like an appropriate time.  I feel like I could even start applying in August.  But there's obviously the concern of applying for a position too early when they need to fill the position soon.  Of course, I guess it never hurts.

Any opinions?  Thanks!

I would like to use this new capability to tinker with the framework and see what sort of web applications I can contribute to the bitcoin community.

This isn't nearly as impressive as the mining rigs some of you have, but my main goal isn't mining. I hope to contribute to bitcoin's value by introducing more applications for it.

Does anyone have any tips for me from here? I've pretty much just echo'd getinfo() so far, and it seems pretty straightforward from here to scale to complex applications. I plan on reading the proper money handling guide, as well."

x2zwk,1265,2012-07-24,"UPDATE: Our summer intern has gotten lazy, what should I do?",iaacp,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/x2zwk/update_our_summer_intern_has_gotten_lazy_what/,"[f]irst time updating, be gentle ;)

Hey everyone! I promised I'd come back for you, unlike Kate did for Jack. I don't even know what that means.

Sorry for being a little later than planned, I had a mini emergency that I had to tend to before I could get back here. Here's the update, and the thread in case you missed it yesterday:

http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/x0tpe/our_summer_intern_is_extremely_lazy_and_spends/

So, I met with him in our small conference room this morning. He seemed really nervous. Asked how he was doing, how work was going, etc. Asked if he had anything to air out, if he was happy with his work, interested in it, etc, etc. He gave me mostly small answers like 'yes' and 'no', while remaining a little nervous. So I asked the ""okay, well do you know why I asked you here?"" while remaining friendly, not stiff (heh) or anything. He had this shit eating grin on his face and said ""uhh, you don't go on reddit, do you?"" to which I also had a shit eating grin on my face. We laughed, and I said how browsing the internet is fine, and I don't want to have to monitor him, but we *need* more work coming from him.

So then I asked if he has trouble focusing, or is bored with work or whatever. It mostly came down his lack of focus, which I can completely relate to (I was very recently diagnosed with ADHD as an adult, and we are close in age). We talked about things that would help him stay on track. I recommended getting up out of his cubicle every hour for 5 minutes, or walking around on our floor, and drinking plenty of water. Maybe take 5-10 minutes at lunch and go for a walk. He responded well to all of my suggestions, and I feel like the talk went great. 

Then I had to inform him where we go from here: like someone suggested here, I told him we're not here to baby sit, but to help him grow and learn as a programmer. We need to make sure his time is being used appropriately. If I notice another decrease in work, that's when the the punishments are going to have to get serious and I'm going to have to inform *my* boss about all of this, which will likely result in early termination. You know, to let him know we're cool, but we are still professional and work has to be done. I also told him if he feels like he's drifting again, or needs more assistance, to contact me before he goes back into this loop.

As we parted, I said to take 10 mins to browse reddit or whatever, and then continue on his assignment. Little did he know I had my IT friend redirect reddit to his own ""GET BACK TO WORK"" page, just for a short while.

I believe the problem is fixed. Thanks to all who gave input on the situation, to all interns who shat their pants upon reading this, to the few that sent me some seriously awesome FBI-level interrogation techniques, and to the many of you that inquired about jobs. No, I still can't get you one. I'm sorry. Oh, especially thank you to all those that called me a hypocrite for going on reddit at work. Please read more. Browsing is fine, as long as you get work done.

**tldr: Thousands of interns produce brown fruit that flows into their sabatons upon reading this thread. Our guy was one of them. We're cool now. I'll leave it up to him if he wants to out himself here.**

Edit: I'm still getting tons of messages about how evil we are for taking an unpaid intern, and how I have *no* right to make him do any work. If you'd read the damn thread and original post, he makes around $18 an hour! Also, plenty of people are chiming that this is fake because no intern makes $18 an hour, that's unheard of. That's the going average rate for internships in this area for the major (CS) and pretty much all engineering majors."
x2zhb,4,2012-07-24,The importance of deadlines.,zclcf30,Screenwriting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/x2zhb/the_importance_of_deadlines/,"Today, I began to actually put pen to paper. I have been planning this sci-fi script for about a month now. Notes here and there, a few scene breakdowns in my head and a general plot outline in my notebook. 

I was surprised by an e-mail inviting me for an interview at a small local journal, a place I had applied to for an assistant camera op internship. I went, and they said I could start on Monday. For a month, I had been ""writing"" this script, telling myself that I'd begin writing soon. But it wasn't until I only had a week to get my first draft out that I began writing. 

Deadlines, especially looming deadlines, really do seem to help. If you can, start setting yourself deadlines that you actually have to adhere to. I'm not sure how that could be done - maybe someone in here does. But, they work!

Unless you have financial support, the cost of most universities today is far to expensive to justify the time and money. This is especially important if you want to do anything in the arts. Find internships at places you respect, move to places you dream of living, and work online with others willing to give you a chance to try your hand at what you love. Take a shitty job that allows you the time and headspace to do want you're passionate about. It might not work. You will be poor. You might give it your all for years and come up with nothing, but at least you'll have tried. And if you don't end up making a sustainable living by the time you're in your mid-to-late twenties, then you can start taking community college courses to decide what you want to study before jumping into a pile of debt and indecision."

Before jumping into the market I want to hear some advice from others to help prepare. Anything you guys have to offer aside from these questions is welcome!


- Is it common for devs to host their clients pages? At this point I won't be able to, so what hosting services would you guys recommend?

- Should I be registering domains for them? If so, is there a preferred registrar for devs? (I'd like to stay away from godaddy)

- What sort of legal factors come into play while doing freelance work with clients?

- Once you finish developing for a client, how do you continue business with them aside from the hosting and maintenance fees?

- I have no idea how to charge clients or price the work I've done. I could make a rough estimate (of course I'll start lower being a newer dev), but is there any real formula to calculating a price?

- If you work with customers from out of your area, what method of payment should be used and when should the payment be requested in terms of the development process?


Thanks for the help and your feedback!"
x2x9l,0,2012-07-24,Announcement Regarding Leadership Board,masstermind,testpac,https://www.reddit.com/r/testpac/comments/x2x9l/announcement_regarding_leadership_board/,"(Kind of long, but important. Please read.)

As you have likely seen, we have spent the past couple of weeks looking to establish a new leadership board. We had nearly 20 people apply to be on the board, some more qualified than others. As of today, we have met with five people that we believe should be on the board. However, they will not officially be on the board until they do an AMA, and are voted in via an “up or down” majority rules vote on each candidate. The voting will be held on testpac.org afte =r all of the AMAs are done.

The purpose of this post is to introduce the five people we want to be on the leadership board. First, though, a few things:

a)      To those who applied but didn’t get a position on the board: First of all, thank you for reaching out to us. Second, we still may end up reaching out to you if someone backs out, or if we want to expand the size of the board. Third, the new board members will almost definitely be reaching out to you to get you involved in the PAC in one way or another. A lot of you had very specific writing or technical skills that the new board is going to need, especially if they want to form subcommittees. If you have any questions, please contact me. 
 
b)      The five people that we’ve selected will be posting an AMA this week / early next week.. We’re going to try to do one per day (schedules permitting) so that the community can focus on one person at a time.
 
c)      Andy, Jeromie, and I will form something like an “Emeritus Advisory Board”, so that we are available to provide input on big decisions, and to ensure that the PAC doesn’t stray from its original intentions.

So, without further ado:

**Michael Embrich (oneway252)**: Michael, a veteran of the Iraq War and the War in Afghanistan, has extensive political experience. He has lobbied in favor of reformed veterans affairs policies, and is a member of Veterans for Peace. Michael has been involved in multiple congressional campaigns, and state &amp; local campaigns. Additionally, he was a key member of Dennis Kucinich’s failed presidential campaign of 2008. Michael is a graduate of Rutgers University.

**Vlad Gutman (eggsofamerica86)**:  Vlad has been the Campaign Manager of four different campaigns at state and federal levels. Additionally, he has been Finance Director of two other campaigns, and the Deputy Midwest Political Director at AIPAC. Vlad is currently the Campaign Manager for Gloria Romero Roses for Congress, in Miami. He is a graduate of Northwestern University.

**Mitch Manzella (mcmanzi)**: Mitch has worked on campaigns for mayors, congressmen, and candidates at all levels of US politics. Additionally, he started a PAC in 2008 called Music for Democracy, where he served as Treasurer and Executive Director. Mitch is a graduate of Rutgers University.

**Tom Dionesotes (TomDionesotes)**: Tom is currently the campaign manager for a State Senator’s re-election campaign in Massachusetts. He has past experience in field, finance, and communications at the local, state, and federal level. Tom is a recent graduate of the University of Vermont where he was an award-winning member of the Lawrence Debate Union.

**Chris Woolley**: Chris is a third year law student at George Mason University with a specialization in National Security and Cyber Law.  He has a year of experience in criminal law, and is currently doing research into Revolutionary American treason law and working as the legal intern at an open source software company.  Chris received his undergraduate degree in history from the College of William and Mary.

AMA schedule:
Mitch – Thursday the 26th
Mike – Wednesday the 25th
Vlad – Friday the 27th
Tom – Sunday the 29th
Chris - Monday the 30th (updated)

**Transition Phase**
            
Once the board is approved, there will be a 2-3 week transition phase. There are two big things we’d like an accomplish during the transition phase, and we will want the community’s help on both of them.

1.       We’d like to re-write the bylaws so that they are more applicable to TestPAC in its current form.

2.       We’d like to create a document detailing the purpose, goals, and mission statement of the PAC.

But, one step at a time. We’ve assembled a solid group, and we’re looking forward to the AMA process and the subsequent votes.

- Scott, Jeromie, &amp; Andy

Edit: As a personal note, I will be out of the country from Thursday the 26th - August 2nd, and I will have very minimal internet access... probably none at all actually. So, Andy or Jeromie will take the lead on setting up votes etc.

-Scott

Very cute, petite hispanic girl. She got on the pill and we had lots of passionate sex (where I learned to love sex without a condom). Lots of sex with the risk of getting caught. We were together 2.5 years. Fell apart in college which I regret terribly. She married but her husband suffered traumatic brain injury and is a sustained vegetable. No kids but I still feel so bad for her. I wouldn't definitely become involved with her again if the opportunity presented itself.

Melissa: I was 20, she was 21. Another cute, petite latina (Venezuelan). We lived in the same dorm in college and shared a few classes. We had lots of sex but not any strong romance. She got on the pill and we had great unprotected sex. Really tight body and kinky outlook. We weren't seeing anyone else but it wasn't very committed. More FWB than romance. Saw her for about a year and half. She is married. I'd probably hook up with her again but probably not looking for a relationship.

MG: I was 21, she was same. Curvy white chick. Friend of some friends. Hooked up with her for around a month (safe sex). Sex was normal but pretty hot. She had a little bit of weight but I liked it. Great oral. She ended it because she thought I was more into sex than her. Which was true.

Katie: I was 21, she was 20. Fucking hot petite redhead. Smaller breasts but gorgeous sexy ass. I had an internship in another city over the summer. She was a friend of my sister. We first hooked up on a coach in a room I was renting. No condom. She pulled me into her as I came. Sex was fucking hot. She was submissive and eager to please. Only partner I've had who did not orgasm during sex. Very sexual but also a little unbalanced. Fought a lot. Didn't last past summer. More on Katie later.

I saw her a few more times when I was in town. It was a great time in our youth. She was hot and would dress provocatively. She certainly had more partners than I had.

T: I was 21, she was same. Curvy indian chick. Thin waist, great breasts, and a great ass. Grew up in States. I hooked up with her during last year of undergrad through my first year out of school. We lived together in a shitty apartment for almost a year. She was smart and sexy. Sex was pretty average but she had a great body. Used a condom early but she quickly got on pill. She had some pressure from her family and things ended. Badly. Relationship was bad for a while before it though. Some of it was certainly my issues. I did hook up with Katie again while I was involved with her.

Katie (again): I was back in town for a conference. We had dinner and she talked me into taking her back in the room. Hot sleazy sex. She was wearing these very feminine butterfly underwear. I don't think I came (inside) harder at any other time. I still remember every detail. She had a trendy pea coat over skinny jeans and a white blouse. Her curvy auburn hair was around her face. And her soft skin was so hot underneath me.

Nicole: I was 25, she was 30. Another friend of my sisters. Attractive brunette. She was anxious about sex at first. Became a pretty involved relationship, maybe two years. She was living in Brooklyn but working from home. I was moving and she came. We lived together. Very needy emotionally. I ended things. I feel bad about everything. She changed much of her life for me. She wanted the relationship. I didn't. She's a good person but I couldn't make it work.

Katie (again): I was 27. We started talking again. I offered to fly her to see me. We did that for a few months. She had lost her job and was being evicted so she came down permanently. She's extremely intelligent and has a degree. But she is extremely impulsive with bad judgement. She can't really hold a job unfortunately. Plus her degree is in journalism from a mid-tier school so it's worth very little in the job market. We had great sex. I lived on the water and had a nice convertible with a sexy woman next to me. Life was easy. Sex was fucking hot as always. She played house. We probably fucked twice a day. Once or twice a week I'd come home and she'd have a bottle of wine open and was horny as hell. We played with anal sex occasional. She'd always tell me how lucky I was to have her ass. That made it hotter. We also fought. And things may have started to soon after Nicole. Things ended again about four months. We still talk occasionally. She asked me to take her on vacation maybe six months after things ended (and presumably fuck her silly). Timing didn't work out with my work. Plus that's a box that shouldn't be opened again. She's still so hot and sexy.

?: This was a pretty slutty few months of my life. I had just moved back to the city from the coast. Lots of young attractive women. I was 27, she was 26. I'm not sure why I can't remember her name. Cute, tall asian chick. Nice breasts. Medical student at a good school. Crazy. Met her on internet. She was very inexperienced. Made out like being a teenager again. But would not come back to my apartment and make out in private like adults. We did have sex. It wasn't good. She wanted to talk dirty during sex but couldn't quite do it and chew gum. Lot's of daddy issues.

J: I was 28, she was 23. I had actually met her before I moved back to the city. Curvy, redhead. She had a body that was a little chubby but she was young enough it was only in the right places. Great breasts and a sexy soft ass. Freckles and long hair. She had the softest thighs and labia. I still get hard thinking about her. She was a friend of a friend. Nothing ever happened before I moved back to the city. But she called me up out of the blue. I think she was a little lonely. I flew her up to see me. We got back from the airport to my apartment to drop her bags off and she was ready to go. I was in my kitchen when we pulled our bodies together. We kissed and pressed her breasts into me. We made out like that for a while. She was demure about fucking me at first. But her pussy was perfectly shaved and completely wet. She knew what the weekend was about.

We moved to my bedroom. She gave great oral which I reciprocated. I got a condom and we fucked in every position. I loved pressing her stomach and breasts into the bed and having her from behind. She sucked my cock after I came. I love that. As I recovered, I rubbed her back, ass and thighs. I kissed the back of her neck, down her spine, and her pussy as she lay face down. I moved my hips over her ass as I rubbed her body. My cock was rubbing against her slit. We were both so wet. The head of my uncovered cock slipped into her wet pussy. She pulled me into her and told me she was on the pill. She wanted to feel me come in her. It felt so sleazy and hot to fuck her on our first ""date"" bareback. We fucked that entire weekend like that. I must have came in her or on her about a dozen times in two days.

She came back for another weekend. She had relationship expectations that I wasn't ready for. I stopped seeing her. I still get hard thinking about her. She texted me a few months ago with some photos of our mutual friends' baby. She tried to lead the texts toward sex. I still think she wants to hookup again. A nice sex weekend in the Caribbean or Mexico would be nice...

A: I was 28, she was the same. Thin dirty blonde. Smart, successful, and remarkably free of any major issues! We're in a good relationship that started on the internet. Sex is usually pretty average with an occasional stand-out. It's a healthy relationship and we're still together. Although, I do think about Katie and J occasionally. A purely sexual weekend would nice with one of them."
x2pcb,4,2012-07-24,Date was not memorable? (long read),[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/x2pcb/date_was_not_memorable_long_read/,"Hello to everyone who will read this. First, I'd like to say this is my first post on reddit. (sucks that it has to be about my relationship problems). So, if I do something wrong, just correct me please. Sorry for wall o'text!!!

My gf(18) and I (19) have known each other for about a year now. We started talking about a month before college through a facebook page for our college class. We would debate different music artists, random accessories, and other things. When we got to college, we hung out a lot. Like, everyday after our classes were done, I was either in her room, she was in mine, or we were sitting outside talking. About two months into the semester, her friends confronted me about her. They said she liked me a lot, and she was driving them crazy because she was freaking out about what to do. This confrontation also informed me that I would be her first boyfriend...and first everything. (Except for kiss maybe, I dunno.) Anyway, I told them I did like her, and then I asked her our in the following days. Everything was going fine, but then she started to take away from me time. Meaning, I wasn't allowed to play video games, or hang out with my friends. I thought, alright, I'm her first boyfriend, she expects me to be around her 24/7. Eventually I started hanging out with her a little bit less, so then she constantly dropped by my room. I broke up with her cause she started to criticize me on how I spent my time. I tried getting her to understand that at home I didn't have freedom, I wasn't really allowed out of the house, and that I was always being used by my parents. (As in lots of chores, always helping around the house, and helped build 3 houses with my parents. This would leave me too physically tired to do ANYTHING.) She didn't understand. So I broke up with her. This all happened within a month or so. (~october-november)

I think we went a few days without talking, and then she stopped by one day, and we started to talk again. We hung out a few times. However, it didn't register in her that we weren't together, and she would randomly kiss me. Yes, I would pull away when I saw a kiss coming, but she wouldn't let that go. During this time period, I would be mean to her. She would come to my room, and she would lay on my bed wanting to hang out, but I played video games or did homework. Yes, that is fucked up, I know. Then I would hang out with my friends, and when I wasn't in my room, she would check my friend's rooms. She would find me there, and then she would get really upset that we weren't hanging out. Most of the time when she asked to hang out, I didn't respond, but there were a few times where I said we would, but I went to my friends. (~november-april)

In December, we were on break from college, and she though it would be cool if we hung out. I admit, I did want to take her to the movies and hang out. So we did just that. We went to the movies, did some sight seeing, and I paid for all of it. (Transportation, movie+food, and pizza before she went home that night) That same day, while we were hanging out, she confessed that she loves me. At that point in our relationship(as friends) I was kind of iffy on saying I loved her too, because of all the stuff we went through. I said it back, and I meant it. I don't remember if we hung out after that, but we texted everyday, and skyped here and there.(decemeber-january)

Now we're back in college, and things are going great. And then shit hits the fan again. I try to hang out with her, but I like doing other things too. At first, she suggested we hang out every other day, and just see each other to say hi and bye in the morning/evening. We tried that, but she would constantly come by. From januaury, things would be hell until april. She would come over, we would fight, she would cry, and go back upstairs. My friends didn't like her, and her friends started to dislike me. Then, in mid april, things changed. My friends decided they like her, and they would stop making fun of her as severely as they used to. (Yes, I stood up for her even when we WEREN'T dating/going out). We drank together a few times(me, gf, and friends). 

This is where it gets weird. I was going to ask her out again, because I started to see things getting better. One day we're laying on my bed, and she decides she wants to have sex. Through our relationship, I took it really slow to do anything with her. At times, she would get upset of this and say that I'm not interested in her, or that she is ugly...y'know, the regular stuff. Anyway, she decided she wanted to have sex, and I didn't get a chance to ask her out before that. So we decided to say that I did ask her out ""before"" she lost her virginity to me. So we started dating again, and things were going fine. (april-may)

In may, the second semester ended, so we headed home for summer break. She cried that I would leave her and not pay attention to her. Within the first week of summer, I got an amazing opportunity for an internship. Of course, I took it. I was out of the house 8-7 every single day of the week. However, after every day at work, I would get home, and only want to skype her. Sure, I did play video games while skyping her. I understand that this is wrong, and have stopped this. This worked for about a few weeks. (may)

Then she started complaining that I should visit her. I live about an hour away from her by car, but I cannot use the car on the weekends because my parents need it then. Also, it is not my car to just take it and drive to her. So we decided she will drive out, and come pick me up, and then we can hang out. Let me just drop this: her parents make x3 as much money as my parents do. They also have two cars. Her parents don't really get along, but haven't gotten a divorce because her mother would end up in the street, simply put. She doesn't get along with her mom. Her sister is away at a good college, and her dad works everyday. So she doesn't have a picture perfect family. And I respect that. I always try to talk to her about whats going on, hows the family, but she gets upset. Then she blames me for not asking how she feels.

I convince my parents to let me spend the weekend at her house, and they said alright. So we spent the weekend seeing her town and things like that. I paid for everything except gas money. (which she asked her father for) Then two weeks went by, and everything was nice. We skyped, texted, and didn't argue. I went to her house again, and we did the same. I paid for everything except for gas, and she asked her father again. Then she came to my house one day after work. This marked our third month together. I took her to the flower shop, and I had ordered flowers two days ago. Little did I know, the store didn't have them ready. This upset me, because I lost a lot of time waiting on the flowers. Finally, the flowers were put together, wrapped, and I was able to pay for them. We walked back to my house. I then took her for a walk across the Brooklyn Bridge in Manhattan. We took a few pictures, and I enjoyed it a lot. We took the train back to my house, and since I couldn't use the car, she decided to drive her dads car to the restaurant. Now this is stupid: I took my brother along because he loves this restaurant. Yes, I know it was just suppose to be just us two, but I promised him I would take him the next time I went. I paid for the meal, and I left a huge tip. (Counted wrong, and left a 40% tip. The people at the restaurant know my entire family, and we have been going there for years now, so yeah) Anyway, we drive back home, and she waits in the car as I go to get her flowers. I looked into my backyard, and noticed my parents were there. So I asked them how I should pack the flowers. They quickly explained and I went to prepare them. I prepared the flowers, and took them outside. I didn't want her to leave, so I kept asking her to come outside of the car, and stuff like that. We kissed goodnight, and she said she had fun. I told her to drive safe, blah blah, her parents are going to be worried, so head home now. I also told her to text me when she gets home. 

I spent this past weekend at her house. Everything was going fine. I took her to see the new batman movie, and I paid for the tickets. I was about to pay for her drink too, but she declined. So I said okay. So we are sitting in the movie theater, and have a few minutes before the movie starts. She decides she wants popcorn. She pulls money out of her purse, and asks if I would get it for her. Okay. This pissed me off. When I ask her to hand me something, she responds ""You have two legs, and two arms"". So I said I don't want to get it, in a whiny kid voice. She understood, got up, and got it herself. Later that night, we were both hungry. So I asked her if we could go to the store to go buy something. She said alright. But she then said, ""I don't want to ask my dad for money anymore today."" So I said, alright. I understand. I'd prefer if we could split the cost or something, rather than pay it all. This came out of my mouth wrong, and she immediately got offended. She took me to Wendys, I bought a sandwich, and she didn't want anything. The entire drive TO the store, at the store, and the drive home, I was begging her to buy something to eat. (That I would pay for.) Nothing. Okay, fine. 

The next morning she drops me off at the train station, and I take the train home. Later, she texts me saying she is really upset that I didn't offer to pay for her. At this point I lost my cool and texted her back: are you fucking kidding me? I might not instantly say I'll pay for you, but all you have to do is ask. I have never took you out and not paid for you. Every time we hang out, I pay for everything BUT gas money. She then replied, ""I wish chivalry wasn't dead"". At this point I just wanted to respond, ""I wish princesses still existed"", but I knew that would cause trouble. 

As of right now, she is still ignoring me from the fight about the money. I have spoken to one friend, and the friend told me ""you guys aren't married, but movies and food is something you should cover. And you did cover it."" Please keep in mind that I am in college, and have to pay a LARGE amount of money because I refuse to take out loans. I am STILL nice enough to pay for her on the date. 

She also has sent me a package with a shirt in it. She has sent me cards saying how she misses me, and I have sent cards back. 

How am I suppose to go about this? I don't understand what else I should be doing. 

**TL;DR:** Girlfriend thinks I'm not chivalrous enough. Complains that I don't do enough ""loving"" things to her. Then goes to say she didn't think our date was memorable. "
x2now,10,2012-07-24,"What was the reason you chose to get into a LDR?  I'm on a very wobbly, about to be overseas, fence and would like some anecdotes please!",fuziwankenobi,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/x2now/what_was_the_reason_you_chose_to_get_into_a_ldr/,"At the start of the year I (23, female) met someone (24, male), through mutual friends.  He's amazing - sweet, loving, gets along with every single one of my friends, and I honestly am falling for him.  We've been dating for about 2-3 months.  The problem is that I'm going away for at least 3-4 months, if not more, if an internship works out, and it's weighing on me that I don't know what will happen.  

Should I just do it and try for a LDR?  I have no experience in these things and if I wasn't in this situation I'd laugh at anyone else for even suggesting such a thing.  I'm a very logical person usually.  

Also, this is my first big trip overseas as an adult - I have been planning it for over a year and am not sure that I want a long distance relationship clouding my big trip to another continent.  Plus I don't think it would be fair on him - me gallivanting all over Europe while he is stuck on another continent.  I am also planning on catching up with two men that I had feelings for at certain stages - one an ex boyfriend who was on exchange in my city while we were together (4 years ago) and the other is a professor who will help me with my degree, but someone who I also had a fling with (1 year ago).  I have hinted at this with my current love interest, but he doesn't seem to want to know the details of my trip - I understand that he's just enjoying the time we have, but it's still weighing on me.
 
I'm basically worried about the future - I really like this guy but I think, logically, a LDR would not work, but every day (and I leave in 5 days) I fall deeper into this relationship with him and I don't know what to do.  He has been much more invested in this for the past few weeks, and wants a LTR.  It's been my coping mechanism to keep him at an arms length so I don't have to deal with the ""goodbye"", but with my leaving so soon, it's becoming apparent that I am developing feelings.  Errrrrgh... D:

I'm not sure where I'm going with this, I think I needed to tell someone, but not him just yet, until I organize my feelings better.  Also, red wine is fuelling this post.  

TL;DR: Tell me about your decisions for trying a LDR Reddit, and your reasons you didn't.  Is an uncertain return date a dealbreaker?  "

x2n88,8,2012-07-24,Thinking about moving on from my first job. Need advice.,marpstar,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/x2n88/thinking_about_moving_on_from_my_first_job_need/,"I landed my first CS internship in 2009, writing COBOL (with a GUI) for a small software company. The job was very easy, just sat in my cube and fixed bugs all day long. The code quality was very poor, but I didn't care. I was being paid to code. It was great. At the time, I had much less confidence, and I was actually pretty content with the $33k job offer they made me 3 months before graduation. I was going to take it. Then my girlfriend got pregnant, and my world was turned upside down.  I needed a higher paying job, so I applied everywhere. I graduated with a degree in Computer Science in May 2010, and landed a job with a local company starting the Monday after graduation.  Compared to my internship, I've got a dream job. Working with C#/.NET, Android, 

A little background: The company was founded 15 years ago, and sells management software to the public sector. We've got a flagship product that's just as old, and within the past 12 months, the company has began development on our next-generation web application. Only one person on our team (of 20 developers) has had prior JavaScript experience, so I took it upon myself to start learning web development including JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.  In the 12 month since we've started this project, I have become the go-to guy regarding anything JS/CSS/HTML. We've already built a large part of the system's core, and it's just adding more and more domain-specific functionality from here on out.  

The problem:  I'm getting tired of the Business Analysts, UX Designer, and Product Managers telling us that we need this software out the door yesterday.  I feel as if they spend all of their time conceiving this ""game-changing"" product, but when it comes to the developers, we're simply the construction monkeys and we have no say in anything. Throwing 20 developers with no JavaScript experience at a 3-year project the powers-that-be want complete in 1 year has left us with a mountain of technical debt, and some parts of the architecture are shaky, to say the least. 

Because the BAs and the PMs order our backlog, we're constantly struggling to squeeze in refactoring stories so that we can try and keep the architecture as scalable as possible.  My immediate superiors have responded to this by 'assuring' us that the leadership team 'knows' that they 'will have to pay for this technical debt', but I'm not so sure that they know how much actually is there, or that they'll ever actually allow us to address it. 

The lead PM has, to say the least, been less than inspiring to the development team, even going as far as to announce to the entire company that ""Yes, development has hit every milestone so far, BUT there's still a lot to do."" at our most recent milestone celebration. I get the feeling that these BAs and PMs feel like they're the ""rockstars"" developing this new product, while we're nothing but the expendable labor they can boss around. Combine this with the recent rumors that these BAs/PMs are receiving sporadic bonuses while we get $25 gift cards for working a month's worth of Saturdays, and I'm just not as happy as I was when I walked through the door. 

For the average developer, I think that this place is a dream come true. The hours are super-flexible, and the pay is pretty decent for the Midwest, we aren't micro-managed by our immediate superiors, but I'm just tired of dealing with all of the politics between development and product management. I'm not afraid to say that I'm an above-average developer, and even with only two years on the job, I'm ready for something more challenging. I want to ask for a raise and promotion, as my manager has repeatedly said that I'm one of the most productive employees she has, and my advanced knowledge of JavaScript has made me a crucial component to this project being delivered on time.  Every 3 weeks for the past 6 months or so, I have been giving 1-hour JavaScript training sessions at lunch to the rest of the development team, which has been the only education on JavaScript provided to our team. 

I feel that at one point, this company really did value their engineers, but now just wants to give bonuses to people that aren't us. 

TL;DR I loved my job until they stopped appreciating their developers. I think I'm ready for a new challenge, but could very easily get a raise and promotion at the end of the year.  Burning out and not sure what to do.

Just looking for thoughts. "
x2n10,1,2012-07-24,Some scribblings of ideas for a new play and the person I usually show it to is unavailable and the replacement is also unavailable. Please help.,RookieMonster,writers,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/x2n10/some_scribblings_of_ideas_for_a_new_play_and_the/,"I'd never show anything this early on to people, but this is an emergency since I'm getting sucked in and I could be losing sight of this being a pillar of piss. Any creative/critical/constructive comments welcomes. Any ideas on an ending are welcome too, but I'm ready to work that out on my own as I write the damned thing. Just to clairfy it is meant to be a comedy or perhaps a modern farce.

*There's this office for Collin's Dictionary. It already has Tom Murdoch who's the only adult (Mike just got casted) who runs the the office for Collins. He's ex-MI5 and quite muddled, a bit of PTSD and a little paranoid. Got shuffled there because he interrogated a shop a ginger student for 36 hours when he suspected he might be an IRA spy. Now he gets cheap interns to come in and do all the work for him.*

*George Clarke is the long term 'intern' working on the thesaurus section. He's clever and knows it, sloths talk about being 'as lazy as a george'. Passive aggressive and believes that his talents are going to waste, which they are. Very frustrated and take it out on those around him with long winded rants but also likes to snipe at and devalue others, in his own sardonic and comic fashion.*

*Sarah McNeil plays mummy, makes the tea and coffee and friendzones people. She isn't innocent and knows what she's doing, she does it to prove her own personal feminist agenda of women being feminine and weak but ultimately that making them more in control. Ultimate cock tease. Lost her place on her masters course after sexually assaulting a first year student and leaving him unable to achieve an erection except whilst wearing a bib with 'good boy' written on it. This counts against her community work.*

*David Watson is crazy and reclusive. He plays scrabble against himself, and challenges his won words. He also claims to be able to do the Times crossword without filling any letters in, but when asked to says that there's no point. Tragic characters, haven't decided if he's really intelligent and stuck there because he's so odd, or he's thick as two short planks, and being odd is why he's still there. Says shit like ""What would happen if Pinocchio said 'my nose will now grow'"" and ""I don't think it's called the secret service, because otherwise how would we know about it?"" and ""If the Pope dies, is he being fired or promoted?"" and ""Since superman has x-ray vision, can he still see with his eyes closed"". He's definitely on the spectrum.*

*Henri Houwen is the protagonist. Fresh if the English Literature at Cambridge conveyer belt that delivers overeducated under-lived young people. He's idealistic and unadjusted. His white clothes are all pink because of a red sock in the washer and Sarah has to bring him in leftovers because he's starving. He joins the office as a new intern at the beginning of the play, or has already joined them, or is about to. He tries to get on with people and is torn between enjoying perfect grammar on one hand, but believing language is to be used by people in the real world on the other. He dresses like you, in fact he's a bit of a Claudio. Torn and undecided, easily swayed as he tried to please those around him. Has deep issues with people misspelling his name.*

*Tom believes there's an anarchist cell working to place spelling, grammar and definition errors into the Collins Dictionary. Tom's too well know in the dictionary world after receiving a number of prizes including best definition for his cutting edge definition of 'Tweet' in the '09 awards. He sends Henri to spy on the anarchists for him and work out how they're getting the spellings errors into the prints.*

*When Henri finds the anarchist (how?, I have no idea) they have almost exactly the same office with perhaps one picture changed on the wall. All the characters are mirror images of the ones in the Collins office just they all wear badges with an 'A' on them and have ruffled there hair. They talk about more aggressively but are essentially the same characters played by the same actors.*

*Henri gets chatting a lot to the equivalent of Sarah; Sister Sair-rah. Talking about words and freeing ones mind and comparing acts of first world anarchism (e.g. dating your signature one day earlier than you signed it, walking on the grass, opening packs of crisps at the wrong end). Walks home and gets pulled of the street by Sair-rah, who it transpires is a member of the Oxford Dictionary lot. Same actors playing similar characters just posh.*

*No idea what happens next. This has not been proof read or spell checked or any of that fascist bullshit.*

Oxford and Collins are the two big publishers which produce dictionaries. Thanks so much for your time in advance, reading all these scribbles, this is why I hate showing it to people, I feel like such a burdan on you people. Also, if you steal my idea I'll tear out your windpipe and wipe the wet side on your face.

if this is true then what about agents that ask for some writing after being queried but then pass? about a third of the agents i queried did not respond. another third sent a form letter rejection. the other third asked to see the first few pages/chapters, then declined.

so, what am i supposed to deduce from this? do i need a better query? or has it been working well enough for some agencies as it has generated a decent amount of interest? do i need to look into a massive re-write of the story? or should i just keep submitting?

i feel like it is about as refined as i can get it. i dont think a re-write would make it any better, just, well different. also i really dont want to do yet another re-write (already done several). but on the other hand i will do whatever it takes to get this thing published.

the rejection isnt the hard part of this stage. its the uncertainty. its the not-knowing of what to do, and when to do it, and the endless waiting for weeks and weeks and weeks for a response from agents. also there are all the questions.

did the agent reject it or his halfwit intern? would one of the other agents at that agency be interested? did the halfwit intern think to ask one of them? do the other agents use the same halfwit intern? how long should i wait before querying that agent again if it takes them 8 weeks to reply in the first place? what is the likelihood someone else would end up reading it instead? what if i changed the title?

If you would be so kind as to provide a little guidance to me I would forever be in your debt.

Here's the situation, I am being forced to law school. I have no interest in going to law school. I am going to be a senior in college and my parents are literally forcing me to go (they themselves did not go, my mother did not even finish college herself. She dropped out to help pay for my father's education). We already had it out a few months ago where my mother and I did not speak for a few days. I can’t stand that, I love my mother and want to please her and make my father proud. They promise they would help pay for it, ""there is money for you to go"" is what she says. My family is not rich by any means but we are certainly not poor.  

Now I realize how lucky I am to be in this position (they will not pay for all of it but they will certainly take off most of the burden if what my mother says is true). That alone is keeping me interested, how much could having a law degree hurt? The problem is, as I stated above I have no intention to be a lawyer. Not to mention within my group of friends they are already getting job offers from their internships while I am plugging away at my part time job and studying for the LSAT in my free time. 

Now, the only reason I have not gone insane at this point is because my mother is certain her connections would land me a job in the state's attorney office. Again, given these circumstance I am in a state of self loathing because I seemingly have it so easy, I realize how easy it could be (there are no guarantees she could actually get me a job) yet still manage to complain about the situation (I also volunteer a lot, so I see the underprivileged on a regular basis and get to listen to their stories and feel even worse).

What I really think I am meant to do, and what I am very interested in is law enforcement (when I offered the prospect of being a beat cop my mother almost had a heart attack and threatened to “cut me off” if I don’t follow through with the plan “we” (she included me but really it was her and my father) made for my future. 

I consider, on a regular basis, dropping out of college and joining the military to get my foot in door with law enforcement. This, I am fairly certain would kill both of my grandparents, they would probably drop of a heart attack if they heard that (they are also my best friends and I want to make them proud as well). Ultimately I would like to go into the FBI or some other agency on a federal level, but not the legal side.

Thank you for reading this far if you have, I appreciate it.

I just need some guidance here. My mother and father would certainly cut me off if I don’t follow through with what they have planned for me.

**TLDR: Parents forcing me to go to law school. Even offer to help pay for the MAJORITY of it, I don’t want to go...at all. Self loathing ensues (I realize how good I have it). Want to go into law enforcement, but not the legal side. Won’t listen to my reasoning, will cut me off if I break away from the plan they have choose for me.**

Have a great day everyone, and good luck on the exam those taking it!"

Something drips from the vagina and they realize that her ""vagina"" is actually her urethra. That's why she couldn't conceive and had those pains. 

Some replies to the comment commented on how sex education would be beneficial in schools, how the poor woman endured having a penis in her urethra and how small her husband's penis must have been if she didn't think it was painful enough to go see a doctor right away."

x22xl,33,2012-07-24,Being a woman with feelings caused my boyfriend to resent me and caused me to resent myself...,[deleted],SRSWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/SRSWomen/comments/x22xl/being_a_woman_with_feelings_caused_my_boyfriend/,"My boyfriend of almost two years and I split recently.

We started hitting a rough patch in our relationship when I was feeling particularly vulnerable (many of my friends moved away simultaneously, I was very stressed about work/college/my body/my future/money etc., and he was pretty much all I had), and I increasingly grew more dependent on him. During this time, rather than feeling supported by him I felt like I was being resented. He would never tell me any of what he felt upfront and I would often have to drag it out of him. This often resulted in him telling me how he questioned our compatibility, citing how our brains work differently, how he doesn't ""feel"" as strongly as I do, and how he needs his space. All this took a real toll on me emotionally, which created a vicious cycle of me becoming depressed because of the resentment I felt from him, and him becoming more resentful because of my depressed and increasingly dependent/emotional state.

Our breakup was a long time coming, but I refused to acknowledge it for months. In fact, I convinced him once or twice to stay with me. I told him that things will get better, basically promising that I will change. I found myself suppressing my feelings all the time for the fear that I will start a fight and he will finally decide that he doesn't want to be with me anymore. I was very afraid of being alone, thinking it would tear me apart completely. I was basically waiting for him to love me again, despite watching him pull away more and more. Meanwhile I was completely oblivious of the fact that I didn't love him anymore.

After spending a few weeks apart, due to him having a summer internship, I realized I didn't really love him, need him, or desire his approval of me any longer. After months of crying and convincing him that we should be together, that I could be better, that we could be better... I just didn't care anymore.

We broke up over the phone. I literally had to make him call me and break up with me.

After all the work to keep us together I now wonder why I ever bothered to stay with him. I felt no sadness when we finally split. In fact I felt free, and I feel free now.

Now, a few weeks later, I wonder how I let this happen to me... How did I manage to fool myself into thinking that being with a man, when the relationship is a shitty one, is better than being alone? How did I let myself think that my feelings weren't worth feeling? In retrospect, I see the extent to which that relationship caused me to see myself as a gendered stereotype. I saw myself as the nagging, clingy, ""bitchy"" girlfriend who needs to control her emotions. Ughh!!!

I don't really know what I'm looking for by posting this... I guess I just want to share what I have been discovering about myself in the past couple weeks... it is also lucky that I discovered the Fempire during this time, and finally feel like I have a safe space online to share these kinds of thoughts :)"

She was especially flirty with me, and we hung out a bit. I tried not to think much of it for fear of ending up in this mindset, but when I realized that I was the only intern that she treated this way, I got the balls up to ask her out. She says yes, but after a few days, the day before we were supposed to go, she tells me she's ""kind of in a relationship"" and proceeds to eventually divulge that it's not really one (bad sign already). At this point I cut my losses and keep my distance but don't do anything to be especially drastic. This year, we both come back to work, friendly but I don't hang out with her one-to-one. Funny thing is she's even more flirty now than last time, and she knows that I already fell for that once. Always begging me to hang out after work, although in groups, I just don't feel like doing something just because she asks (and this happens alot-she complains when I don't comply, but hey, I'm your friend and coworker, not your bitch). I feel like I should make it known that it's annoying and fucking with my head. What should I do? At this point I wouldn't even want to date her, needless to say.

Will the Real Accountant, Please Stand Up? – To the rhythm/beat (whatever) of “Slim Shady” by Eminem

May I have your attention please?
May I have your attention please? 
Will the real accountant, please stand up?
I repeat: Will the real accountant, please stand up?
We’re gonna have a problem here:

Y’all act like you’ve never seen a real audit before
Jaws all on the floor like Ernst and Young just burst through the door
Started sampling worse than before, going through drawers, turnin over furniture
It’s the return of the—aw wait, no wait, you’re kidding, he didn’t just say what I think he did…did he?
And Arthur Andersen said --- nothing you idiots Arthur Andersen’s dead, they’re all over the country

Feminist women love CPAs *chigga chigga chigga* “Deloitte, I’m sick of them, look at them
Walkin around, sampling you know what, interviewin you know who”
“yeah but they’re so efficient though” Yeah we probably got a couple of screws up in our head loose
But it’s no worse than what’s goin on inside your board room
Sometimes, we just want to leave our laptops and just let loose
But we can’t, so can we at least get some grey goose?

My rec is on your lips, my rec is on your lips, and if I’m lucky
You might just give me a little tip, and expect me not to know what the expenses balance is
Of course you’re gonna make me adjust entries, by the time I hit send re: here’s your reconciliation, reply please?
We ain’t nothin but camels, we go from audit to audit without stopping for even happy meals
But if we can balance budgets and fudge it through the audit, then there’s no reason that another
Auditor can’t get hope

If ya feel like I feel I got the antidote, seniors let us go on home, sing the chorus and it goes:

(Chorus – Repeat 2x)

I’m an accountant, yes I’m an accountant, all you other college majors are
finance and haters. So won’t the real accountant, please stand up? Please stand up? Please stand up?

You know, private companies don’t have to follow Sarbanes-Oxley. Well we do, so fuck that and fuck you too. You think we give a damn about your work flow? Half of you critics can’t even remember us, let alone understand us. 
But auditing, what if you weren’t, wouldn’t it be weird? Why, so you guys can just lie to keep me here, and sit me here next to Britney Spears, yo you know she needs an audit better switch me chairs, so I
Can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst, and hear em argue over who is goin bankrupt first
Lil Jon, he needs to file his 1040 and do it quick because it’s getting close to 10/15
I should download his audio on MP3 and show the whole world how we do our 1120’s
I’m sick of you little interns all you do is annoy me so I have been sittin here to destroy you
And there’s a million of us just like me, who dress like me, who just don’t give a fuck like me,
Walk talk and act like me and might just be the next best thing, but not quite me!

(chorus – 2x)

I’m like a head trip to listen to, cause I’m only giving you things you joke about in your cafeteria room,
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y’all and I don’t gotta
Be false and sugarcoat it all
I just get on Excel and hit it, and whether you like to admit it, I just did it 
Better than 90% of you associates out there and then you ask
“well how can firms take on these workloads in truckloads?” It’s funny, cause at the rate I’m going
When I’m 30, I’ll be the only person in the cubicle hurting, 
Crying to myself while outlook isn’t working, and the intern, he’s surfing 
The internet and isn’t working
And every single person is an accountant lurking 
He could be working around your state
Or checking out your LIBOR rate
Or in the parking lot, circling
Screaming “I NEED A BALL POINT PEN”, with his windows down and his notepad up

So will the real accountant please stand up and put one of those blue pencils in each hand up
And be proud to be out of your house and under control one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

(Chorus 4x)

x1wty,8,2012-07-23,Seddit I need your help to transition out of being a textbook beta,[deleted],seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/x1wty/seddit_i_need_your_help_to_transition_out_of/,"I've read all the side bar posts.  I've studied inner game. I think that I have begun to comprehend what it all means.  But I have no idea how to go about to bring this change into my life.  For example here is a quote from the inner game wiki post:

&gt; You do not NEED approval from others. Approval is something a high value individual doles out to others. Receiving approval is taking value. Seeking approval is being a value taker. YOU dole out the approval. YOU are approached by value takers. YOU are a value giver. Every person you encounter in your life is better off for having met you. Whether it's just a wave hello to a stranger, a compliment to your butcher, or a massive party you help organize and invite high value people to, you're enriching the lives of others. You are benevolent and compassionate. You look out for and protect the people in your life.

That's great and all, I now understand what a value giver is.  But how to I go about changing so that I transform from a value taker to a value giver? I'm experiencing the same thing with all the points of inner game; I can understand them, but dont know how to act on them.

What I've found is that I can understand the concepts presented to me by the seddit community but I have no idea of how to implement them. I feel like I've been overloaded with information but I have no idea what to do.

Heres a little background info on me, make of it as you will: 19 y/o, currently have an IT internship for the summer. Never had a girlfriend, been or a date or even kissed a girl for that matter.
Basically on mondays, tuesdays, wednesdays and fridays, I get up for work in the mornings, go to my internship, get home at 5, eat dinner, and watch tv or browse reddit the rest of the night, along with practicing my drums.  On wednesdays after dinner I go over to my friends house where we have our weekly ultimate game. Thursdays I have off work, which is occupied by tv and reddit, plus I have my drum lesson. On saturdays, sometimes I do something, sometimes I stay at home and do the usual reddit + tv, and sundays is the typical reddit/tv combo. When I was reading through the 8 characteristics of the modern alpha male the only one that applied to me was number two: be firm in your beliefs.  Whenever I hangout with people I am a textbook value taker, giving very little to the group in return.  Whats really weird is that my friends rarely text me or invite me to parties/events, but if we are at are weekly ultimate game even if an event hasn't been mentioned they will make sure to bring it up and invite me, and I have no idea why this is happening. 

I think part of it is because I value myself as an individual very lowly.  I am always very negative on myself, mainly because I can't see any positive characteristics of myself.  The only thing that I know I'm good at and that I feel confident about is computer programming. Anytime I find myself thinking there's a possibility I might be good at something else or enjoy something else my brain always tells me you suck at that, don't do that, that's not you etc.  Also what I have found is that in conversations (not necessarily with females but in general) is that I have no problem talking and carrying on a conversation, but that I often run out of content because my life is really boring and most people don't want to talk about programming stuff. In group conversations this leads to me being a fantastic listener but most of the time people forget I'm there. I learned about threading a couple days ago and have tried it out, but it wasn't really going that well.  

Another point is that I have what I guess I would call induced approach anxiety. I have no problem talking to women, however, because so many women in the past have rejected me/ignored me/etc, I have found myself unable to progress past opening and having pleasant conversation for fear of rejection. 

I'm trying to break out of this; today I went to the library and picked up some political philosophy books as well as ""How to win friends and influence people"" by Dale Carnegie, but I feel like that's not doing enough. 

So, Seddit, what should I do to stop being a beta?"

I went from ideas such as: 

1. Hey I wanna be an architect! - No... don't know have drawing talent and it seems like it isn't the best job to have now...
2. Programming! - Oh... but my math grades are pretty bad... wont't get in such a college...
3. Psychology! - Huh. Pretty much won't get in a good psychology college since the spots will be filled up by better people... and it's pretty expensive...
...
?. Medicine, way too expensive.
??. And finally, here I am thinking about getting into politics. But... it's a job for old people. And I'm not really into all that...

You may have noticed that I over think about jobs that actually pay well. I can't go for the stuff I prefer because I want a job with a future. Something that will eventually pay well too...

 **tl;dr**: Can't choose college at all. It's really a good time to make my mind already, and nobody around me is helping.(My rating of how well I do in subjects at school might help you help me, haha...)

Thank you so much if you will take the time to respond to something like this. You may even be a very big factor in this decision haha...

x1rvd,4,2012-07-23,College was a total waste of time and money ,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/x1rvd/college_was_a_total_waste_of_time_and_money/,"I am about to finish college (just need to end pass one summer class) and I feel angry. I spent my first year at a specialized art college but I realized that I wasn't cut out to work in that industry so I transferred another school. I figured, I would have a great time at my new school because I easily made lots of friends and had a great time at my old one.

It was a terrible decision. I had problems off the bat. My roommate turned out to be a lunatic who stalked and harassed me. The people were extremely unfriendly. They took one look at you and that was enough for them to dislike you and treat you like garbage. The classes all seemed to set everyone up for failure. Professors gave tons of busy work and had mandatory attendance policies. Cheating was so rampant. I studied and studied but some hungover fratboy who had an advanced copy of the test still managed to score better than me. Since everyone was a douchebag it was hard to even find people to study with. People here would sense weakness and use you, only to throw you out when you were no longer useful to them. Whenever I told anyone about my problems they basically said ""Don't like it here? GTFO. I don't give a hoot"". Although one person had the audacity to tell me ""Hardship makes your life more interesting!"".

My first two years there I tried everything to make friends. Initially I did meet an OK group of people but they ended up being monsters (thanks to aforementioned lunatic roommate). I tried clubs but they were all either cliquey and insular or turned into a second job. I had a part time job and held an internship but it just felt like resume padding. I managed to move away from the psychopath but I lived with random, often crazy people who would do things like forbid me from using common areas or throw parties every weekend and make it very clear that not only was I not invited, I shouldn't even be seen. Everyone around me was always having fun and socializing and couldn't even get that. Less said about romantic relationships the better. The only people who notice me are 50 year old maintenance personal who aren't exactly my type. I felt like I was in prison or that I died an went to some kind of existential hell. 

I began to wonder what is wrong with me. I'm in shape. I would be considered attractive by most peoples standards. I don't smell bad or have grooming issues and I dress like a normal person. Prior to coming here I was bubbly and outgoing but now I am a lot quieter and a lot less warm. I'm going back to school for something you don't even need a bachelors for and I'm angry that I wasted the best years of my youth trapped at such an awful place. It was like getting sent to a minimum security prison but having to pay for it.

Sorry about the length but I just lost 3 good years of my life."
x1rml,40,2012-07-23,Why I LOVED UCSD,postucsd,UCSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/x1rml/why_i_loved_ucsd/,"First of all, to the incoming freshmen and transfer class ... CONGRATS! You're in for a fun ride! I just wanted to take this time to tell you why I thought that my time at UCSD was hands down the best college experience I could have asked for. I'm going to say straight up that it wasn't easy (I was a computer engineering major), but the memories I made, the friendships I created, and the educational opportunities I received were simply second to none. 

First I'm going to start off by addressing a HUGEEEEEE MISCONCEPTION (prospective students listen carefully). I think that our status as a socially dead university is grossly over exaggerated. OK SURE we don't have a frat row or many people around our campus at night/weekends, but you can be rest assured that the students here can (and do) party hard. If you go to sungod you'll know what I'm talking about. I admit the first few years I was sad that we didn't have a football team to go crazy for or a legit frat row on campus, but I went to my fair share of fun house parties (my liver can attest to this). My best advice is to honestly buckle down and get a lot of classes out of the way while you're not 21. SD is probably one of the best places to be in the US when you're of age... trust me. I took a lot of my harder courses in the first 2 years of my college career and really had a lot of fun once I turned 21. Go to the beach, make a lot of friends, host fun house parties and learn a lot of drinking games while you're young. Go to taco Tuesdays to world famous. Try out wing weds at pizza port or wacky Wednesdays at the bowling alley (they have a sweet deal). Pick up surfing during the weekend. And of course eat at all the AWESOME MEXICAN FOOD PLACES (lolitas, vajartas, lucha libra) all day every day. There are so many things SD has to offer. Don't be hung up on the fact that our campus is kind of empty. We're a commuter school its bound to happen. Once you find your awesome group of friends you can just wait a year or two and party with all SD has to offer. Go to PB every Thursday AHHAHAh. DO Check out downtown, northpark, and Mission beach.We may not have a college town but these are just AWESOME places to party. Throw in a trip to LA and Vegas once in a while and you're golden. I think my 4th year I went to Vegas like 6 times ahahaha. I studied my ass off my first few years at ucsd while attending a healthy dose of house/frat parties so that my workload would be a LOT more chill when I turned 21. It worked out for the best ahah. My best advice for the first few years is to find awesome people to chill with. Have a couple throwbacks and bp tournaments and party HARD later with said friends. I was lucky because everyone I met first year ended up being my best buds throughout my whole 4 years. But yeah DON""T be shy and DO be as outgoing as you can during your first few years.

Now that I've (hopefully) convinced you that UCSD is not as socially dead as the naysayers want you to believe, I want to say that SD gives a top notch education (esp in the sciences and esp esp in CS). Whether it is getting accepted to top notch med/law/grad school, working for a fortune 500 company, or even doing a start up, the accomplishments of my friends never cease to amaze me. I was so surprised that a lot of my peers got what they wanted especially in this troubled job market and weak economy. I am really happy where I ended up as well :). Lets just say that I did not think that I would be able to work for this company when I started my schooling at SD. I want to emphasize the importance of doing things during their summers. DON""T just go back home and waste your months. I know its hard but during your 1st and 2nd summer as a college student TRY AS HARD AS YOU CAN TO GET WHATEVER EXPERIENCE YOU CAN IN THE FIELD YOU ARE INTERESTED IN. Be a volunteer if that's what it will take. Find research, take whatever job, if all else fails JUST TEACH YOURSELF SOMETHING. Do your own project if you really can't get anything. Just don't let that time go. I know a lot of people that put off their first two summers thinking that they had a lot of time to make up for it or feeling inadequate about how little they knew. JUST DO SOMETHING. It is extremely difficult to nab that crucial 3rd year internship without any outside of school experience. With that said, I would say that there are a lot of opportunities UCSD has to offer, especially for science related fields. Whether you go out and look for/nab these opportunities is all on you.I think though for more business orientated people it might be harder to find gigs but then again we don't have a major in business (but we do have a minor). 

I hope there aren't any spelling or grammatical errors (we engineers are not known for our eloquent writing). There are just so many awesome things that UCSD has to offer. My post only really scratches the surface :). Don't let the quarter system get you down guys. These years can be some of the best years of your lives. Don't take that for granted. :)"
x1qo3,2,2012-07-23,First ever break-up... happened about an hour ago.,[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/x1qo3/first_ever_breakup_happened_about_an_hour_ago/,"I'm 23M she's 23F, we had been going out for about 8 months.

I feel like shit right now but not quite as bad as I thought... I kinda saw it coming but then again not really... It was going so great between us for the first five months, I would see her every weekend, and occasionally on weekdays when work would allow it (she was doing an internship). Then when my semester ended we spent a week together it went great.

Afterwards I left on a trip for 2 months, didn't do anything stupid, missed her like crazy.... When I came back I could feel things were a bit different. She was a bit rude with me sometimes and was reluctant to activities with me. We got a couple arguments, she would tell me she wants to be alone or with her friends but I hadn't seen her in 2 months so of course I wanted to see her. Then things started going good, we would go out to eat, to see movies, cudle like before, she would be happy to see me and all that.

But today, we were leaving her parents' cottage after a wonderful evneing. We had sex in the morning like before, joked around, and I felt great.

Couple hours ago, she shows up to my door and tells me it doesn't work. She doesn't love me anymore and it's not working. I was pretty devasted because I REALLY loved her. We spoke for 3 hours, we were both crying and holding each other, I tried to get reasons out of her but she just wants to be alone, and says its not the same with me.

I feel not bad right now, but when the memories start flowing in I break the fuck down. I don't know if things will get worse... My biggest fear is seeing her with other guys. She has a lot of guy friends lurking aorund and I'm afraid that's why she broke up with me... 

I told her I don't want to see her again, at least for a while and she started crying hysterically, I don't fucking get it. If it hurts her so much why did she break up with me? I still love the shit out of her and don't know to do. I felt like writing this to vent though. 

Cheers."
x1pzm,0,2012-07-23,What is a professional way to deal with a student/intern plagiarist?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/x1pzm/what_is_a_professional_way_to_deal_with_a/,"Of whom, I am not their supervisor and I’m certainly not the head of any department.  Because the last time I confronted one of our students I was far too angry to go about it gracefully. (/TL;DR)  

I work in a healthcare facility and we have students come in for different types of internships.  Some require they observe for a week, others require months of participation as members of a department under the supervision of a licensed professional.  The students who are with us for two to three months are required to complete a project and give a presentation to most or all of the relevant department(s) during a mutual break (sometimes we’d get fed too!).  

Please note, first of all, the student was in a doctoral program (not MD, but PhD kind of doctorate.)

What I watched, as fellow member of the department, was the student plagiarize his PowerPoint presentation, and present it as his own work without any sources.  How did I know, you ask? 

I became suspicious when the presentation didn’t appear to be cohesive, but that could’ve just been a sign of working to the last minute. I wasn’t happy to see large chunks of texts without any citation, but maybe there would be credit at the end.  Sloppy work, but not worth vilifying the presenter.  

Then the font size occasionally changed without any apparent reason, and text appeared out of line.  Finally, the double bullets were the unambiguous sign that he had copied and pasted from another list somewhere.  I took out my smart phone and wrote a sentence into google closed in quotes.  LO AND BEHOLD, the same chunk of text appeared on an advocacy/education site.  I do it again when he advanced slides, and more information from the web shows up word-for-word in the top google result.  

I am vibrating with anger at this point.  I look around at my colleagues to see if anyone else has noticed, but they are all placidly watching the student talk.

Finally it ends.  No slide citing of any sources.  He asks if there are any questions.

I do not remember exactly what I asked, but it was about where he got his information.  Things went downhill from there.  He attempted to brush off my question, saying everything was his own work.  He wouldn’t plagiarize, NEVER.  I was mistaken.  I remember him asking why I was so angry, like it wasn’t a big deal.  

I showed him what I found and had saved to my phone.  That I could tell by the shoddy formatting. That it is a violation of academic and professional ethics to present someone else’s words as your own.

That’s when he started complaining about the time frame for the project and being given very little direction on how to proceed.   He apologized.  He’d spoken with a previous student who did practically the same thing he just did.  He apologized and apologized.  He would never do this, normally.  It was only this once, and had no bearing on his character.  I shouldn’t think so badly of him. This was a one-time thing.

In my mind, and I told him so, nothing excused plagiarizing, and it certainly didn’t excuse presenting the whole thing to a room full of people.  He showed an utter lack of respect by plagiarizing, and doing it so obviously.  What he did here made all of his other coursework suspect.  What would we see if we put his presentation through TurnItIn?  This could cost him the passing grade, and get him into a great deal of trouble with his supervisor and his school.  Students have failed courses and been expelled from schools for plagiarism.  This should not be taken lightly.

This went on for a good fifteen minutes.  I was riding on the adrenaline rush of anger.  I’m sure I looked scary to the people watching.

The end of the lunch hour brought an awkward end to the whole thing.  No one spoke, neither to me nor to him.  His supervisor, watching in the back of the room said nothing.  Everyone cleaned up, and I went up to the computer/projector to show him the evidence against him (he really, really didn’t understand the double bullet thing).  The rest of the day was largely quiet, and I was tired.

What could I have done differently?

I ask you about this, Reddit, because I have gotten a WIDE range of reactions to the incident.  Healthcare professionals outside my department and facility have defended my actions to one degree or another.  Non-healthcare workers think it’s hilarious.  A few colleagues gave me a thumbs up, while others I work with quietly took me aside and said I should have handled it differently, taking him aside and out of public space as they did me.  I embarrassed the student in front of his supervisor and the department.  I left a good student with a negative experience, and he may not want to work with us in the future. 

The student’s actual supervisor never once spoke to me about it.  I was so thrown by pulling a Bruce Banner --&gt; Hulk I shied away from asking about their take on it.

On the one hand, yes that wasn’t the best way to go about it…  However, I can’t help but feel that telling him one-to-one would have let him think “oh, only one person noticed, and it wasn’t my supervisor. Meh.”  I honestly don’t know if taking it straight to his supervisor would have changed anything, especially since it’s clear he passed the internship and graduated from his school.  Public shaming seems to have been the extent of his punishment.

But as far as efficacy goes, I think I gave him a good scare and showed him he’s not as good at BSing as he thinks he is.  

Ultimately, what I did was unprofessional, no matter how justified my actions.  I need to do better in the future.  So, the question is, what’s the better thing to do professionally?"

Just to clarify, I don't have a place yet. I'm living with a roommate near the Myrtle JMZ currently, but my sublet ends at the end of August and I'd like to get my own place by then, preferably with a cool new roommate or two!

About me: I'm a 22 year old male, just graduated from a college in DC. I moved up here for a summer internship at a tech startup that turned in to a full time job. I'm pretty easy to live with: not home that often as I work long hours in the city, pretty clean but not a clean freak. I might take up cooking once I move in to a more permanent place, but you probably wouldn't want to eat any of my shitty food anyways. I'm 420 friendly and generally just a friendly, laid-back person in general. 

Have a girlfriend back in DC who will stay for the weekend every once in a while - I'll be gone for the weekend with equal frequency to balance that out.

I'm definitely not trying to create some sort of 'artist community' or anything similar, just an apartment with two or three people who can relate on some basic level.

About you: Around my age, male/female/whatever, working professional or serious student. Work hard + play hard attitude is great. Preferably you'd be down for a few beers every once in a while just so we don't feel like we're living with strangers. Clean and considerate. 

About the place we'd be looking for: Decent 2- or 3-br around Myrtle JMZ or any of the Bushwick L stops. Most rooms of that size around here have recently renovated kitchen / floor and nice creature comforts. This area is at a great intersection of price, proximity to manhattan and wburg, and quality housing. We'd definitely be able to get a nice kitchen and living room, and possibly access to a yard.

If this sounds appealing to you, please email me at bushwick.roommates@gmail.com , I won't check this reddit acct for messages.

##Rules Because We Are Grown-Ups and Grown-Ups Love Rules

Welcome new users. If you have no idea what TestPAC is, you're in the right place. This is our weekly wednesday meeting thread where we discuss the current state of TestPAC. Upon posting of this thread, the previous week's thread will be considered closed. Id like to remind our users of the ideal format for these threads. 

**The opening responses should always be in the form of a question.**

For anyone who is curious, I always downvote the question posts as I'm often asking questions that I'm not necessarily looking to promote within the group. I'd like to suggest people do the same unless they specifically support the inquiry they're posing to the subforum.

There were a couple responses in the previous meeting threads that listed a number of suggestions, however it's very difficult to determine if the upvotes these posts received were in reference to some or all of their suggestions. 

*Please try to stick to this format if you'd like your individual ideas to be placed up for group vote.* 

We do appreciate your opinions but any suggestion lists would be better suited for their own threads.

 - User asynchrnouschat has also show interest and has posted an AMA [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/testpac/comments/www3x/id_like_to_be_involved_ama/).

Once the board is approved, there will be a 2-3 week transition phase. There are two big things we’d like an accomplish during the transition phase, and we will want the community’s help on both of them.

##Issues Brought Up This Week

- There has been some issue with the process of restaffing our board positions where a number of things should be reiterated to keep everyone on the same page. To bring everyone up to speed, we have to choose a board of directors for TestPAC as the current leadership will unfortunately be leaving their positions. We will be conversing with our applicants via their AMAs and once the AMAs are complete. In next week's meeting thread, we should discuss this further pending their completion. Please try to avoid discussing the AMAs as they progress as it will be much easier to keep all discussion together. Once we've had a chance to discuss this, the applicants will be placed to a vote and our new board will be chosen. 

There is a mandatory Treasurer position that requires knowledge of the system and experience with filing the necessary documents to keep the PAC in legal compliance. Aside from this position, there is nothing required of the board other than to handle the finances and hopefully give direction to the group. As stated by Lead Advisor masstermind:

&gt;The mandatory responsibilities of a PAC are very minimal. You could start a PAC right now, as long as you can handle the reporting, because that's pretty much your only legal responsibility. What we need to think about in terms of a new board is picking people who will ensure the longevity of TestPAC. However, that is not done through just knowning the mandatory responsibilities as outlined by the FEC, it is done through winning campaigns, and therefore raising money and taking the actions necessary to win campaigns. We need people who can do that, and more importantly, have proven that they can done that through their past experiences.

The existing board members have requested that we include an “Emeritus Advisory Board” position.

 - DrowningSink [has suggested](http://www.reddit.com/r/testpac/comments/wsf1c/testpac_weekly_meeting_thread_july_18th_2012/c5g3bwk) and [begun work](http://www.reddit.com/r/testpac/comments/x5b4v/draft_of_rpolitics_survey/) on our proposed survey of /r/politics.

 - We showed negligible interest in [Darcy Burner](http://www.reddit.com/r/testpac/comments/wsf1c/testpac_weekly_meeting_thread_july_18th_2012/c5g0zne) and negligible disinterest in [Karlo Dizon](http://www.reddit.com/r/testpac/comments/wsf1c/testpac_weekly_meeting_thread_july_18th_2012/c5g0zqj). There was the idea of throwing out a couple of questions in the /r/politics post asking for [five possible candidates](http://www.reddit.com/r/testpac/comments/wsf1c/testpac_weekly_meeting_thread_july_18th_2012/c5gz8nm) where we could have a positive effect. There should be significant time placed into what we decide to post to /r/politics as they require their content to be as relevant as possible.

 - We’d like to [re-write the bylaws](http://www.reddit.com/r/testpac/comments/x2sxq/call_for_vote_on_test_pac_bylaws/) so that they are more applicable to TestPAC in its current form.

 - We’d like to create a document detailing the purpose, goals, and mission statement of the PAC.

There has also been discussion brought up this week about the formation of a [media wing](http://www.reddit.com/r/testpac/comments/x26k7/how_does_testpac_feel_about_a_media_wing/).

I highly encourage all of our users to post their open questions to this thread. Not to keep treading over the same point, but this is everyone's PAC and your input is needed to keep the pulse of this subreddit going.

Please let me know if I've made any inaccurate inferences from the data or missed any information from the previous thread so I can correct the OP as necessary. Any oversights are entirely unintentional and I will correct them as quickly as possible.  Please keep in mind that suggesting something in a previous thread by no means requires you to support it in this thread but I made my best attempt to include as much information from the previous thread as possible.


##Last but not least, guys even if you don't agree with what's being said, any posts made about the structure of the PAC shouldn't be downvoted. These things are posted to keep everyone aware of what's going on here, good or bad. Downvoting relevant content screws up the visibility of news to new users."

x5quf,5,2012-07-25,I am absolutely terrified of growing older. I get stomach pain and anxiety when I think about it.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/x5quf/i_am_absolutely_terrified_of_growing_older_i_get/,"I am 23. A senior in college. Ill be turning 24 in the beginning of 2013 and whenever it crosses my mind it makes me want to puke. I think its because I dont have a career in line, or even an internship. I search everyday and apply weekly, its almost an obsession. Whats strange is that i do a lot of action sports, when it come to that im fearless. Ive had dozens of stitches, bruises, concussions, etc.. but turning 24 next year and not graduating or having a career in line makes me want to jump off a bridge.

 I force myself to improve everyday, physically and mentally. Now I don't even like to go home or talk to my relatives because I am so ashamed that I havent graduated with my BS and that I am still selling furniture at my work to pay my bills, when people around me have legitimate jobs they can put on a resume.

I have lots of fun, I mountain bike everyday. I go up to lake tahoe every week to adventure, get drunk in the woods, swim in the lake. During winter I snowboard about 3-4 times a week. I live a pretty good life, I support myself for the most part, except for a loan to fix my car recently.  My parents are smart and successful, they didnt even try to set me up for college, they are pretty accepting, but they let me know i must work hard to get to where they are in life, so no pressure issues from them.

 I have lost several relationships with girls because when i start thinking about it i cant sleep for days, im like a zombie and im paranoid. They everntually cant take it, I dont whine about it but they just dont want to be around me. It happens every couple weeks and for the last 2 years Ive just dranken my anxiety away, not an alcoholic issue but i want to learn to get it out of my head without a couple shots of whiskey. All i want in life is to hook up with a career, work my ass off so i can clock out and go have fun until I have to go to bed. Wow, I feel a bit better now."

I don't know why I am sharing my boring life with the internet, but I guess maybe some people can make me feel better even if it is for just a few minutes. 

I am enrolled in a high-profile university, but I am not a top-notch student. I am lazy as hell, I got through highschool with good grades just because I seem to can filter important from not so important in shorter time than other. I had not a huge circle of friends during the time, but I got a few and I would never say I missed out anything. I was the only of our nerdy group that had a girlfriend and my life was going well. Then we all graduated and our ways seperated. 

A lot of my friends moved away to go to colleges, but since my parents are hit hugely by the recession, we got no money and my parents can't support me that way. I ain't sad about that, that's how is life and luckily we have this high-profile university in the next biggest town. I applied and I don't know how I got in, but I did it. Funnily someone I graduated with and knew from early childhood applied too and was accepted to the same course. I was kinda happy to have a local when I would commute daily the 60km to university, but on the other side he was always someone I could not really grasp from his personality. He was a real elitist, which is easily shown in his  grades. But that comes more down the road into action. 

For me I thought this could be new start with new friends and awesome experiences, but now the distance to my home was a real problem. If I wanted to spontaneously do something with my new friends I had to go 1h 30 min by train. + The train only drives during the day. No partying and coming home late at night. That way I never really bonded with them and I was ""stuck"" with my local buddy. Well the first year went well he had exceptional grades and I had okish grades, but I really started to despise the learning for tests. Well second year comes around and my buddy got accepted into a more elite part of the university where he got personal treatment and personal mentors and all that stuff. I was happy for him, but then he changed. He started to become a real dick. He made me feel really bad and became really selfish. I did not at that time wanted to loose the friendship with him. So i just manned up and took all the stuff he said. About 2 months ago now my limit was reached and I basically told him to get the fuck out of my life and believe me I told him a lot of times before that he should be a little more friendly, but it was like talking to a wall.

Plus I got more and more sick of the system at university with the neverending learning. I can't do it anymore, I had no break from learning for 15 years, if you total it, and my social life is completly broke for about a year. I had decided that I would take a break from university after this term to make an internship in the sector I am studying to get my ehad free of the learning stuff and maybe see what I can do in terms of my social life. But now I am at the point I can't even go through the exams without being just completly struck. I can't even explaing it, it is like my brain having a conversation about how I should learn right now, but my body has not the power to grab for the books.

 To add onto this I had many interviews for internships after this semster and I have now 23 declined applications after I have been at an interview. I am at the moment trying to plan out to volunteer at various places around Europe to clear my mind and find my motivation, but the more I look for such stuff even with help of redditors. I can't find stuff. In this whole process I did pretty muchtold  none of my parents or friends only until the end where I asked my dad about advice and he doesn't want me to take a break to volunteer, and he pretty much got me singlehandely an internship at a big reputable firm, becaue he still had connections. But to be honest I am at the point where I can't even finish this semester, I just want to go and find my luck on my own way. I know how this has to sound from someone outside. Your dad got you everything you wanted and you won't accept it.

I just don't know what to do. Especially since my nevers can't take the upcoming exams either way which are pretty much the prerequisites for the internship. 

Sorry for this way too long text and throw-away account, but I just needed this out of my system.

P.S.: Sorry for any grammar and punctuation mistakes."

I was trying to get a teaching job through a district intern credential program, but I can't seem to find work. My apartment lease is up at the end of August. My boyfriend lives with me and just graduated college with a BA in Religious studies and a minor in political science (he already regrets it). His intern IT job ends at the end of the summer so he is looking for a job as well, but he has been supporting us for the last month. I have 0 savings, and no money, because I've been looking for a job since May. I do not have a car, but my boyfriend does and lets me use it all the time.


So here's the deal: my boyfriend and I need jobs, and are willing to relocate ANYWHERE in the world as long as we have jobs. At the end of August, if we still are jobless, my bf and I will have to move in with my parents and my 5 young brothers (ages 3 to 7). 

I don't have a full credential so I can't do teaching, and I don't have ece units so I can't work at a daycare or preschool - but as you will see almost all of my work experience is with kids. I have no idea what my career is going to be now. 

I'm posting my resume (minus some #'s) so I can get good advice from anyone who reads this. What kind of work do you think I could get a job in? Any tips? Is there a good place to move to get a job?

x5kpu,3,2012-07-25,what's the point ?,IjustCantStandThings,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/x5kpu/whats_the_point/,"I'm 24

I was in a long distance relationship for 4 years (broke off a year ago). Even though my ex girlfriend was adorable on some levels, she was way too overly attached and I couldn't stand it any more. She could have jealousy crises for just about anything even though there was no reason to have them. She was my first and only girlfriend.

But now, one year later I feel lonely as hell. 

I'm doing an intern-ship that I can barely stand, all that to get a job that I'll probably not like either. I slack off as hell during the intern-ship because I don't even understand what the hell I'm doing there. I don't understand what's the point in doing that shit ? The last two intern-ships went OK. But this one is in a big city where I barely know anybody and plus the work I've been given is just not captivating me at all. To be honest, I feel useless and not good enough.

We're all supposed to work at least 40 years in our life. All my life at the moment is work. And I hate it. I can't even see myself finishing the intern-ship. 

We're supposed to ""suck it up"" and work to get money. But what for ? Why ? To be able to continue working ? To do the same crap over and over again just to eat and sleep. I spend so much time in commute (2 to 2.5 hours a day) that when I come back to the flat all I can do is cook, eat and watch an episode or two of a series and go to bed. The week-end I'm too burnt out to feel like doing anything.

All of this would be much less of a pain if I had a girlfriend. But that seems impossible. My ex-girlfriend already seemed like a one in a lifetime thing, ie a girl that can accept me as a huge sensitive geek. I'm way too much of a SAP to even be able to approach women. I don't think I'm unattractive, sometimes women look at me. But I don't have anything to say to them, I lack the courage to go and talk to them. I'm almost positive that I'll bore the hell out of them like the few other girls I've tried to approach in high school (I was studying computer science in university and there were no girls). And even if I did, I'm too scared they'll crush my fragile heart. I'm also incapable of telling if a girl is interested in me or not, I'm completely oblivious.

By working in the computer science field, there's no chance I'll even be able to meet a girl. There is the one female intern at my job but she already has a boyfriend and I seem to not be fun enough. I also hate going out in public places. I don't feel comfortable at all in those places.

All what's happening now is that I'm looking at my life going down the drain and feel helpless. And I especially don't see the point in fighting back. I'm not going to miraculously find a group of friends, a girlfriend and an interesting job. I don't feel capable of doing it. I feel like a completely bland person, which is not a trait other people look for in friends.

I have a couple of friends, but I don't feel comfortable talking about this shit to them. My family never takes me seriously. And my cat is at home, not where I'm living at for the intern-ship, so I can't cuddle with her.

I just needed to say all of this, even though nobody will read. And if someone does, don't get me wrong, I'm not thinking of committing suicide. The idea of death scares me way too much to do that.

**TL;DR Broke up with girlfriend 1 year ago, feel lonely as hell, shit intern-ship and don't feel any motivation in anything. Can't understand the point in having to work all my life to to ""live""**

I have a BA in psychology and 50 credits towards a 60 credit clinical masters that I have decided not to peruse (in this economy). I'm turning 30 in 5 days, I feel stuck, and need help.

My dream job is one that allows me to physically help the earth and its people. I want to be involved with green energy, sustainability, and the environment. Id also like if some of the job description involves going overseas to help villages in crises or install green infrastructure. These three things have always been passions of mine and I never thought to explore them as a career. I keep current with world news, green energy breakthroughs and the environment. I love the earth and the idea of sustainability, no matter how farfetched it seems. I am very mechanically inclined and computer savoy. 

I'd like to be financially secure making at least $40,000 a year. I have long term goals of home ownership and a family one day so I can't do the volunteer, internship, Americore type thing.  I am looking for an actual carrier / job in this field. The happiness I would have working my dream job would trump the lower income. I'd rather be outside helping the earth for $40,000 than in an office all day making $60,000. 

I'm also a documentary photographer and would love to behind the scenes taking photographs. 

I'd appreciate any guidance, any suggestions, and any leads. 
Thank you reddit.

x5hgk,11,2012-07-25,The past 30 days of my life.,wingnutua32,selfhelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/x5hgk/the_past_30_days_of_my_life/,"Hey guys, this is my first time posting anything on Reddit but the past month or so of my life has been a roller coaster, to say the very least. I decided to write about what has happened and how I have learned to better myself for the future. I thought I would share it and maybe provide hope to others.




The past 30 days have been some of the most tumultuous of my entire life. I graduated college a little over a month ago with a degree in Business Administration specializing in Marketing. I had no job but a “promising” internship that I had hoped would lead to a full time offer. I had a girlfriend of almost a year, who I saw as potentially someone I would spend the rest of my life with. My life was going great and I was on the right side of the tracks……Then that all changed.


After graduation I went on vacation with my family to North Carolina for a week, a celebration of sorts, for obtaining my degree. I returned a week later and within days of returning I received a text message from my girlfriend saying “I need to talk to you about something.” I didn’t need to be a rocket scientist to know what that means. My girlfriend broke up with me, telling me the typical cliché “it’s not you, it’s me” and “I don’t feel the same way anymore.” At the time I was devastated, we had spoken about “us” long term and marriage 48 hours prior to her breaking up with me. We had known each other since freshman year and had a myriad of mutual friends. Coincidentally, I learned at my “promising” internship that same week that there would not be a job offer for me at the end of the summer.


At this point, I felt like life had pushed me into a hole with no chance of climbing out. No job and lost my girlfriend all in the same week, the phrase “great things happen all at once” didn’t exactly fit. I just wanted to give up, I had applied to more than 50 jobs by the first week of July (I have the spreadsheet to prove it) with all them saying “I wasn’t who they were looking for.” I also was lucky enough to see my ex-girlfriend make out with some guy less than a week after we broke up. I was angry, depressed, sad, hurt, basically every sad adjective in the book. Thankfully, through a strong support system from my family and friends, I was helped from the bottomless hole life put me in.


I was more motivated than ever to prove myself right and put the past behind me. I applied to every job under the sun. I networked whenever and wherever. I accepted every cup of coffee and went to every happy hour. I told myself its not “if I get a job, it’s when I get a job.” I only allowed positive thoughts to run through my head.


Through patience and perseverance, I received a full time offer last week from a great company. I wouldn’t have been able to write this if it wasn’t for my constant networking and my pursuit of every opportunity. I will never forget the moment when I received the phone call from the human resources department saying, “We would like to extend an offer to you.” I knew my life was going to change immediately. I no longer had to worry about going back to my parents’ house or brown nose at my “promising” internship.


The reason I wrote this was to remind myself to never give up hope. Life will knock you down, it is your choice if you want to get back up and keep fighting. If you want something bad enough, you will get it. Maybe not tomorrow or the day after, but through patience and determination you will achieve your goals.



Hopefully, I did this right. Please take this however you want, I really wanted to share this."

My girlfriend broke up with me, telling me the typical cliché “it’s not you, it’s me” and “I don’t feel the same way anymore.”  At the time I was devastated, we had spoken about “us” long term and marriage 48 hours prior to her breaking up with me.  We had known each other since freshman year and had a myriad of mutual friends.  Coincidentally, I learned at my “promising” internship that same week that there would not be a job offer for me at the end of the summer.


At this point, I felt like life had pushed me into a hole with no chance of climbing out.  No job and lost my girlfriend all in the same week, the phrase “great things happen all at once” didn’t exactly fit.  I just wanted to give up, I had applied to more than 50 jobs by the first week of July (I have the spreadsheet to prove it) with all them saying “I wasn’t who they were looking for.”  I also was lucky enough to see my ex-girlfriend make out with some guy less than a week after we broke up.  I was angry, depressed, sad, hurt, basically every sad adjective in the book.  Thankfully, through a strong support system from my family and friends, I was helped from the bottomless hole life put me in.  


I was more motivated than ever to prove myself right and put the past behind me.  I applied to every job under the sun.  I networked whenever and wherever.  I accepted every cup of coffee and went to every happy hour.  I told myself its not “if I get a job, it’s when I get a job.”  I only allowed positive thoughts to run through my head.  


Through patience and perseverance, I received a full time offer last week from a great company.  I wouldn’t have been able to write this if it wasn’t for my constant networking and my pursuit of every opportunity.  I will never forget the moment when I received the phone call from the human resources department saying, “We would like to extend an offer to you.”  I knew my life was going to change immediately.  I no longer had to worry about going back to my parents’ house or brown nose at my “promising” internship.  


The reason I wrote this was to remind myself to never give up hope.  Life will knock you down, it is your choice if you want to get back up and keep fighting.  If you want something bad enough, you will get it.  Maybe not tomorrow or the day after, but through patience and determination you will achieve your goals.  

Hopefully, I did this right.  Please take this however you want, I really wanted to share this.

x5d35,3,2012-07-25,Help powering a PWM fan,GreyPooponPoop,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/x5d35/help_powering_a_pwm_fan/,"For an internship I'm working, I have been asked to design a circuit for a pwm fan, including a microcontroller.  There are a great deal of examples on the internet, but my mentor has asked for one requirement that I cannot figure out.

The fan has to be functional between 12 and 48V. Most of the examples I've seen just draw power from a Molex connector or something similar, but This particular application (because of confidentiality I can't be much more specific) needs to draw power from outside the device and its not always the same amount of power.
Most of the microcontrollers that I've looked at have much narrower ranges.  Even if I used a simple resistor voltage-divider, no combination could shape these voltages to fit in a 2.2:5V or similar range.

I'm still in the very early parts of the design process, and I have very little experience in this field, so if any more information is needed, just let me know."

I believe I am very qualified as I have a 3.5 GPA and am a scholar athlete at a D1 school. I am currently pursuing a BS in Finance and am planning on getting a MS in Accounting right after undergraduate before sitting for the CPA. I also have competent Chinese conversational skills so I believe that is a plus.

Unfortunately I do not have any connections so I am unable to talk with any current agents to ask some questions about if my educational plans are the best route to take. I am really passionate about going into the field and becoming a special agent but do not know what the best way to approach this goal is. I know the process is very long and competitive and would like some advice to give myself the best chance to make the cut. I was hoping I could ask any redditors familiar with this field for some help!!

And as a side question - I unfortunately tried marijuana earlier this summer for the first time and found out that the FBI does not allow anyone who has smoked in the last 3 years to apply. I was hoping to apply right as I turned 23 and finished school but since I am 21 should I wait until I'm 24? Also I was thinking about applying for the FBI Honors Intern Program but they also enforce the same drug policies. Will they be as strict with the internship or should I just not apply for it at all? I would really like to because I believe it would be a big leg up for getting into the FBI but do not want to apply for the internship if it will ruin my chances of getting the job in the future because of my use of marijuana.

Sorry for the long post - Any help would be very appreciated!!!"

NEED HELP",hiddensidepr,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/x54u7/cant_take_this_anymore_its_been_a_year_still_cant/,"This is my story… I apologize for this long story that I will write but I just need to vent.  I met what I taught back then what was the most beautiful, smart an awesome woman I’ve ever had the pleasure to meet in my life. 

In June of 2011, 13 students of my college got selected for a summer internship with a well recognized Top 500 Forbes company. I was one of them as you can imagine.  Half of us arrive in late may of the program &amp; the other half arrived in June 4th.

I still remember how everything was before meeting this woman.  This was my second time returning to the company as an intern. I was single &amp; enjoying life was not even thinking of being in a relationship because I did not felt the need of being in one. I was enjoying my single life so much. Focusing on my career and so on..

I had a female friend who before me coming to the internship had approach me to let me know that a friend of hers was coming to the internship also but was really nervous because it was her first time as an intern in any company.  Let’s refer to this woman as Angelica (My ex).  So I go and tell her hey, tell your friend to not worry.  Give her my number and FB profile &amp; tell her that we will have a blast, I will show her the way through the program.   I was being as friendly as I could be because that the type of person I am.

So fast-forward to June 4th 2011, Angelica arrives to the apt were we are all living, so she calls me and the first thing she says is... I arrived!!! But I’m in a crisis I need to go to Wal-Mart and buy some lady stuff. We both laugh through the phone &amp; I told her hey ,don’t worry let me go down and get you &amp; I will take to Wal-Mart .

When I go &amp; get her…  I was blown away by her beauty!!!  We both stared at each other for like a minute. It was an instantaneous attraction between the both of us what occurred that day. I immediately knew that I liked her &amp; that we would hook up during the 10 week program. 

This is when everything started…   as you can expect we clicked immediately; we were super attracted to each other, so on the upcoming weeks we got more involved with each other.  Our relationship was so intense and her personality, charisma, the way she treated me &amp; the intimacy we had was the most fulfilling thing I’ve ever experienced. 

Now… here are the red flags that I ignored &amp; bit me in the ass that till this day has crushed my soul into oblivion.

When I met her she had just broken up from a 5years relationship with her ex-boyfriend. She had been broken up not even a month when we met.  By the second week we had our first kiss &amp; by the 4th week we had sex for the first time.  

During the summer she had explained to me what happened between her ex &amp; her.  I told her , be honest &amp; tell me what you plan to do because I am developing strong feelings for you and I don’t want to get hurt in the long run.  She goes and tells me everything its over bla bla bla!  Like a fool I believed her.. :(

After the program finishes we return to our campus &amp; from there we keep ongoing with our relationship.  For 8 month we had the most intense &amp; beautiful relationship. I came to love this woman with my soul.  She fueled me in such a way that I managed to do better in other areas of my life. She complemented me in a way that I felt she was the one!  

But at the same time her ex boyfriend during those 8 month kept calling her and texting her, trying to get back with her.  I always knew about this because she would show me the text and phone calls.  To which I had suggested her to block the number. But she never did..

Suddenly by our 5th month  I notice her very distant and I knew this was the beginning of the breakup,  I got so nervous &amp; panic because I felt how I was losing her for no reason at all.  I could have not been better than what I was as her boyfriend.  Suddenly she tells me she thinks this will not work out …  I immediately start crying because I could not understand why she would leave me after all we have been through.  She would constantly say things like she loved me.. I was the most influential person she has ever had in her life. No man had treated her the way I did &amp; that I was the most complete gentleman she had ever encounter.

She started by saying that she needed time for herself, blab la bla. For me all of this is bullshit.  Now I get pissed because I felt like I got screwed. The reason for this is because in her 5 years of relationship with her ex,  she had broken up multiples times with him and each time she would break up she would meet someone start a relationship with them, then would end it and come back to her ex.  Therefore I was a rebound.

Back then when she breaks the news of breaking up,  I begged her not to, So in a way I forced the next 3 month of the relationship. During those 3 month she would get annoyed by the most bullshit things. One time I got so consumed by a project that I arrived late to her apt &amp; because of that she gave me a ton of shit for it.  She even used this as a reason to breaking up with me.  Now fast forward to November, she suddenly calls me one day cursing at me!! Saying how could you do this to me?!  To my response I go &amp; tell her: “What are you talking about” 

She goes and replies with: “I have Chlamydia “  I’m in shock!!!!  Because before her I had not had sex in like over a period of 5 month.  So I go and tell her this has to be a mistake I will take an std test.

She would not give me the benefit of doubt, I was just receiving her wrath of hatred.  To me, it was understandable her reaction but I knew I did not have any type of std nor ever had one in my life.  She goes and dumps me that day.  I go and take my std test, but then I found out that a month earlier she had booked a flight to Florida for December where guess what?   Her ex lived.

I confronted her &amp; she admits having been talking with her ex &amp; that she was going to see him over there. That news crushed me so much. A week later I get the test results and all of the tests are negative. Took it twice &amp; negative were the results. 

 I go and scanned the documents &amp; send it to her email and through text msg ..  Then I tell her what do you have to say about this..   She goes and tells me that she does not know what to think about the situation.  Later then shows me the second test she got and it came negative. So all this time it was a false positive.  

Everything calms down for a while, but I keep suffering because she is acting really wreckless and it does not make sense.  What happened to the charming sweet woman that I met?.  Now she is just acting  crazy.   January comes by and she invites me to a restaurant to celebrate my bday. But she is acting so weird and confusing.  One moment she is being very caring and treating me the way she used to when we were together &amp; suddenly the same night she does not want deal with me.  Then she tells me her ex boyfriend is coming to our campus area for vacation.   

By this time we are already broken up, but still it just destroys  me hearing this from her, so eventually she  hooks up with him again but while she is with him,  she would keep texting me and calling me. 

 What happens next?

She goes for spring break and visits him   but when she returns.. she broke up with him and later on not one month goes by and she starts dating a friend of mine!  It was so hurtfull to see all of this that I went on a mega depression.  Having to go to counseling &amp; a Psychiatrist.  

You may wonder.. Why are u suffering so much for somebody that obviously its not worth it?  The answer is simple..   Im not over her, I love her so much.. I skipped way to much stuff and everything seems that was always negative but it was actually the opposite. 

Now IM in a situation where… Im back for a 3rd internship  for the same company &amp; she also is here, we live to each other apt.  and 4 times already we have hooked up ( NO sex) .

We have had talk about what happened to us &amp;  she confess that the reason she never came back was because she knew she did wrong &amp; did not have the courage to come back to me because of shame.  Therefore she decided to move ON.  To which I ask her if she loves this new person in her life.  She tells me no , but that everything is going great &amp; she does not want to fuck this up.

But this is the real scenario  while we’ve hooked up,  she would then text her boyfriend but at the same time text her ex boyfriend.

After all of this Im still devastated because of the situation I’ve gotten myself .  I miss the person who I fell in love.  That person does not exist.  I see the potential she has but she is so emotionally unstable that I know its done foerever.  It just sucks!!  Ive cried so much for 8 month its pathetic.

Suddenly camed upon this : [When the Relationship's Over - By Randi Kreger](http://155.42.33.13/StudentLife/CounselingServices/documents/When-the-Relationship-Ends.pdf)

Now I’m wondering if she has BPD…  Please don’t judge me. I need your help r/Breakups.  Lift me up and be as honest as possible.  I know what I have to do,  but its so hard because I want her back.

**Summary:**  Met this girl, became a couple.  We were best friends, complemented each other in a marvelous way.  Suddenly she has a crisis with her past.  Dumps me,  tries to go back with her ex.  Does not work dumps him .  Gets new boyfriend…  Now we are living side by side on the summer internship. Have hooked up couple of times,  We have talk about us.  Im still suffering while she keeps doing her.

Part 1(?): James Bland
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Damn. Slow day- no. Slow week. Slow periods, in my line of work, are usually a good thing, since nothing gets an intelligence service moving faster than the threat of imminent death. After a while, however, you learn to view imminent death as a more honorable fate than paperwork, which gets circulated during slow times, probably to try to make us ever vigilant for the slightest possibility of terrorist activity. 

The best I could do today was an in-depth report on the possibility that small, Krogan-made toys were really thermonuclear weapons. 

Then, my door burst open. In scuttled a nervous intern, who's look of fear would hopefully lead the day in a more interesting direction. 

""Boss, uh-""

Boss? Who made me Boss? I don't remember anything about that...

""There's a, uh, slight... Thing, uh-""

Any chance of something fun? A Vorcha illegal on a rampage? Or maybe even an assassination attempt on a diplomat?

""The water cooler, boss... It's empty.""

Close enough.

""I'm on it,"" I reply.

""A-Are you sure? I just though you should kno-""

""I said I'M ON IT."" You're not going to ruin the one thing that's happened this week.



Twenty minutes of phone calls and general activity later, I sat back down at my desk, thinking deep thoughts, and logged back on to my computer. Suddenly, the screen was a whirl of activity, files being transferred, windows opening and closing, and lines of code being entered in a console window... Unfortunately, I was doing none of it.

""What the hell?"" 

The thought struck me a few seconds later: My computer was being hacked! I'm certainly not computer illiterate, but for some reason my mind jammed. My fist easily passed through the glass screen, which  spread in an arc around my desk. The activity immediately ceased. The intercom suddenly blared to life.

""Ward. Come to my office. Now."" That's never a good sign.

I slowly retracted my fist from the fragments of computer, which sizzled every once in a while. My hand was bleeding, but I'd look at it later. The only thing on my mind now was the walk of shame to the Superior's office, down the hall. 

Two years ago, when I was promoted out of the standard field work, I was genuinely happy with the thought of not having people trying to kill me. Now, on the other hand, I almost wanted to be killed just to escape the paperwork, which had been piling up on my desk due to clever procrastination tactics.

When I finally reached the door, I extended my arm to knock, but was interrupted by the door opening on it's own. I saw the Superior sitting at his desk, and was about to say hello when I looked to the left and found the grim face of Admiral Thompson.

""Take a seat,"" He drawled. I did. ""Your superior was showing me a genuinely dull report on Krogan toys-"" Uh oh ""- when we were alerted to a hacking attempt on one of the computers in the department. An attempt that you stopped.""

""Yeah, about that...""

""IT's getting the data for the breach- ah, speak of the devil.""

Another flustered intern scrambled in, dropped some files onto the desk, and exited. The admiral picked them up. The Superior looked nervous.

As the admiral flipped through, his eyes widened subtly. 

""It says they only downloaded seven megabytes of data. Data that was subsequently deleted off the system...""

""What?"" I said, ""They were on for long enough to get a few gigs!""

""Do we know what they took?""

""No.""

""Can't we cross-reference the archive now with an older backup?""

""Um... We don't have the storage for backups..."" 

The admiral glanced quickly at the Superior, who was visibly sweating. ""I see. What would take up seven megs of data?""

""A profile!"" Blurted out the Superior, who looked proudly up at the admiral, ""One of our profiles on a terror suspect, or group can be around that large.""

""So we know they took our info on either someone or some organization... But we don't know exactly who, or what,"" I continued. ""We're still shooting in the dark.""

""Then I'm glad you're on it, Ward. Don't let me occupy you."" The admiral turned around and slowly walked out of office.

The superior grabbed the report, pushed the papers into the accompanying folder, and sighed. ""Looks like you have something to do, now. Get to work.""

My hand hurt.

When I lived there I didn't have a lot of money (obviously). Now I have a bit more so that's good. Anyway, the only three bars I every made it to with any regularity were Father's Office (not crazy about it, but close to a friend's apartment), The Blue Palms in Hollywood (because that's where I lived and I liked the atmosphere) and this one bar sort of in the downtown/Little Tokyo area that I THINK had a German sounding name. I liked it too. I might be off on the placement; it's been a while.

WHERE SHOULD I GO THIS TRIP? I don't know if I just didn't do a good job seeking out beer bars because I was so cash strapped (probably) or if the beer culture is just different here in Massachusetts.

My problem is on the first sheet. I need to get the right code for the green boxes, so that they return the base list and total price (as seen in the reference sheet). the dysfunctional code I have in that first green box right now is:
=IF(D11=Ref!D5,VLOOKUP(D12,STD,2,0),(IF(D13=Ref!H5,VLOOKUP(D13,Master,2,0),VLOOKUP(D13,Master,3,0))))
Which as you can see, doesn't return the value it shoud, which would be $1,017.00

If somebody can help me at least get the correct code for this first box, I can hopefully take it from there. I'm desperate, and will be happy to return a favor :)

I bought a laptop from HP and paid for overnight shipping based on the ship date to make sure the laptop arrived before I left for an internship abroad for 3 months.

Hopefully with the economy, the advice stays the same. Some things I've learned:

* You are probably going to have to start at the bottom. You may have just worked your butt off and paid lots of money for your education, but in many cases you might have to do menial work. I started out as a secretary after college. Don't ever think you're too good for work.

* When doing a job search, make your criteria as flexible as possible. Mine was simply that it required a bachelor's degree. 

* No matter what you're doing, look at how you can improve the job you're in. Always leave a position better than when you started.

* Your boss knows where the bodies are buried. Don't try and change things right away, because you don't know the reasoning behind a seemingly redundant/ridiculous process.

* Sign up for internships. I really wish I had done this. Internships and volunteer work count as experience! "

The problem is, I currently have no portfolio to show them. I am currently working on a marketing plan for a local small business, but this text report is all I have so far. So my question is, where can I start to build a portfolio?

I'd really like to get into working creative, but I like the idea of working accounts as well. Should I demonstrate in my portfolio a preference for one or the other? What sort of things can I include? I've seen people doing 'mock' ads for products, is this a good move? Should I do them for the firm I'm applying for?

Last May, I graduated from college, starting a new life as a web developer. You may say that ""Oh hey here we go.. Another Kiwi wannabe"" BUT Please, before you close this tab, let me share my story.

I came from a country that was too different from your country (I don't want to mention it one by one coz it will take ages!). When I was a kid, I met this Kiwi guy, he asked me if its always like this in here. ""I said yeah, but its a beautiful country isn't it?"" Then he started talking about this New Zealand. I couldn't believe what he said to me. Until one day when the Internet era came, I looked up what this New Zealand is. And suddenly I was convinced. I wanted to go there. I feel like this is my salvation for what's missing in my life.  

Now I'm determined to go to NZ.  I am.   

So here I am, a fresh graduate Computer Science. I don't have any jobs yet but these are the things I need to know:


1. I need to know how to get there in the fastest possible and legal way. I read  all about the migrations so I am aware about the technicalities to go there. But I don't know what kind of immigration plan I should take..
2. As for the developer/programmers. I read that the most indemand programming language there is .NET. How about PHP? Is it possible to get a high chance to get an employer with less in demand Programming languages like Java?
3. What do you think about the next 2 - 3 years? I heard that getting a job there is getting harder and harder...
4. Is there anyway I can get an internship? And how would it cost?


Thank you very much kiwis! Please help me fulfill my goal in life, and I will be forever in your dept

x4jk7,5,2012-07-25,Moved to another country. Not sure how to deal with my mother :(,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/x4jk7/moved_to_another_country_not_sure_how_to_deal/,"Right, Tl;dr first: I moved to the UK, mother cries everytime I call. What do?

The long story:
I (F23) moved to England from my (European) home country about a year ago to be with my boyfriend (M28) and to start my postgraduate studies. I met him when I was doing an internship here 2 years ago. Everything has been going really well and we moved in together a month ago. I'm in a really good place in my life, socially and academically: I love my boyfriend, have a good circle of friends here, just finished my Master and secured a fully funded PhD. The only major problem I have is with my mother and I would appreciate any advice on how to handle this situation.

My parents split up when I was fairly young, after a failed marriage that somewhat traumatised my mother (lied to, left with debt, my father was with another woman and instantly moved in with her after the breakup). Her family situation growing up was really awful, too, and left her with a lot of insecurities. She went into panic mode after the divorce thinking she had to protect her children (me and my younger brother) at all costs. While I would still consider my childhood to be fairly happy, she was often controlling and convinced that almost everything was a potential thread. She drew a strict line between immediate family and everyone else. She expected my brother and I to live with her for much much longer, planning us and our hypothetical spouses to live and work in the house or close by.

However, after the internship I was enthusiastic about moving to the UK. My mother was already upset that I went in the first place and panicked. She threatened to cut me off if I went through with it.

She never actually did when I moved, but our relationship has been really strained ever since as she feels I've abandoned her. I've been trying to rebuild our relationship, but I'm extremely unsure how to. She hasn't come to terms with me moving even after a year. She pretends I'm on holiday to cope, and when I call or visit she realizes that I am not and constantly cries. :( I told her I would come to visit this month (went 2 times before so far, was insanely awkward and uncomfortable as she switched between crying, sulking and both of us pretending I never moved) but she said “don't bother I would just cry for two weeks after”. She claims she 'cannot' come visit me as she is afraid of the plane, ferry and tunnel and calls the channel a “great ocean”. I've suggested skyping a lot, but she thinks skype is ""soulless"". It's really starting to get to me. Sometimes I'm angry, as some of the things she says are fairly manipulating, sometimes I feel extremely guilty.

I won't move back, but I really want to make it easier for my mother, somehow. But how?"

x4gep,2,2012-07-25,I'm halfway through the 4 semesters of a language required for both of my majors and my school has dropped the language I was taking.

I just finished my sophomore year, junior year starts in less than a month. I took Mandarin Chinese for Beginners I and II last year, and I was enrolled in intermediate I for this coming semester. This week I got an email from the registrar's office saying that the class had been dropped. I was told to contact the head of the Language dept. to find out way. She told me that they couldn't find a teacher to replace the Chinese teacher who left after last semester (who had made clear her plans to leave). I asked what she planned on doing to make it up, and she basically said she wasn't going to do anything. She told me I could take two semesters of a different language and possibly the records office would approve that. I told her, however, that I plan on using what I learn in college in my career, and I'm not really interested in learning another language at this stage in my life. She eventually told me that I could study on my own and take the intermediate proficiency test to get out of having to take the intermediate classes, or I could find an online course to substitute in. These are all pretty awful options. 

Honestly I think the whole situation is bullshit. I think with some independent study and the help of a professor in another dept. who is a native Mandarin speaker, I could pass the intermediate proficiency test. I want to get some input from r/AskReddit though. What do you think?

Edit: spelling. and I read again and I need to point out that literally no one seems to think this a problem or that anything should be done about it. The Language dept. head seemed surprise that I was mad about this and she didn't apologize or act like it was her job to offer a solution. I've emailed both of my advisers, who are also the heads of their respective departments and they said they will look into it. Do you think it's a good idea to email someone else higher up at the school? Also, I can't talk with anyone in person because I'm actually in China working an internship for the summer. "

    2) Do you know if there is a computer security company that would hire me (even as an intern) and pay for my certifications?

x46j2,0,2012-07-25,I'm being kicked out. Could use some advice. ,Beignet,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/x46j2/im_being_kicked_out_could_use_some_advice/,"Please excuse another one of these. I did the search, and read dozens of threads, but could use some more specifically tailored advice. I'm working out the logistics right now, but it's very rough, and I'd appreciate if someone more grown-up than me would look over it. 


A little about the situation: I'm in university, going into my 4th year. Looking back at it, I probably shouldn't have pursued the double-major (electrical engineering and math). But I'm about a year away (plus maybe another semester) from graduating. My parents have issued that I leave sometime soon. I'm in summer semester right now, and it's dead week, which is why this is particularly bad timing. 


I'm working out the rough costs it'll take for me to finish school, but I can't account for the semester I will/won't have to extend. A semester's costs run at $9628 per semester, but that includes rent for on campus housing. I could live off campus for cheaper, but at this point to break contract which just incur more costs, so it looks like I'm stuck on campus. The rest is tuition and various school fees. I have a loan for $3750 for both semester, as well as a fall only scholarship for about $2200. This leaves a difference of about $3600 for fall, and $6000 for spring. I was going to ask to take out another loan (Parent Plus) which is in my Mom's name, but since this falling out I don't know what to do. This is my biggest obstacle. 


Aside from school, from past semesters' experience, month expenses vary from $600-800. Most of that is my car: payments and insurance is $350 (my insurance is rather high). I've averaged about $150 in groceries, it can obviously be lower, but that's not just food, but anything I can get while I'm getting foodstuffs at the store. I budget $50 for other, but it doesn't usually get spent, and it's rather accumulated for emergencies (car issues, random fees that come up). 

I didn't work this summer, and am living on savings. Most of my expenses were provided for by the parents this summer, but I'm still down to my last couple hundred dollars. It's countered by some unfortunate charges to the card so I've really got no liquid money to my name. I have a TA position lined up for the fall which has a decent stipend ($2980). It's barely enough to pay off credit card bills and living expenses for the semester. The supervisor says there's no reason I can't continue into the spring semester if I wanted to, so I guess I can count on that for the spring as well. 


Aside from that, I do have another asset I can tap into: books. I've kept all my books from class (as opposed to selling them back at the end of the semester). They're mostly engineering and math texts so I thought they might be helpful, but desperate times? I figure I could get anywhere from a few hundred to maybe even $1000. Plus it would cut down on storage. I'm going to be trying my damnedest to secure a well-paying internship for the summer. 


I'm currently registered for 20 hours at my university, and they're no slacker classes. It's a typical load for me, but I'm debating on cutting down to the bare minimum so I can pick up another job. This obviously pushes back the possible graduating date, so I don't know if another job justifies the cost of another semester. 


So that's about a couple hours of brainstorming. It all really came down to money, and it was terrible foresight to not account for such an emergency, but with graduation that much closer, I guess I lost sight. Would someone tell me if I'm being naive? And tell me what else to watch out for? Thanks AskReddit, I know this is a huge post"
x4603,6,2012-07-25,It's like I'm not allowed to be happy,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/x4603/its_like_im_not_allowed_to_be_happy/,"I have overcome chemical depression (or imbalance or whatever you want to call it) and all the horrid and deranged thoughts, behaviors, beliefs and confusion that comes w/ growing up not knowing who your going to be from one day to the next.  

Several years of introspection, therapy, trial and error and painful realizations and failures, along with appropriate meds for a specific time period, allowed me to untie those knots.

I have beaten alcoholism, teaching myself how to drink responsibly and not become a blacked-out scene causer.  

Several years of public drunkenness, potential relationships destroyed, friendships ended, jobs lost, opinions of me irreparably damaged and plain old self hate provided me with the motivation to not fail.

I have overcome a debilitating case of social anxiety and insecurity to manage to go from a kid who never kissed a girl until he was 17, a virgin until 19, to become not a ladies man or a player, but someone who can hold his own and is able to attract new women.  

A lifetime of rejection, failure and a relentless will to stop feeling this (the biggest of all pains) on a regular basis pushed me to work out my fears and identify my over compensatory behaviors, and allowed me to mature into a kind, charming and somewhat well dressed man.

I have gone from being the broke friend for 20 straight years to being the guy who picks up the tab.  This took 7 years of sacrifice, walking or taking public trans to community college, and going right home after, having no available time for a workable job schedule that could provide funds capable of any more than small daily rations.  Unpaid internships, minimum wage and watching everyone w/ money enjoy everything I wanted and was working for gave me a goal to strive for over the years of nothingness.

*not to mention all these time periods overlap one another*

And every single one of these things has been taken from me in one way or another.  Not all at once, but each time the achievement was stripped and reduced to a source of regret.

Dui arrests have taken my job and my money.  My family, my friends and more than anyone I am so disgusted and disappointed in my failure.  3 dui's over 9 years.  1 without driving a car.  1 for marijuana.  My freedom remains only until my sentencing.    

After playing the single scene for years, I finally was in the position to transition to a more healthy lifestyle.  The girl I was seeing and beginning to fall for, in turn played mind game after mind game as she used me to whatever end I am still not sure of.  Deeply hurtful and cool-headedly cruel comments and actions that I absorbed, afraid of being alone to face this sentence, knowing that having only a few weeks left, it would be impossible to find someone new and build again, and mostly stubborn and unwilling to admit I was going to come up short once again.  

My efforts were viewed as pathetic, needy..desperate.  Her lies and manipulation caused me to be insecure to a point I hadn't been since I was a depressed little kid with hyper anxiety, new in school having moved towns in 2nd grade.

Everything I was proud of myself for has been pieced away in this year alone.  I entered 2012 ready for the best year of my life.  And I stand now worse than before, not because I am in the same place but because I had so much and wound up here.  

There's something about ""to have loved and lost"".......that's bullshit.  Not that I was in love w/ any one specific person or thing..but I loved my life for 2 months this year, for the first time in my life.  2 months more than I could piece together over my entire life, and they were back to back and looking to continue onward.  And it is all gone.  And I have never felt worse.

I bring this here because your strangers.  And I'm anonymous.  With epic novels that could be spun about my family-that whole thing, my friends and the relationship I have w/ them, and my wandering and impersonal sex life (or it was, until I met this last one- who, again, I went all in with only to be systematically deconstructed by, to the point where I wouldn't dream of sharing personal stuff with her) I will simply say they are not an option in this regard.  

I'm hurting.  And I need to get shit off my chest without it coming back.  

I feel like I am not allowed to be happy.  The things in my life I work at and build on...always fall from beneath me...my first love was my best friend (a female) who ended up choosing my other best friend (male) over me.  She would later have sex w/ just about every friend I have- proving to me how pathetic I was to love her in the first place, it was a wake up call for how unacceptable I was as a person, but also it was the first inner time bomb placed- eventually developing into an instinctual belief that I am wrong....always being less than everyone because I was broke, only to become one of the more successful friends in my group- just for it to be lost because of a mistake I supposedly stopped making years ago....being walked all over and spat upon because I was vulnerable and open- after working literally decades to actually allow myself to let people in....beating depression to becoming damn near suicidal....the irony alone is enough to make you sick.  

Add to that the repercussions of my actions and these events...Christ I can barely get up in the morning.

I know my actions and choices dictate my life and not some unforeseen hand...but I cant shake this feeling that I am not allowed to be happy.  Fuck..I am hurting."

I'll tell you. I'm basically staying with friends over the summer for an internship. So not my carpet. 
I'm usually pretty good about putting the cap completely on, but this pink was different. Instead, it was not screwed on; so I picked it up by the top along with 4 others. 

I swear that pink bottle flew and I had a 12 inch long sling of polish on their beige carpet. It had runniest polish consistency.. Oh my god. 

I instantly came here and searched for tips. sorry no pics I was in ultra panic mode..

We used shaving cream, carpet Clorox, acetone, and hot water. It's mostly out but I still see it. 

I feel AWFUL. Im never wearing a pink that shade again, im just not destined for those pinks. Had to let it out, and I figured you all would feel me."

It's hiring season for Fall internships right now, and I've worked a pretty crappy (non-finance) internship all summer because of sloppy work by me in the past semester but now my house is in order and it's time to get on top of things for Fall (my resume is much stronger, interviewing skills honed, and general demeanor more suited to the industry).

My problem is that when I started my internship search this summer I was in constant communication with a startup consulting firm that had just been founded by a graduate of my college (a non-target but we still manage to get some people into Citi, JPM and IBs). We finally got to sit down and chat last week, and he offered me the opportunity to come in and work (originally remember, this was a summer internship). He is now implying that I'd work through the Fall as well.

Through some connections I've made at the career center at my college (and this was today, after a couple hours, not a real shift, at the new place), I was pointed in the direction of some banking related internships that were not available on our career center website, and had been emailed to my contact from a friend. I really want to apply and take it - banking is my *dream*. And not for the money either - I'm a competitive person, and I also **love** analyzing the markets and such and dealing with clients.

Seeing as I'm a rising Junior, and this internship will be the only real finance related internship on my resume before summer internship hiring, what do I do? Do I quit the job and go back on my word because these other opportunities weren't available yet? Do I try to manage two internships, 18 credits, club sports, and honors business class life?

I am not content to let this dream sail away because I pussied out either. If I do need to quit the consulting job, how do I exit it? Tell the truth? ""Something better came along""?

TL;DR ""took"" and internship (no contract) but have been sent amazing opportunities in banking that no one else has an opportunity for. Do I quit the thing I just took?"

x3yzg,6,2012-07-24,"I'm feeling really lost and shitty. I need some real talk right now. TL,DR at end of post",fabul0uslyfoxxy,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/x3yzg/im_feeling_really_lost_and_shitty_i_need_some/,"Hey guys. So, I'm feeling really, really down right now, and I'm not really sure who to talk to, so I figured I'll give this subreddit a shot. I don't necessarily expect any pity talk, but just real constructive advice if anything.

BASICALLY, I wanted to pursue a career in financial services, something more in investment management/ advisory, but this desire only surfaced in the past 15 months. I just graduated from a non-target undergrad, doubling in Econ &amp; Lingusitics with no prior internships. I work(ed) part time at the MFE office in the business school, but obviously that's not really any finance experience. 

Anyway, I studied abroad in China last spring semester in a business/econ focused program, and that's when I got bitten by the financial career bug. I came back in late August looking for internships, didn't find anything, began full-time recruiting, &amp; signed up for the CFA Level 1 to take in June. Of course, without any prior experience, I was nowhere near competitive to the other candidates at my school, but I tried anyway.

During winter break, I had a super short ""internship"" at a M&amp;A advisory firm. I didn't get any quantitative/ modeling experience or anything. It was more like reading Marketwatch &amp; Businessweek and discussing/ reporting any interesting stories/ trends in the morning (more educational), and then in the afternoon, I spent my time contacting boutique banks and business brokers to find companies to acquire (so I guess I was technically on the buy-side of this particular transaction). In terms of learning, I became a lot more knowledgeable on financial news in general.

When I came back to school, I made a feeble search for internships, but by this time, most places were looking for underclassmen, and so I started to study for the CFA. I somehow managed to get an interview with a registered independent advisory (RIA) firm (they were a boutique investment advisory firm). The 1st round was exhilarating, just talking the news and I actually really enjoyed it. There were no behavioral questions, and I knew I did a great job. I got a call for Round 2 about two hours after my interview. The 2nd round was a case interview along with a couple ""get to know you"" interviews with the VP that I'd be working under. Finally, I get called back to the final round, and I talk to all 6 partners via phone or in person. I think I did pretty well overall, except when I talked to a 2-partner team interview in which they ripped apart my econ gpa/transcript, and I caved under that pressure. Also, I talked to the partner under whom I'd be working, and he pretty much told me that I had no idea what I was doing/ talking about/ getting into. Therefore, how could he expect me to work well for him? Needless to say, I didn't get the full-time offer. Apparently some other guy did a much better case interview in round 2 than the other 3 candidates (including myself).

My final quarter was dedicated to studying like full time for the CFA, and if you don't already know, results for Levels 1 and 2 came out today. Despite my efforts, I didn't pass. I know I should've studied even more than I already did, but I didn't slack off. As expected, my weakest section was accounting/ financial reporting standards because I had only taken beginning accounting at school. 

So, the thing is I had put CFA Level 1 candidate on my resume, and THAT alone had given me some kind of a leg up. Recruiters and professionals that I talked to were somewhat impressed and encouraged me to study and do well. Now, I don't even have that. I'm really at a loss of what to do. 

Summary of academic background: beginning accounting, micro/macro economic theory, investment theory, finance. I have no financial modeling experience, proficient in Excel (but not like super, I just learned how to do pivot tables.. kind of), and my accounting is really weak.

I really apologize for the long post, but I really needed to just get it off my chest and possibly get some real feedback. Is it possible for me to even fathom getting into investment management/ advisory? Or is it just not possible/ maybe I'm just better fit for something else? If it is possible, can you shed any light on how I can continue? 

**TL;DR: graduated from non target, no real internships, took CFA Level 1 &amp; didn't pass. This is what I had worked for all year, but now I don't know if I can actually continue this path.  Is it possible for me to even fathom getting into investment management/ advisory? Or is it just not possible/ maybe I'm just better fit for something else?**"

As the title says, I'm approaching my senior year of college at a top ranked business school (not the top top, but it makes a few lists). Ideally, I'd really like to get a job at an advertising. If you watch Mad Men, I pretty much want Peggy Olson's job -- something in the creative department (I'll x-post to r/advertising, too, but I figured I might as well start broad). 

I have no internships under my belt. Due to the nature of the curriculum at my school, this year is my first year taking major classes. I thought it wasn't worth my time to apply for internships since I didn't think I was qualified/had anything to offer. My summers have not been idle -- I have a job and just finished 6 weeks studying abroad in Europe taking an international marketing class. But I've always heard that an internship looks way better on a resume than a steady student job.

What should I do to boost my resume? There aren't many internship opportunities available to me in this city to complete during the semester, and I'm also worried what effect an internship would have on my grades. Should I look for internships when I graduate to get experience, or look for a ""real"" job instead?

I've also considered putting together a little portfolio -- nothing too intense, but maybe something I do in my spare time to take a break from studying where I can mock up some ad campaigns or something. Would this be helpful since it wouldn't be ""formal"" and just in my spare time? Do you have any tips for this sort of thing?

I'm also incredibly willing to listen to whatever tips you have. What sort of things do you wish you had known at this point? I'm also a lady, if that makes my prospects any different. :)

Shift is an internship programme; disguised as an innovation lab, ran like a creative agency. Over the next few months the team will have their heads down, underpaid and malnourished challenging traditional methods of creativity and encouraging cross-discipline collaboration to explore and uncover new ways of thinking. But we're not doing this for ourselves, we want to share it with you and the world as much as possible!

To do so we're planning on holding a one of a kind event to showcase this new thinking, streamed live across the web from a leading UK venue, exhibits and a mass workshop will engage those lucky enough to attend and others interacting online. Guest speakers, unique collaborative performances and an after party to end all after parties will complete a night to remember. 

For those who can't attend we will be producing the 1st edition of 'white paper' a must have publication documenting our early trails, tribulations and triumphs. Acompanying that will be a DVD featuring our findings, exclusive interviews, coverage of our event and much more. But we need your support to help make this a success, help invest in the future of the creative industry, get involved and help us take creativity forward.

All you have to do to show your support is treat yourself to one of our perks! &gt;&gt;&gt;

Please Note: We'll be updating this page regurlarly with more information on our perks, so keep popping back.


**What should I expect...**

Expect something different, expect unusual, insightful and the embarrasingly obvios, from rap battling to develop slogans or uncovering methods on how to thought shower with the world - this is fun, it works and we call it 'new thinking'.


**What exactly is Shift then...**

Shift is an open studio that provides internship and placement opportunities to emerging creative talent. Providing an inspirational co-working environment for a dynamic mix of emerging talent to create, innovate and collaborate on live projects. The studio shares skill sets, excitement, resources, ambition and the simple requirements of a creative studio.

Its output will include work from its founding partner Studio Precept, undertake community lead projects, competition briefs, culture shift research and independent projects commissioned to the studio. It's mission is to explore new working methods in branding, emerging technologies and multi-channel media as an ever evolving agency model. Its findings will be used to inspire creativity and encourage innovation - in turn becoming a catalyst for improving education, inspiring entrepreneurship and creating jobs.


**Right, so who's behind it...**

Shift was founded by Nick Johnson, MD of creative agency, Studio Precept. Driven by a niggling urge to take projects beyond the brief, his desire to empathise and to do the right thing in giving something back and creating opportunities. Shift was born from good morals and it's ethos is not to do things right - but to do the right thing.

Nick truly believes that innovation begins with people having fun and that aspiration breeds innovation. Through pairing vivid imagination with a collective vision we believe we can create and define a brighter future. Shift it is not at all about productivity but impact, not excellence but significance and unearthing something new.

Alongside Nick you'll find co-founder and Shift Studio Manager Andrew Kilburn and the studio's current trio of team leaders; James McCaughan (New Media), David Carr (Copywriter) and Carl Storey (Art Director). Followed by our current army of change makers; Mark (Creative), Josh (Creative), Wes (Editorial), Rachel (Product), Sam P (Designer), Sam H (Graphics) and Alex (Illustrator/Animator).

Shift will evolve organically as we look to expand and as our interns one by one move on into full time employment. So much so we're currently in the process of building a diverse team of interns, collaborators and mentors to get involved with our projects and our up and coming event. If that could be you, please don't hesitate to contact Andrew andy(at)studioprecept.co.uk to get involved. You can also keep up to date with our progress and help us spread the word on twitter, follow us @weare_shift


**Great, so where will the money go...**

The $15,000 (or whatever we raise) will help make our vision for the 'Taking Creativity Forward' event a reality and allow us to produce and amazing publication in our first edition of 'white label'. We're not in this to make a profit, but any remaining proceeds from the event will simply go towards the running costs of the Shift studio, it's tech needs and basic office equipment. If we exceed our expectations and we raise more than our target, we’ll reinvest back into the internship programme to give further opportunities to emerging creative talent.


**Finally, what does the future hold for Shift...**

As well as an innovation lab Shift is available to clients and brands just like any other agency; however, they will be getting something completely new and often unexpected - and becasue it's ran by interns it's really cost effective too. Through this unique approach we hope to build a finanically stable internship programme, offering a fantastic service that covers it's costs and continues to provide fantastic opportunities to emerging talent. In addition we want to continue to showcase this talent and our findings through running more events and producing further 'white paper' publications.

We’re 100% committed to making Shift a huge sucess over the coming months, and have put a lot of blood, sweat and tears in to get this far. We see a future where Shift is self funded but first we need your help to get Shift off the ground!

So please get involved, do your bit to support new thinking and for the future of the creative industries - help us take creativity forward.

If the perks don't work for you then contact andy(at)studioprecept.co.uk to offer alternitive forms of support. Every little counts and a 'Good Luck' message will go a long way.

x7rkz,0,2012-07-26,I'm a 20-year-old aspiring videogame storyteller. Where do I go from here?,ccbeef,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/x7rkz/im_a_20yearold_aspiring_videogame_storyteller/,"Damn. It's weird not being able to just say ""writer"" or ""script writer"". Because, in this subreddit, ""writing"" implies ""writing code"", right?

**Why:**

Basically, as a gamer and just overall semi-educated person, I'm really underwhelmed by how basic the plots of basically all videogames are (and let me distinguish between a game's ""world"" and ""characters"" and its actual protagonist's story arc). I'm also really disappointed by how most games fail to even attempt to make people reflect on things outside of the context of the game. I know this isn't a brand new idea, but I'd like to contribute to helping the medium ""grow up"".

TL;DR: I dream of a day when intellectual/art snobs can boast about which videogames they've played, whether they actually have or have not.

**Where I am now:**

So, at the moment, I'm taking summer classes, trying desperately to switch into an English major. I attend a well-known American engineering school and actually came in as an aerospace major. I'm hardwired to be incredibly ambitious (long story) and thought I could more easily change the world through engineering, though I've always been more of a writer/artsy person. Long story short: here I am, about to enter my third year of school.

I'm currently in the researching and brainstorming process of three different videogame concepts. I'm thinking about themes, main events, general gameplay mechanics, etc. I plan to start writing a script by the end of the summer. Hopefully, I'll be able to finagle my way into the English major and have opportunities to take creative writing classes over the next couple years.

I know nothing about programming, but I'm strongly considering the idea of improving my drawing skills so I can at least display some sort of physical manifestation of my ideas. But those two skills -- writing and drawing -- are not enough to create a game.

**What can I do?**

But what exactly do I do from here? How do I transform a script and some sketches into a functional development company, with competent programmers and enough investment money to produce the product? 

Once I get my script and sketches together, is my best option to try to get an internship? Oddworld Inhabitants is based in my city, and I wouldn't mind interning with Bioware or Bethesda. At least it could get my metaphorical foot in the door and maybe a stable job.

But, ultimately, I'm unsatisfied with the current status quo. How possible would it be for me to start a company right out of college? Is it really as scary/simple as taking out a huge loan from a bank, hiring some random programmers, and gambling on subsisting long enough to produce a profitable game? It's important to note that, with my current plans, I probably can't achieve my creative goals with anything smaller than an XBLA game. I don't think a 2-D world can convey what I need it to convey, and I'll probably need a good 10 hours minimum for the total experience. Also important: I won't have any college debt, which I don't want to elaborate on.

So where exactly do I go from here?

EDIT: for grammar"

I'm eligible for a paid internship next year in the tech field, and from what I've heard, this job combined with my more than 2 years of grocery experience could help me get the paid internship.

My worry is that my performance wasn't great at the job. A big reason was because I was a bad fit for the job. I was never at camp before and am not exactly counsellor material. It took me close to a month before I finally started to ""get"" things. I was also exhausted all the time because of the heat (which I am not used to working in) and was always sitting down, which my supervisors took as me being lazy and not working, despite me saying otherwise. My first performance review was downright lousy and they cited attitude, work ethic, as well as knowing the right time and place as things I needed to improve.

After that, I pushed myself hard the last couple weeks and finished strong the last couple weeks but am not sure if that was enough to have the first 2/3 of camp forgotten. My second (and last) review was better, but still had several things I need to work on.

Obviously this doesn't look good to a future employer. I can assure you that I'm NOT lazy and have a good work ethic, but I had a rough time at camp. That said, should I put in on my resume? I'm worried that they'll call and ask about my performance and then take that info and apply it absolutely, even though I'd be a better fit at other jobs."

Would you like someone to watch it?",[deleted],london,https://www.reddit.com/r/london/comments/x7oy1/this_might_be_crazy_but_do_you_have_a_flat_in/,"I recently met someone who was staying in a flat that their friend owned in Russell Square in london.  The couple left the flat empty for months at a time as they lived in Switzerland most of the year and only used the flat for visits.

It struck me how I would worry about leaving my property unattended, but I also realise that renters are a hassle and are really hard on a property.

So here’s a proposition, I’m a 21 year old female who comes from a solid home where I was taught to respect my space and be responsible. I’m incredibly clean, I do my dishes the same night I dirty them, I put my dishes away, I sweep and hoover once to twice a week, I make my bed in the mornings and I don’t use and abuse where I live because I respect my space as my home.

I’m also a serious student who is in my final year of study in London, doing two degrees and working an internship, which means I don’t have time to party or go out and waste money at a club.

My evenings consist of a book, homework, or perhaps a glass of wine and a movie.

If there’s a London redditor out there who has an empty property and would love a clean respectful young lady to watch it, here I am! I would be willing to pay rent and maintain your property.  I would be willing to sign a full contract, release my full details to you (If you would like, you could even speak to my family!) I can provide character references, my visa details and my university details. I would also be willing to provide monthly photo update emails of your property so you can see that all is well. 

I would also be willing to leave the flat whenever you were in town.  I would be completely flexible to your wants and needs.

What benefit would this be to you?  

* You receive extra income each month for your property so it’s self maintained. 

* You would have someone watching over your property that you could trust, and you wouldn’t have to worry about squatters or a break in.

* Your charity would help a student, and provide an unmatched opportunity.

At the beginning of the Summer, I was 226 and I got down to this weight in about a month only from going to the gym once a week so I can usually lose weight pretty easily but I never have time to do anything. Here are some things that prevent me from going to the gym;

- I have a summer intern job at my parents office that I go to every Monday - Wednesday and Friday for 8 hours a day.
- I don't have my driver's license yet so usually I have to get a ride from my parents, but since they don't work out much, I go pretty rarely.
- This may be because I'm lazy but the weather has been over 100 here a lot recently, so whenever I am at home, it's usually too hot to go for a walk or a bike ride

So if anyone has any diet tips or work out tips, please tell me.

After I wrote this I thought of something that could help with my weight loss, since I work on the 12th floor of the building I work at, maybe I could walk up and down the stairs everytime I get there or want to get lunch"

Discrimination Upon my hire at UVU’s Women’s Success Center

It was common knowledge among the staff members serving in the equity in education Center, Turning Point, and our center (WSC) that Dr. S.m. (the head researcher that created the need for the center)was not pleased that the decision was made to hire a man. The second director, N. K. --whom was terminated, let me know of this fact, P. P.  --our coordinator-- was well aware of this fact and even defended by hire to AVP/Dr. M. T., A. L., a Presidential Intern, also knew of this prejudice and an assistant to J. B. discussed this fact with me on numerous occasions in the UVU lunchroom and at the Provo Library. K. also made mention of it in the Losee Building. Upon A's. hire, she quickly had her first “steering Committee meeting” with the associate vice president and two other high administrator/professors. She came back to the office from that meeting to be greeted by P. P. vocalized her defense of my hire and A. disclosed that S. (professor) wanted me either terminated, and if that was a HR violation, transferred.

Equal Employment Opportunity

When the PBA (public budeget and accountability) was announced and my job was becoming full time with benefits. This meant that I would need to reapply for my job.  N. Johnson, S's (head researcher's Assistant seeking for quid pro quo for her work with S. M.), got in contact with A. about the position. Now I understand that an inquiry is by no means a violation however, A. remained adamant that she would not discuss the position with me --other than the fact that it would “open” as it would be an equal employment opportunity violation. 

Below are some correspondences of private meetings (directly titled in the E-mail, “Admin Job.”) and even a special request to remind N. to apply for the position from A. because she had not done so at that point due to her presence at a funeral in Idaho. I believe that out of seventy applicants, the one that receives the official offer is the applicant whom had a private, “offline” meeting with A, the center’s director and Committee member for the hire. The inference here is that not only did I not have a equitable shot at the position, neither did 69 other candidates.

Thanks for reading Reddit! any help would be amazing --even just a few emails would have a tremendous effect.

A,  I wanted to share this while it was fresh in my mind. Have you seen the www.beautyredefined.net posters/billboards (see attached for a flier)? It made me think that we could create something similar for the WSC. They could say things like “graduating is my plan” or “educating me can change the world” or “my children will have a better chance in life because I graduated from college” or “my education gave me greater independence” … we can use some of the specific finding of the research to create the slogans, but also include positive and encouraging statements. At the bottom of each we can have the WSC logo and an invitation to stop by/call/chat online. Something like “Come see how we can help you succeed”  And, to save on cost, they could be displayed throughout campus on the electronic ad boards. This could be another service learning opportunity for some creative media design/photography students.   I looked over the website today and have some ideas for improvement. I’ll work on getting them organized and on paper for you by early next week. I like the new look; it’s very fresh. J   N

Hi S (high level professor),   Quickly cause I know you’re busy, you mentioned that you have a couple of good admin job descriptions that are more Women’s Center friendly. Could you please forward them at your soonest convenience?   Your friend, A

Yes. I’ve actually attached the two I am using now for an admin and a coordinator so you can see those, but I also have the 2010 and then the 2011 (very similar) versions of what I used as well. I think a lot of it will be applicable for yours, but some may not. You are welcome to use any of it you would like. We did put “associate’s degree and experience” because of N Johnson being in school—but I think most of the official admins (as your position would be) have a bachelor’s degree or higher. I really think you need someone with that education.   I hope this helps

Comments from Anne Regarding my presence at the Women’s Success Center

From: A  Sent: Friday, February 17, 2012 4:04 PM To: P P;   Hi Everyone,   The Women’s Success Center is truly becoming a Success!! Thanks to all of you, we are making great progress! I love you all and am happy to welcome Y to our team.  We’ll need to do a good welcome party for her when we’ve made it through all the paperwork, but hopefully she will start next week. I’ll let you know when Marcy tells me.   On another note, I’ve come to the conclusion that W's (me) video editing talents are critical to our success. As we try to brand and market what we do, we need a polished electronic presence. His skills contribute greatly to our ability to move forward despite the lack of budget. That said, I’d like to have R. cover the front desk Mondays and Fridays. N. has agreed to cover Tuesdays and Thursdays. We will see what Wednesdays look like but W. will cover those right now. He will still handle the budgetary issues but the vast majority of his time is now going to be dedicated to video production and website love!   Let me know if you have any questions or concerns or of course, insights.   Thanks again, A. 

Letter of Recommendation From A.

February 28, 2012 Letter of Recommendation for W.

To Whom It May Concern:

I am pleased to write this letter of recommendation for W. I am his direct supervisor at Utah Valley University. Back in August he was hired as the administrative facilitator of the Women’s Success Center. There were many other talented applicants, but W’s skills and talents helped us select him from a large pool. His advanced ability to communicate personally and electronically was a key factor in our decision. It was the right choice; he is very polished and professional without losing the ability to relate at a personal level.

We interact with people from a variety of backgrounds and interests and I believe W’s experience completing a Master of Arts at Temple University in Philadelphia expanded his understanding of human communication signiﬁcantly. W. is a dedicated scholar and has an impressive academic resume. He has a great background in the details of academic freedom and the integral part that communication plays in the educational fabric of society. He constantly demonstrates that he is verbally articulate and an excellent writer.

Without hesitation I recommend and endorse W. in his application for the assistant director with Prospective Students. If you require further insights into my recommendation, please contact me at 801-863-3020 or annew@uvu.edu.

Sincerely, A Director Women’s Success Center Utah Valley University

I did 4 years of college, 4 years of medical school, 1 year of internship, 3 years of residency, 1 year of fellowship, and now have been in private practice for almost a year.  I'm 32 years old and finally am out of school.  I do mostly cataract surgery and corneal transplants.  I'm certified in LASIK, but I don't practice it now that I'm in private practice.  I can definitely answer questions about it though.

As far as ACHOO syndrome, go ahead and google it.  Ever since I was a baby, I would sneeze when I would see the sun.  It takes about 30 seconds to kick in, then I sneeze about 3-5 times.  I'm fine after that until I go back inside for at least a couple of hours.  My wife thinks I'm making this up and still thinks I've been faking my sneezing for the past few years.

I'm not sure how to verify my identity.  I sent a message to the mods that I'm more than happy to send them a copy of my medical license or state license, etc.  I'd rather not post public photos of myself as I don't want anyone suing me for something I say.

This is long, sorry.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/x7g3k/experiencing_unexpected_lowself_esteem_and_unsure/,"tl;dr: I'm going through a rough time emotionally. I'm the one with the problem. But how do I proceed without acting crazy or messing up my relationship?

My bf and I are in our early 20s. We've been dating just under a year. We're good friends, we have a lot in common, similar senses of humor, and generally really enjoy each other's company and conversation.   

Some differences: I come from a broken/divorced family with absent parents. Generally grew up poor and without a support or guidance. I took on a lot of college debt and haven't always made the best decisions to set up a reliable career. I graduated college w/ a humanities degree and support myself financially as a waitress. Not a great job and I don't intend for it to be long-term, but I love working there and it pays the bills for now.  

He has a very involved family with a lot of support, emotionally and financially. His family takes care of finances so that he doesn't have to  work while he's in school and can focus on his engineering major and internships. He's incredibly successful, talented, and intelligent and has an incredibly rewarding future ahead of him.   

My issue: I've been trying to find a better job and am not getting a lot of interest back in the process. I just completed a very lengthy interview process (10 weeks) with a company that I thought was very promising, but was just denied an offer. I feel pretty lost. I would love to go back to school to earn a more practical degree but I can't afford it. I admit, I screwed up. I'm going to keep applying to better paying jobs and hope for the best.  

My self-esteem is tanking. I generally am very happy, I like how I look, I have a lot of friends, and I genuinely like the person I am. I feel like a big fuck-up now though professionally and it's affecting other areas of my self-esteem. I know I'll get through it and I just have to work really hard to correct my mistakes and remind myself that I can do whatever I set my mind to... it's just that now I'm having a hard time being confident with my boyfriend and I notice that I'm constantly hurt and made more insecure by things he says. I interpret what he says as condescending at times (though I doubt he intends it that way, I think I'm just feeling like shit and overly sensitive). He likes to debate a lot, and while I know he challenges me because he considers me a good conversationalist, I keep interpreting his disagreeable attitude as thinking I'm wrong and I get defensive. He constantly makes suggestions on how I should live my life (I know he's trying to help), but also sometimes makes hurtful statements like pointing out that my skin is breaking out.   

Anyway, I know I'm the one with the issue of insecurity and it's not his fault that I feel worse around him. I think I want some space so that I can take time to figure my own shit out. I'm afraid that I will react defensively and resent him if I don't fix my issues before he triggers that kind of reaction. At this point I think he'd be better off with someone else.

Before I go ahead and ask for a little ME-time to sort out my shit, any tips or other suggestions? How do you deal with low self-esteem and vulnerability in relationships? I haven't had many role models as far as healthy relationship go, and I'm not used to being so exposed to criticism and judgement, even if non-malicious, while going through emotional rough-patches.

in 2004 i graduated highschool and went to college, immediately becoming lonely and depressed i decided to chase one of my dreams and join the army. i always have had issues fully committing to something so i just joined the national guard in my home state. i was gone for about a year worth of training and then came home and realized that the national guard is a joke and not fulfilling at all.

i got a decent job working in telecomm but it was dead end and eventually i was let go. i was involved in a near fatal car accident which involved a medevac... my insurance did not cover all of it and i was left with thousands in medical bills that i could not afford. i decided i wanted to go back to school and use my GI bill. this is when i realized that i had no GI bill because all of my active duty time was filed as ""training"" and therefore did not count, this was the first crushing blow.

later the next year i was jumped while visiting a friend in a city and hospitalized without insurance again... massive bills, i could not afford.

i decided to quit my full time construction job and take school on full time to minimize the amount of semesters and loans. everything went well, i took 20-24 credit semesters spring summer and fall and sped to my senior year.

coming home from a grad party i got pulled over, i was slightly over the legal limit and charged with a DUI. this was the second blow, i now had two semesters left in school, no car, no way to get to or from school since i could not afford to live on campus and could not drive to work in order to pay my rent (i live alone).

i thought to myself (all i have to do is make it through this year and i can start working and straighten this all out). with just 3 months left to go before graduation i was out with friends drinking (not driving obviously) and we stopped at a local convenient store. when i walked out of the store i sat down in the car and a cop approached me, i don't exactly remember what happened because i was pretty drunk and i ended up under arrest for DUI... again. i assumed this would all be straightened out and wouldn't come of anything.

my lawyer had my friend sign an affidavit stating what happened that night and how i was not operating the car and he was just in the store blah blah blah. well my lawyer never got this notarized and therefore could not be used in court. i got fucked. hard. i honestly do not drink often, but i decided at this point to just swear it off completely. its just not worth it. it wasn't a hard decision, just a necessary one.

during this semester i landed an internship at one of the top firms in my field, it was great, i was so proud of myself for being selected and worked my ass off as i always do.

graduation came and went and i got a phone call from the VP at my internship asking if i would be interested in a full time position. i said yes, calmly, then hung up and danced around for a bit.

then this week, i received a phone call telling me i would not be allowed to work with the firm because of my DUIs and my credit problems. i had the full backing of the team i worked on and the VP of the firm... and i still could not be hired.

i have $71,000 more debt now from school, i now realize i have no shot of getting into my field of work with my record and credit. i have no idea what i'm going to do. i feel like because i half committed to things, i fucked myself. i feel so terrible about not having money to pay those bills, i feel like pushing so hard for my education was a waste, and i am not worse off than before i started to make a positive change for myself.

I'm currently in my final semester of my ChE degree, finishing my undergraduate research which is required for the option I chose at my university.

I have no co-ops or internships under my belt (yeah, I now know, big mistake) because I figured I was going to be here longer than 4 years but I was clearly wrong.

I don't really care to continue my education at this point. I'm mostly willing to take a job wherever but all I'm finding are entry level positions with 3-5 years experience and I have no experience. The jobs I am finding that have no experience required have been turning me down.

My GPA is above a 3.4. I've been looking at craigslist, indeed.com, monster.com, and careerbuilder.com as well as checking individual sites like BASF, energy &amp; oil companies, etc. Am I just looking in the wrong places?

I've been talking to people who seem to think there's no reason in applying for co-ops or internships because they want students who will do multiple rotations or go back to school after their term.

Any advice?"

I'm an intern at a start-up, go to night school, and I am (WAS) active in a non-profit I helped found. This spring my wife was making ice cream for some restaurants...one thing led to another, we:

* Met with SCORE and SBA advisers
* Started an LLC
* Invested in a machine, hardening cabinet, and delivery van
* Leased space in a certified kitchen
* Built a wholesale client list
* Realized everyone who was telling us that wholesale doesn't work small-scale weren't just having a laugh
* Started doing a weekly farmer's market and got shelf-space for pints at a local grocery
* Got a distributor to expand wholesale client list
* Just got into a bigger grocery chain and have inquiries from others.

So it has essentially blown up, but we're still doing it in our spare time (Nights, weekends, early morning). It's not making enough to quit our jobs yet but needs more attention to grow. Certainly, this is not sustainable, so we have to go beyond Excel spreadsheets and to-do lists. I picked up Getting Things Done &amp; have been playing with LiquidPlanner.com (Tried BaseCamp, Redmine, etc, etc), but it hasn't really 'clicked' yet. Just figuring out how to use Quickbooks Online to correctly calculate COGS is giving me nightmares. 


To top that off, we have to be able to survive through the winter, so we're under serious time pressure. Our sales will inevitably go down, and we won't be able to get precious, precious cash flow from farmer's markets &amp; events. So we HAVE to get enough wholesale clients before then. 


We've come to the conclusion that we must open at least one retail location. It's not going to scale, but it will provide a stable platform for growth and necessary cash flow. Therefore, we must get our business plan updated, determine a number, and pitch to some investors. The more I read about 'successful' entrepreneurs, the more it seems 'bootstrapping' is a fairy tale. These guys and gals either had money to begin with or got bucks elsewhere. 


So, question time. 

* Am I freaking nuts?
* How do I make wholesale work until I have economies of scale?
* Just how much will I have to give up for that first bit of serious capital?
* Other than solid numbers and a clear plan grounded in reality, what would you as an investor want to see?
* I've read The Goal &amp; Joe's Garage, any other sources for learning the harsh reality of manufacturing?
* Alternatives or opinions on LiquidPlanner.com?
* Using tools like GTD when you're more of an ENTP?

TL:DR I need someone to take a few good photos of the piggy bank object from the ""Piggy Bank Adventure"" game at EPCOT Innoventions so I can 3D print it for my 3 year old who has been begging for it for a solid week. I'm not kidding. He is that obsessed and the pig is apparently that cute. Read on.


I was at EPCOT with my 9 year old and 3 year old boys last week. Long story long, the 3 year old's favorite thing on the planet was the T Rowe Price sponsored ""Piggy Bank Adventure"" game at Innoventions 'cause you get to carry around this football sized piggy bank and put it in these machines and it animates on screen and you get to push and pull things and go wheee ! He loved it more than anything else we did all day... yeah... But then the last machine kept the pig and the game was over and there was a 3 second beat as the look of bewilderment spread across his face and he turned to me with wide teary eyes and asked : ""Wah piggy go?"" (Translation: ""Where's mah muhfuggin PIG ?) To which my only possible response was ""Piggy went bye bye""... This was evidently not the correct answer. Bewilderment led to anger, hate, tears and the dark side... Total elapsed time 4 seconds. Result, 30 mins of all out, nuclear powered, steam driven rage face on this kid which simmered and boiled off into a tarry, black, 60 year reserve supply of resentment and bitterness which you can still see lurking just behind his eyes when they catch the light just right.

Meanwhile, 10 seconds after the occurence of the great pig disappearance of 2012, the look of bewilderment was on my face as well because that game character appears to be the only one at Disney that's not on sale. (With the exception of the live ""Ariel"" character. It is NOT ok to ask. Different story. Moving on.)
Anyway, fast forward a week later and I have a 3 year old who's waking up in tears every morning asking where piggy went because he's still DREAMING about the T Rowe Price Pig EVERY night. This bears repeating... out of ALL the damn Disney characters we saw, every one of which can be bought within a 5 minute walking distance of any geographical location in the continental United States, he wants the friggin piggy bank character made out of mil-spec, platinum plated Unobtanium. And he will-not-let-it-go. Accept no substitutes... yadda, yadda.

So I have a solution. I am a 3D modeler (and intern architect). I can 3D model this pig. I also have access to a 3D printer... Yay me !

I have no reference photos to work from however. I didn't take any pictures during that game. I would need a couple of decent front, side and top views to model from traditionally, or a series of shots taken all around the object to use photogrammetry software (like Agisoft Photoscan http://www.agisoft.ru/products/photoscan/ )

So if anyone who is going to EPCOT can stop by Innoventions and manage to find the time to take a few pictures of the Piggy Adventure piggy bank character you have no idea how happy that would make me. As well as this future Darth Bundy currently residing in my house. Think of it as saving the Galaxy from evil. Lots of karma involved.

Meanwhile, for those of you who don't have a 3 year old at home yet ... be advised that reproduction potentially leads to a dramatic increase in ""Maker"" skills with an associated dramatic loss of any free time you might have had left to spare.

---

You're a new programmer. You're a high school student; you're studying computer science at a university; you don't like your current job and you want to try something new; you've been programming for fun for a while but you want to get serious; whatever. I think a mentorship might be a good way to go about that.

I don't have a lesson plan or anything. This isn't a tutorial, though I'll hopefully compile helpful questions and answers into a (free online) book later. I was thinking I'd put this out there and see what the response was and go from there. Optimally you would have an idea in mind, like ""I want to make a side-scrolling platformer game"" or ""I want to make a website where people can vote on cat pictures,"" and I'd tell you the sorts of things you need to study in order to do that, helping you along the way. Or if you just want someone to consult every now and then when you get stuck, I can do that too.

I found the hardest part of learning to program is just getting a handle on what's out there: where do you start? What's the first step towards making a website? What's a ""compiler""? There are few high-level overviews of this sort of thing, so I thought having someone to ask might be helpful. It's what I wanted when I was learning to program, anyway.

This isn't a homework helper or anything. If you just want to pass your CS classes, there are plenty of resources for that. I'm interested in teaching long-term skills for people who want to program because they like programming, not just because the money's so good.

**Do you have any weird pedagogic opinions that will impact your mentoring style?**

I would like to try teaching multiple programming languages at the same time. That might sound a little crazy, but I think it would be valuable for people to see that there are lots of ways of doing things, and tying yourself down to a single language is very limiting. All statements in Java are in methods because that's a Java design decision, not because it has to be that way. Strings are immutable in Python but mutable in Ruby; that's another decision.

Optimally you would have single language that you want to learn (or I would help you pick one). It can be just about anything. But along the way, we'd look at other languages just to get an idea of the landscape and hopefully to reinforce concepts in your ""main"" language.

I am very experienced with Python, JavaScript, C#, Java, CoffeeScript, Objective-C, C, and C++. I have light experience with Ruby, Haskell, Scheme, Clojure, PHP, Perl, and a slew of other lesser-known languages. As far as related skills go, I'm also very proficient with HTML, CSS, SQL, and a healthy dose of frameworks (jQuery, Cocoa Touch, blah blah blah). But the main thing that I want to impress is that learning to program isn't about learning a language; it's about learning to program. Yes, you need to know a language or two to do that. But learning a programming language is like learning to talk: it don't make you a good speaker.

**Who are you?**

I'm a long time Stack Overflow contributor who recently discovered this subreddit. I like helping people program; I don't know why. I'm about to graduate from one of the top ten computer science programs in the US. I've been programming for over ten years, I've been doing software internships throughout my college career, and I have a great job lined up after school. I'm not certified to teach or anything; I just thought this would be a Good Thing to do.

I've definitely still got a lot to learn, and there are lots of areas that I wouldn't be much help at. Want to become a kernel security auditor? Look elsewhere. But as far as the basics are concerned, I've been through everything you're about to go through and made it out to the other side.

**What do you get out of this?**

I'd like to write a book for beginning programmers. But it's been a while since I learned how to code, so I'm not completely in tune with what sorts of questions new programmers have. Basically, I don't want to make the sort of assumptions that tend to make beginner resources inaccessible, like ""make sure `/usr/local/bin` is in your `PATH`"" -- that's the sort of thing that an experienced *nix user would say, but would probably turn off a beginner. I want someone to call me out on that sort of thing.

I'm also designing my own programming language, and I'd like to make it as accessible to beginners as possible. I think it would be valuable to see what concepts are intuitive and what concepts are tend to be difficult for new programmers.

**What do I do?**

Comment or message me with what you want to do (specific is better than general) and we'll go from there. Email is probably the best way to do this long term, though some kind of live screensharing thing might be helpful sometimes.

**TL;DR** You want to learn how to program; I want to teach you.

**Edit**: Okay, I clearly didn't think this through very well. I was thinking one-on-one would be the best way to get a feel for the types of questions and stumbling blocks people go through, and I'd actually have time for that sort of thing.

If you're really serious about this, send me a message describing where you'd like to start (like a specific project) or questions that you currently have. Not necessarily, like, a ton of detail, but it'll be a lot easier to differentiate that sort of post than a bunch of people saying they're interested.

If this turns into something valuable I'll compile exchanged messages or something into something more useful for a larger audience, so if I'm slighting you now there may be some recompense down the road.

**Further edit**: I've gotten a ton of requests so far but they show no sign of slowing down. I'm going to wait until this calms down a bit before I start sorting through requests and responding to people, so if you write me don't expect a response immediately. I'd like to help more than one person, but I definitely can't take on 50, so apologies in advance if I say I can't help. (I've never done this before!)

Also, I'm getting a lot of requests for people wanting to learn Android development. While I'm pretty familiar with Java, I have no experience with Android. If you're someone completely new to programming in general who wants to one day make Android apps, I can help, but if you're an experienced Java developer looking to get into the ecosystem I'm not going to be much use. Maybe there are some Android pros out there who are interested in mentoring?

There are also a lot of requests for game programming. Same disclosure applies. I've tinkered with some very small OpenGL-based games, but I'm no expert."

I graduated with two majors (4.0) and excelled in every subject in HS (particularly math- and this isn't hubris, I actually have shit self-esteem) so responses don't need to be limited to the arts- anything that requires a skill set over a degree (and that you find satisfying) would be much appreciated.

**Things I would love to hear if you have the time to elaborate are:**  

*What /was/ your major? (if any)

*How much of what you do was self-taught?

*How much experience did you have to land your job?

*Did you stumble upon your job (luck) or did you find it fairly easy to follow a plan to get your job?   (i.e. ""connections!"" vs. graduate --&gt; internship --&gt; job)

*If it's not too forward, how long have you been at your current job and what do you make and/or what was your entry level salary?


I know this is a lot and thank you to anyone that got through that and/or responded- I truly appreciate your time.
**Industrial Light and Magic is starred in the title because I think it would be amazing to work there but as far as I know magic is literally required to get a job there** I doubt there are many ILM employees on reddit, but if there are I cannot begin to tell you how much a response would mean to me.

*Also, people may argue translation and programming are not ""creative"" fields but I beg to differ- puzzle-solving is incredibly creative and enjoyable in my eyes (though I am aware it is sometimes tedious)*

Please excuse any typos from this sleep-deprived OP, and thank you all for your time!"
x76cc,1,2012-07-26,"Can any Redditors going to, or currently at, Disney World EPCOT help me out with a project ?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/x76cc/can_any_redditors_going_to_or_currently_at_disney/,"Thanks for stopping by. This takes a little explaining. 

TL:DR I need someone to take a few good photos of the piggy bank object from the ""Piggy Bank Adventure"" game at EPCOT Innoventions so I can 3D print it for my 3 year old who has been begging for it for a solid week. I'm not kidding. He is that obsessed and the pig is apparently that cute. Read on.


I was at EPCOT with my 9 year old and 3 year old boys last week. Long story long, the 3 year old's favorite thing on the planet was the T Rowe Price sponsored ""Piggy Bank Adventure"" game at Innoventions 'cause you get to carry around this football sized piggy bank and put it in these machines and it animates on screen and you get to push and pull things and go wheee ! He loved it more than anything else we did all day... yeah... But then the last machine kept the pig and the game was over and there was a 3 second beat as the look of bewilderment spread across his face and he turned to me with wide teary eyes and asked : ""Wah piggy go?"" (Translation: ""Where's mah muhfuggin PIG ?) To which my only possible response was ""Piggy went bye bye""... This was evidently not the correct answer. Bewilderment led to anger, hate, tears and the dark side... Total elapsed time 4 seconds. Result, 30 mins of all out, nuclear powered, steam driven rage face on this kid which simmered and boiled off into a tarry, black, 60 year reserve supply of resentment and bitterness which you can still see lurking just behind his eyes when they catch the light just right.

Meanwhile, 10 seconds after the occurence of the great pig disappearance of 2012, the look of bewilderment was on my face as well because that game character appears to be the only one at Disney that's not on sale. (With the exception of the live ""Ariel"" character. It is NOT ok to ask. Different story. Moving on.)

Anyway, fast forward a week later and I have a 3 year old who's waking up in tears every morning asking where piggy went because he's still DREAMING about the T Rowe Price Pig EVERY night. This bears repeating... out of ALL the damn Disney characters we saw, every one of which can be bought within a 5 minute walking distance of any geographical location in the continental United States, he wants the friggin piggy bank character made out of mil-spec, platinum plated Unobtanium. And he will-not-let-it-go. Accept no substitutes... yadda, yadda.

So I have a solution. I am a 3D modeler (and intern architect). I can 3D model this pig. I also have access to a 3D printer... Yay me !

  I have no reference photos to work from however. I didn't take any pictures during that game. I would need a couple of decent front, side and top views to model from traditionally, or a series of shots taken all around the object to use photogrammetry software (like Agisoft Photoscan http://www.agisoft.ru/products/photoscan/ )

So if anyone who is going to EPCOT can stop by Innoventions and manage to find the time to take a few pictures of the Piggy Adventure piggy bank character you have no idea how happy that would make me. As well as this future Darth Bundy currently residing in my house. Think of it as saving the Galaxy from evil. Lots of karma involved.

Meanwhile, for those of you who don't have a 3 year old at home yet ... be advised that reproduction potentially leads to a dramatic increase in ""Maker"" skills with an associated dramatic loss of any free time you might have had left to spare.

Many thanks for taking the time out of your lives to read this far. Protip: If you are at work and still reading this you're going to have a bad time..."

x71k9,12,2012-07-26,My mom wants me to wait another year before I out myself to anyone else. Should I?,GemsAreOutrageous,lgbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/x71k9/my_mom_wants_me_to_wait_another_year_before_i_out/,"Hi. First of all sorry for the wall of text, anyway here goes.

I'm a 21 y/o Belgian guy, who has been confused about his homosexuality for most of his life. I am quite masculine so I've never had any real problems hiding my homosexuality, while having my intern struggle. After some failed relationships where the girlfriends told me there was no ""spark"" between us, I decided to explore my sexuality online. After discovering lgbt, gay, gaymers, ... subreddits, I realized that I'm not alone. That there are so many amazing people out there, that have great lives, without having to hide themselves.

Today I am perfectly fine with who I am. I realize that homosexuality is an important part of who I am, and I'm proud of it. At first I didn't know what to do with all this new found happiness. I no longer had to feel guilty or sinful for who I was. So I decided to tell my mom. She was incredibly supportive and asked me all about how I felt. I told her then, that I was going to tell my dad and my friends in the nearby future.

Now four weeks later, I was just getting ready to confront my dad. When my dad steps out of the house to do some gardening. Suddenly my mom comes up to me and with a soft voice she tells me: ""I need to talk to you"". Basically she told me that it would be better and ""safer"" to not out myself to anyone until I'm independant. Some explanation:

Currently my best friend (since I was in elementary school), who's a conservative but awesome dude, carpools me to school daily. Although I presume he's slightly homophobic, I think he should be able to accept me for who I am. My mom however would rather me not taking the risk of not being able to get to school for my graduation year in college (I don't have a car and public transport connections are aweful).

My mom also doesn't want me to tell my dad because suddenly my home could become a hostile place and she desn't want that for me. She said it might be a whole lot easier when I get a job first. So even when my dad's being a hard-ass I can just find my own place. My mom even said that if I really wanted she'd move out with me.

So basically my mom left me a choice but called it good advice. She also said she'd always be there for me, she'd always love me and she'd always put me first in her life no matter what.

I believe that the recent gay bashing/killings in Belgium might me what triggered my moms reaction. She doesn't want me to get hurt, but I have come to terms with the fact that people that are ""different"" to society need thick skin. (This is something I noticed when reading all the stuff on here and watching a lot of youtube videos on this topic. I've always walked between the lines and I've almost never been in a fight/argument &gt;_&lt;). Belgium is supposed to be one of the most liberal countries in the world concerning lgbt rights. Yet this entire outing thing seems like such a struggle.

Is my mom being overprotective? Should I hide it for one more year just to be sure/safe? Thanks for reading and please let me know your thoughts/experiences."

",BenFalvey,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/x70l0/finally_left_my_job_of_2_12_years_and_i_feel/,"I worked for a chain supermarket for about a half year before they switched me to the Dairy Dept. I did really well, but, to simplify, they hired 3 new people who made a mess of the dairy products in the case (Didn't rotate the case) and I had to clean it all up one night. Every time I went to put anything out, I would have to rotate the case, which is time consuming. On top of that, I was training one of the three new people who recently came to the department, and at the end of the night didn't have time to put out the milk. However, I put out some anyways, and left a note for my manager. It didn't matter. The next day, the store manager decided that I didn't deserve to be there anymore and moved me. I called my Union, and they never got back to me. The next day, they put me in Grocery, and I sliced through my finger with a box cutter that slipped on the edge of a box. I called the Union that day, and they didn't get back to me then either. They took the money for that day and the rest of the weekend out of my sick pay. 

I went back to the front end, (Carts, Cashier, Bagger) and started to really not mind the job. I then moved and transferred to another store, where I stayed as cashier until June. During that time, I was harassed by my manager over the phone for calling out for my uncle's funeral. I suppose I could've skipped it, but he was my godfather, his wife is my godmother, and I was a pallbearer. I called the Union, and they didn't show up, they sent the store steward, who was the front manager's buddy. The steward was also the meat manager. The front manager acted like it didn't matter what was going on outside of work, and that I had to be at work when I was scheduled. I protested, since this was an emergency, but all three managers in the room, agreed that I was being unreasonable. I settled with them, and didn't really care so much about it, as I wasn't getting fired. 

I continued to work there from Sept. 2011, to June 2012, when I asked to be switched to another department, due to a customer telling me to ""Go fuck yourself"" after I asked for her ""Fuckin (Store Name) card."" The people at my store were scum, and I had four bad customers in a row that day. I didn't want to work up front anymore, and the managers said that there was an opening in Meat. I always heard that Meat came with a pay raise and all sorts of perks, so I jumped on it. I was then ignored, never properly trained, and left alone. They expected me to clean the machines at night, which I was taught, but not right. I was taught four different ways that all conflicted and did things completely different. I cleaned for the first week and a half, and then got yelled at for not putting any meat in the case at the end of the night. I was never even told that I had to do that, and it made everything a lot more rushed. 

The first Sunday I worked in the department, (Sundays are the worst days due to high volume of people) I was harassed by another employee, which I made clear to my supervisors. They didn't do anything about it, and put me on the next Sunday with someone even newer than me. They expected me to work Seafood that night, which I had never been trained for. The night was a disaster and a mess. We did what we could, but the other guy in the meat dept. didn't start on the machines until way too late. I left a note stating that I was putting in my two weeks. It wasn't worth it anymore. The next day, I came in, and the guy who harassed me two Sundays ago told me that ""He knew I didn't give a shit..."" and I walked away to talk to a manager. The manager ignored the harassment again, and apologized for the situation. I told him that I wanted to finish out my two weeks and leave. The following Friday, my harasser was working with me alone. He refused to take customers he was supposed to serve and called a manager on me. This is a guy who smoked pot, came back reeking of it, and did nothing for an hour, which I made clear to my supervisors who didn't care. 

A manager came down, and I told him that I was focused on cleaning the machines, because if I didn't someone could get salmonella. He left and came back later, after I had finished. After finishing everything I went home. I came in the next day and a manager told me that yesterday should have been my last day. I protested, called the union, and after typing up a full report for my union rep even longer than this, my union rep told me that I didn't need to do anything. It was company policy that an outside company handled all the HR now, and that my reference from the company would consist of my date of hire and the date that I left, and a list of my company duties. When I found that out, I threw the Union meeting. I didn't go, and let my rep know that he should cancel it. 
The next day, I found out that the Seafood manager ratted out the Meat manager (I had never seen or heard from either of them for the whole month I worked in the department) about a separate harassment case. The Meat guy touched some girl in an abusive way at work, and was now getting fired. The manager who ignored me, was getting moved over the incident. The store had the health department called on them for not using the right chemical to clean the machines for weeks. I didn't do any of those things, and when I heard through my (Retired from the same union) father's contact in the higher up of the union, I laughed really hard. 

The next day, I got called by a TV show that I love for an internship opportunity, after I sent them a resume with some fan mail. I have an interview at another job, and while it's not guarenteed, I know the head manager there, and a lot of the employees, so I have a decent shot. I have never felt better in my life as the day I walked out of that building and never looked back. I'm really excited for the future now. The question I have for you, reddit, is what is the worst job you've ever worked, and why? 

TL;DR I was harassed and screwed around by my job for two and a half years without ever being able to defend myself. When I did, I felt great and left the job. What is the worst job you ever worked, and why?"

The money sat there for 5 months until I graduated college this June. I had no other savings at this point and I got a job in a different city. I accessed the funds to pay for a deposit on my new apartment. I'm working my new job and once again contributing to the same account.

My question is whether or not I will have to pay fines on the money I withdrew if I put the $300 back to what it was before? 

Since I am so young I'd like to have a Roth IRA, is there any way to make this same account a Roth IRA? Or would I be required to open a 2nd account, this time not deducting the contributions

I'd only be able to put half of the annual IRA contributions in each account if I had two IRAs, but is there any sense/benefit in doing this?

As the title states, I am a non-traditional student. I work full time and I have a family as well. I have worked as an electronics technician for the past 13 years or so.  


As an adult student with some type of work experience, should I even stress about not having the time to find an internship, not having time to participate in extracurricular activities, or any of the other activities that are normally recommended to traditional (younger) students?  Also, what about grades?  I don't have a bad GPA (2.99 from the school and 3.54 overall), but my current pace of family/work/school is brutal.  I don't want to just pass my courses; I would honestly like to earn high enough marks to be invited into Eta Kappa Nu. I guess my real question is, how much will being a non-traditional student along with 15 or so years of technician experience (by the time I graduate) impact my HR's or a hiring managers opinion of me and my resume?


Frankly, I could really use some honest opinions and support.  My mathematics skills are not the strongest and I have the belief that when I graduate, it will not be because I am smart, it will be because I'm stubborn (I don't care about repeating a class, I really want my BSEE).

x6pp7,0,2012-07-26,[req] - $300 until I get my last paycheck.,[deleted],Loans,https://www.reddit.com/r/Loans/comments/x6pp7/req_300_until_i_get_my_last_paycheck/,"I posted a [req] yesterday, it appears I need to word the situation better.

I am a college student working a decent paying job this summer.  I am being paid on a salary basis, meaning no matter how many hours I work in a single week I don’t get over time pay.  I do; however, get compensation time.  Meaning if I work 8 hours over one week, I can take 8 hours off the next and get paid the same.   I’m doing this because next month is my last month and I want to make as much money as possible and still go on a wonderful trip to London/Paris where I plan on proposing to my girlfriend.  

Normally I get paid 15% of my monthly salary a week for the first 3 weeks and get the last pay check on the 4th week, the last week you get paid more, but they also take all the taxes out at the end of the month.  Here is the problem; that I did not know this until recently.  Next month is my last month, and instead of paying a weekly paycheck, they pay you in one lump sum on your last day of that month.  But every day I work over also means another day before I get paid.  If they paid me on a weekly basis the last month and just adjusted my pay accordingly, I could go on the trip and not have to worry.  I tried talking to the HR department and can’t get a partial pay advance either.  August 17th is the last day I actually work, but I’m going to have 40 hours of over time.  In doing so this means I won’t get paid until August 24th and in the mean time have to pay for an entire month’s worth of bills before I get my paycheck.  In doing so this puts me short on being able to have any spending money for the trip itself.

I need around $300 to make this trip happen.  I thought I was going to be paid on a weekly basis still; I planned accordingly for how much I was going to have.  I also got permission to work over as an intern to make sure I have sufficient money.  What I did not know, was how they did the last month’s pay.  I will be able to pay the $300 back no later than the 24th."
x6ogb,3,2012-07-26,"2.1 GPA non-accounting graduate with no accounting experience dreaming of working for a Big 4 or top 10. Am I delusional? If not, what do I need to do to achieve this goal?",anf1eld,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/x6ogb/21_gpa_nonaccounting_graduate_with_no_accounting/,"As the title states, my undergraduate GPA was horrendous due to having my priorities backwards and lacking any career goals. Being the first person to attend a 4 year university in my family probably did not help either. That being said, I take full responsibility for my actions and am only trying to move forward.


I graduated in 2009 and was only offered work at a dead end job, a result of the tanking economy and my lackluster credentials. After working said job for a year and hating it, I realized that I had to completely rebuild my resume and qualifications in order to ""reboot"" my career prospects.


After doing some serious soul searching, I decided to pursue the CPA designation. Some of the reasons supporting this decision:


1. It is a solid career foundation and opens a broad range of career paths(I have since narrowed my goal to fraud accounting)

2. A professional license would hopefully balance out my deplorable GPA

3. Auditing and fraud accounting seem to match my questioning personality 

3. Accountants are always in demand and have reasonable job security

4. Achieving this designation would help restore some self-confidence (Job hunting in this economy is brutal!)


 To complete the unit requirements to sit for the CPA, I went the community college route since it was highly unlikely I would be accepted into any MAcc program with a 2.1 GPA. Although most likely irrelevant, I did earn a 3.7 GPA(while also working full-time) in the accounting classes I took at CC. During this time, I also took on a leadership role in a campus club.


I have since **passed** BEC, FAR, am waiting results for AUD(cautiously optimistic), and taking REG in August. With a bit of luck, I will have completed all 4 in the span of 6 months. I left my job(same one since graduation) back in May and my current job is studying for the CPA exam.


Because I am not in school, internships and campus recruiting are out of the question. I also understand that I will need to network my butt off to land any interviews. The choices I made as an undergrad have cost me dearly, but I am staying positive and am doing everything in my power to turn things around. 


Now for the big question.


Has anyone else gone through a similar experience, and if so, how did you end up where you are now? There are all these threads with people worried about 3+ GPAs and here I am with a 2.1. Am I crazy for thinking I have a chance?

I know I'm late to the show but I really want to show recruiters I'm dead set on becoming an auditor!


 Any feedback is greatly appreciated! Thanks!


**edit 1** If asked about my GPA, would it be wise to contrast the 2.1 and 3.7 to show how I've changed/improved? This is a sticky topic that I'm not sure how to approach.

**edit 2** It's 5am so I'm gonna try to sleep. Will answer any questions when I wake up. Good night!

**edit 3** Thanks for all the solid advice so far! As recommended by some of you, I've redone my linkedin account, updated my resume (and approved by a friend working in big 4), and will make networking my full time job after the CPA exam. Hopefully this thread has also been useful to lurkers in the same boat as me.
Feel free to drop knowledge or questions if you have any. Don't be shy!"
x6nv1,1,2012-07-26,Mother died and lost love,Elefante_en_la_casa,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/x6nv1/mother_died_and_lost_love/,"College life hasn't been all that good to me. I am 22 now and while I know there is still a whole life ahead of me I feel like I'm stuck in a dark place instead. First of all in my first two years, quite a few of my beloved old pets died, but I pulled through. During this time I've been in a long distance relationship since high school with an European girl (well woman now) while I am American. During the second year I visited her for 3 weeks and... things didn't quite go so smoothly. To put things simply, I got way too nervous and shy and botched things and got overly sensitive about stupid things. When I returned home we argued and nearly broke up things got so heated. It took months for things to finally smooth over then we seemed to be pretty patched up. Through all that happened I continued to love her a lot.

In my 3rd year of college my mother began having lung problems. Eventually hear hatred of hospitals forced her into psychosis and she even went crazy which was very heartbreaking and stressful. My brother and I are both very close to our mother and not so much our dad. Since my room was close to where she slept I often helped take care of her when her psychosis kicked in and she thought we were evil people keeping her trapped in the house. Often she'd ask for Vicodin to relieve her pain (she had a prescription) but she'd often ask for one even after having already had one. One night she kept shouting for once even though she already took a vicodin so my father and I ignored her request telling her she can't or she will overdose. The next morning I woke up to police in my house. Apparently she had called to claim spousal abuse. We told the police the story about the vicodin but they had to take her to the hospital to get checked out anyways. For a day or two we had no idea where she was. Hospitals would not confirm her being present because of the spousal abuse claim even though the police knew it was bogus. 

We did eventually find her but her health was failing and she was in critical condition. We visited her every day for however long we could but she passed away a couple days later. We were able to thankfully speak with her a little on the day before she died though she seemed out of it. During this time I had my wisdom teeth pulled and had terrible tooth aches so couldn't stay overnight... which I now regret since she died the following morning before we could make it to the hospital.

Ever since I have been depressed (and I was already down over my relationship troubles though thankfully we were in better shape before this happened) and I haven't been able to get over losing my mother. I mostly spent the days distracting myself. I still had college work to do, games to play, movies and shows to watch, a girlfriend to talk to etc.  I began to lose focus and unable to find interest in other more creative hobbies like story making, role playing, or drawing. 

However I still had a goal in life to keep me going and pressing on - graduate college and go visit my girlfriend again to make things right and show her my true self rather than being all shy and crap. The summer after my mother died I managed to land an internship that paid well. I made enough for airfare. Things started looking up despite my underlying sadness. I graduated this year and had a plane ticket ready. All I really cared about was seeing her again.

Things went well mostly, certainly better than the time before. We had a lot of fun, we talked and laughed, went out to eat just overall was good fun. The problem was it seemed more like two friends together rather than any kind of romantic interest. I find her extremely attractive and was wanting to hug and kiss her but she didn't quite feel the same way about me. She didn't feel like kissing me, although we did try cause she wanted our relationship to work too. Basically in the end, I was the only one feeling something. For her, we didn't quite click. She isn't sure why, possibly she's still reminded of the previous time I was over and the arguments afterward and things just got damaged beyond repair. I don't know either. She said I am fun and everything but she sees me more as a Best Friend.

I felt burned. I flew all the way to see her, worked an entire summer even, to see her and apparently she doesn't quite love me the same way I do her. I had fun, and I appreciate her friendship but still I felt bitter. I had a long flight home. Way too long to be stuck with such crap on my mind. The more I thought about it the more I thought that yes I do love her still even if its not quite returned so I don't regret going to see her, its not like I'd use the money for something else anyways, I don't care all that much about money. I want her in my life no matter what happens so even staying friends is nice... just still I had hope we'd stay together.

When I returned home we talked again, and she basically brought up something she said before. Where a friend suggested to her that maybe we are just too inexperienced and should break up and see other people then see what happens from there and maybe fate will have us cross again. By inexperience I mean we are both each others first love. Sort of. I had a girlfriend before but it was in middle school and I could tell that one was meaningless compared to what I had with this one.

So basically... I flew to a foreign country happy and in a relationship and fly back home and become single. We are still friends but I feel extremely heartbroken and a little bitter. I still care for her deeply and I want her to be happy... just she was the sunshine in my life and now I feel like that light burned out and I'm all alone in the dark. I'm not that close with my family other than my brother and sister. My sister I don't even see that often since she doesn't live with us.

I know there is plenty of fish in the sea as the saying goes, but the thing is I am not interested in pursuing anyone. Maybe after some time I will be but I doubt it. I just feel extremely low right now and I won't be surprised if even my usual attempts at distracting myself will not be enough this time. As I said before I graduated college, but I don't feel ready at all for a job when I am in such a terrible mental and emotional state."
x6m4t,480,2012-07-26,"""Make a copy of it.""",Kainaeco,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/x6m4t/make_a_copy_of_it/,"When I worked as an Intern for the network admin at my old university we would take help desk calls from student and faculty on computer issues. One day a faculty member had called in and spoke to my boss. She said that she had just recieved a CD in the mail and installed the program but she was having trouble with it and she believed that it had a serious bug on it not allowing her complete to work. 

After she spent about 15 mintues complaining about the CD and the program my boss told her ""Make a copy of it*(the CD)* and leave the copy in my mailbox in the lounge. So I can see what's wrong."" Later on that day my boss comes in laughing with a sheet of paper in one hand.  The piece of paper had a photo copied black and white picture of the CD and the words ""Thanks"" written on the bottom. And then he goes ""I guess she doesn't know what 'make a copy of it' means..."" So he goes into Google and prints out a picture of a cockroach and writes ""No problem, I found it"" and places that picture in her mailbox in the lounge.  After that I never heard anything about her again. 

I don't know if she realized how silly it was of her to send in a photocopied picture of the CD and was embarrassed to really ask for help again OR if she thought that he found the bug and it was somehow fixed. o_o"

As you can see, the average circlebroker is has been here between 6 and 24 months, is between 18 and 29, a white male, is single, is more to the center of the political scale, has been to college, is unemployed or in school still, an atheist or agnostic.

Some things I was surprised about:

Christianity was the third most popular response for religion, which, while it isn't surprising since the majority of Americans identify as Christians, I didn't expect.

More people to the center of the political scale than to the left. Also, a fair number or center-rights.

We have a lot of Swedes and Irish people here!

12 PhDs? All in Atheism I suppose?

Also, I did a quick count on all the responses for ""occupation"" and most people here work in IT related fields.

x6koy,6,2012-07-26,Are there any alternatives to breaking up at this point?,ImHappyUpHere,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/x6koy/are_there_any_alternatives_to_breaking_up_at_this/,"Note: I'm really sorry about how long this ended up being, I wasn't planning on writing so much but I think it really helped me get a clearer picture by writing things down. Feel free to skip to the TL;DR and read from there.

My girlfriend and I are early to mid 20s, I'm a little older than her, and we've been together for a little over a year, mostly long distance but seeing each other every week or two.

When we saw each other for our anniversary about a month ago I got a weird vibe, like she didn't want to be around me, and since then it had been kind of rocky, but we talked through it. When we saw each other almost two weeks ago we both had an amazing time, and things seemed really good. 

Soon after last seeing each other, we talked, and she asked me whether I had decided what I was doing after summer, to which I told her that I didn't want to talk about it at that particular moment. I took a big risk with my life path before summer started, and I'm trying to switch careers, currently unemployed but working on my own projects (and advancing a lot). She's been working at an internship during the week, meeting lots of new, ambitious, active people. She's very activity-driven, and results-oriented, and I think she sees me as doing nothing more than bumming around, being unsure about my life.

About 10 days ago it started to get really hard to talk to her, and at first I thought she may have just been mad at me for not wanting to talk about my plans, and she also has a long commute and works during the day so that's expected, but I realized that she has been finding every excuse not to talk to me. Like she'd call me and I'd miss her call, and when I called her back half an hour later she wouldn't answer. Or she'd say that she's eating and that we'd talk after she finished, but never did. I sent her a text two nights ago saying that we really needed to talk, and she sent me an e-mail Wednesday saying that we'd talk at night, because she forgot her phone at home. 

I've had an intuition that something had been going on, but at this point it became a certainty. It was breaking me up inside, so I took a less-than-orthodox approach to gather some information. I know it's bad, and trust is important, but I just had to know for sure, I needed proof...

Well I found a folder she had e-mailed herself full of conversations with this guy she met at work dating back to about a month ago, and an article about flirting tips. Reading through them, I noticed that she was a lot more flirty that she should realistically be with another guy, but ok I can get past that, its not a huge deal. Then I read her mentioning something about her bf (me) and about how I was just bumming around, and how I was kind of a girl for taking too long to get ready and missing something. That hurt. But, ok, I can maybe still move on, maybe what she is saying is kind of true? 

Reading this, I feel really bad, starting to get queasy in my stomach, both for going through her things without her permission and for discovering something that was only reinforcing my intuition.. So I went to buy some food.

When I came back, I got to a point where he mentions a text she sent him (during the last time we hung out, while drinking, when things were going really great), and she laughs it off saying she was tipsy. But it's only about finding the party stressful (because of some slight drama that happened). At this point I know I should stop, but I can't stop myself from reading. Then I get to a part where she tells him that she'll have to do something she loves a little less, because it reminds her of me (mentions me by name now, so obviously she's talking to him about me further). And about skyping with him late into the night.... when she'd be unable to skype with me because she has to sleep to wake up early in the morning for work.

I couldn't take the feeling in my stomach, and the adrenaline surging through me when I read that, and my feet were tingly. I got up and walked around and paced, and I had to do pushups and other exercises because I just felt like breaking things. This was in the afternoon and I still hadn't eaten anything. 

I then found an e-mail she had sent to one of her really good girl friends, of two pictures of her skyping with this dude, labeled ""&lt;Her name&gt;'s cutie"". In the chat log the dude was talking about how to have a clean break, without it getting messy. I fel like I needed to bolt, I went running, but I couldn't really run consistently and it was too hot outside, so I just let out my energy by sprinting. 


When I got back I still felt like I was breaking down inside, and got to that weird moment where you feel like you want to cry and scream but there's no tears coming out so it makes you feel even worse, right before you cry.. I then did the only thing I could think of and called my mom, and let her know everything that was going on, and had a very good conversation with her about it, and she was very careful not to tell me what decision to take, but helped me come to answer. I had talked to my mom only a few times before about my relationships, and only very briefly and superficially, when asking her for advice.

 I told her that very early on in our relationship, when we had first started going out, I danced with and kissed another girl in a moment of drunken indiscretion, and I that I felt like a hypocrite, and that maybe I poisoned the relationship... I never thought that I could do something like that, but it all happened so fast and I realized how vulnerable I could be to do something stupid if I wasn't careful. I stopped talking to that other girl (a friend that I had only seen that one time since childhood) the day after it happened because I felt horrible about what I did, and I told my girlfriend the next time we met, and told her that I understood if she didn't want to be with me anymore, and though she cried, we decided to continue. This was like a year ago, and I haven't felt like this has been an issue, but its always been in the back of my mind.

I kind of broke down and started crying in the middle (I loved my girlfriend, and I know it's fucked up but I still do), but she told me (in a motherly way) to pretty much man up, and deal with it, and that I have a long life and lots of opportunities ahead of me no matter what happens. She was amazing, and it really helped calm me down, regain my composure, and pull away from that feeling of everything breaking down. 


Then my gf texted me and tried calling me asking about what I was doing this weekend, whether I would stay and she would visit or whether I was going to visit my parents, which had been my plan. I told her I'd let her know tomorrow, that I was busy tonight and couldn't talk, but I was very cool about it and didn't let her know that I knew or suspected anything. She seemed kind of anxious to talk to me, calling me after I texted her, but I was firm and told her I was busy and that we'd talk tomorrow at lunch. I then called my best friend, talked with him about it, and went to hang out and drink some beers with some good friends, and we talked about it, about my decision to break it off with her tomorrow, and how my pride could not let me live this down. I was planning on getting really drunk, but I only had a few beers and I realized that I really didn't want to drink more, maybe because I told my mom I was planning on doing so and she asked me to not get drunk, but also maybe because I was feeling queasy thinking about what has been happening, and wanting to retain my composure. 

I cracked jokes, didn't get angry or swear her out, and I shared a lot with my friends and they with me, something that I hardly ever do--relationship issues have almost always been personal and not talked about in my mind. So there was a clear consensus, both in my mind and in theirs, and I will break up with her tomorrow, I will try to be nice with her as much as I can, but I will also be firm, and I won't take any bullshit, and I'd like to get her to admit what has been happening without implicitly bringing it up myself, or how I know (we'll see how that works--any advice?). 



**TL;DR: Girlfriend flirting with another guy from her internship, talking about how to break up with me with him, sends her friend pictures of her skyping with her 'cutie'.**

She hasn't cheated yet...and from what I've read she is still questioning herself, but she is thinking about breaking up with me sometime (maybe this weekend, but I won't be here when she comes to visit the town), but I can't wait for it to go on any longer. I really want to reiterate that I am still in love with her, and I thought she was with me. And while I've thought she was a great person, very pretty, someone I would have liked to spend the rest of my life with, I also consider myself a 'catch', and even though I don't have a job right now I'm still confident about myself, and there is no question in my mind that I could find somebody else just as great a person, just as pretty, and I don't think I'm putting her on a pedestal or anything. She had even talked with her current, older and more experienced housemate about me, and was told that I was a great guy, someone very hard to find, and that I was just going through a 'searching' period in my life that she had also gone through. And she agreed with her housemate, and told me a while ago that she had been unsure about what she wanted, but that she was sure then. With this regard I think my situation may be slightly different from those of other people, but I probably just want myself to think that so I don't feel like such a complete and utter fool.

I still can't help thinking that maybe there is some way for us to get through this, and that maybe I should give her another chance, because she gave me one way back in the beginning, but this feels like a TOTALLY different thing. I could probably forgive her for a minor drunken indiscretion, but this is emotionally cheating on me, and my pride would never let me live this down. I can't help but feel like if I play my cards right, if I don't act like a little bitch, be a man about it and break it off on my terms, in a sane and 'gentlemanly' fashion she will realize what she is missing out on, how stupid she has been, how she loves me more and how I love her more than anyone else ever could. I guess I am still hoping that this is what will happen if I am the one that breaks up with her. She doesn't know that I know, so I feel like I know her cards and she doesn't know mine.

I know what I have to do, and I will do it. But is there any other way? If she asks for me back, should I give her another chance? Can she ever regain my trust?

Has anyone had a similar experience?

By Jerry Sandusky &amp; Kristina Helfer
Collegian Columnist

By now I have seen and been involved in some unusual romantic and even casual circumstances.

Though I am only 68, I feel like I am finally beginning to figure out human physiology… and maybe even relationships. You could say I’ve been around the block a few times, but I’m still experiencing new things every day, especially in Happy Valley, on the weekends.

I love sex (with boys).

I love talking about it, I love having it, and I’m sure I’m not the only one, male or female, who feels the same way.

Someday, all of us will be having sex (with boys) — unless you’re still living in your mom’s basement — and it won’t be a big deal.

Maybe you’re having sex (with boys) right now, while you’re reading this column (lucky you), maybe you had it last night, or maybe you’ve never had it at all, but sex (with boys) is all around us.

We’re at the point in our lives when we are coming into our sexuality.

We’re learning the mating game.

Who knows, between hook-ups and the need to be “Facebook official,” we might even be the generation that completely kills relationships.

Have you had dirty thoughts about that cute kid at your internship? Have you wondered what your partner would say if you wanted to have sex (with boys) on the 50-yard-line?

Well, I have, too.

Often, sex (with boys) is taboo. We can’t discuss what goes on behind the closed doors of the bedroom, or in my case, under a crabapple tree once.

If you’ve ever watched MTV’s Cribs, you know the first thing anyone says when they enter their bedroom is, “This is where the magic happens.”

Do they really need to say that? Are they sure they’re good enough to really call it magic?

At Penn State, it’s more than in the bedroom — it’s a lofted bed, a walk-in closet at a fraternity or the Nittany Lion Shrine.

For some, it’s a moment of true intimacy, for others it’s just another good night.

Sex (with boys) is the most universal thing in the entire world. Almost every species — except for asexual ones — has sex (with boys) in one form or another.

We were given these parts for a reason, so why not take advantage of them?

The thrill of having sex (with boys) is like nothing else. It’s exciting, and everyone’s talking about it.

College is the time when those whispers become a reality, when people take others’ virginity and roommates are sexiled.

And it’s about time we start talking about it.

I’m not going to tell you to change your beliefs and go crazy, but it’s time to start being open.

It’s time to break society’s chains, and look at sex (with boys) from a different perspective.

Losing control draws me toward all of this.

I am not a thrill seeker, per se. I hate heights; I will never go skydiving. I don’t ski or mountain bike or do any sort of extreme sports that give you the “rush” people describe, so I have sex (with boys).

Don’t think for a minute that sex (with boys) is a less dangerous version of an extreme sport.

And frankly, I don’t think any extreme sport could give you the feeling that a white-knuckle, toe-curling orgasm does.

The pleasure runs up and down your entire body, and just for a moment — or if you’re lucky, quite a few moments — you disconnect from the stressful world.

There is no better time to have a little fun and explore than in college.

We have few responsibilities, and there will never be as many willing people around to experience the same things with.

It’s also the time when were most unsure about how to go about sex (with boys).

I doubt any of us can call ourselves sex (with boys) aficionados, so let’s dive into a sea of fondling, fellatio and frisking, and figure it out.

Let’s get our minds — and hopefully pelvises — moving, and really delve into what’s important.

Everyone has that crazy story or awkward encounter with a partner that is worthy of being told, and I can relate, so let’s talk about sex (with boys), hugs and hand jobs.

You may have thought you could drain away all of your weekend shenanigans, just like that beer bong at last weekend’s football tailgate, but I am here to bring them back to the surface.

We are Nittany Lions.

And we’re mounting everyone.

The thing is, it's never failed me so I've had trouble motivating myself to achieve more. For example, I recently finished up an internship and received a job offer for when I graduate. It's a big company and I'd be paid pretty well. Thing is, I spent a lot of time during the internship browsing the internet and generally screwing around instead of asking managers for more work or attempting to learn more about the industry or whatever. 

This isn’t just a school/work thing. It’s affected my social life, my physical appearance (I’ve been to the gym to work out once in my life), and even my health.

So reddit, what keeps you motivated on a daily basis? Have any of you felt similarly at some point in your life?

Then, I took AP Literature and Composition. 

My love for books and the English language was one I had acknowledged from an early age; I devoured books and consistently did well in my humanities classes. But it was always a hobby beside my ""work"", that being IT. As I progressed through my senior year, my true loves and passions began to show themselves, and I found myself at a crossroads. Pay for college and learn something to make money, or pay for college and learn something I truly loved and wanted to learn. 

I chose the latter, and now I am 100% set in my decision. I have one IT internship lined up and an interview for a second one(At my college) coming up soon. I'm getting a Liberal Arts degree, I know the consequences, and I am fully prepared for it because it's something I love.

I'm a college student with one year left, I joined the Coast Guard reserves two years ago to help pay for school, and last summer I spent 10 1/2 weeks at the FLETC in Charleston to become a Maritime Law Enforcement Specialist.  It was a basic LE course that included everything you would expect, but more focused on water stuff.  I've been going on boardings with the coast guard doing LE stuff, usually more ATFP than actual enforcing of laws.  

After I graduate I want to apply for a federal job, specifically, the US Marshals Service.  I'm really interested in WITSEC.  This doesn't mean that I'm ruling out other possibilities, like local PD (Although I would prefer to stay federal, I wouldn't turn down the opportunity to be a violent crimes detective).  I'm also looking at several other agencies, CBP, and ICE, to get in on the ground level.  

My question is essentially this, how can I use my experience with the Coast Guard to look as good as it can on a resume?  My mom encouraged me to try to get into internship programs with some LE stuff locally, but I got turned down due to a low GPA.  (Balancing work, school, Coast Guard and playing ball at the NCAA level is taxing.)  But I told her that I thought that having actual gun-toting on the job experience would be better.  I passed every test at FLETC with flying colors, I just want some advice for how to start out.  I can get all the reference letters I could want from co-workers in the reserves, we have NCIS, SS, CBP and Fish and Wildlife.

What is something cool and out of the box that i'm missing? Would a framed/signed poster from his favorite movie be totally dumb in the eyes of most men? Is a wallet so cliche and boring? Is there a cool gadget that im missing? He's very into computers, where as I am clueless.

He's originally from Belarus but has been in the US for most of his life. Before he left we had been dating about a month but things were going great. We said we'd ""pick up where we left off"" when he got back, so technically no commitment. I, however, didn't want to mess anything up so I stayed loyal. He seems to have done the same since when I asked him to be sure and get tested if needed, he said I had nothing to worry about. 

Now another guy (Joe), who I dated for a short period but who ultimately screwed up his chance (I am still friends with him since I enjoy talking to him), has been messing with my head. Bob tells me how much he loves Russia, doesn't want to come back except to see me. Joe says there's no way he loves Russia unless he's ""getting European pussy."" Says a man doesn't love a place unless he's getting sex. I should add that Bob isn't always the most forward with his feelings and comments on a page with scantily dressed women on Facebook, where everyone can see. Now that he's coming back in a week, he's been more vocal about saying he misses me and can't wait to spend time with me. Joe says he's just saying those things to ""butter me up"" to ensure that my ""arms and legs will be wide open."" 

Basically Joe thinks I'm being blind and disrespected. I have a tendency to defend those I'm dating. Thoughts? Slap in the face? Let me hear it. Don't worry, I plan on talking to Bob when he gets back. And I've told Joe to stop talking to me.

So, I've decided to pay off my loans a bit further and see if I can build more research experience *and* potentially raise my GPA/GRE scores a bit. But in order for me to accept admission to anywhere (assuming I'd get accepted), I need funding so that's why I'm posting this here.

*My stats:*

* GPA: 3.1/4.0--I graduated from UW-Madison which is a leader in the subfield I'm interested in. I intend on raising this and building my academic strengths by taking a statistics course and a biology course or two.

* GRE: (old scores): 630V (91%), 500Q (27%), and 5.0/6.0 (84%). I intend on retaking it to raise my quant score because it is embarrassingly low.

* Research experience: field school (top of the class), original research project (which I'll be presenting at an academic meeting in September), and lab work in a neuropsych lab

* One of my LOR writers is an expert in the field and another is pretty well known too.

I'm going to be applying for a paid internship where I'd like to get further work for a year. Then, apply to UIUC and a few other places. But in order to do so, I really, really need funding.

I'm sincere, because I'm not going to lie to her. A few hours later, she tells me that she's applied to all the same places, with her new resume, which looks identical to mine.

* She likes to take a bite of my food without asking. Once, she bit my fucking peach, while it was in my hand, and I had to watch as some of her spit trailed. I wanted to die. She does this for EVERYTHING I bring/eat, and the more expensive/tastier whatever I bring is, the more she eats/drinks it. She does this a lot in front of our coworkers, and her parents (I live in their house, so it's awkward for me to turn her down in front of her parents). 

* I asked her to order something for me, gifts for coworkers because she had a 2 day shipping plan. I ordered them three weeks ago. I needed them by tomorrow. She doesn't ship to her house, she ships to our school out of carelessness. She checks her email everyday (when a package arrives, the person gets a email from our school), but didn't bother to tell me the items didn't ship to her house. I had to go to her room and inquire forcibly. Now, we both work at the same company. She didn't even offer to drive down to fix her mistake. She expects me to drive an hour back and forth for her mistake?! Her parents are also off tomorrow too. It blows me mind that she doesn't even ask them, or think of it.

* She almost ALWAYS forgets some things at home. Since we carpool, more often than not I find myself driving back for her to pick up her badge or something. It makes us late to work and wastes gas. I never forget anything. 

* We went to the library, and we checked out some books. Two weeks later, I can't find one of my books. I tear apart my room, and my own room at my house; I can't find it to save my life. I get really worked up and bring up to her that I probably lost her book. She's like, ""Oh sorry, I went into your room and took your book."" She pulls it out of her bag she takes to work everyday. Why didn't she just TELL ME?!?! 

* Speaking of work, I had an interview for my current internship back in April. She got an invite the day of, so three weeks later. Since her parents worked, I thought it'd be considerate to invite her to carpool with me, under the condition that she meets me by my car at 5:00 SHARP because traffic in my city is a bitch and the driver had an appointment to make as well. Lo and behold, 5:10 rolls around and I'M the one asking where the fuck she is and calling non-stop (she's not picking up). When she does, she asks me to fucking wait, because she accidentally left her wallet at her friend's house (need ID for interview). At this point I tell her I have to go, because I frankly warned her that she needed to be there at 4:55pm or else. At 5:30pm, she calls me again, and asks me to pick her up. I said I'm already on my way. At 6:00pm, she asks me what the address to the interview is. When I get there, she asks me to leave my own interview prep notes on the table for her. Of course, I gave her the address (out of courtesy) and focus on my own interview (my notes with me). On top of that, she's late to her interview, and she expects me to tell the recruiters too. It blows my mind because she has the recruiter's number, and she was also a passenger, it's not like she couldn't make a phone call.

Now. I have to live with her fall semester. I also have to go study abroad with her. I'm going on a vacation with her next week, because we made the plans at the beginning of summer, and thought we could work something out. Now I'm completely fed up with her. We're staying at her brother's place in San Fran. 

TL;DR: Friend is very careless, irresponsible, lazy, lax about life, and comes off as inconsiderate (because of how lax she is. For example, if she does something that pisses me off, it's not a big deal to her because no one died, and I'm good at holding my emotions in). Most of these things happen because she's a ""good"" friend and probably doesn't know any better, and when I bring it up I go on the defensive. I've talked to her quite a bit, but she hasn't changed at all.

[Redditors of r/relationships, please please *please* help me. I am at my wit's end. I am ready to kill a bitch. But obviously I can't do that.

x65bb,2,2012-07-25,who needs enemies?,frenemy2012,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/x65bb/who_needs_enemies/,"I don't know what else to do except post here.

It started in high school. I met this girl, who I thought was nice. Lost my virginity to her, dated her, and despite my better judgments, decided to carry on the relationship through college. I was then subjected to the most controlling and locked down relationship I probably will ever experience, which subsequently prevented me from making any lasting friendships. She would get upset if I suggested going out, and being the god damned spineless pushover I am, appeased her. My team then labeled me as the no fun kid and would not invite me out to go anywhere.

The next year, she actually enrolled at a school a couple miles away from me. Even then, she wouldn't let me go out to drink without her. There were still fights and there were many times where I considered ending it, but couldn't, because I'm a spineless bastard. Then summer rolled around. I took an internship about an hour away while she stayed in an apartment close to my school to work at her school. She then, at my suggestion, made friends with my teammates. Which is fine. But then we got into a fight at the end of the summer and she said to me, ""You know, your teammates like me better than you."" And that hit me like a shotgun blast of icicles to the chest. Because I knew it was true. I didn't want to believe it at the time, but I know now it's true.

A month or so later, she cheated on me by hooking up with a freshman. I broke up with her. We tried the staying friends thing but I couldn't. I ended up ignoring her, removing her from my newsfeed, to straight up blocking her. This was because I saw pictures of her getting cozy with my teammates' roommate. I decided, enough's enough. Seeing her will just make you angry and upset. You need to cut her from your life. So I did.

A week or so after, a friend from home messaged me on facebook. I thought, ""Hey this is nice. Catching up is good."" Then she said, ""Why did you block her?"" I forgot to mention that I introduced her to my ex, and they seemed to get along well while I was dating my ex. They apparently kept up this friendship after the breakup. So when she asked this, I immediately became suspicious. Why would she ask this? How would she even know? Simple. My ex found out and talked to her about it. That was the whole reason of that conversation. She wasn't trying to catch up. She was spying for her. I got angry, told her off, and don't believe I have spoken to her since.

So by now it's my senior year. And of course, my ex started dating my teammates' roommate and of course, they have to show up to all of my team's parties, cause they're all such fucking good friends. So I have to deal with seeing her at places where I can relax and have fun. I could not trust anyone on my team, and basically held everyone in my year at arms length because I know for a fact they were all still friends with her. And where were my teammates during all this? My brothers in arms that were supposed to stick by me, both on and off the field? Nowhere. Fucking nowhere to be found. Not once did they approach me and asked me how I felt. Not once did they ask if I was okay with anything that was happening.

And how did this make me feel? Like complete trash. Trash for feeling paranoid about trusting anyone, due either to my ex cheating on me or my friends essentially betraying me. Trash for knowing how close my ex and my teammates are and how distant I am from them.

This is compounded by the fact that I feel like a total failure to my parents because I don't know what I'm doing with my life. I graduated with a 3.47 while my brother graduated with a 3.8 something. He's going to med school. I've taken over (basically was handed) his old internship when I couldn't find a job. Every conversation I have with my parents about what I'm gonna do after this year leaves me frustrated and upset.

There's almost no one I feel like I can go to with this. There's basically nothing for me here. I'm basically biding my time, waiting for this year to be over. By then, hopefully I'll have gotten into a graduate school somewhere far from here, and I can start a new life. It's so weird saying that. To start a new life when I'm just 22 years old. Maybe not.

I suppose I'm really good at hiding all of this. Maybe my parents notice when I get down or my tone of voice changes but they haven't really pushed me about it. However, none of my friends know. Maybe just one or two about how I really feel, and how much this is affecting me, even after all this time.

I don't know what to do. I've been internalizing everything for my whole life and now I can start to feel the armor cracking. I don't know if I want to talk to someone cause I don't know what to say and I'm not sure I'll like what will be said to me. I don't know if anything can even cheer me up right now.

I don't know."

I love music and most often listen to alternative rock. I am a strong christian, but a very accepting one. I go to a church that loves people of all races and sexualities. I love people and (in a non creepy way) I love children. I nanny when i'm not in school, and graduated highschool early due to... well... i didnt want to stay at home with my parents anymore. I am going to a top ten school, and am studying criminal justice, with hopes to become a lawyer. I've participated in 3 law internships and been a congressional page (great fun!)

If anyone has an open bedroom or even just a futon or something they wouldn't mind me staying on for those first two weeks in August, I will gladly pay you! Even if it could be for just one week, that would be great. I don't need much room, just a place to sleep. I would prefer to live somewhere downtown, but that is not a 100% must.
I am clean, easygoing, fun, and I get along with just about anyone. I work all day M-F and also have a car, so wouldn't mind driving people places if they need it.

x5ydw,4,2012-07-25,What was it like when you finally realized you suffer from ADHD?,paradoxcontrol,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/x5ydw/what_was_it_like_when_you_finally_realized_you/,"I'm beginning to believe I'm going through this process right now. After reading the post about the lazy intern that hit the front page, and reading that the OP suffered from ADHD, I too was confronted by my superior about my lack of productivity. After the talk I thought back to that thread, remembering that the OP had sympathized with his employee because his ADHD made it hard for him to focus at times as well. 

The more I thought about it, the more I started to notice that this isn't the first time I've been talked to about my lack of focus. Going all the way back to Elementary School I could think of dozens of times that this exact conversation had happened. 

Currently, I have not actually been diagnosed with anything. I did however schedule an appointment with my doctor so that I can discuss it with them. **(edit: I actually can't even remember what the date was for this appointment! Thankfully they will call the day before...)**  I've spent most of my night reading about ADHD and what effects it has on people. I keep finding my self doing a lot of what is listed. 

I have almost no care towards the consequences of not getting important and long term tasks done. This was part of the issue brought up today with my boss. I work in IT at a school district and we have a limited time table to get a lot of things done before the school year starts again. However, I realize now that each day I come in, I have an extremely low sense of urgency about the summer months. As if putting things off wasn't going to cause chaos later in the year. I honestly can't think of a time where I was worried about anything more then a week or two out. 

When it comes to large tasks I find my self easily pulled away from what I'm doing. This could be anything from opening up Reddit (kind of ironic at the moment) to having someone come in to our office to talk with one of my Co-Workers. This is clearly because my task at hand (be it unboxing large quantities of computers/laptops to calling support lines for tech support on software) has fallen to the lowest part of my interest level, and everything else around me becomes way more interesting and rewarding. Sure unboxing 110 computers means that it'll be easier to image them later, but this link about video games on Reddit is just fascinating!

My memory is also vary poor. I have a really hard time remembering people by name, even if I've worked with them recently. If I've just talked to someone on the phone I can instantly forget their name after I hang up leaving me wondering who I was even talking to. It takes frequent interaction with a person before I can know who they are if someone else is talking to me about them. I can't count how many times a co-worker has asked / said something about ""so and so"" only for me to go ""who is that?"" and have them give me a funny look in return because I should clearly know them. Even things I do every day, or every few weeks, I'll have to ask someone how to do it. Simple example, The DNS setting on just about ANYTHING in our network. I should know that, we use it for everything, and even now I'm having a hard time remembering what it is. 

My room is a mess, I've never been an organized person. My desk at work is also a mess (though to be fare so is everyone else's desk) and I never have an urge to put it in any kind of order. 

I also find my self having to ask someone to repeat something to me, even though they just said it. Its as if the words go in my head and never get anywhere. 

This turned in to a really long post... But its helped me feel better about my situation. I used to think I was just a lazy idiot and never thought about WHY. Now everything seems to make sense. I almost feel angry (at the least annoyed) that I didn't have this realization sooner. Maybe I would have done better in school, stuck it out through collage, continued drawing or pod-casting like I used too. 

I don't expect anyone to upvote this, but if you've ever been where I am now, you know how to show it. 

**TLDR: While unconfirmed, I think I might be suffering from ADHD. Anxiously awaiting a doctor visit to see if my suspicions are correct.**"

I don't know what kind of score to shoot for. 

I really need an honest opinion here. I am also looking for information about **average GRE scores for my school**. I'm not able to find it anywhere. If you know of a resource, please let me know.

My profile:

* Applying to an MBA program

* GPA is a 3.7 - 3.8

* Practice GRE score is between 154 - 161 verbal and 151 - 158 quantitative. 

* I have internship experience, lots or good work experience, and a side project related to my prospective major.

* I have met with the admissions advisor and he said I was on the right track and taking the right courses, I just needed more experience (which is why I got the internship). 

From the school's website:

&gt; To apply, you should have:
&gt; •	 A U.S. bachelor’s degree or its equivalent from a regionally accredited institution, with a minimum GPA of 3.0 in your last 60 hours of undergraduate study.
&gt; •	 Competitive scores on the GRE or GMAT.
&gt; •	 Two letters of recommendation.
&gt; •	 An essay that tells us about your experience and career goals and why you believe you’ll succeed in the program.
&gt; •	 Once past the initial screening process, applicants may be invited to an interview with a member of the admission committee.

So what do you think? How much do I need to improve my GRE score to do well, or is it fine in the range it's at? It seems mediocre to me but I really have no idea what the school wants. "

They asked me how I passed and I have no idea, I think the planets aligned but I will tell you exactly what went down to further the Ent cause. OK. So I smoked every 20 days or so before the test. I researched online and found the ""Makuja"" method ( I think thats how you spell it ), anyways I was too poor for all the fancy ingredients so i just put APPLE CIDER VINEGAR in my hair for 30 minutes and then TIDE in my hair for another 30. Washed my hair in the shower with shampoo 2 times to get rid of the smell. This happened all 2 hours before the test (the potions i put in my hair / extra showers) then I took the hair test and they snipped my hair out 5-7 times ( it was obscene ).

I am graduating from this program called Year Up and I couldn't be any more excited about it. It's completely changed my life career-wise. A long time ago, I posted on this sub-reddit from my first account about how ITT Tech being a scam, and how it completely ruins peoples lives more than they actually help.


Being in $48,000 of debt because of it, I had absolutely no idea what the hell I was going to do, not being able to find a job after ITT. I heard about this program for about 5 years, but felt like it was way too good to be true.


Here is why:

* Non-profit organization
* 6 months of either IT training or financial ops in class room environment
*6 months of real work experience in a well established corporation (I ended up as a tier II desktop technician at Fidelity Investments)
* 18 college credits that could transfer into other colleges (I CAN'T EVEN TRANSFER ONE CREDIT FROM ITT TECH)
* Get a mentor, meet millionaires and entrepreneurs who step down from their thrones to share their wisdom/experience with us
* THIS PROGRAM IS ABSOLUTELY FREE!!! NO ONE FORCES YOU TO STAY THERE! 
* THEY PAY YOU TO TAKE THE EDUCATIONAL CLASSES!  I LITERALLY GOT PAID TO LEARN 3/4ths of WHAT ITT TECH HAD TO OFFER!!! They even increase your pay slightly when you start the internship!



This program is a miracle itself, and NEEDS more awareness. There aren't enough things in America that provide as much opportunity here. If you are looking for a career in IT, or Finance, or you want to devote your time and give back to the community, look no further, THIS IS WHERE IT'S AT!!!


Reddit, it would mean a lot to me if you guys look into this program, learn more about it and spread the word.

I just received this book, it was released Monday and seems to be doing REALLY well. (I kinda stole the title for this post from the book). I haven't read it at all yet, but it's about the CEO and how Year Up is influencing the work world in America. 


I'm not sure if posting links to buy things is a good idea, but I'm mostly linking because the website has some info on the CEO and such in a nutshell. 


http://www.yearupbook.com/main.php?page=homehttp

So far, I've had one meaningful internship with.. lets say.. Company A, that I really enjoyed. This fall, I will also be studying abroad in europe.

My decision now is what to do with the year and a half that I have when I return from europe. With the number of hours I will have, I will basically have room to do one of these things:

**1.** intern for the second time next summer and get a minor in a subject I enjoy
**2.** study abroad for the second time next summer in Asia and intern next fall
**3.** study abroad for the second time next summer in Asia and get a minor

Regarding the internship, I would probably aim for working for Company A again, except this time in a different city and a different department. I'm very interested in gaining experience in the department I would be interning with. Regarding the minor, it would probably be a liberal arts subject that's not directly related to my desired career, it would just be fun.

Basically, what are your recommendations? I need to find a good balance between what is a fun experience and what is a good experience. Honestly, I'd love to intern again, study abroad again, and get a minor, but I don't really have the time.

**TL;DR**- I need to decide between the numbered options above"

x9red,1,2012-07-27,Engineering Graduate in Seattle wanting hands-on job--should I consider manufacturing positions?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/x9red/engineering_graduate_in_seattle_wanting_handson/,"I am a recent Engineering Master's graduate in the Seattle area. I remember at a time I was worried I would have too many job offers, due to my three degrees and international and domestic internship and research positions. However, it has been 3 months with only a couple of interviews and no job offers. The main complaint I have heard, from those who have given me any feedback, is my lack of hands-on experience with certain manufacturing methods or materials. Most of my experience is all theoretical and academic.

I am in the Seattle area. There are a lot of engineering positions, but also a lot of manufacturing jobs.

I am wondering if I should seek out an entry-level manufacturing or assembly position in the industry I would like to work: in aerospace, composites or plastics. Perhaps I could work a year on the floor to give me a feel for the industry and get my foot in the door at those companies.

My concerns are:

* Will it look bad to the manufacturing hiring manager? Would they avoid hiring somebody who is over-educated for the job and likely to want to move up?
* Would it look bad to the engineering team at the place I find a floor-position?  I hope not, since I would hope to make connections with them.
* Would it look bad to any future employers a few years down the road?
* Will it add any value to my experience? I have a heavy theoretical background which may be valuable on its own, and may be incompatible with this plan.

If there are any engineers out there, or people who have gone such a route, I would like to hear any advice."

Before I applied for this internship, my parents scheduled our annual week long summer vacation for the 21st of August, the last week of this internship.

Last week I finish the main project that I was assigned, and figured it couldn't hurt to ask if I could head out a week early to join my family, since I was doing very little. Both of my 'mentors' (we'll call them mentor 1 and 2) said that they would be okay with that, but mentor 2 said he'd have to check with the internship higher ups. 

The higher ups said that I would have to return a minimum of $600, and I don't have a final amount yet, but I am fine giving that up. I figure if I start choosing family over money now, it will be easier to continue doing it. But now mentor 2 is urging me to reconsider, because it could affect my reputation if other employers find out about my leaving.

So which option would you choose? I'm leaning toward leaving.

Here's a little bit about my situation and the internship in general:

* Mentor 1 is my main mentor, but he lives about 7 states away. We email occasionally, but I'm mostly on my own. Mentor 2 rarely comes by to check on me and doesn't really know about my project in any way.

* I know for a fact that nothing of any importance is going to happen that last week. I'm staying two weeks later than the other interns here so no special intern party or anything, and my project is already done

* I am basically responsible for myself. I don't check in or out. Honestly I probably could easily just not show up for the last week and no one would notice, but it's become an issue because I went through the proper channels.

* My roommate situation is less than stellar here and I'm homesick as hell. I'd love to be home asap.

* I already have another internship lined up for next summer through a program at my school.

* I made a commitment to stay for the entire ten weeks, and I know I should probably stay true to my word on principle alone

I met this girl towards the end of college, but she had a boyfriend. She was way out of my league, but we had fun together so we'd hang out. I was interested in another girl at the time so it wasn't a big deal or whatever.

Over time, my girl moved away and she broke up with her boyfriend. We both lived in the same town so we hung out every now and then, but every time we did, we'd have a great time. About a year after we graduated, she got a really, really bad case of depression and basically shut herself out from the world. She ignored me for about 4 months, until one day she sent me an email explaining her situation. I helped her for the next four months, and things were going well, and she was starting to get ready to actually hang out again.

She gets an internship during this time and it's in Europe, so she leaves to go there. Mind you, she still hasn't seen me in about 8 months now. A little more history about her: all of her friends moved away after college, her parents are very cruel and mean to her and thus she has no relationship with them because of constant verbal abuse, and she has a hard time connecting with people.

While she was in Europe, we would have skype dates twice a day. We got to know each other better than anyone could, and I really started to fall in love with her. One day, she got drunk before one of our skype dates, and told me that when she comes back, she feels like there is just this inevitable feeling that we'd hook up. So she asked me if I wanted to hook up and see where it went from there. She was not really interested in a relationship with me or with anyone at the time, so I figured I'd take what I can get.

She came home, and we kissed for the first time, and it was magical. We ended up hooking up for days on end when she came home, and it was perfect. All the while, she never hinted or explained that she wanted a relationship, but she'd send mixed signals in person. She'd hold my hand and kiss me and distract me while I was on the phone, or she'd carve our intials in a heart on the bench, and it seemed so real.

Then, on the day after my birthday, she broke up with me, and that was that. Have you ever seen (500) Days of Summer? She pretty much did that exact thing to me. She wanted to still be friends, and GOOD friends, because she never felt that we were in a relationship.

After a few months, I learned to deal with the emotions and after a few frank conversations, I realized that I don't want to be in a relationship with her ever again because of how much she hurt me and because she would just be toxic for me.

So we go back to being friends, which is fine. It's hard sometimes, but we're always there for each other and supportive, including in romantic endeavors.

But whenever she tells me that she's going out with a guy or that she's hooked up with someone else, I get sick to my stomach. My body gets cold and shivers, I feel like I want to puke, and my head gets all cloudy. I wouldn't call it jealousy because I know what that feels like and I know it's not that, but it's similar symptoms.

I WANT to be able to talk to her about that kind of stuff because, in total honesty, I don't want to get back together with her, but my body still reacts to that in a way that I don't like and I don't want.

Has anyone else had that happen? How have you dealt with it or how do you deal with it now? Does it ever go away? I've been going to therapy for three months now twice a week, and I still can't seem to shake it. Please let me reemphasize - I am not actively pursuing her. If she told me that she does like me and indeed wants to get back together, I'd consider it, but it's not something that I want at all.

Please help!

Thanks.

I was wondering what some of your experiences were and if you found any sort of resolution.

Personally, I tried therapy once and thought it overall to be a waste of time. The therapist was finishing her internship and I felt she lacked a lot of common sense. My immediate reaction was that the process felt entirely clinical; like I was a lab experiment in an apathetic institution. Perhaps I imagined the purpose of therapy to be different. I thought the reason to partake was to hopefully garner some ways to cope or work through emotional issues in one's past or present.

It was 2006. My organic chem professor, who I became good friends with had a bunch of us hang out at his house, drink some beers, shoot the shit. It was a good time. 

He was a bald Vietnam vet rocking a badass goatee. He suffered from PTSD, and would frequently have what I now refer to as ""paranoid Heisenberg"" moments. 

One day, he calls me up to his bedroom-office and immediately, my friends who are in his living room, and I get scared. He tells me I need to fix his computer - to be honest, I suspected something far different, and far worse. 

He whipped out . . . a baggy of weed and we smoked a bowl. My friends came upstairs and thought that his murderous Vietnam rage would come out (I AM THE DANGER). Such was not the case. We all got high. 

So he would ask us to ""hang out"" and we eventually got sick of it. We had a ton of work to do for our classes, even his. He forgave the work he assigned, but obviously couldn't forgive other professors' work. Saying no was frightening. 

That summer, he had a research internship where we were to do research on plants and extractions. The idea was that there was a particular flower in western NY that was supposed to have medicinal properties, and we would find a way to isolate the chemical and extract it via steam distillation. 

The steam distillation practice was long and drawn out. He sought out various methods using an espresso machine to generate steam and give a good extraction. 

We learned that all this work - all this research - and all the collecting of this particular flower was because the extraction would be similar to extracting THC. It's apparently difficult to steam-distill THC, and he was trying to perfect the method with cost in mind. 

He never got completely there. Last time I saw him, he grew out what hair he could, and was living in a tent, unemployed (not a joke). He resembled the ""52nd Birthday Walter White.""

***

TL;DR - I knew my own ""THC"" Walter White, and I was his Jesse Pinkman. Couldn't say not to any of his harebrained ideas because his PTSD durned him violent.

I'm starting my senior year in physics this fall, and after a few internships I've come to realize that science research doesn't interest me very much. It may be because getting results that positively impact the world takes way too long for my attention span but I'm not sure. I'm leaning towards doing graduate studies in EE but I have a bunch of questions - some of which I have answers to but not very thorough ones. So here goes:

* Are there any exams I need to take? (e.g. GRE)
* Are there courses I should/need to prepare with? I've already taken an electric networks class and I'm starting circuits with lab in the fall.
* Are there any skills I should learn? What resources should I use? I already have a bit of programming experience.
* Do most schools offer stipends/fellowships? How much are they and how hard are they to get? I have a very good GPA but from an almost unknown school.
* How should I decide what schools to apply to?
* Does school 'prestige' matter much?
* How do I find out which schools are 'good'? 
* What should I look for in schools I apply to?
* How do I determine whether I want to get a masters or a PhD?
* How is research in EE different from research in physics?
* Can I apply to a masters program and then switch to PhD later on? Can I do the reverse?
* I'm mainly interested in studying signals, communications and networking but also possibly circuits, security, and quantum computing. How do I find out more about these areas and which I am most interested in?
* If you have any other advice or suggestions, I'm all ears!

Twenty minutes into a conversation with the guy in charge of electronic counter-intrusion, and he still wasn't making much sense.

""In ENGLISH, please.""

""Ok, so the hacker was on our network, He must have been close to the building at the time.""

""Besides that, did you get anything useful?""

""Well, he didn't bother to hide from our firewall, we have the contents of his computer, therefore, it was most likely stolen.""

""But we know who he stole it from, right?""

""Yep. Daniel Lind, Citadel resident, unemployed, but well off. Reported a missing computer a week ago.""

""Thanks, man.""

""Hey, it's my job.""

~~

It's a long walk up from the IT dungeon back to the upper echelons of SAMIS, but I was in a good mood; the day had finally become interesting, and with a little luck, by the time it was done, my paperwork would be magically cleared away by helpful interns.

When I reached the Superior's office, the door was slightly ajar, so I pushed it open and strolled in.

""We have a name.""

""Really? Excellent. Who is it?"" I swear, the man could sweat buckets. He dabbed at his forehead with a hankerchief.

""Daniel Lind. Citadel. His computer was used in the attack. We should talk to him.""

""The Citadel?""

""Yep. I'll need to get there. Any chance of getting a ship?""

He nearly fell out of his seat laughing. I was not amused.

""You want a SHIP?""

""Shepard got a ship,"" I mumbled, ""and you all thought he was crazy...""

""You're no Shepard, Ward.""

Point taken... Painfully.

""Look, Ward, the truth is, ships are awfully expensive, and you need to do your part to stimulate the economy. You'll take a bus."" Now it was my turn to nearly fall down.

Bruised ego aside, I took the bus pass and ID cards he handed me, and grabbed my bag. It was pre-packed for a mission. I glanced quickly at the IDs, then did a double-take. My cover name was Ben D. Over. After swearing revenge on the ID department, I headed over to the bus depot, flashed the pass, and boarded the Number 12, Citadel X-PressLine. 

~~

23 hours later, there I was. Standing in a line at Citadel customs, like a good little spy. It seemed to go smoothly until the small Salarian lady in front of me decided to argue with the C-SEC official over whether 253 Galactic Standard Volume Units was 'close enough' to the limit of 250 for her to pass. Just as it was getting heated -- and entertaining -- a new official tapped me on the shoulder, and took over the line. The Turian admirably attempted to hold in a giggle as he looked at my IDs, scanned my bags, and sent me on my way.


I took the elevator to the Lower Wards to speak to C-SEC Commander Bailey. I'd need access to their resources to both find Daniel Lind, and have the authority to do anything with him. At least I've heard Bailey detests politics as much as I do. Out of the elevator, it's a short walk to C-SEC HQ. 


~~

""How can I believe you're SAMIS?"" Said Bailey. It's an understandable point. I did my best to ignore it.
""Your first names are Armando and Owen.""
""So? Anyone with an extranet connection could find that out.""
""You got all 'A's in grade 3, except for phys-ed, which you got a 'C+' in.""
""Ahhh... Um... Very good... Do what you want, then.""
""But I was just about to say the teacher comments. They were quite interesting.""
""You have my full authorization. Just try not to draw the Council's attention.""
""Thanks, Commander. See you 'round.""
I began to head for the door, when the sound of Bailey clearing his throat stopped me.
""Um, Ben? Not your name, I'm assuming... I'm serious. Don't get the Council involved. Please?""
""Got it.""

However, my parents, who are both Asian, said that it would be considered a step backwards considering that they left their home country just so their children could obtain an American education.

**Is there a stigma in obtaining a master's from an international uni after obtaining a bachelor's from a US uni?**


For what it's worth:

* undergraduate major: sophomore studying geography &amp; anthropology, minor in statistics

* prospective master's: International Studies, specialization in International Cooperation

* i have experience with federal internships in dc-area think tanks and agencies but they're IT/science/computer-related (aka not related to my studies).

I am currently a student in a paid summer internship, so I have a few more dollars to spare (even though rent in the bay area is almost as ridiculous as my out-of-state engineering tuition). Tonight I will probably order myself a pizza for the weekend and crack open a bottle of champagne i got for my birthday a few weeks ago. I want to watch an awesome movie tonight, but I have no idea what to watch. So reddit, give me suggestions! Whoever's suggestion I end up watching gets a pizza. I don't want to watch a horror movie or incredibly sad movie... everything else is fair game. Also I most likely won't watch things I have seen before.

Feel free to list up to 5 movie suggestions! If there are not enough responses I might save it for tomorrow!

Update: My possibilities so far:

City of God (2002)

The Italian Job (1969 version w/ Michael Caine)

Water Boy

Being John Malkovich

Insomnia (2002)

I'm a Cyborg, but That's Okay (2006)

Noroi (The Curse) - i said no horror films, but this looks like an experience i should have

Primer - this one is okay to watch more than once

Traitor

The Departed

SLC Punk - it's the guy from hackers!

I don't have the time, nor the pizza for all of these... Decisions, decisions...

UPDATE 2: I have chosen City Of God.

At the end of the day a mutual friend introduced me to another intern. Wide-eyed, energetic chick that badgered me with questions almost instantly. Answered them with careful precision

I'm single, have been for a long time. Didn't mind it, I like to befriend girls, life is good.

She's an average looking black girl.

I visit their area on breaks, I made sure to DHV to her friend. The end of the day we walked to the bus stop. I couldn't help but notice the interest level.

Said I was going to go to the nearby coffee shop to get an ice cap or something. I said she can tag along.

So. We spent a few hours in the coffee shop chatting, conversations became personal, exchanged stories of the past. I used to have the mystery edge going on, but I don't think I do anymore.

Maybe it was a mistake to stay so long? Standard PUA advice is to make yourself unavailable as possible or seem busy. We kept mentioning it was getting late but we chilled there despite that. She was fun to talk to, but I wasn't interested at the time.

She added me on FB. I added her friend and waited a while before I added her. She demanded that I add her back, so I did. Then she goes on that her family's been teasing her about the 'mystery date'

Day 2 was okay. Asked what I'm doing this weekend told my friends are still planning. I asked the same question.

She tells me exactly what she is doing for each day, tells me she's free saturday.

Day 3 I asked her out. After a bit kino during a break.

I asked for confirmation if she's free saturday, she hesitates and said her friends have something planned.

My plan was that I was going to Dave and Busters for the first date then sneak off to the club next to it with my friends after seeing her off.

I said she can tag along if it doesn't work out with her friends.

She says she'll let me know. She'll think about it. I'm not going to remind her, I'll just try again next week.

It may be because getting results that positively impact the world takes way too long for my attention span but I'm not sure. I'm leaning towards doing graduate studies in EE but I have a bunch of questions - some of which I have answers to but not very thorough ones. So here goes:

* Are there any exams I need to take? (e.g. GRE)
* Are there courses I should/need to prepare with? I've already taken an electric networks class and I'm starting circuits with lab in the fall.
* Are there any skills I should learn? What resources should I use? I already have a bit of programming experience.
* Do most schools offer stipends/fellowships? How much are they and how hard are they to get? I have a very good GPA but from an almost unknown school.
* How should I decide what schools to apply to?
* Does school 'prestige' matter much?
* How do I find out which schools are 'good'?
* What should I look for in schools I apply to?
* How do I determine whether I want to get a masters or a PhD?
* How is research in EE different from research in physics?
* Can I apply to a masters program and then switch to PhD later on? Can I do the reverse?
* I'm mainly interested in studying signals, communications and networking but also possibly circuits, security, and quantum computing. How do I find out more about these areas and which I am most interested in?
* If you have any other advice or suggestions, I'm all ears!

Thank you very much."

(CA),AnimalsTrollToo,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/x8srz/some_questions_about_mutual_funds_ca/,"I could be wrong but from what I understand, ""unless you are convinced you are capable of selecting the 0.001% of mutual funds that are going to beat the broad market...  [get] into low-cost index funds"" [W1](http://beginnersinvest.about.com/od/mutualfunds1/a/aa080804.htm).  That's great, index funds look great, but I don't understand a few things:

1.) People keep saying how x index fund is great (usually S&amp;P 500).  Also that it has had ""an average of 13.6% annually (dividends reinvested)"", which would mean if ""you invested $10,000 into the S&amp;P 500 50 years ago, you'd have $5.78 million in your account today."" [W2](http://www.commonsenseadvice.com/index_fund_investing.html)...  SOUNDS GREAT!  But I haven't seen anyone actually suggest investing in this or even that you could, can you?  I think I understand it's an index, could somebody explain what that really means.

2.) Just to learn more, I'm looking at specific indexes, and I don't understand that ex: VTSMX has a YTD return of 9.29% but a yield of 1.78%.  I read a lot of the return vs yield and I still don't think I really get it.  Return seems to be what matters, return is the profit, if I invest 10 dollars and get 10% interest per year, I'll have a return of 1 dollar or 10% of my investment right?  I don't understand yield.

3.) After hearing the silly tale, where after after 50 years of compounding, you'll be swimming in money.  My skepticism makes me think that can't be the truth, everyone would do that.  So if that is true would it be advisable to invest in a index fund at a young age (like in the example).

Since it's usually asked on these types of subreddits, I'm 17, Canadian, and if I can follow what my sister did,(and mooch), I won't have any dept from university, but I will have money laying around.  There's a chance if I go into a co-op/summer internships, I'll be making money at university.  Would index funds be a good center to my future portfolio.

x8nn0,2,2012-07-27,That dreaded personal statement,littlehamsterz,Veterinary,https://www.reddit.com/r/Veterinary/comments/x8nn0/that_dreaded_personal_statement/,"Hi everybody, I just recently graduated from the University of Pennsylvania and I'm in the process of applying for the class of 2013 (taking a gap year). I was wondering what advice people who have actually gone to veterinary college have for writing the personal statement. I'm having trouble getting started.

My background in terms of experience with animals are the following:

* Full time volunteering/internship at a domestic small animal clinic
* Internship at a Wildlife Rescue (mostly birds, some small mammals)
* Internship at a marine mammal rescue center (current) - dealing mostly with harbor seals
* Volunteering at an emergency clinic

What I would like to write about is the fact that I feel like I have really developed a deep love and respect for animals through these experiences. I feel like when I first got started I had a really fanciful idea of why I wanted to be a vet, which primarily consisted of ""man I love animals so much."" However, in retrospect, I realize that this love was rather cursory, sort of the same way you would love a favorite sweater. It was a nice idea, but not substantive enough to really build an entire career around. I have since learned that love is not enough and it never will be. Instead, I have come to realize that I want to be a vet because I respect the life of these animals and want to do my fullest to help them. If I don't try, then I have failed. If I don't become a vet, I can't try to save them. I know I can't save them all, which is the life of animal rehabilitation, but the least I can do is try. At the same time, I respect these animals enough to say that the suffering must end and to pull out the Euthanol when it's necessary. I have also realized that many vets do not have a lot of knowledge about wildlife, so I think my background makes me unique. One of the vets I know actually told me that they didn't teach her very much about birds in school, so she didn't really know much about their care when they came into the emergency clinic. 

Not sure if ""love and respect"" being the basis of my motivation is too frufru...what do you think?"
x8l2q,5,2012-07-27,I want to be a documentary/conflict/war photographer. Any advice?,OverlordXenu,photography,https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/x8l2q/i_want_to_be_a_documentaryconflictwar/,"I'm in college right now. I recently transfered to Bard, and I'll start there in the fall. I plan to do a joint major between History and International Relations (I feel that I need to try to understand the world to the best of my abilities, and I think having a knowledge of world history [with a focus on the developing world] and international politics will help with that), and also take a few photo classes… maybe do a minor in it. But all Bard really offers is fine art photography, and while I know that will help me grow as a photographer, I don't want to dedicate myself to it.

I don't want to be a newspaper photog covering events and the like. I don't want to shoot needed shots for the occasional article. I want to do in-depth stories on events or people or places that wouldn't otherwise be covered. I know that this type of Magnum or NOOR or VII dream is shooting for the stars, and that only the best-of-the-best photographers (and the hardest working, and the best able to interact with people, and the Aristotlean cowards, etc. etc.) get there. I know it will be a trek. I know I am more than likely to fail.

Right now, my plan is to finish school while working on some journalistic projects in my own time (though I don't know what I'll find around Red Hook… there's always a story worth telling, but it might be hard to find). Maybe try to find an internship (anyone know of any? I've tried for the Overseas Press Club Foundation scholarship/internship, and I'll try for it again, but I'd *love* to know of any others). Then, after school, try to find a mentor or an internship. *Or* start working some bullshit job and saving enough money to finance a trip to cover something… to produce a story. Then shipping said story to papers and magazines and online publications and the like.

In the mean time I carry my camera with me everywhere, keep up with the news, read books on the world and war, look at photos, read more books, look at more photos, wander around inner cities, look at more photos, read more books, try to live…

But if anyone around this subreddit does this—please, tell me anything. Also, I've been wondering… would it actually be a *bad* idea to try to get to where I want to be from a job just covering bullshit events for a local paper or something? Is it really possible to move up like that?

Additional information… I live near NYC, if that matters. And my photos are [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autumnjazz/sets/72157627695582563/), if I'm too shit (and obviously lack the ability to grow) to do this, *please* let me know. I've gotten so, so many conflicting opinions on my photographic ability that I don't know who to listen to.

I really just want to give a voice to the voiceless. Travel to places no one gives a shit about, and try to make people *give a shit*. I desperately and deeply care about humanity, and I want to attempt to spread that passion around. Make people feel, think, and *act* through photos and prose. I've got the passion, I've got the ambition… but I don't know if I have the skill, or if I'll have the opportunity. I sometimes look at the lofty goals I want to achieve and feel defeated. Other times I feel empowered. Most times I just keep marching forward, onward, trying to reach.

Early this summer, I actually had an idea for a story. There's an encampment of homeless people near the train tracks in my town. I live in one of the richest places in the world… and I wanted to try to throw the poverty hiding past a hill into people's faces. So I started talking to the homeless people. And… I got scared. Not because they were homeless. But because so many of them were just, to put it bluntly, not sane. One man told me about the devil and god telling him to do different things. And I thought to myself, ""I can probably deal with bullets. I can deal with mostly-rational people trying to kill one another. But I can't deal with these unpredictable people. I just don't know what they'll think or do."" And then I worried that I'm not cut out for what I want to do. And then I wonder if I can get past it. I didn't grow scared because it could have been dangerous or something like that, but just because I couldn't understand these people with un/barely-treated mental illness. And I didn't know what type of story I could tell. These were mostly people who *couldn't* make it in society, and society forgot them. But people wouldn't care about that. Everyday people, comfortable people, secure people… they can care about the homeless. They can care about the men and women who have tried so desperately to be a part of society, but who society has let down. But the people who will always be outsiders? Those that should probably be an institution, if only for their own safety? How could I make an average person care about that? Maybe this is all just a bullshit excuse though. I'm probably just not ready. Maybe I'll never be ready. But I sure as shit hope I will be. But I don't know how to prepare myself….

Sorry. That got a bit overly personal. But, this is my dream right now. And this dream rules my days, and lords over sleepless nights. And I want to know how possible it is. I want to know how prepared I should be for failure. I want to know if I should just not embark at all, so that I might have more time to find another path.

Maybe I'll just try to get into the Columbia School of Journalism."

For 29 dollars an hour, you’re getting talent that you wouldn’t have dreamed possible before. You’re getting somebody with a mixed personality that can mix drinks, show up at mixed times, mix up your footage on Final Cut Pro, but never get mixed up.

You want a pivot table on Excel?
I’ll make you one.

Want me to open the mail?
Not one paper cut.

You want someone to show you how to make latte art?
I’ll teach you.

You want me to make you a martini?
Dry? Dirty? Shaken? Olive? Vodka? Gin? Peel?
Don’t know what it means?
I’ll TEACH you and your staff how it works.

My god. Who is this guy? Why haven’t I hired him yet?

I am the most kick-ass all rounder. That’s who I am. No point looking elsewhere. You’ve found your guy. Hallelujah. Mazel tov.

I am 23 years old, have a degree in Media and Communications, have a Diploma in Advertising, and have traveled and worked in more countries than your entire employee group combined. Yep. That’s right.

I came back from New York Fucking City 5 months ago after working some mean-ass jobs. I worked in hardcore bars that you wouldn’t dare step into. I waited tables at fancy-pants French restaurants. I worked in the cruel home foreclosure business. I worked long hours in television production.

Shows that you’ve SEEN and that you’ve LOVED.

What do you need help with?

Are you looking for someone to do the dirty work at your company? Need someone to call people up and tell them they were unsuccessful at-interview because you’re too gutless to do it? I’ll do it with grace and elegance. Then I’ll clean your fucking toilets.

Are you surrounded by a bunch of pussy yes-men? Need an honest answer? I think your dress looks like shit, I think James is hungover and puking in the bathroom, I think Rod is a fucking anorexic and needs help, and I think the music you play to encourage your office fucking sucks.

I will tell you where to get a new dress.
I will force water into James and shove a Panadol up his ass, and get him back to his desk.
I will get Rod professional fucking help and make him delicious food.
I will give you music that fucking rules.

Need someone to redo your entire network at the office? I’ve done it before at a radio station. That’s right, I’m a technical guy. Do you know how much they paid me at that shitty radio station? NOTHING. Because they used me as an intern. Want to use me as an intern? Stiff shit. 29 dollars an hour, baby.

Do you need someone creative to BROADCAST on the radio? I’ve done it for 4 years. I’m hilarious. Just check out my year 10 yearbook. Funniest boy in school. Lap it up. Need someone to act in your corporate video? Bam. Right here. I’ll even bring my own release and have it signed for you. Fuck paying a lawyer to make one for you. That’s a waste of money.

Need someone to deal with your annoying customers with a smile?
My smile cost in excess of $10,000 in orthodontic fees. When you see my smile, you will melt. When you use a $10,000 piece of machinery or technology, you expect performance.

You also expect to pay for the expertise and productivity, right?

That’s when 29 dollars an hour comes in.

Isn’t 29 an arbitrary figure?

NO.

I’ve calculated my worth. Trust me here, you’re getting a fucking good deal. Think I’m too expensive? I think you’re too cheap. You get what you pay for. You pay nothing? Expect nothing. Move along. What are you expecting from somebody you’re gonna pay $20 an hour to?

C++-++–+ coding/yellowhat/gayhat experience?
Pyramid construction skills?
Experience as the regional sales manager for the Midwests 8th most popular brand of blue ballpoint pen?
Dungeon gimp experience?
Someone who came 4th in the tri-state-areas IT customer service hoedown?
The ability to write and develop code to enable earth satellites to communicate with interstellar phenomena at any time during geosynchronous orbit?

GET REAL.

NO. I won’t upload my resume. You wanna see peoples bullshit and exaggerations? Go to the next candidate. Wow. They’re studying finance at UTS and have an internship at KPMG. But can they pick shit up quickly? Not as quick as me. Can they get to the city within an hour? Probably not because they don’t have a travelten. They don’t have a go-get subscription. They don’t have their shit together. They spent their rent money on a bag of coke last weekend at some shitty club night. I don’t care about guest lists or celebrities, I care about kicking ass in the workplace.

You can send me an email. I get the emails quick, because I have a smartphone that I check. I’m on top of my shit. Unlike Ms KPMG intern who can’t fix the printer, best get that hole in your septum checked out, junkie. I, on the other hand, can fix the fucking printer. And I got people who will VOUCH for that shit.

x8iua,8,2012-07-27,My Ukrainian Bro is leaving,CyanWolf13,ukraine,https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/x8iua/my_ukrainian_bro_is_leaving/,"Hello everyone, one of my best friends is leaving for an internship next Tuesday which will last for half a year. He moved here from Ukraine about 6 years ago so he is has a bit of a mixture of Ukrainian and American culture. My plan was to make a big dinner for him and have a few of our friends over to celebrate before he leaves. He is a bit reserved so I was wondering is that a Ukrainian thing or is that just his personality? I planned on attempting to give him a hug and to tell him how much he means to me since I will not be seeing him for a very long time. Is this acceptable? Also, what/how do really good friends in Ukraine treat each other? Also, does the surname 'Dakhnovets' mean anything? 

Thank you!"

I gave him my information at the store during the lunch hour, so no one at the program would see the exchange.  I told him that he could do whatever he'd like with the info.... before I gave it to him, I told him that I'd understand if he thought it would be inappropriate or unethical, but he said he'll think about it.  Those words won't stop repeating in my head: I'll think about it.  He didn't say it in a mean way and he seemed a little chipper that I had this conversation with him.  For the rest of the time he's there I'm going to try to play it cool, obviously... but I'm dying to know peoples opinions of how to make this work, or whether it's a good idea or not.  Afterall, he's only an intern.

I started working in TV with an internship early 2007. I've since worked at several stations, in the Northeast and in Texas. 

I've done several different jobs: photojournalist (shoot video for reporters and their stories), production (operate studio cameras/control room), master control (the last line for what winds up on air), produced for web (turned what reporters and anchors say into proper print style and managed Facebook and Twitter) and assignment desk (answer phones, manage field crews, set up stories, and may other things). Wow, reading this list makes me realize that I need to get my life together and focus on something...

Basically, as someone who spent a lot of time in many different roles behind the camera, I've got a pretty good idea of how everything works at a station, both shitty small market and more medium-sized. I have a good idea of what works and what doesn't work for TV news.

I can provide proof to moderators, but don't know how. I'd really like to remain anonymous, so I'm going to be vague regarding what cities/stations I've worked for.

If you're interested in working in local TV and want to know how to get into it, let me save you the trouble of asking. Internships. That's all that anyone cares about.

I'm working as an intern at a company that's male-dominated and full of people under the age of 35. It's a really fun place to work and I'm enjoying myself, but this week it hit me that sometimes it's tough to have privacy when you have a friendly, familiar relationship with your coworkers. 

Tuesday morning I woke up with a pretty wicked UTI, so I decided to email my supervisor and tell him I was having some health troubles, and then get myself to the doctor and take the day off. He responded professionally, I went to my doctor, and by Wednesday morning I was feeling well enough to go to work. 

Wednesday morning, I was bombarded with questions from my team. ""How are you feeling?"" ""Are you better?"" ""What was wrong?"" ""Is the outbreak over?"" I laughed it off and said I was feeling better (of course not about to share the details of my genitals with these guys), and tried to get to work. But the questions kept coming, to the point where I was just blushing and saying ""I'm fine, I'm fine."" It was only when the only other woman on my team snapped at the guys that I might not want to talk about it, that they left me alone. 

I though it was over, but at a one-on-one meeting with my supervisor later that afternoon (it was pre-scheduled, he didn't call it to talk to me about this), he started the meeting off by asking, ""So what was the matter yesterday?"" Frustrated, I said, ""I have some health problems at the moment. I went to see my doctor about it and I'm feeling better, thanks."" He gave me a bit of a surprised look but carried on. 

So 2X, have you ever found yourself in a similar situation? What's the proper etiquette here? I want to be friendly with these people, but I don't want to have the spill the beans about my genital ailments just to maintain this environment. "

-Equity analyst internships at 2 hedge funds with 14 months of combined experience.

We met in class during the spring and became friends.  While we're away on summer, we've been emailing each other multiple times per day.  Although I missed a few chances to date her at the very end of the year, we both confessed to liking each other over email.  She ultimately said that she'd be open to dating, but wouldn't want to mess up our friendship, so, since she is indecisive, it was up to me.  I hinted that I wanted to date her, and I do.  However, she won't be back at school (internship) until spring 2013, and I'll only get to see her for a week before fall semester.

Lately, we've been emailing about religion and morality.  She's a Christian and very conservative.  I've never seen her wear anything revealing, she said she's only been on a few dates in the past, and she's never had sex.  I'm an Atheist and think sex should be kept within a committed relationship.  However, I don't think I would be able to, or want to, wait until marriage to have sex again.  She has recently stated that she won't have sex outside of marriage.

My question is, should I date her, knowing there is a good chance things will not work out in the end because of the lack of a sex life, or should I tell her that we should just remain friends?  I really like her and we get along great, and I'm fairly socially awkward so I can't just wave my hand and find someone else I could see dating.  I haven't been in too many relationships, and I think the experience would also help a lot.  I could wait until marriage if things go swimmingly well, but that also raises the question of, once we're married, what if we're not sexually compatible?  Should I enjoy dating her and not worry about these things until they come up, or avoid it all together?

TL;DR, Should I date a girl I like, knowing I probably can't wait until marriage to have sex, which will probably lead to us breaking up, or should we just stay friends?"

I've received one offer from a Big 4 already, but it is only for $23/hour + OT, which seems low compared to what some of my friends told me they made last year. The offer is in a smaller city (~400k people) whereas a lot of people I've talked to worked in large cities, and I'm sure this makes a difference in the salaries.

It was a blast to build and I have been loving it since may when I built it.  I had my share of dumb moments like the time where I forgot to plug in the cpu power and couldn't figure out why it wasn't turning on and when I forgot to put in the standoffs on the motherboard :p but all in all, it came out pretty well.  

I have done some updating since I built like adding in the 750w psu and the gelid silent fans which really do live up to their claim of silence.  I also started with a shitty mouse and a microsoft ergonomic 4000 keyboard which I hated so I splurged on a mechanical which I love so much that I take it to my internship and back every day :)  

But anyway, it runs bf3 on ultra at 1080p pretty well with an average fps of ~50.  I wish I didn't get an ocz ssd and I wish I got a larger one because I have been strapped for space on it.  The boot times are very sub par for a ssd clocking in at 42 seconds when I check the event log :(  It gets from power button to the password screen in 28 though which is better but still nowhere near great.  but here's the specs and special thanks to a redditor by the username of ComancheCorps who provided me quite a few things free of charge despite never even meeting me in his life.

xbhic,1,2012-07-28,So i really like my coworker...,[deleted],seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/xbhic/so_i_really_like_my_coworker/,"I'm 19. She's 22. Were both interns. I like her alot. Wayyyyy more than the average crush like it is not normal how much I like her. I've never felt this way before about someone. I can't stop thinking about her. I try to but I can't. It's impossible. Fuck.

She likes me as a freind but I'm not sure if she'd want to date me. We do talk alot and she always smiles when she sees me. She laughs at my jokes even though they suck. She always seems to be interested in what I talk about. She does like talking to me . Idk if she would want to date me though. There's the fact that shes 22 and im 19. I'm not sure if she would be willing to date that younger. And at the end of August we both go back to college where we would be 1-2 hours away. I'd definitely be up for the distance but idk if she would be.
Another thing that is giving me doubt that she would want to date me is that usually when we talk its me starting the conversations like I go to her desk and talk to her. She never comes to where I work and talks to me. That could be partially due to the fact that I am usually all over the building and never usually stay in one area for more than an hour. She did say to me a few times to fell free to stop by her since she is stuck in a project where she works alone.

So what do you think reddit? Do you think she is interested? How would I go about asking her out or even just hanging out after work? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

It all started during the past semester when my friends group started to dwindle, for whatever reason. Some got boyfriends, others found new friends, it doesn't really matter what the reasons are, I suppose. I found myself hanging out with my boyfriend really often, because I just didn't have anything better to do. 

For the past few months I thought I felt better. Some of my friends had more time because of the summer, I was less stressed out because there was no school, etc. But now I feel like I'm back to square one. I feel like I'm so needy of my boyfriend, which is a quality I prided myself on never having. I used to be so independent. I miss being that way. There are just so many things wrong, I'll just try to list them, because if not I'll just wind up rambling.

-I have no desire to do anything. Even things I enjoy I have no motivation to do. 
-I get angry at my boyfriend a lot over really dumb things, and I'm worried I'm pushing him away. I love him, and I don't want him to break up with me over something I know I can control because I'm conscious of it happening. We spend a lot of time together, and right now I'm thankful for that. But I know that he needs to be with his friends and so things without me, but I get upset when I can tell he doesn't want me to come along. I know this is bad, and I really don't want to be like that. He's really, really hard to talk to sometimes, so it's hard for me to explain this to him. 
-I get really, really anxious if I don't talk to someone throughout the day. If i have a day off of work, chances are I have nothing to do. And when that happens I have really bad anxiety the longer that I sit and do nothing. The problem then is that I have no motivation to do anything, even by myself. 
-When I think about my future, I just want to vomit. I'm majoring in something that's almost impossible to break into. I haven't even had an internship, even though I tried incredibly hard to get one, and I'm about to graduate. 

There are just so many other things. I guess the main problem is that I feel like I've lost my independence. I haven't been happy in a while. I used to think that if I felt depressed, I could just let it slide, but I know now it doesn't work that way. 

If anyone has any advice on how to feel better, I'd be more than happy to listen. Thanks. "

I'm a Torontonian (who has spent many months in your wonderful city) and am thinking about moving to Calgary.  The reason is that my girlfriend works in the energy industry and we figure it would be a lot easier for me to make the move to Calgary than for her to look for work in Toronto...


A little about me.... I currently work in the capital markets division of a large bank.  I graduated this year with a degree in MIS/Finance.  I have internship experience as a developer at IBM and at another large bank.  I know a fair bit about Finance (mostly interest rate derivatives), am an expert in Excel/VBA.  I am a decent programmer (PHP/PERL/C#) and fairly good at SQL and PL/SQL.


I've posted my resume and indicated I'm looking for work in Calgary but I never get recruiters calling me... only Toronto-based ones.  I've contacted a few headhunters and they said that if I wanted to work in Calgary I should move... the thing is I have a pretty good job in Toronto and don't want to just take the plunge and move.  


Please feel free to share any advice you may have! :)"
xbgar,1,2012-07-28,"Pros, I need insight on the various workplaces of the design field.",[deleted],Design,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/xbgar/pros_i_need_insight_on_the_various_workplaces_of/,"I am a design student entering my second year, and have been fortunate enough to have a great chance at a few different internships next year.  If everything goes as planned, I will pursue all of them over the course of my education (that is if nothing better pops up).  Nothing is final at all yet, which is why I come to you with these questions.

Anyways, I am not going to assume the best and need your help in deciding which one of these I should pursue.  The thing is, one of these internships is with a major **corporations** design team, which I actually was lucky enough to be able to shadow for a bit and get a better idea of how they work.  

The environment includes cubicles, but is far from the cliche in that they are extremely low cut and the team is constantly engaging as a team as the area is easy to navigate freely.  This design team works only within the corporation or their clients, but the corporation definitely takes care of you financially.  Everyone on the design team works a set schedule, allowing time for things like side-projects and having a family.

The second is a major **advertising firm**, the largest in the state.  I am unfamiliar with the working environment and was hoping some of you guys working within the field at a similar advertising agency could give me some insight on the average creative environment of these places.  Are they studio-like, similar to something like IDEO, or are they more open-cubicle like?  Do designers within this area generally have a set schedule, consistent and reliable pay, good benefits?

The third opportunity I have is at a major **video game agency** in the area with multiple blockbuster games on the market.  Again, no idea how a place like this would operate.  Anybody have any insight on the working environment of a place like this?  

Any help at all would be appreciated, if you design within a company similar to any of these I would love to hear about it.  I really just want to get a better feel for what I personally would enjoy more.  Is your area always organized and clean, or does it resemble a classic college studio space?  Are you happy with the pay, hours, benefits, etc?  How much room do you have for growth as a designer, and for your career?  I have a lot of time until then, but I really want to get a better grasp on these environments and gain a better idea of what would suit me the best.

**tl;dr do you design in a corporate environment, advertising agency, video game company, or anything similar?  If so, let me know what you think about it and why.**"

I have been away from my family (who lives about 7 hours away) for 8 weeks. This is nothing new. I'm a college student, so I'm used to being away from my family for extended periods of time. But around the second week of my internship, I got a call from my parents saying that my younger brother had a seizure just after he got back from running, and after a trip to the hospital, was put on epilepsy medication. He then had several panic attacks (apparently emotional instability was a side effect), so my parents took him back to the hospital, which, by the way, is by no means an amazing medical institution. A week goes by without any news, and I start stressing out. Fast forward to today. My brother ended up in the hands of a neurologist at a different hospital because he kept having small episodes where he would get dizzy and collapse (on a daily basis). He is still having them today, and the doctors, after nearly 6 weeks, have not figured anything out. One guys says it's stress, another said it had to do with his heart (his heart rate had 20-point differences from when he was standing up, sitting down, and laying down), but they haven't done a thing to help him. I am sure my brother is stressed out over all of this, and so am I. I want to be there for him, to at least keep him company since he doesn't have the energy to do anything other than play on his xbox and sleep. I am losing my mind worrying about him, and I don't know what to do to make things easier for him while my family waits for the doctors to make a decision.

I want to hear some of your stories, Reddit. How did you handle a situation like this while far away, or what did a family member who was far away do to make you feel better during a crisis (not necessarily a medical one)? What did you do so you didn't go crazy from worry?"

I'm 22 now. When I was 2, my parents, both middle school teachers, met with a personal financial agent. Thanks to his help, I graduated from Trinity debt-free, and we paid off our house and cars. He never charged us for seeing him (still doesn't), and when I couldn't find work with my finance degree (still can't), I asked to intern with him. My degree turned out to be different from what he did, but that was okay, cause the company paid for me to get licensed, even providing the study materials. So I took the red pill, learned how money really works and how the finance industry really operates, and-- well, when you look at your paycheck and your bills, I don't think I have to tell you how it's affected all of us.

So I passed both my investment exams last weekend. Which is HUGE, only half of 1% of the entire U.S. population holds a Series 6 license. But having it doesn't mean I'm good at using it; that comes with experience. Now here's the deal: you want to retire someday. You want to send your kids to college. You want money you can quickly access for emergencies. You want to get out of serious debt. You want to lower your car insurance payments. You want your stuff to go to the right people when you're gone. You want to protect your income. And me? I want to become great-- not good, great-- at being the guy to see about that, because I don't charge you for seeing me. I can make a financial gameplan for each and every one of you, show you what I know, set you up with a minimum $50/month IRA (and more), and you'll never write a check with my name on it. If you feel it's too early to think about retirement, I tell you the time is now for EVERYONE, including my generation, and if you think a CD at the bank's enough, or you don't believe the money's even there, I can beat it, and I can find it, for free.

Now, as you can imagine, I'm very wet behind the ears in this matter. So the first group of people who come see me will be sitting down with  me and my mentor, a force of nature who's done this kind of thing for 18,000 clients over the past 27 years, until I learn how to determine what's right for which person on my own. That seems pretty fair, don't you think? So I come to you guys because I want as many people as possible to know I'm looking to save as many as I can. I ask for your help, and a little faith, and appreciate any you can offer."

I'm in debt from school, and I do not own a car, so moving somewhere else is out of the question for the next six months to a year. My first step is to start saving money to obtain some certifications.

I'm eager to work, and I love networking. Before I didn't like it a lot, but now it's something I really, really enjoy. I feel like a ""jack of all trades, master of none"" kind of person. 

I guess I can just ask my questions now. 

* Should I be worried about losing potential work experience? I graduated this summer. 
* Should my main focus be to obtain certifications right now?
* Is there a site to practice or do small networking/IT projects? I want to keep my skills up and learn new things, I'd love to use a site that had weekly projects. Sort of like what you'd expect from a classroom. I'd probably need to learn linux the most.
* Is there work I can do remotely? Obviously I wouldn't expect a full time job working from home in IT, but are there places that require small projects that could be done remotely? 
* Anything I should know or do in the meantime?

I'm now wishing to try other lines of work (something that might actually pay something...) and am going to apply for some openings at an organic food and farming advocacy non-profit in my area. I need to figure out how to translate my experience as a farmer into skills that would be attractive in a farming related non-profit setting. The jobs are mostly ""member recruitment and management,"" development and educational program oversight, all related to farming but pretty office-y.

So here's the story: The farm I work at is part of a non-profit organization but I've basically been working for myself without a direct boss since I'm the head of my department.  Since I took over, the farm has increased sales from a few thousand dollars a year to about $50,000/year. I managed our farmers market and I started a 100 member CSA, marketed the shares via public speaking events, social media, a website that I put together and other networking methods, managed the members and responded to member's concerns. I used spreadsheet and database programs to create planting schedules, budgets, equipment and seed orders and membership records. I also started a farm internship program, recruited hundreds of applicants via word of mouth, web and social media presence and conducted interviews prior to each growing season to create a team which I then managed 6 days a week to do work related to every aspect of farming. Many of my interns have either stayed on as permanent staff of our non-profit or have left and then returned to work here again so I guess I am a pretty good manager and create a fun, very hardworking team-based environment. I've completed farm food safety training as well as non-violent communication training, have experience working in a consensus based environment. I went to college for International Relations (Sustainable Development focus) and have had other odd jobs - barista, early learning tutor for ESL students, administrative assistant and database manager for the same non-profit that I work at now, managing and updating an Access database with about 20,000 entries with history for most of them dating bag 20 or so years.

A 32/128 bit addressing junkie?  Master of all things with lots of blinky lights?  You'll need a couple of things to start this journey:

* Genuine interest in technology and computing (its not about the money)
* Committing yourself to **never stop learning**
* A realization that it is a long, stressful road to becoming a network engineer
* Patience, you're going to be working with and supporting a lot of people of varying skills and social levels

So you've got those, let's get started!

1.  **Go to College:** Some people skip this step, but it's honestly the only sure fire way to get a job in networking.  You need the credentials a degree provides in today's world to get your foot in the door.  Look at getting a two or four year degree, with an internship at some point. 

2.  **Get a Helpdesk Job:** Everyone starts in Helpdesk. This is where you gain a lot of confidence, patience, experience, and most importantly: your first battle scars.  You need to find out the hard way that you don't know everything by causing a massive fuck up.  It humbles you and makes you more conscious of what you're doing and how it can impact things.  While you're working help desk, try to help out your superiors in any way possible.  Also, you should be working on getting at least your Network+ and CCNA.  Why Net+?  It's a really well rounded certification that covers a lot of ideas that are very vendor neutral.

At this point you have two options.  Stick around at your current company or jump ship.  I would say jump ship, as most help desk people will work at that job forever without a lot of advancement.  Either way, you want to move up to a:

3.  **Junior Administrator:** Why an administrator?  You want to be in networking?  You need server experience.  The more knowledgeable about servers you are, the more of an asset you are to your team.  Hopefully you picked up a lot of stuff on servers from your help desk position, but if not its probably a good idea to work on getting a Microsoft cert of some kind. You should also be collecting used Cisco equipment for your home lab.  You're going to need it for your CCNP, and companies will typically give old stuff away. 

4.  **Junior Network Engineer:** This title has many names, but it typically means entry-level network job.  This could be at the same company as your last job.  This job will give you a lot of networking related bitch work to do, but that's what you need.  Between looking over configs and working in your home lab, you should have enough experience/knowledge to get your CCNP.  The company should be able to pay for it too.  

Once you have your CCNP, it's descision time.  You can stay in the corporate IT world or move into consulting.  Consulting will pay better and fast track you into network engineer/architect role quite quickly at the cost of a social life and an enormous amount of stress.  Its also somewhat harder to get back into corporate IT from a consulting role.  Regardless, your next job should be a full blown network engineer.   

One thing you'll eventually need to think about is what specialty you'll bring into the table/focus on.  I think Cisco breaks it down the best:

* Routing and Switching
* Voice/Unified Communications
* Security
* Wireless
* Storage and data center

Having a specialty makes you more important and gives you an ace in the hole for jumping jobs.

I hope you found this guide useful. "

I was an intern at Valve a little while ago. It's the best place to work even if I didn't get paid. I've followed my dad's footsteps in the gaming industry and he eventually got my foot in the door.

I was fresh out of college and still green to the world. This would eventually get me in trouble at Valve. So college was a blast and pretty easy for me since I've been studying game design and have been an active gamer for pretty much my whole life. 

So I happened to be on /r/gaming when I get a beep that says I got a new e-mail. I got called in for a 1 on 1 with my boss. Ugh..

I guess I was in trouble for browsing the internet too much (we're allowed to take intermittent breaks during the day so we can ""freshen up our minds"") So I hesitantly walk over to the office and knock on the door. Lo and behold Gabe is sitting in the chair. Now I see him every once and a while around the building but it's only a little hi and bye so this was scary and exciting.

He sits me down and the first thing he says to me as he turns the monitor around, ""So is this what the internet thinks of me?""

Apparently they saw some Gabe meme from monitoring my net usage. My voice cracked and I whispered, ""um, I guess..""

Gabe bursts out laughing so hard and I let out biggest sigh of relief. Well then he told me to keep on the project we were working on and try not to ""take breaks"" as often.

So now every once and a while I get an email from him with some meme about him and it kind of became our inside joke. I'm pretty sure he's a Redditor now since he would always send me stuff that I just saw earlier that day.  And I thought I only had to deal with this on FB.

By the way, Gabe gets the 3 jokes. 3/3/13"

[Original Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/MyLittleSupportGroup/comments/who5j/probably_not_that_important_compared_to_other/)

Well, now it's almost a month of not really being able to sleep at all.  Nothing much changed with my internship in the last two weeks...aside from Thursday, when suddenly my boss (once again, at her house) decided to teach me something about an aspect of the business I had been interested in.  On top of that, she told me that she may well have a client next week and she wants me to meet with them and mentioned that she needs to pay me for what I've done so far.  This is the first time she's mentioned pay since the interview before getting this position that she's mentioned pay without my asking about it, so (call me naive) I'm hopeful I might get something.  About time, too, because my savings are getting into that stage where even filling up my car to go to her house looks like an unaffordable luxury.  Call me suspicious, though; I can understand the client having their own schedule, but taking 2 months to teach me about something fundamental to the industry and suddenly all of this happening on one day?  The Career Center at my university swears they didn't talk to her yet, but I'm not so sure...

Unfortunately, that's the good news.  It seems my depression has come back in full force.   I've found I have all but withdrawn from my group of friends that I've met this summer because I just can't bring myself to go do anything outside my apartment.  There's a girl I've met and become friends with just because she lives on the floor below us, and whenever I go try to hang out with her (and my roommate who have been inseparable since she found a kitten), there almost always seem to be 10-15 people crammed into her apartment who all know each other and I feel excluded; I've never been much of an extrovert, but the group feels so intimidating that I more often than not stay for a few minutes then slip back upstairs to do my own thing.  As a result, I get left out of most things they end up doing.  This isn't me; I want to be involved or active and doing things regularly, but I just don't feel like doing anything or trying to branch out and try to talk to them.  So, I increasingly just get left to my thoughts in the evenings, making my worries from before even more intense than they would have been.  I've caught myself on more than one occasion wishing for a way out - *any* way out.

At least I can keep my mind off my thoughts and dark issues to some degree with a first (sort of) client for my business.  They won't be paying me much if anything at all, but it will help with getting a portfolio started to bring in more clients down the road, and because of timezones and all of our individual commitments, the times we can collaborate on the project the easiest are in the evening.  There's so much to do that I can get lost in the work – oddly enough, that is when I am most at peace with myself; when all I can focus on is the task in front of me, I can momentarily lose sight of everything that is otherwise weighing me down.  And yet, I still worry about those subsequent clients; I have found that I am in over my head in terms of talking to potential clients and selling them on my services in person. I have everything spelled out well on my website, but I just have no confidence in myself to be able to translate that to a conversation rather than just give them the link.  I can talk about the industry all day if I had to, it's just getting to where I can talk to someone not as a sales proposition, but as sharing my knowledge, that I am terrified of.

Last but not least, my roommate and said friend from downstairs say that they want to wake me up early tomorrow morning – by dropping her 5 week old kitten on my face.  It may sound cute, but I'm not a morning person, especially when I haven't really slept for a month.  I already (rather forcefully) told them **no**, but they seem to think it's all a joke.  Never mind my own whole issue of not sleeping, I'm terrified I might reflexively and completely unintentionally hurt said kitten in the seconds of being woken up by a cat clawing at my face.  Sadly, my room doesn't have a lock, so I just have to rely on either staying up all night, or barricading my room and praying I wake up before they do for once, which means in 5 hours, or 6am.  On a Saturday when I might have actually slept for a while longer (assuming I can even fall asleep to begin with).

I'm just so messed up now that I can't even really think of anything to ask aside from this: how can I deal with my friends both in the matter of the kitten and feeling excluded from everything?  Also, how can I get back my confidence and feel like there's even something worth breaking out of whatever I'm stuck in?"
xad6r,3,2012-07-28,I'm overly jealous and it's causing issues,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/xad6r/im_overly_jealous_and_its_causing_issues/,"Hi /r/relationships,

just like the title said, I tend to be overly jealous in relationships. Some background information: my boyfriend and I are both almost 19, I've been in this relationship for over a year, and I love him very much. During the school year we're long distance (2000 miles) with the occasional visit here and there.

I've always been pretty jealous of other girls and insecure about myself, even though he's given me no reason to suspect anything. He's always been very committed to me and never flirts with other girls.

This summer he has a female coworker who seems nice, but is very pretty and no matter how hard I try I just can't not dislike her, because she gets to spend a lot of time with him (8 hours a day) when my time with him is very limited to begin with. 

Today, that coworker got my boyfriend an interview for a pretty great internship with her mom taking place next summer, and I can't help but feel threatened. I know this is illogical, but I couldn't help but be a little upset over this news today. Obviously my boyfriend wasn't thrilled that I wasn't 100% overjoyed for him. Help?? :("
xac7d,5,2012-07-28,So I really like my coworker,[deleted],dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/xac7d/so_i_really_like_my_coworker/,"I'm 19. She's 22. Were both interns. I like her alot. Wayyyyy more than the average crush like it is not normal how much I like her. I've never felt this way before about someone. I can't stop thinking about her. I try to but I can't. It's impossible. Fuck.

She likes me as a freind but I'm not sure if she'd want to date me. We do talk alot and she always smiles when she sees me. She laughs at my jokes even though they suck. She always seems to be interested in what I talk about. She does like talking to me
.
Idk if she would want to date me though. There's the fact that shes 22 and im 19. I'm not sure if she would be willing to date that younger. And at the end of August we both go back to college where we would be 1-2 hours away. I'd definitely be up for the distance but idk if she would be. 

Another thing that is giving me doubt that she would want to date me is that usually when we talk its me starting the conversations like I go to her desk and talk to her. She never comes to where I work and talks to me. That could be partially due to the fact that I am usually all over the building and never usually stay in one area for more than an hour. She did say to me a few times to fell free to stop by her since she is stuck in a project where she works alone.

So what do you think reddit? Do you think she is interested? How would I go about asking her out or even just hanging out after work? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

TL;DR How do I go about asking out my coworker?"

i'm so completely sick of not having anyone to hang out with. i'm really hoping to meet some local people who are chill. specifically, i want to meet a guy! hahaha. it's hard because lately i've been working/busy a lot and meeting new people makes me really anxious.

i love art - i do ink, &amp;watercolors - &amp; fountain pens are my newest interest along with calligraphy. i write poetry  &amp; music, but i don't play any instruments because i'm challenged. but i love to sing, when i'm alone usually, but lately i've been getting less shy about that.

 animals are my passion, i really do love them and they give my life meaning. i have a dog &amp; a cat &amp; a snake! pretty rad. right now i'm doing my first level internship at a vet clinic and dream of becoming a veterinarian someday.

video games are cool, lately i've been indie game hounding for whatever reason. i really love roguelikes/procedurally generated ideas. but honestly i'm up for anything. i haven't played a lot of the more reddit-popular games though which sucks (sort of embarrassing to admit it. i wont even mention what ones i havent/have played. but hey, just consider it an opportunity to play games with me!)

i read and like to watch movies too - I REALLY WANT TO GO SEE BRAVE but i have nobody to go with! haha. i pretty much refuse to go by myself &amp; i've already exhausted the ""bring your 8 year old neighbor!"" idea. :|

anywho,  don't be shy, really, i'm super easy to talk to - i promise! (i sort of like the shy guy thing... haha. but it's sort of a catch 22 in the dating department) Soooo hit me up? (:  - you're allowed to AMAA , too ;) haha. encouraged, actually. a little bored tonight. "
xa94m,2,2012-07-28,I get jobs easily and have for some time. SO just graduated college and is having trouble finding a job... I don't know what to do. ,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/xa94m/i_get_jobs_easily_and_have_for_some_time_so_just/,"I'm 22, and he's 21. I am graduating college a semester late, but he just graduated in May. I realize this sounds like it's bragging, but basically I get jobs (and good jobs) easily. I recently got a great part time job that has a very strong potential for full time once I graduate. Today when we went to my old second summer job just to play some games, my old boss (who also works as a very high up at a massive electronics company) offered to help get me an internship at said company which would basically land me any job in the industry afterwards. He also told me about his new company he was starting and offered me a job with that as well... all in front of my boyfriend, who is currently struggling getting a job.

I have tried my hardest to help him and he has a promising job opportunity through a guy I somewhat know, and I even asked my old boss if he could endorse him for an internship as well, but I can tell this is taking a strain on our relationship. I don't feel like I can talk to him about my job or any opportunities like this whether it's positive or negative. He never says anything but the dynamic just entirely changes when I bring up my job.

I have attempted talking to him about it with not much prevail, and it's hard to bring up because I don't want to make it seem like I'm disappointed in him for not having a job yet (I'm definitely NOT disappointed at all... I know he doesn't have a lot of experience, but he's incredibly smart with a math major and I know he will get one... it's just taking longer than he wants). His best friends all got jobs straight out of college as they were all engineering majors, so that causes some strain as well.

I have been encouraging him and trying my hardest to make sure he doesn't feel like he's disappointing me.

We have been dating for over a year and a half.

So... any advice on what I can do or say to help take down the strain?

**TLDR: I keep getting job offers, even out of the blue, boyfriend is struggling finding a job and it's causing a strain on our relationship. I'm not disappointed by him at all, if anything I'm very proud of him, but I'm having a hard time conveying so... or convincing him of it.**"
xa86g,1,2012-07-27,Hey guys! My birthday was awesome!,rafsou,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/xa86g/hey_guys_my_birthday_was_awesome/,"So today was my 18th birthday, and it was really awesome. But alas sometimes the more awesome the tale's end, the less awesome the beginning is.


So today I woke up at around 6:30AM for my job after mini-partying 'till 3:00AM. I had been planning to get sleep, because I needed to be in work for a lot of hours today, but when 12:00AM rolled around last night I was like screw it I know I have work but whatever I'm gunna smoke and screw around for a while. So I did! xD It was fun as hell and I winded up watching like six youtube videos on photo editing in GIMP. Learned a lot!


Anyway so then the morning came, about three hours later. Ouch. I was still slightly buzzed and completely exhausted and entirely not in the mood for a day of work preceded by walking through really hot weather in work clothes that I look bad in. xD Only my Junior year days of getting consistently like 10 hours per school-week of sleep kept me semi-conscious. Sounds annoying right? ...it gets worse.


You see, it's the holy month of Ramadan xD


I am not Muslim, I'll get that straight right now. I'm deist, if anyone cares. My dad is Muslim though, and two Muslim habits I've picked up are: don't eat pork (I know it's good but I honestly am not a really big fan of meat or anything... like steak, ribs, bacon. I can live without em.) and fast for Ramadan.


So here I am, burned out from last night, sweating from heat in uncomfortable formal work clothes, and absolutely starving, and I can't even drink a cup of coffee to help me wake up. My stomach was not only hurting from hunger but also was just unsettled. I had acid reflux all day for some reason. I probably just needed a nice glass of forbidden water to settle it down.


Work wasn't *that* bad. It was a really chill day. I had two long meetings that wasted a lot of time (one even taught me all about Active directory server architecture!), chilled for an hour on my lunch break with all the other interns making jokes about how I couldn't have any pizza, and checked my facebook for constant ""Happy birthday!"" updates which were nice. xD I also cleaned out my entire old email inbox of over 5,000 spam messages! 


I decided to leave work a bit early (planned to stay 'till 6:00PM) and left at 4:30. Fell asleep on train after train trying to read my book, and it took way longer to get home than normal. When I finally got home my mom and brother and our friends named Jin and Thomas were like happy birthday! And then I smoked some bud with Thomas and my brother =) 


Around this time it's probably 6:00 I'm pretty happy and maybe a [7] when my brother says something along the lines of ""We're going somewhere."" And I'm like ""Where?"" and he's like ""It's a secret."" And I was like .......""YAAAAAAAY SECRET PRESENTS!""


...however, a bit later, my mom and brother said that ""the plan had failed."" They wanted to drive me to my dealer and buy me a quarter but he texted something like he couldn't sell today or whatever, so we wound up not going. We chilled and listened to the Strokes for about an hour and at like 7:00 we left to eat dinner.


So we're driving and suddenly I know where we are! It's this cool ass Thai food place called Tuk Tuk. I finally break my fast with calamari and sweet chili sauce which was delicious. Then I get pineapple (haha) friend rice and its awesome and everything is right with the world.


THEN we went outside and go to this park that's right by the restaurant and look at a view of Manhattan. I've seen a lot of views of Manhattan in my life in NYC, but I'd never seen that exact view until tonight. It was awesome. It was pretty breezy, and we were right under these huuuuge canopy-forming weeping willows that dangled down and swayed with the wind. We were sitting in benches that were really reclined and the backs of the benches were really tall so you can lay all the way back and stretch out and look from the bright buildings of the city to the stars between the hanging vines of the weeping willow trees. 


Then we dropped off Jin and Thomas, and drove back home!


The end! xD Sorry if parts of this are written weirdly, I'm at about [7] right now."

I recently found your subreddit, and I hoped to get a little advice on what I should do with my current money situation. Here are the details:

I am an 18 year old in college. I am lucky enough to have my parents pay for almost all of my college, but I do take about 6-7 thousand per year in loans. 

I have 2k in a Roth IRA account with Fidelity, which I was able to fund when I worked at an internship this summer. I put that money into one of the Fidelity ""changing allocation fund"", where you say what year you want to retire (2040) and it changes (currently aggressive growth with almost all in equities) from aggressive to conservative as you get closer to the year of retirement. 

I then have 500 dollars in a checking account, and about 14.5K in a savings account, both with Ally Bank. I am earning almost nothing on the checking account, and about .8% with the savings account. 

My question is basically what should I do with the money that I don't have tied up in the Roth account. I would like to earn more than the measly .8% on the savings account, but I don't know what I should do with it. 

Thank you very much!"

I'm currently in college, and have been at this summer internship for about 5 weeks now at a major corporation (not bragging, just adding context). She's out of college, has been interning there for about 5 months, but last week she was hired as a full time employee. Up until 2 days ago, she sat in the cubicle next to mine. Now she's at the other side of the office. Also, we don't work together or with the same people, so it's not like i'd be forced to see her regularly if things didn't work out.
 
So here's my question. As an intern, is it acceptable for me to ask her out given the conditions? Does the advice vary depending on the company? We work in a pretty relaxed atmosphere where friendships are highly encouraged, but I'm only an intern and she's a new employee... I don't want to seem immature by not recognizing the severity of the situation and asking her out anyway. She's an extremely nice person and would never blow this up, but I also don't want to take advantage of that and put her in an awkward position either. Then again, if you never ask, how can you know she won't say yes? I'm torn, please help.
 
And yeah, I realize I probably missed my shot by not asking her out before they hired her full time, no need to rub it in.
 
**TLDR: Intern wants to ask out (a very recently) former intern who in now an employee... good idea or bad?**"

I'm 29 years old.

I'm twenty or thirty pounds overweight.

I got an Associate's degree in Computer Science from an accredited technical college back in November.

I had to quit my (night) job in October in order to complete my mandatory (unpaid) internship.

Since then, the only job I've had was a two-month temporary position working at an IT help desk. That helped me get caught up on my bills, but money slips away pretty quickly.

In June, right after my birthday, my girlfriend of 3+ years left me.

I live in a trailer with with Dad and my sister.

I believe that I suffer from depression. I'm pretty sure it's why I let my girlfriend leave. She would probably even get back together with me now, but... I can't do it.

I've alienated most of my friends by working nights and then working nights while going to school. They've all moved on in the last few years, while I haven't, really.

I'm not even really sure what advice I'm looking for, Reddit. I'm trying to get a job and I'm working on losing weight(lost 20 pounds since June!), but I just can't muster up the motivation to actually TRY. I put forth a half-assed effort at pretty much everything I do, because nothing seems worth the effort.

For example, getting into shape is fine and all, but I'm not really doing it for myself. I'm doing it to impress whichever shallow girl I meet next.

Working is fine, too, but I'm not doing it for myself. No job I've ever held has ever paid enough to justify all of the work I've had to do.

In college, I graduated with a 3.95 GPA, I had Perfect Attendance and made Dean's List throughout my entire academic career, but... so what? I'm still unemployed nine months later! It seems like all of my hard work was wasted.

I guess what I really want is advice about what to do differently, Reddit. I'm just really, really unhappy with my life.

(note: And don't worry, I'd never commit suicide, I know better than *that*.)"

He then even FURTHER went on to state he would ""decline every job that paid him less than 100k"" after graduation.

- K has stated he will become a millionaire by the age of 30 by simply ""putting more money into the stock market.""  He went on further to state that his method of choosing stock to buy was ""by complete random decision.""

He is not trolling, and we know for sure he is serious, because he has stated these facts to our boss, as well as many other full-time employees.

Through my Studio Art minor an internship is being offered. The application instructions are to write a very brief proposal for a curriculum that focuses on integrating art and any core subject taught in K-12 public schools. 

I have some experiences teaching, but they have all been very specific and different environments and material. So I figured I would start with a medium and subject that I am most comfortable with. 

I like to paint and draw with pastels. I also like science a lot. Lastly, I really don't have a preference on grade level. (I have worked with at least one student from every level.)

What I am asking you:

1. The one tip you wish some one had given you before you started teaching.  

2. Curriculum pointers

Most importantly..

3. Activities that integrate art and science. (To narrow it down, maybe an activity teaching color in terms of expression and physics).

*Because there is such a huge range in ages the activities can also range in depth and complication.

I have 3 days to find a roommate. The landlord is okay with the new person being on the lease. No smoking, no pets, no loud parties please. Moving on...

Anyway, the place. It's pretty small, the living room and the 2 bedrooms are carpeted (new carpets). As mentioned, it's $550/month, so $275 from each of us plus gas and electric. The kitchen is pretty sizeable (new stove, huge fridge) and the living room is...average? medium size? Enough for a sofa and coffee table. I don't have either, but you are more than welcome to bring furniture if you wish. My desk is there, by the way, because the bedroom that I have can only hold my bed and not much else. But don't worry, it's a small desk, not taking up much space. I have a bookshelf as well, also small, also in the living room. Your bedroom would actually be the nicer one: it's somewhat larger and has a nice huge window pointing to the street, so lots of light, and the closet is slightly bigger. (My window points to the other building/rusty fire escape and pigeons love to shit all over it, so you are really getting the better end of the deal here). There is no central air so please bring an AC unit, else it gets quite unbearable in this weather.

About me..I am a 21 year old female college student. I am working at an internship til the end of August in Itasca so I don't usually get home til 6:30-10PM. Otherwise, when the semester starts in late August, I will go back to my old job on campus where I do IT work. I will most likely spend most days (and some nights) studying either at home or the library. So...no parties please. But nothing wrong with having small get togethers or movie nights. Just nothing loud and crazy. No smoking and drugs in the house please. I don't care what you do with your friends, just don't bring it inside :) Oh, and also: NO PETS!

I'm somewhat reserved but I warm up pretty quickly and get along with most people. The only things I won't tolerate is people touching my stuff and people being flaky with bills/rent.

I like to cook, dance, read, go out to do random things when I have the time, beach, whatever. We can be friends or just friendly/polite, it's up to you.

So if you're interested in this apartment, please send a message! :) Everyone that has seen it absolutely loved it, by the way. It's no-frills but clean and airy. I would GREATLY prefer to live with someone around my own age, that's probably my only other request. I will get back to you hopefully tonight or tomorrow for sure. Again...I need this settled by Aug 1st. July 31st works too.

Thank you. "

Past Summers I'd waste my time playing Xbox and working minimum wage jobs. This summer I got motivated to get an internship. On top of that I created a schedule that was going to allow me to advance in life. 

When I get off work around 5pm, I go to the gym for an hour and a half, then make myself dinner and eat it for a half hour. Then at 7:30 I go to the local coffee shop and learn web development or read until about eleven, then go to sleep. I feel much more productive and like I'm continually moving forward in life. I'm not depressed anymore, and I'm noticing everything in my life is starting to change for the better. I'm actually making more friends now that I'm a more passionate person. I'm starting to enjoy the little things more, I have a reason to get out of bed every morning. 

To any others on Summer break I highly recommend starting a project of your own, like learning a programming language or foreign language. Also create a schedule and stick to it, once it becomes habit everything becomes a lot easier. At first, going to the gym was gut-wrenching after about the 5th time it was routine, after the 10-11th time it became essential and I started enjoying it.

I like her alot. Wayyyyy more than the average crush like it is not normal how much I like her. I've never felt this way before about someone. I can't stop thinking about her. I try to but I can't. It's impossible.

She likes me as a freind but I'm not sure if she'd want to date me. We do talk alot and she always smiles when she sees me. She laughs at my jokes even though they suck. She always seems to be interested in what I talk about. Idk if she would want to date me though. There's the fact that shes 22 and im 19. I'm not sure if she would be willing to date that younger. And at the end of August we both go back to college where we would be 1-2 hours away. I'd definitely be up for the distance but idk if she would be.

Another thing that is giving me doubt that she would want to date me is that usually when we talk its me starting the conversations like I go to her desk and talk to her. She never comes to where I work and talks to me. That could be partially due to the fact that I am usually all over the building and never usually stay in one area for more than an hour. She did say to me a few times to fell free to stop by and visit her since she is stuck in a project where she works alone most of the time.

So what do you think? Do you think she is interested? How would I go about asking her out or even just hanging out after work? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"

I'm a 23 year old college graduate. I've got a steady part-time job that pays me just barely enough to cover all my bills. I use my days off at an unpaid internship at the company of my dreams - I won't say where for privacy reasons, but in my field they are a very big name and I'm doing real work in the internship so I'm hoping this will let me break into the industry after my internship concludes in October. It's not an ideal situation, but I'm only 2 years out of college in a shit economy and I've been working really hard with what I have. With a $1,200/month income, I pay my $550 rent, $200 in public transportation to and from work and internship, and use the remaining $300 for food, expenses, etc. Even living on the edge like this, I managed to save up an emergency fund and pay down my credit, though the latter has been slowly creeping back up. I have worked very, very hard to become a financially responsible person with the little I have. But I had one blind spot, and it turns out it was a doozy. The only bill I wasn't paying was my student loans, as my parents said they would make payments for awhile until I got a real full-time job. My parents are horrendous about money even though my dad is a fucking accountant, and I realize now I should have been more vigilant - calling the banks to confirm, etc. I have been asking about my student loans - how much are the payments? how much do I owe? who do I owe it to? but my dad doesn't. talk. about. money. I even tried getting around him to figure out what phone number to call to speak to somebody else so I could get the answers, but I didn't know where to start. They assured me it was fine, so I let myself believe that it was, despite their utterly irresponsible attitude towards money. I told myself it would only be a short while longer until I got a real job and became financially independent and would not need to worry about them anymore.

Well, I stopped by my parents' house yesterday to hang out while they were on vacation (since they have a tv and I wanted to watch the Olympics). There was an unopened letter addressed to me sitting on the steps. I opened it up and it was a letter from a collections agency letting me know that my federal student loans are in default. I was completely floored. There had never even been a hint that they weren't making a payment - I have enough emergency money in my savings that I would happily have dipped in to make it if they were having a hard month, but they didn't say a word. I dug around and found an entire stack of unopened letters, clearly bills from the Department of Education, dating back over a year, complaining of late payments and missed payments. I'm thousands of dollars past due.

What can I do? Who do I talk to? What are my options, if any? I don't know where to turn. I live exactly on the edge of my income right now. Originally my student loan payments were around $200 which would be really fucking hard to make, but maybe if I dipped into my savings for a few months I could make it - but as it stands now, I can't possibly make the huge past due payments. How will this affect finding another apartment in the future? My credit is ruined, I'm sure.

Worst of all, while I can rebuild my credit over time with hard work, I don't know if I can ever rebuild my trust in my parents. This is not the first time they've done something of this kind to me. They are so irresponsible they're on the verge of losing their house. They've stuck their head in the sand about money for the last year, and not only are they sinking into an abyss of their own making, now they're willingly pulling me in with them. I could have done something about the payments *if only I had known* but they didn't say a word, even when I asked them point blank about it. I've always loved my parents, so the thought that I can't trust them is rocking my universe and I don't even know what the right choices are anymore. If anybody has advice, I would really appreciate it. Obviously in this economy I'm not the only person having problems with student loans, so hopefully any advice you have would be of use to them as well. Thank you. "

Our SOs were jealous of our friendship, but we were never single at the same time, so we never had a chance to see what it might become.  He graduated a year before me, and moved to a completely different part of the country, but when he'd come back to visit, he always made time to see me.  Even if he didn't have time to see anyone else. I'd feel sick about it afterwards, my heart would be racing so fast.

When I graduated from college, my plans took me even further away from him.  We basically live as far away from each other as possible. He's come to visit a couple times for work stuff, I've spent a couple summers in his city because of internships, but again-- one of us was always dating someone. We'd do activities that were essentially dates, bring each other to parties, or grab lunch in the middle of the work day. It's the same thing as in college, where he might be in my city for a couple days, and only have one free night, and he'll spend it with me. At least for me, that initial connection never went away. We've known each other for almost 5 years now, and I feel like I can distinctly remember every interaction we've had, because my adrenaline is always so high when I talk to him.

This is now the longest we've gone without seeing each other.  Work has not brought either of us to each other's cities in almost a year. We talk pretty often, and I think about him all the time.  These six months have also been the first time we've both been single in our entire friendship.  

Lately, I've felt more and more like I want to tell him how I feel. In a year, we'll both be in professional situations where we could move, and I keep thinking about how great it would be to be in the same city as him. Part of me thinks I should just fly out to where he is, without any excuse but to see him, and see if something happens.  Part of me thinks I should say something first.  Sometimes I feel like if I don't say anything I'll burst. Trying to hide the fact has made me the worst conversationalist ever.

So, what to do, reddit? Do I profess my feelings?  Should I fly out to see him and see if something happens finally?  Do I bite my tongue and preserve the friendship?"

Each potential employer found that while my grades were good and I had valuable work experience toward my major (I work as an IT guy for the library on my campus during the school year) I was too young for what they were looking for as they wanted to give more opportunities for upperclassmen who were nearing graduation.

I didn't think much of not obtaining an internship at the time. I figured I would just work at a place locally during the summer to help with college expenses and try again next year so I took up a job as a lifeguard at a local water amusement park around where I live. This is my final day working at said water park, and I can easily say it has been one of the worst jobs I have ever had. Don't get me wrong, I try to keep an optimistic outlook on whatever job I have and put my best foot forward. I realize that every job has bad days and you might not always work fore the most tasteful of people, but I can easily say that working as a lifeguard this summer has been one of the worst experiences I've ever had and has made me appreciate my college education and the importance of finding a REAL job astronomically more. 

So I am heading back to my university in 3 weeks, excited as ever to continue my education and am ready to put in my best effort to obtain a job that I am happy working at. 

Once again, if you have any recommendations for good places to intern for as an undergraduate MIS student (or any undergrad student for that matter) or have had any good experiences working at at internship, please let me and any other college redditors know!

Much appreciation,

Jackie Molasses

**TL;DR:** Worked at a terrible job this summer. Looking for recommendations for good places to intern at in the future for an undergrad college student."

My question to you is this: how much have you guys changed over the years?  ",Sonicdude41,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/xcc7h/after_thinking_really_hard_about_it_i_realize_one/,"If there's one thing I've been thinking about my life lately, it has to be this: where has all the ****ing time gone? I remember not too long ago, I was a silly little freshman starting high school. The only things important to me at that times were video games, tech, and many of the first world problems we all encounter on a daily basis.  

Now, I look at myself, and it's hitting me. I'm not a little **** anymore. I start my sophomore year of college in about 3 weeks. By this time next year, I'm going to be a 20 year old, looking for internships at some (hopefully) big name tech companies... and I'll be looking for a place that I can truly call my own down in Austin. I really have looked myself and noticed just how different freshman-year me and current me is, and to me, it's amazing just how much I've changed.  

Partly because of this place and college, I've become... I suppose a bit wiser.  If I'm going through some rough situation, I am now able to think about people who could be going through much worse, and put it in perspective to kinda keep myself going.  I can say that after becoming atheist more than a year ago, I've learned to take many things I see with a grain of salt -- by that, I mean that I'll go out of my way to verify any claim/point/whatever it is that is presented to me, as opposed to just accepting it at face value.  On top of this, I'm finding that, if I work hard enough... I'm capable of whatever it is that I put my mind to, mundane as this sounds.  While these are just a few things that I'm mentioning, I mention them because these changes are the ones that are very important to me, if that makes sense.

I'm really genuinely curious to know if any of you have had the same thoughts cross your mind in any way.  How much have you guys changed over the years?  Are you at all surprised by just how much you've changed?"

I'm in California for a summer internship (leaving early September to go back to university in England) and I'm working 12 hour days on an oil rig. I get time off (usually at least 3 days) when we finish a well and so far I've just been using that time to visit friends in SoCal. I would like to be using that time to meet and pickup girls but I'm a little lost as to how to go about that. I don't have a specific place to go when I get time off - I've just been crashing at friends' or hotels in whatever city I feel like visiting. Any advice on places to go? I'm not 21 yet so I can't get into bars. Also, advice on how to play the whole ""I'm gonna be gone in 5 weeks"" aspect?

We've been going out for about 9 months now, and things have been... well interesting. This is the first relationship I've had that has lasted longer than 3 months. I've had 3 other 'girlfriends' in the past.

We met in college after my ex-girlfriend broke up with me a couple months beforehand. I really missed the feeling of being with someone and having someone cherish me, and I put aside her personality flaws and settled for her.

I moved back to my home state after college just recently and am still dating her. She's very cute, funny, and social - which is why I'm still interested in her. The thing is, I'm not attracted to her physically and.... well... sexually (listening to how she speaks and moans while having sex). She is a really great person and I truly believe she's definitely going to be more successful than even myself professionally.

Right now, our long-distance relationship is pretty annoying to me. She wants to speak with me at all times she is not working, including breaks at work, school, and her internship. Every time I inquire about less-talking over the phone, she gets sad/upset because 'I don't want to talk to her :('.

I feel like she's not the one for me, and I want to break up with her. I've doubted myself about this a long time, but then I realized I had more fun and interesting conversations with her girlfriends than her. She's young and naive, and at this point in my life I really want someone on equal footing with me or having more experience in both professional/personal spheres.

I feel terrible already for saying all those mean things about her, but it's how I feel. Again, I really think she's a great person and I'm just the asshole who just doesn't want to be with her. But here's what is going down soon.

- she's coming to visit me (4 hour flight across the country) in two weeks for a week (already bought the ticket).

- I'm already spent talking with her over the phone, and she always wants to talk and have phone sex (I don't even want it anymore, and have faked it many times).

- She probably will not come live on my side of the country after college (5 months away) because her mother wants her to move in with her after college.

So /r/relationships, here's my question: how do I break up with my girlfriend in the most genuine and sincere way possible? We both have a lot of mutual friends in her state, and I don't want to burn bridges."

But I am a selfish, childish fuck and I need to grow the fuck up. So here goes. 

My boyfriend: My boyfriend has been the absolute most positive force in my life for the past five years, and he and I plan on getting married and spending the rest of our lives together. Our relationship is truly a dream, we never fight and we are on the same page about everything important in life - money, family, career, etc. He is loving, faithful, and more supportive than I could ever imagine of my hopes and aspirations, which he constantly cultivates. He makes me feel like my absolute best self, and everything I have going for me in life right now (a great job, a healthy lifestyle, a positive outlook and big dreams) I trace directly to his incredible influence.  He makes me feel special and loved. We have sex all the time when we are together, but we have been doing the long distance thing for awhile (we have concrete plans to be in the same place and get married within a few years). 

The other guy: this summer, I got a big time finance internship - they just gave me an offer for when I graduate from B-school next year. I have been working long, long hours with one particularly incredible person, who is a few years older than me. He is the guy that I would have fallen for years ago, before I met my boyfriend. He is very different from my boyfriend, but eerily similar to me. I am able to talk to him about topics that are very near and dear to my heart that my boyfriend and I do not have in common (though we have other things in common, and until this summer I've never found it problematic that my bf and I don't share all the same interests.) I have spent significant time at work with this guy and one long afternoon outside of work (nothing happened). This person is not as attractive as my boyfriend, not as interesting, not as good on any level. But he is the first person, in five years, who makes me feel like maybe someone other than my boyfriend could make me very happy for a very long period of time. 

The issue: It makes absolutely zero rational sense for me to even conceive of leaving my boyfriend for this person, but I find myself extraordinarily drawn to him on an emotional and physical level. I wake up thinking about him, I wonder about his whereabouts, I wait for his texts. Basically, I'm infatuated, and it sickens me but also excites me. I have done several things I'm not proud of. I have sought out opportunities to spend time with him outside of work. I have found opportunities to complement him. I have given him one gift, and I bring him coffee and can't seem to stop the urge to feed him and bring him food and stuff. I find reasons to touch him, like brushing something out of his hair, touching his arm when we're talking. It feels very primal, I keep feeling like I want to buy him things and take him places and do things with him. I can't stop thinking about him. I am very ashamed of all of these things, and I realize that they make me a very selfish person. 

I have a tendency to develop unreasonable crushes on men that I spend time with, so, in everyday life, at school, in previous jobs, etc, I take precautions to shield myself from developing feelings for men who are not my boyfriend.  I don't go out without him, generally, and when I do I don't talk to guys or shoot them down way early or talk mostly about my boyfriend. I let men know early and often that I am completely committed to him. But with this person, I can't avoid him because we have to work closely together. The other guy is not a bad person (I wouldn't be attracted to him if he was), so he is not going to make a move on me even though I think he feels we have a special connection too. He does not seek me out to the extent I seek him out, he does not touch me or reciprocate the way I treat him. However, I think this is related to the fact that he has to evaluate me and he has a strong sense of decorum. I am overwhelmed by a desire to talk to the OTHER person about his feelings for me, and I know that the person I should talk to, who deserves my attention and all of my thought is my boyfriend. 

I am having a very hard time reconciling what, on the one hand, is the rational and analytical side of my brain which screams STAND BY YOUR MAN (and don't be a fucking psycho bitch), and the other, psycho bitch hormonal and emotional side of my brain which wants to talk to, spend time with, have sex with and fall in love with this other guy, after breaking up with my boyfriend. 

I am not going to physically cheat on my boyfriend, but this is obviously already a case of emotional infidelity. What can I do to control how I feel and make sure that nobody gets hurt here (including me?)

TL;DR: I have a great boyfriend that I want to marry, but I have developed an intense infatuation for a guy at work I have a lot in common with.  I need advice on things I can actually DO to avoid being a psycho bitch and maturely handle two complex relationships. "

I like to talk about, and more importantly, listen to and ask about, everything. Abstract or concrete, to inform, to debate, to learn, and to entertain. This has served me pretty well - a bio professor with a vast untapped and restless knowledge of Midwest American history used to have me around just to lecture me on trains. A libertarian coder in a democrat company made me his favorite intern because even though we disagreed on some things, I wanted to hear what he had to say, and the adults' disagreement was, pettily, still as a lake. And as silent.

But. Oh. God. So many adults want to talk about their children. Oh, gods, raping, children. And gardens and vegetables. I didn't begrudge the children and gardens and vegetables, but the deluge was too intense.

Music, philosophy and videogames came up in my age cohort among the interns, as was to be expected. When I find my colleagues lacking in articulation, as occurs too often when one is in a technical field, I tend to just get back to work.

Allow me to describe:

Situation 1:  Hung out with HB8.  Explained that I'm not relationship material, and that I'd be leaving town in a few weeks (I'm here for a Summer internship).  Came back to my house, watched movie.  Lots of kino, lots of kissing, but not enough returned.  And whenever I went to kiss the neck, she'd say 'no.'  And at some point she said that it turned her on too much (wtf?).  Hung out a time or too after that, but didn't get a positive enough reaction to kino and kissing.  But I could tell this girl really likes me because she would text me a lot every day, and she said she liked me, and she always wanted to hang out.  Eventually, I quit hanging out with her because I wanted to be physically intimate and, frankly, she wasn't putting out.

Situation 2:  Hb7 expressed lots of interest in me (""let me know when you want to go to Disneyland"").  However, I couldn't seem to get her alone.  Anytime I suggested we hang (""are you free?""), she'd definitely be interested, but wanted me to hang with her friends.  She knows I'm leaving in two weeks.  I don't have time to hang out with her friends and all that bull.  I want alone time with her.  Last night, she invited me over.  I asked her who all was over, and she said it was just her (over 18) daughter.  So I came over.  Ended up with a house full of people.  We did have a really great time, and I made tacos for everyone (I was a professional cook for ten years), and drank beer and whiskey.  She digged me for sure.  To some extent, all over me.  Around midnight or 1am, I start indicating that I have work in the morning.  Her and I went outside for a smoke, and then started making out pretty hard.  And then, of course, all her damn friends come out there, too (is it really that difficult to get some goddamn privacy?).  I tell her I gotta go, but she could come hang out with me for a bit if she wants.  She wants too, but says she doesn't want to be rude to her friends.  I leave.

How could I have indicated to these girls that they didn't't have much time left?  That I'm going to quit hanging out with them so much if she can't give me what I'm looking for (because I'll be spending time with other girls who can)?  Because girl one seemed pretty upset when I quit hanging out with her as much (and girl two obviously wants to be intimate with me, but I'm not going to continuously hold the door open if she's not going to make a minimal effort to walk through it).  I feel bad about not spending time with these two girls simply because they won't put out, but what am I supposed to do, ya know?  I want to hang out with a girl I can be physically intimate with, not one who treats me like a bf but doesn't put out (or one who puts out, but with whom I spend an entire night with and can't seem to get a moment alone with)."

Is there anything we can do?",Jombozeus,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/xbo8e/police_forced_so_to_take_the_ambulance_by/,"My girlfriend (under 21), was intercepted on university campus by police on her way home while heavily intoxicated but not to the point of needing paramedics.

This is pretty obviously extortion but I know there is no likelihood of suing. Especially because in California, state law allows paramedics to treat a patient under implied consent when the patient is intoxicated.

However, forking out $1400 for a &gt;2 mile ride while being forced to is ridiculous and however we can reduce this amount would be the ideal.

What can we do the challenge the bill? Can she write to the hospital and challenge the amount with a combination of her low income (intern) and the fact that she was forced by a police?

Thanks."
xbnjx,0,2012-07-28,Let me tell you a story about a girl I like to call shoe girl.,instantnom,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/xbnjx/let_me_tell_you_a_story_about_a_girl_i_like_to/,"So I have told this story to several of my friends but I think it is about time that the reddit community hears it.

I had just finished my first year at Georgia Tech and had flown back home to Dallas to participate in a summer intern research position in 2009. One of my close friends for that year (who I shall refer to as Stephen) had just broken up with his girlfriend (who I shall refer to as shoe girl). Stephen and shoe girl had been going out for a year; however, Stephan broke up with her cause he was transferring to UGA next year. Right after they broke up shoe girl turned to me, instantnom, for comfort and remorse. For the next two weeks shoe girl would start to tell me how she has developed “feelings” for me and that she “loved me.” After the second week had ended she told me “that she loved me and wanted me to come visit her in Atlanta” to which I responded “ok.” (Let me just put a note in right here and say that she was and still is very attractive and we had been friends the entire time that Stephan was dating her.) After getting Stephan’s permission to pursue his ex-gf I flew out to Atlanta to what I had hoped and thought would be a weekend of fun. Of course if that would have happened I wouldn’t be telling this story now would I.

After arriving in Atlanta, I met up with shoe girl to go out on our evening date and to hang out. We decided to go to Atlantic Station for dinner due to the fact that there are a lot of things to do. Once arriving at Atlantic Station shoe girl would continue to non-stop text to which I originally found irksome but not a deal breaker. I suggested several places to go eat but she informed me that “she had just left CB’s house where he had cooked her dinner before picking me up.” (CB stands for cock block. I couldn’t think of a better name nor do I remember his real name.) Hearing this I started to worry but was too fucking hungry to care at the moment. During dinner at the local burrito place shoe girl continued to text CB and later asked me if I thought “it was ok for her to date around.” Being that we were on a date my first thoughts were a big hell no but being the giant pussy that I was I responded with a “sure.”

After dinner we decided to go to movies and see the latest big summer blockbuster, Inception; however, shoe girl was too impatient for me to buy the tickets and suggested “that we just go back to my hotel room.” At this point I had to make a decision, watching a movie I can see at another time or sexy times with an extremely attractive female. It was a hard choice but I went with the second option. While we were driving back to my room she told me a story of how she was at a party a week earlier, got drunk, and how one of Stephan’s friends (shall be named Fry)tried to hook up with her.

When we arrived to my room shoe girl continued her constant texting and got a text from Fry explaining how he had just gotten a house in Home Park and if she wanted to come take a look at it. Once again being the giant pussy that I was I agreed that we could go. Once arriving, it was to my surprise that Fry had not in fact purchased a house but was renting a room inside of a house. After doing the usual meet and great thing it was discovered that there was going to be a party there that night.

I’ll skip past the normal party things and go to the pool scene but just note that like most Georgia Tech related parties it was a giant sausage fest. At around 1 am a few geniuses decided that they wanted to fill up their newly purchased inflatable pool and to go swimming in it. It was during this that we all decided to go swimming in our underwear which only confirmed my original beliefs that shoe girl was in fact extremely attractive. About 15 minutes after getting in the pool another guest arrives; however, this guest is no ordinary guest. She is an ex-stripper who still likes to put on a show every now and then. It was at this point that the girls, all three of them, would participate in what was called “bras-off-o’clock.” It was at this point I finally got to lay eyes on her beautiful 34 C breasts; however, the pool water was around 60 degrees so nothing really happened down under.

At around 4 am people started to go to sleep in their respective rooms and it occurred to me that I was in fact trapped there for the night due to the fact that my driver was tipsy and that you do not walk around Home Park at night unless you want to die. Therefore I embraced this fact and we went to Fry’s room to go to sleep. Once arriving to Fry’s room, shoe girl communicated that she would be sleeping in the bed with Fry tonight while I would have to sleep on the floor. I was a little more than upset with these arrangements due to the fact that she had mentioned previously that Fry had tried to hook up with her but yet again being the giant pussy that I was said nothing. Normally you would expect that a host would offer their guest a pillow and/or a blanket yet I was offered nothing. I was stuck in the dog house. Having no pillow I came to the brilliant decision to use my shoes as a pillow. Thus the origin of the name shoe girl.

During the night it got below 60 degrees and I would therefore wake up from my discomfort of not having a blanket or a pillow around every 20 minutes or so; however, one time I was awaken not due to those conditions. It appears that during the night, because it was so cold, Fry and shoe girl decided to warm themselves up by having sex. Unaware that I was awake continued to warm themselves for about the next 20-25 minutes while I lay there not knowing what to do, shell shocked, and also speechless. Once morning arrived it was time for shoe girl to go to work and gave me a ride back to my room. After arriving back to my room she told me that she loved me and that wants to get together again soon. At this point I packed my shit and took the next flight back home.

Shoe girl to this date still will call me every now and then and tell me that she loves me not knowing what I had witnessed.

At this time I would like address a few things to a few people:

Stephen: I can see now why you broke up with her.

Fry: Sorry to disappoint you but she was faking it and your dick is not as big as you think.

Shoe girl: If you are going to say a name during sex make sure it’s the name of the person you are having sex with. His name is Fry not Ryan. On a positive note, you are still probably one of the most attractive female that I have ever seen. Congratulations on your engagement to a man who ironically has the same name as me. Perhaps in the future you, your fiancé, and I can get together and your fiancé and I could switch roles. At least that way if you yell out the wrong name, I would have come to expect it, but I don’t know if your fiancé would take a liking to that.

If the reddit community is interested I have many more stories that I can tell about real life events. Just let me know.

tl;dr: Hot girl says she loves but ends up having sex with another dude when she thought I was asleep in the same room.

xbmqz,1,2012-07-28,Let me tell you a story about a girl I like to call shoe girl.,instantnom,funny,https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/xbmqz/let_me_tell_you_a_story_about_a_girl_i_like_to/,"So I have told this story to several of my friends but I think it is about time that the reddit community hears it.

I had just finished my first year at Georgia Tech and had flown back home to Dallas to participate in a summer intern research position in 2009. One of my close friends for that year (who I shall refer to as Stephen) had just broken up with his girlfriend (who I shall refer to as shoe girl). Stephen and shoe girl had been going out for a year; however, Stephan broke up with her cause he was transferring to UGA next year. Right after they broke up shoe girl turned to me, instantnom, for comfort and remorse. For the next two weeks shoe girl would start to tell me how she has developed “feelings” for me and that she “loved me.” After the second week had ended she told me “that she loved me and wanted me to come visit her in Atlanta” to which I responded “ok.” (Let me just put a note in right here and say that she was and still is very attractive and we had been friends the entire time that Stephan was dating her.) After getting Stephan’s permission to pursue his ex-gf I flew out to Atlanta to what I had hoped and thought would be a weekend of fun. Of course if that would have happened I wouldn’t be telling this story now would I.

After arriving in Atlanta, I met up with shoe girl to go out on our evening date and to hang out. We decided to go to Atlantic Station for dinner due to the fact that there are a lot of things to do. Once arriving at Atlantic Station shoe girl would continue to non-stop text to which I originally found irksome but not a deal breaker. I suggested several places to go eat but she informed me that “she had just left CB’s house where he had cooked her dinner before picking me up.” (CB stands for cock block. I couldn’t think of a better name nor do I remember his real name.)  Hearing this I started to worry but was too fucking hungry to care at the moment. During dinner at the local burrito place shoe girl continued to text CB and later asked me if I thought “it was ok for her to date around.” Being that we were on a date my first thoughts were a big hell no but being the giant pussy that I was I responded with a “sure.”

After dinner we decided to go to movies and see the latest big summer blockbuster, Inception; however, shoe girl was too impatient for me to buy the tickets and suggested “that we just go back to my hotel room.” At this point I had to make a decision, watching a movie I can see at another time or sexy times with an extremely attractive female.

7/27/2012, approximately 9:00 pm @ the West LA Transit Center (Fairfax and Washington)
I was sitting on one of the bus benches, waiting for my particular Metro bus, coming back from my internship at the wonderful Reverge Labs LLC. Had my Intuos4 Tablet in a cardboard slip, and my Blizzard Entertainment Messenger bag on the floor right next to my feet. I was sketching away, most of my vision concentrating on drawing, until three early 20, late highschool black males walked past while also reaching down to grab my bag away. They started booking it up north on Fairfax avenue, I tried to give chase all the way to Apple, but I knew I wouldn't catch up since they had the surprise on their side. Called in 911, they took a report, and they'll do what they can, understandably, but that was at around 9:40 pm. From what I can remember, the person with the bag was in a maroon sweater, black hair, shortly cropped (not a buzz cut), and one of his other two friends had short dreadlocks and a dark navy blue jacket that night. Exclaimed something like ""Hey man, why are you chasing me? I didn't take your bag."" All of them fairly athletic build, like any decent track athlete or b-ball player. Besides that, no names, nothing. It all happened so fast, and I can't remember any particular facial features, etc.


This is going to be a long shot, and I don't know if the contents of the bag or the bag will end up on ebay or craiglist, or somewhere else anytime soon, but if anyone knows about where the stolen property might be, I'd be incredibly grateful.


Black Cloth Messenger Bag with ""Blizzard Entertainment 2011 Summer Intern"" woven on the front flap. One of the mementos of part of my career dreams, so it holds some importance to the child inside me.

== Contents include == 

-a black Micro B USB cable (Wacom), Intuos4 Grip Pen, Intuos4 Pen Well, Intuos4 Tablet Mouse

-blue pencil case with nondescript pencils, pens, etc in it. Rounded off corners, broken zipper seal, and a fake carbon fiber weave texture

-a black USB thumbdrive, forgot the brand/make &amp; gig size, but on the top it has a liquid crystal display showing Storage Size in 20% increments. Has a black cap.


That's about it. All in all, a loss of around $300 I would suspect (the bag is irreplaceable since they're not sold). My tablet's fine, but without the pen, USB cable, etc, I can't really help make games, do art for games, or maintain a livelihood in that sense. That and it was a gift from my already sacrificial-loving parents, and to all the other digital artists out there, you know how the tablets are priced. The Blizzard bag is and was a memento of a childhood dream half fulfilled when I had the opportunity to do Game Testing over there as a Freshman last year.


If ANYONE know where the stolen property might be and if they can get them back to me, I'd be grateful for your assistance and if the robbers are reading this, may I humbly ask that I just please get everything back? It's hard to lose stuff that has a lot to do with dreams.  Trying my best to forgive you guys, and it's not easy on my heart.

EDIT: I guess as a clear picture, if you do see the bag and/or persons.
--&gt; Call the cops immediately and give locations, descriptions, general direction of movement.   Take pictures if you can, video, even if low fidelity.

Thank you for your time, and I understand that I failed to be smart in an urban environment.

xbjvz,1,2012-07-28,question for APRNs/RNs: acupuncturist + nurse practitioner training?,acu_to_NP,nursing,https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/xbjvz/question_for_aprnsrns_acupuncturist_nurse/,"Hi there - long time reader, first time poster.  I made a novelty account for this purpose.  I have a career question.  I'm currently in graduate school for traditional Chinese medicine.  One earns an M.S., and then can sit for state/national board exams for a license to practice (the L.Ac).   After that, people typically go into private practice or join a pre-existing practice, or work at a hospital (this last category is pretty rare, but may be growing?)

We do at least 960 hours of clinical training during the 3.5 years it takes to earn the degree.   This involves working in student clinics under clinical supervision, seeing patients at progressively higher levels of autonomy.   We use various acupuncture techniques and Chinese herbal formulas, as well as give lifestyle/dietary advice.  Depending on the state we are in, we can be considered as primary care providers - which is a ton of responsibility.  

I personally don't feel that this is enough clinical experience.  Especially because, in the United States (where I'm located and where I plan to practice), patients will be coming to us as a 'last resort', with complicated conditions and presentations and will have already seen many providers before.  We do a few hundred hours of training in modern biomedicine, including anatomy, physiology, pathology, pharmacology, diagnosis.  But it's basically a joke, compared to what RNs, MDs/DOs, etc. do.  We're expected to understand when we see certain serious conditions so that we can refer out.  

I think the amount of training that acupuncture students do allows for a lot of mediocrity in the field.   Which has a lot of ramifications, of course.  A way to get past this is to do a a ‘residency’ or internship with more senior practitioners.   Another problem is that a significant amount of people don’t have very good business skills, and running a small business eludes them.  It’s hard to get employment statistics for this field - the few that I’ve come across say something like 50-70% of L.Ac’s stop practicing within 5 years of earning the license. 

I do not want to become one of these people.  I love doing clinical medicine, and I see the benefits in our modern medical system.  The wisdom in the tradition I’m studying is also incredible, and I would love to combine the two, somehow.   FYI, I used to work as an EMT, so I have some experience in that field.  I’m really interested in primary care, and want to work in underserved/rural areas.   I would love to have a stable job.  The stability of acupuncture is unknown, as it can take a while to build a successful practice (if you build one at all).  

So, I’m considering enrolling in an entry-level NP program when I’m done in about a year, and I’m curious what people here think of this idea - how feasible does it sound to open up a practice (in a state where NPs can practice autonomously, for example), and do both traditional Chinese and contemporary medicine?  Does it seem like these could complement each other?   How possible would it be to see people in hospitals and refer them to my private practice, for example?  I’ve looked at doing an MD/DO or PA - but I really dig the nursing model, and it seems like the APRN really fills a huge hole that is developing in healthcare.  In addition to primary care, I'm also considering specialties in psych or occupational health, as these sound potentially synergistic as well.  

It would be cool to have a dialog about this.  I’m really keen on hearing what experienced people say.  

Thanks in advance for your comments!

TL; DR:  future-acupuncturist wants more clinical experience/confidence, is considering the NP route.  can these worlds be combined, for the betterment of society and for a stable job? "

A guy I work with flagged me down as I was leaving and told me he watched her do it. 

I work in a 4 story office building, and dont know who it is. 

I left her a note.

""You hit my truck, please call me at (phone number).

I have pictures, your tag number, and a witness.

If you do not contact me by tomorrow AM, i will file a police report.""


She called from a blocked number. and opened with ""you accused me of hitting your truck?"" I laughed, and told her, it wasnt an accusation, i have a witness. She again claimed she didnt. I told her I have a white strip on my black truck, and she has a black strip on her white SUV. I have a witness that watched her try 4 times to get in that spot, one of which she hit me. She said the spot on her car had been there. I told her thats fine, ill go by the PD tomorrow. She is like ""well do what you gotta do"". I thanked her, and hung up. 

Its not bad, its just the principal of it all.

I have a pic of her tag# and VIN. She also works for the same company i do and is an intern. I could F#CK her world up. She better play nice.

The Internship is in December and we both have worked the past year and 1/2 to pay off all our debt. The only money we owe is about $9,000 and we are shooting to have that paid off my December, so saving money will be really hard to do while crunching back money to pay all of that off. We have both worked really hard to be responsible and we are looking for any type of organizations that would possibly help sponsor us or looking for any additional (legal) ways to make some extra money till then. Does anyone have any good ideas for this? 

Go ahead and rule out family. I am the first person in my family to even make it to college and his family doesn't have the extra money either. 

We both work over 40 hours a week. 

The Cost of this Internship is approximately $8,000. The Internship would provide us with the knowledge and skills needed to Build and create superadobe structures. They are Eco-Friendly and a more durable and cheaper option than lets say a trailer. We are hoping to learn this material to bring it back to the Eastern part of the U.S. to help find better and safer options for living. 

Thanks ahead of time for your help 

TL:DR. We need help getting funding for an internship we have worked over 2 years to try to afford? Any Ideas? Edit: Not asking for money asking for other people's advice on how they maybe got funded or found sponsorships."

Just hit the 1000lb mark :),greater_than_four,Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/xf35p/so_excited_just_hit_the_1000lb_mark/,"I just started lifting last spring semester, about February.  I played soccer my whole life and was always considered one of the strongest on the field, despite the fact that I had never spend a day in the gym.  I always just did push ups and pull ups to failure during my conditioning every summer.  No weight training.

I've been lifting consistently since February and have been eating great since I started my internship in the middle of Arkansas this summer.  I never maxed out any of my lifts because I was so worried about making sure that I got a great workout every day.  Today some bigger guys were maxing squat so I decided to jump in. I hit 385 and was absolutely pumped; they said my form looked great as well! :)

I asked for tips on bench and whether or not they could check my form after our workout.  One of the guys asked what my current max was, I said, ""about 250 maybe"". He threw up 270 after my form was down and I got it easily!

With those two lifts that puts me at 655 and I know I have a max deadlift of over 345 because I did 3x10 at 315 last week.

This is the first time coming home from the gym that I am really really excited about how far I've come.  My goal at the beginning of the summer was to work my way up so that I may be able to get the 1000lbs by the end of next semester, and I feel like I just crushed that.  I'm so happppy!!!!!

For those who are curious I am 5'7, male, 192lbs at about 12-14% BF, although that's just a guess.

My diet is pretty consistent, albeit boring:  

Breakfast:  6 egg whites, **OR** 1/2 cup of oatmeal with some frozen blueberries in it.  I recently favor the eggwhites.

Lunch:  1 Chicken breast and either a raw tomato, some raw brocolli, or an avocado.  This changes by week depending on what I buy at the story over the weekend.

Before workout:  Half a scoop of ON whey which about 10oz. Skim milk

Post workout:  2 scoops of ON whey with 18oz of skim milk

Dinner:  1 chicken breast with either a tomato, broccoli, avocado, or asparagus. Whatever I choose it is different from what I had for lunch.

Before bed:  ON Casein with 6oz skim milk and water to whatever consistency I feel like.

Thats it!  I just had to share with you guys :)

It's hard to get him to open up, but he does he just cries and cries. It hurts my heart.

For the first time he has not been beside me, he's gone to do an internship a couple hours away but this is when I noticed it getting worse. When we are together he says he's fine fine, but when he's alone he gets anxious and feels like he will lose me or fail at something. All these things are what he has told me. Recently he wanted to break up because he thought his depression would ruin this relationship eventually, I was very hurt. I love him a lot, but I told him I had to move out then. Essentially I was heart broken, still am a little. The second I tried to leave he just cried and begged me to stay. I want to help him, but he refuses to go to therapy. I am afraid he will continue to feel this way."

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It was a hot day in Bangkok. The kind of hot that makes sweat run down every inch of your almost-completely-exposed skin; the kind of hot that makes it impossible to think of anything other than the next release –the next glass of ice water, the next plunge into an unheated pool. Austin was grateful that today was her day off; any other day and she would have had to walk to work, escaping into her building’s air conditioned lobby just as the sun was rising –the hours before daybreak her only defense against the blood-boiling heat. Even on her days off, it was impossible for Austin to sleep in past sunrise –not even her thick, dark blue curtains could keep the light and heat out, and every day she woke up drenched in sweat. A cold shower had helped her recover that morning, but the relief was only temporary; not two minutes after leaving the cool, white, tiled bathtub, she felt her body’s temperature begin rise again. After five, she began to sweat. By eight a.m., the heat in her apartment was unbearable. 


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;When she had first gotten the internship offer, she had imagined herself in quaint cafés in the city’s center, drinking iced coffee, perfectly styled and made-up, nonchalantly reading all of those books she had never gotten around to. She had done this a few times, but the romance was somewhat diminished by the pit-stains on her flowing tops and now, in the hottest part of summer, she favored the privacy of her building’s small garden –the freedom to wear as little clothing as possible, free from the shameless eyes of the local old men. She technically shared the garden with the three other apartments in her building, but she had never seen anyone else out there, and she had a feeling that aside from her, the garden went largely unappreciated. Its ground was covered in unkempt grass, and small, white flowers peaked out from the cracks in the old stone wall. Austin didn’t know much about her neighbors; she occasionally saw the other tenants, mostly college-aged locals, in the evenings on her way back from work, but had never exchanged more than a short greeting with any of them. After six weeks here, and with no previous knowledge of the language, Austin was just beginning to grasp some simple Thai phrases. She had been able to navigate most of the city with only English, but had gone through great lengths to avoid conversations with the natives. 


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Austin stepped out into the abandoned garden, water bottle and book in hand, and adjusted the reclining lawn chair to maximize the small remaining patch of shade. She straightened out the beach towel covering the smoldering plastic and carefully laid back. Wearing only tiny jean shorts and a white bikini top, Austin surrendered to the heat. She stretched her tan arms, reaching up towards the cloudless sky, and sighed. Hands back at her sides, she admired the beautiful body in front of her; still soft and sensual, her stomach and legs were showing the positive effects of summer. She hadn’t bothered to look for a gym in Thailand, and running outside in this weather was out of the question, but Austin had never walked so much in her entire life, and her toned tummy glistened in the sun, a bead of sweat trickling downhill towards her bellybutton. If only she had someone with whom to share this new body, she thought, as she picked up her wilted, sun-bleached paperback and flipped to the most recently dog-eared page. For two hours straight, Austin read, pausing only for giant gulps from her bottle and to wipe her damp, strawberry-blonde bangs from her face. 


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;She was captivated by the story she was reading, surprised that the novel, an undisputed classic, could still feel so contemporary and relevant. More so, she was amused to find that, within its long, complicated, plot, lay several explicit sexual encounters –encounters that, far from the modern world of films and pornography, were astoundingly erotic and sexy in their authenticity. Austin could picture the scenes perfectly in her head –the dark, handsome protagonist both pleasuring and being pleasured by the various femme fatale he met on his travels –and Austin’s longing for someone’s touch only intensified. Knowing she was alone, Austin undid the top-button of her shorts with one swift movement, pulled down the scorching, metal zipper, and slid her left hand down between her legs, the slick material of her bikini bottom the only barrier between her and her comparatively pale vulva. There, she paused, enjoying the simplicity of the slight pressure, and lightly began to rub, tickling her clit through the thick material. She closed her eyes slowly, letting her mind run free. Austin knew exactly the pace and pressure that would bring her to climax, but there was no reason to hurry. Pushing aside the material of her bikini bottoms, she slowly explored every inch of her cunt; tugging lightly on her small strip of hair, playing with her delicate folds, occasionally brushing against her soft clit, teasing herself. Soon she felt that familiar urge –the urge to be touched inside, the urge to be filled. Without hesitation, Austin let her hand sink further down between her legs, gently pressing her middle finger against her increasingly wet hole. She increased the pressure, her finger soon overcoming her vagina’s slight resistance, her long finger plunging into her tight, warm pussy. Bending her finger upwards towards her belly-button, Austin found that awesome ridged inch and began to rub –back and forth, alternating pressure, pressing hard against her soft g-spot. 


Suddenly, the dead quiet of the garden was interrupted...

For example, how much do you pay for food and drinks per month (eating at home and occationally go out for food)? I heard that SF is quite expensive. So in general, what do you pay roughly for the basic needs of life?
Also, is Craigslist (or padmapper) the only/best way to find a shared flat? While I definitly want a room on my own I also would be happy to live together with some cool people who could introduce me into the city.
The last question is special. Does anybody of you have experience with paragliding near SF? I just got my licence and would be happy if I could go flying in the bay area. (Also, will my german licence or ippi card be enough to fly legaly?)

BACKSTORY

Me (f, 24) and A (m, 24) started off as friends over a year ago.  That quickly transformed into a friends-with-benefits situation that we both loved and were having fun with.  Sex, sex, flirting, partying, sex, all that stuff, but technically we were still single and we talked a lot about how we liked it that way.  We have a lot of the same friends, we hang out all the time.

Over time things became more intimate, feelings grew, and we realised what we really had was more similar to an ""open relationship"" (though I don't really love using that term).  We were both fine with that, and every month or so had a conversation to make sure we were both okay with the situation.  Some rules were established (for example, we don't need to tell the other person if anything happens with someone else, unless it's sex, because at that point health is involved.  Another is that if the other person is present, we're with them.  Not trying to get with someone else.).  Over the course of the first 7 months or so, when we started to have this agreement, **neither of us acted on it**.  Neither one of us has so much as kissed someone else this entire time.  So naturally when we've been having these conversations there has always been an understanding that neither of us is 100% sure of how we would feel or act, but ideally both of us would *like* to be okay with it, so we would *try* to be okay with it.  But in the end it would probably be case-by-case, and we both reserved the right to re-assess the situation if we had issues with it.  The main rule was that we had to be honest with each other about our feelings and our desires.

Over the last 3 months or so things have been getting more serious between us.  We're being treated more like a ""couple"" by our friends, and we're acting that way too. But I have enjoyed the way our relationship has been.  Not so much because I can go sleep around or even make out with other people (I have no urge to) but because I'm a social person, I like to flirt, and there's a part of me that really likes that when I say ""I have a boyfriend"", it is entirely up to me to say that.  It is not because I feel an obligation to say so, it is because *I want to*. 

Moving on...

THE EVENTS

At the beginning of the summer I had a temporary internship that lasted about 2 months.  It was a particularly unusual opportunity a lot of people in my field would love to have, and I, along with the 20-or-so other interns that got the job, was really excited.  During the internship, I developed close friendships with 3 people, there were about another 3 or 4 people I could see myself developing close friendships with, and the rest were all people I would at least like to keep in touch with.  I should mention the 3 people I developed close friendships with I sort of knew from before the internship, through working with them in the past.

Jump to the end of the internship.  One of these close friends, J (m, 24) has a party to celebrate.  There's a lot of booze going around.  My boyfriend, A, is busy that night but says he might come by later. People are doing a lot of shots and I end up getting really drunk, along with everyone else.  I've been texting A a bunch, trying to get him to come, and also telling my new friends how great he is, and how we're just newly acknowledging that our relationship is more serious than we had thought at first.  There's a lot of chatting about the other interns and it is revealed J has been having a bit of a romance with one of the girls.  So they're kissing a bit and it's all fun and drunken and good.

More shots.  Eventually A comes but really he's just coming to pick me up because now I'm more drunk than I have been in a looong time.  This is where things get a little hairy.  

Me and A wake up the next morning at his place.  I'm pretty hungover.  I don't remember leaving J's party.  I was too drunk.  I'm regretting it.  When A realises I don't remember, he seems irritated and reveals that something happened last night, and he spent a good portion of the night trying to sleep on the couch but thinking about our relationship.  He tells me that when he got to J's, I was more drunk than he's ever seen me (I agree).  And finally, apparently when we were leaving, J (who A has met a couple times before but doesn't know that well) made a move to kiss me, on my mouth, while A was standing right there.  And apparently I made no effort to stop it.  A ended up shoving J, no kissing occurred, and we left.

This event, which my immediate reaction was to think, ""no big deal"", led A to spend the evening tossing and turning, wondering if I had feelings for J, wanting to go back and fight J, wondering if something had been going on with J for a while.

I apologized to A for my drunkenness, and felt terrible that this happened right in front of him.  Obviously that is a major insult.  I also *really* wished I hadn't blanked on the events in my mind.  

But in all honesty I didn't think J kissing me was that big of a deal (especially since as far as I am concerned, J and I are totally platonic.  Even if he were to have feelings for me of some sort, which I don't think he does, they're feelings that I would squash if it got to a point where I felt like he was changing our friendship in any way).  Sometimes parties get a little affectionate (A and I have been to parties like this in the past, he is no stranger) and it is just friendly.  Also, I was not the person that initiated anything.  Like I say, this is the first time in about 7 months that any form of kissing with other people has taken place.

J also texted me the following day apologizing to me and apologizing to A, and I texted him back just saying that what he had done wasn't okay but I accept his apology.

So, (and I'm trying to wrap this up a little and get to the point) now A hates J.  After this series of events we had many big conversations and eventually it was concluded that an open relationship isn't for us and that we would now be ""closed"".  I however, was not willing to break off ties with J entirely.  I like the guy, and I really *don't* like who I associate myself with to be based on my boyfriend.  A feels that I should just not want to hang out with J of my own volition, because of what happened.

Jump forward about 2 weeks.  J has texted me asking if I want to go see a movie premiere with him and the other 2 close friends from the internship.  I haven't seen them or talked to them since the party (despite being invited to a couple social events).  I feel like the air has cooled a bit, so I accept.  No harm in a movie right? 

That night me and A are going to sleep and I tell him that I'm going, and I say I know he's not going to like it, but I hope he's okay with it and I think he should know.  (To my surprise) it is a big deal, he does not agree with me going, but doesn't want to dictate my actions.  He feels that I don't understand his hurt if I am choosing to go to this movie.  Another couple of big conversations and I end up cancelling the movie plans a few days later.  Not because A demanded that I do so, but because I realise our relationship is obviously still having issues in that area so it is a higher priority to me that that be worked out.  A is happy to know that I cancelled, and immediately things are totally fine again. 

THE MAIN ISSUE:

So now I don't really know what to do.  It's been about another 2 weeks since the movie thing.  I lied to J about why I couldn't go.  I haven't spoken to him since then, and as a result haven't spoken to most of the other interns either because the main way I socialize with them is in groups, and J is almost always there.  He is having another party on Friday, and I would like to go.  Not just because I don't want to completely destroy my friendship with him, but also because I want to see the other people that will be there.

However, I don't want to go if I'm going to feel really guilty for going.  I also don't want to go if I invite A, and he comes, and he just ends up miserable because he has such strong dislike for J. 

So, Reddit, what do you think? Am I being selfish?  How should I tackle this party situation; should I keep J in my life or is it a reasonable sacrifice to cut him off in order to keep my boyfriend happy?  If I do, how should I communicate this to J?  Really any comments you have will give me some perspective.

Thanks!

**TL;DR**
Was in a sort-of ""open"" relationship with BF.  Got too drunk, a male friend tried to kiss me when BF was standing right there.  BF was insulted but also realised we can't be open.  Fine with me, now we are just normal and ""closed"", but I don't really want to break off ties with the friend because the kiss was not a big issue to me.  BF thinks otherwise and this is a problem."

I currently have a few part time jobs, two of which are web design related (which is where I'd like to make my career). I can't handle all of them once classes start up again this fall, so I was hoping fellow web designers with experience in the industry could help me make an informed decision about where to invest my energies.

Here's a quick overview of each job, their respective relevance to web design, and my thoughts:

**Job 1:** Marketing Assistant at a construction company. I've been working there for 2.5 years, excellent pay. I design all print media as well as some administrative tasks. I also *maintain* the website, but it's not something I'd include in my portfolio because I didn't design it. Flexible hours, I love my boss and coworkers.

**Job 2:** Front End Development Intern at local dot com startup. Started 2 months (or so) ago. I was hired to do mostly mock ups in Ai and basic CSS work. However, our head designer had to move and subsequently quit the company. This meant that I was given more coding responsibilities in which I'm not proficient (namely, PHP). When I applied I thought it was just a summer internship, but when I talked to my boss he expressed interest in keeping me on, despite my lack of knowledge. I am psyched about the project and I'd love to be a part of it as they launch. This would be my dream job, but I hate feeling so slow right now as I try to learn on-the-go. 

**Job 3:** Web Design/Branding for a local small business. Basically I'd be building the whole package from the ground up. They don't have a website at all, want a new logo, etc. This would be the ultimate project for my portfolio. I am really excited about this opportunity, but at the same time I'm anxious because I've never done an entire project by myself before.

So, I basically feel like I'm choosing between Money, Dream Job Experience, and Portfolio/Freelance Experience.

To make a long story short, I'm in love with this guy, and don't know what to do about it. We're both doing an intership in Europe this summer, but we're leaving soon and we come from opposite side of the US. He's just my type: masculine, a little scruffy, good sense of humor, really smart. Drives me crazy.

I don't think he knows I'm gay. It's never really come up in conversation, and I'm not one of those guys who feels the need to talk about my sexuality all the time. Plus, I'm still not 100 percent comfortable with myself and am not out to everyone, so I have a hard time bringing it up unless it comes up, in which case I don't lie about it.

So I should just tell him how I feel, right? Two problems. First, I think he's dating someone. He casually mentioned his boyfriend one day, but when he started talking about him my heart just kind of sunk and I didn't ask him more about it. Second, we only have a week left of our internship, and then we're going back to the US, where we live on complete opposite sides of the country.

I came across this on Thought Catalog this week: ""Start a relationship with your crush by telling them that you want them. Directly. Like, look them in the face and say it to them. Say, I want you. I want to be with you.""

That's what I want to do: I want to look this guy in the eye and tell him how I feel. Tell him that I feel something with him that I've never felt with anyone else. But then part of me says there's no point since we'll be leaving and being together would be impossible. The most I could hope for would be a few awesome last days with this guy, followed by... what? Several months of missing him incredibly before the whole summer flame thing starts to fade? 

Just wanted to get that off my chess. Any advice would be appreciated. Is there any point in telling him how I feel?

Edit: I should add that his Facebook says he's single, which is why I'm confused about whether or not he's dating anyone."

Before everyone says ""read the sidebar!"" I did that and didn't quite find what I was looking for, so here it goes.

I really enjoy living in a city. I love the atmosphere, the people, the craziness, and the lights and crowds. I'm talking ""a few blocks from Times Square."" However, I also love the SF weather, the nicer people here, and the awesome culture. I know SF has a lot to offer, but since I've only been there a few times, it's tough to scope out the best place in which I'd like to live.

I know about the rent. I have a decent enough offer out of college to handle that and I'd probably find roommates so anything under $2000 a month is fine.

What I'm looking for is a place in the middle of it all. I want to be steps away from great restaurants, bars, and quaint coffee shops. I want to be where things are happening. I've seen tons of people talking about the Mission, but everytime I've been there, it seems so distant from the actual ""city part"" of the city. The financial district / Tenderloin seems more what I'm looking for, but I keep hearing that Tenderloin is a really dangerous place (which I'm trying to understand because it looks very bustling).

Anyway, sorry for the random sounding request, but I'm looking for some advice and I really want a great place that's going to keep my mind from wandering back to New York City.

I'm an intern at a law firm in NYC, and one of my bosses client's is a woman in the midst of a fight over visitation and so on. She is the one who has the child.

xem5q,99,2012-07-30,"2x, I'm 20 but I'm regularly mistaken for a 12 year old, who else here looks really young and how do you deal with it?",teh_mags,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/xem5q/2x_im_20_but_im_regularly_mistaken_for_a_12_year/,"The title says it all, every time I go out in public people tend to assume I'm way younger than I actually am. It comes up basically whenever I leave the house and bump into family acquaintances or friendly strangers. They’re always well-meaning so I’d feel awful if I was catty to them, but every time is another blow to my self-esteem, and it really happens constantly. Just this past few months I’ve had people offer me 12 and under discounts, I’ve had someone try to introduce me to his 10 year old daughter (hoping we could play together), and I hit a dreaded triple whammy… when someone asks what grade I’m in, I tell them I’m a junior, and when they (already incredulously) ask at what high school I have to tell them that I’m a junior in college.

The worst part is that though it’s only an eight year difference, it is the difference between an adult and a prepubescent girl. If I were 30 and getting mistaken for a 22 year old I’d probably feel a lot better about it, but right now it’s a constant reminder that I look like a kid. It’s really hard to feel self-confident and attractive when, as a friend of mine once told me “anyone that is attracted to you without really getting to know you first is basically a pedophile”.

I’m especially worried about it because I’m in school for mechanical engineering, which is of course a totally male dominated profession. At my last internship I was really only given filing work and often no work at all, and I can’t help thinking that it’s because many of the folks at the office saw me as totally young and incapable. I’m really terrified about this because even though I know I’m a good engineer, I feel like no one will take me seriously, making interviews more difficult, and I’m worried they’ll pigeonhole me right away when I get new jobs (making it hard to prove my capability and move forward).

Needless to say, I’m sick of all this and I don’t know how to deal with any of it. I don’t know how to respond to these people and I don’t know how to make myself look older. I’m 5’2”, 110 lbs, and I have a seriously young looking face. (Pics for context: http://imgur.com/a/e4ea6) I grew up awkward and nerdy and never learned how to dress for my body type or apply makeup. I’m also way overdue for a haircut and new eyewear, so if anyone has advice, feel free.

I’ m sure other women out there have this problem, so what do you do about it? Needless to say I have tons of horror stories (once my boyfriend, with his arm around my waist, introduced me to his friends…. Only for them to ask if I was his kid sister), so who else wants to share theirs?

**TL;DR: I am 20 but the first impression I give people is that I’m prepubescent, and it sucks. Tell me your “people think I’m way younger than I am” horror stories and also feel free to teach me how to clothe myself.**

",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/xeleb/i_need_to_move_but_im_literally_stuck_what_should/,"Hi Redditors -- I'll be 22 next month, heading to graduate school in D.C. this fall. It's something I've worked toward for as long as I can imagine, and the reason I pushed myself so hard during college. D.C. is also where I've gotten to experience my first taste of independence (through an internship), so it's a once in a lifetime opportunity to live out a dream, permanently.

Some background: My family is extremely oppressive, likely suffering from a combination of personality disorders, control issues, and trouble accepting my adulthood. For example, I've been obstructed from getting my license, can't drive with friends, or do much of anything by myself. (I'm an only child.) They consistently mock, taunt, and disapprove of my education, relationships, and even emotions. In the past, they've called the police to 'parent' my ways and knock 'sense' into me, threatened to sabotage relationships, and destroy my property. On the night before my graduation this past May, my father left a voicemail ""disowning"" me and telling me that he doesn't care if I'm dead or alive. It's abusive, to say the least.

I've been living at home for the summer, in a guest room, tolerating this for the past two months after graduating college. I've also been working remotely, and making money to support basic things for myself financially. I've signed a lease that starts on August 20th. About $150,000 in student loans begin the same day. Where my parents offer to make themselves available to help, they revoke their offer from one day to the next and hold it over my head in a very manipulative way. Because I don't have a license, the $700+ to pay professional movers, or friends who are available to help on moving day, I'm not sure what to do. I've got about 8-10 medium sized boxes to move, and not much else besides that. I'm scared that I'll miss the boat on something I want so badly.

I'm considering bargaining with movers next, and agreeing to pay them once I get to D.C. (and have access to the disbursed loans, even if it eats into my budget). Other than that, do you have any suggestions for what I can possibly do to get unstuck and moved on with (no pun intended) my life? 



Sincerely,

Stressed Like Sisyphus "

xef0c,1,2012-07-30,Had no idea there was a subreddit for this..well here it goes.,[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/xef0c/had_no_idea_there_was_a_subreddit_for_thiswell/,"A couple months ago I was on the top of the world. I was about to graduate, had a good internship lined up, had a beautiful girlfriend. Everything soon changed. My girlfriend of a year and a half broke up with me two days after college graduation. It was completely out of the blue. She told me she had been feeling unhappy for awhile, but how could I know as she never told me? She never expressed discontent and never talked to me about it. I was naturally very confused, upset, and pissed off. This was all after I gave her most of my stuff from my house so that she could have it for her apartment at school next year, even had my brother drive two hours in his truck to help me move it there. She also attended my college graduation, if she didn't want to be with me all that time, why did she do those things? I felt very used. We meet the next day for coffee where she proceeds to tell me she doesnt love me anymore. But how does one fall out of love overnight? Pretty hurtful thing to say. Makes me think she doesn't know what love is, as I am her longest relationship and me being 23 and her being 19 (soon to be 20).
Fast forward to a week after the breakup. We hadn't talked or anything but I knew she went to visit our school take her mind off of things. Whats funny is that she all of a sudden became best friends with people of whom I introduced her to. These people were my coworkers and their assorted gfs and friends. I am on facebook. I soon see pictures posted by my buddies gf, in each one her standing next to a certain kid. I freaked, thought fersure something was going to happen between them. Most of the people I talked to about it just said it was coincidence, but I knew. I texted her the next day and said we should talk. 
She comes over and we talk in my car. I tell her about the crazy thought I had, laugh it off as if its rediculous. It turns out I was quite right. She fucked the kid. I go nuts, we had been broken up just under a week and she goes and fucks someone else. Immature little girl. Somehow we get through the conversation, somehow she ends up sleeping over, somehow I'm the one trying to make her feel better after I've made her feel like shit, somehow we have sex. We decide we are going to hangout everynow and then as we were/are bestfriends. I tell her idk if I'll feel the same when we wake up.
Now for some backstory. I went through so much drama and what not because of this girl. Not that she didn't for me or anything but still. I beefed/lost friends because I decided to be with her, yet I stood by her side. Also, she basically ended up living with me the entire relationship. My first roomate didnt care, but the next two did. These kids were really good friends of mine, and one day sat me down to tell me how they didnt like my gf and all this dumb shit. I still told them to fuck off and stood by her. I spent nearly every moment I could with her, not that I necessarily wanted to. Everytime I wanted to do something by myself or hang out with the guys she made a big deal out of it, it was rediculous. She at the time, didnt have many friends, yet I still gave in most of the time and hung out with her.
Back to the present now, we see each other 2 to 3 times a week, she sleeps over at my parents house, we go on dates, have sex, and all that. Things do not seem very different from when we were dating. Yet she is two different people. She states that she doesnt know what she wants. Sometimes she will be very cute and sappy with me, tells me she loves me, misses us, and other times she will be very cold and tell me she doesnt want to get back together. I often get very frustrated and worked up about it all. To the point where I tell her I can't do it anymore, and she wont let me go. Says shes not ready to let me go. 
Point is, I am still in same position. I want to get back with her, but shes so indecisive and two sided she cant make up her mind. I have no idea what to do because I am too sometimes. Sometimes I want to tell her to fuck off and move on while others I want soo badly to be back with her. We still have sex and tell each other we love each other. She still continues to hangout with pretty much my friends. I originally had planned on moving in with her to her apartment next year for a semester. Now those plans are fucked. She is even going on a vacation with some people that I know (including dude she fucked), of whom she claims was a mistake and nothing is gonna happen. I just need to know what to do. I moved back to my parents this summer specifically to be with her. I have no friends here as I am not from here therefore I have no one to talk to about it. Please reddit, any advice?"

xeaoz,1,2012-07-30,Happy without friends? (xpost relationships) ,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/xeaoz/happy_without_friends_xpost_relationships/,"I am a 24 year old female and have been in a relationship with my boyfriend (26) for the last 2.5 years. Throughout my life I have always had a best friend, one person that I did almost everything with and was always extremely close with. I had a best friend growing up through high school (who I am still somewhat close with but she lives quite far away so I only see her 1-2 times a year) and then a best friend through college. On top of these best friends I have usually had a pretty standard group of regular friends to go out with etc. Since I started dating my current boyfriend I have lost most of my friendships just due to me not really spending any time with my previous friends.

I know this sounds terrible but please let me explain. Around the time I met my boyfriend I had been graduated from college for about 9 months and had no luck finding a job. I was essentially doing nothing productive with my life and just drinking and going out a lot with my friends. I wasn’t happy with how my life was going but I felt really helpless with the job situation so being around my friends and drinking/smoking just made me feel a lot better, not as lonely. When I met my boyfriend I was feeling pretty bad about my life in general. He was so on track, he had a job and was getting his masters degree. We started casually dating (we were long distance so we would see each other every other weekend or so) and he just seemed so motivated that he made me want to get my shit together. I finally worked on getting a job (not a real career job but something to do and feel like I am making some of my own money). A couple months in to us dating I asked where we were headed with out relationship, he told me he needed me to be more serious about my life (and quit smoking weed) before he could seriously date me. Well, that did it for me. I got more serious about looking for a job, quit smoking and started to make some real moves towards a real life. We started dating seriously and I eventually go accepted into an internship near where he lived. My lease was up where I was living so we decided to move in together (this is all about 9-10 months after we met).

This is the point where I really lost my friends. I moved in with my boyfriend and even though I had friends from college who lived not too far away from where I relocated to I just did not have any interest in hanging out with them. The few times I did I saw myself kind of slipping back into my old habits and even though I am now at a point where I have a very successful career and feel accomplished, I am scared of falling back into the person I was before and losing all the forward momentum I have gained. My boyfriend is somewhat of an introverted person and just never really had a ton of friends, he pretty much hangs out with his brother occasionally and that’s about it. I feel completely fulfilled when we just hang out together and I just don’t feel the need to seek out my friends or find new ones. We have been spending (almost) all our time together (except when we are at work) for almost 2 years now and I am happier than I was when I did have a big group of friends. While we do fight sometimes (of course) it does not seem to be anything outside the realm of any other relationship and we are both perfectly happy staying at home most weekends or going on little trips, neither of us feels the need to go out and be super social.

Before I met my boyfriend I was always someone who had lots of friends and loved being social but it seems as though my priorities have done a 180. I always see in any type of relationship advice that couples need to spend time apart and have friendships outside of their relationship (and I was always a big advocate of this pre my current relationship), is this always the case? Is it possible to have a happy and healthy relationship without spending time away from each other with friends? It just seems like we are breaking one of the biggest relationship rules I seem to see and it doesn’t seem to be causing us any problems at all."

I've been reading the posts and have an idea of what to do to help my chances, but would like some advice on how to do it and if there was more I could to help my chances.

Some background on me:

- Graduated from a state school with an average reputation
- 3.92 GPA
- Math and English major
- Never took probability or statistics class
- Took one online finance class (got an A- but don't think I actually ""learned"" the material)
- Just passed P last weekend on my first try 
- Have taken classes that have used Matlab and Maple, but I never really got a lot of direction on how to use it and never felt particularly competent. 
- I know excel decently, but nothing too in depth, but can usually teach myself from online tutorials
- Don't have internship experience
- I am currently working as a claims representative at a company that works for hospitals in order to get bills processed through insurance companies.
- Variety of unrelated experience: tutoring (college tutoring center and in home tutoring through a tutoring service), TA'd a Psychology course, worked in retail, and served at a restaurant. This list is all the work experience I've had since age 16 pretty much.

What I plan to do:

1. Start studying for FM
2. Take FM in Dec or in Feb if I fail
3. Start studying for either MFE or C for either June or July
4. Learn some programming/excel skills
5. Once I pass MFE or C then start sending resumes out and call in my favors (a relative works for an insurance company but not in actuarial dept and a friend of the family worked two years as an actuary at an insurance companies). Not exactly anything that makes me a shoe in or anything, but definitely could at least get my resume looked at. 

I just have a few questions:

1. What are my chances of ever even finding work as an actuary?

2. Anything I should add to my plan to better my chances?

3. Which is a better choice after FM, MFE or C?

4. What is the best way to learn a programming language/advanced excel skills? I would really prefer not to have to pay for a college course, but if many of you feel it's the only way to learn then I'll do that. Which programming languages will be most useful and attractive to employers? Is there a way to make learning programming less daunting? I have looked a little into programming (nothing at the level of a course on it), but whenever I do it seems so daunting and overwhelming that I feel like I wouldn't be able to pick it up. Once you start learning, does it get less intimidating?


5. For those of you who do tutoring on the side or while looking for work, is freelancing or going through a company better? Right now I make about 24 an hour for tutoring and the company has a pretty easy time finding students. Is there more money to be made just posting an ad on Craigslist? 

TL;DR, Looking for career advice. If you could give me any help one any or all of my questions, I would really appreciate it. Thank you!

Since I took over, the farm has increased sales from a few thousand dollars a year to about $50,000/year. I managed our farmers market and I started a 100 member CSA, marketed the shares via public speaking events, social media, a website that I put together and other networking methods, managed the members and responded to member's concerns. I used spreadsheet and database programs to create planting schedules, budgets, equipment and seed orders and membership records. I also started a farm internship program, recruited hundreds of applicants via word of mouth, web and social media presence and conducted interviews prior to each growing season to create a team which I then managed 6 days a week to do work related to every aspect of farming. Many of my interns have either stayed on as permanent staff of our non-profit or have left and then returned to work here again so I guess I am a pretty good manager and create a fun, very hardworking team-based environment. I've completed farm food safety training as well as non-violent communication training, have experience working in a consensus based environment. I went to college for International Relations (Sustainable Development focus) and have had other odd jobs - barista, early learning tutor for ESL students, administrative assistant and database manager for the same non-profit that I work at now, managing and updating an Access database with about 20,000 entries with history for most of them dating bag 20 or so years. Help me turn this pile of words into a strong resume. Thank you!

tl;dr: I'm an organic farmer. I want a farming related non-profit job. I've done a lot as a farmer and need to turn it into resume material. Help me!"

xe3k8,0,2012-07-30,Happy without friends?,Nofriendsatall,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/xe3k8/happy_without_friends/,"I am a 24 year old female and have been in a relationship with my boyfriend (26) for the last 2.5 years. Throughout my life I have always had a best friend, one person that I did almost everything with and was always extremely close with. I had a best friend growing up through high school (who I am still somewhat close with but she lives quite far away so I only see her 1-2 times a year) and then a best friend through college. On top of these best friends I have usually had a pretty standard group of regular friends to go out with etc. Since I started dating my current boyfriend I have lost most of my friendships just due to me not really spending any time with my previous friends.

I know this sounds terrible but please let me explain. Around the time I met my boyfriend I had been graduated from college for about 9 months and had no luck finding a job. I was essentially doing nothing productive with my life and just drinking and going out a lot with my friends. I wasn’t happy with how my life was going but I felt really helpless with the job situation so being around my friends and drinking/smoking just made me feel a lot better, not as lonely. When I met my boyfriend I was feeling pretty bad about my life in general. He was so on track, he had a job and was getting his masters degree. We started casually dating (we were long distance so we would see each other every other weekend or so) and he just seemed so motivated that he made me want to get my shit together. I finally worked on getting a job (not a real career job but something to do and feel like I am making some of my own money). A couple months in to us dating I asked where we were headed with out relationship, he told me he needed me to be more serious about my life (and quit smoking weed) before he could seriously date me. Well, that did it for me. I got more serious about looking for a job, quit smoking and started to make some real moves towards a real life. We started dating seriously and I eventually go accepted into an internship near where he lived. My lease was up where I was living so we decided to move in together (this is all about 9-10 months after we met).

This is the point where I really lost my friends. I moved in with my boyfriend and even though I had friends from college who lived not too far away from where I relocated to I just did not have any interest in hanging out with them. The few times I did I saw myself kind of slipping back into my old habits and even though I am now at a point where I have a very successful career and feel accomplished, I am scared of falling back into the person I was before and losing all the forward momentum I have gained. My boyfriend is somewhat of an introverted person and just never really had a ton of friends, he pretty much hangs out with his brother occasionally and that’s about it. I feel completely fulfilled when we just hang out together and I just don’t feel the need to seek out my friends or find new ones. We have been spending (almost) all our time together (except when we are at work) for almost 2 years now and I am happier than I was when I did have a big group of friends. While we do fight sometimes (of course) it does not seem to be anything outside the realm of any other relationship and we are both perfectly happy staying at home most weekends or going on little trips, neither of us feels the need to go out and be super social.

Before I met my boyfriend I was always someone who had lots of friends and loved being social but it seems as though my priorities have done a 180. I always see in any type of relationship advice that couples need to spend time apart and have friendships outside of their relationship (and I was always a big advocate of this pre my current relationship), is this always the case? Is it possible to have a happy and healthy relationship without spending time away from each other with friends? It just seems like we are breaking one of the biggest relationship rules I seem to see and it doesn’t seem to be causing us any problems at all.

**tl;dr In a 2.5 year relationship with almost no friends outside of eachother. We both seem perfectly content with this but it feels as though we are breaking a cardinal relationship rule. Are we?**"

This is going to be a pretty long post, but I would love some insight as to what might be going on.


So this guy has been my friend since preschool. He has always been well liked, fun to be around, and just an all around good guy. He comes from a good home, got good grades, was good at sports, and seemed to be doing perfectly fine until now. He is 22 and in college, and some very odd things have been happening lately. Me and my friends have been racking our brains trying to figure it out, but it is just too strange to figure out.


I will start in December which is the last time I saw him functioning normally. He was doing very well in school and didn't seem like there was anything bugging him. He partied quite often but it didn't interfere with school at all. Where things start getting odd is around spring break. On the first night around 5, he got drunk and managed to get separated from everyone, and misplaced his phone. No one heard from him until the next afternoon. It looked like something was bothering him and everyone was wondering what it is. He said that he cleaned his bank account out at a strip club (which is true), and then some people let him sleep at their place that night (unconfirmed). After that night, he was still functioning somewhat normally, but still seemed like something was bugging him. He was in this state for about a month and a half, but then things got a lot worse. 

Around the end of the school year, he just seemed brain dead. He would hardly talk, he would stare off into space, and he was extremely anti-social. We would go out to eat, and he would sit at the table and not say anything, and would randomly walk to bar and sit down and not order anything. He would just stare at the tv. And I'm telling you, he used to be the most outgoing and social person I have ever met. But he just became detached from reality. 


When the school year ended, he began a new internship out of state. No one was really in contact with him, except for one mutual acquaintance from high school that was doing an internship at the same place. This girl did not know my friend, but she knew of him and knew who he hung out with. She called me and a couple of my other friends and asked what was wrong with him, because he seemed like he was just ""not all there."" At this point, me and my other friends have talked to our parents asking for advice, and they all suggested we talk to this guy's parents. We took their advice, and they said they had noticed some things too. We left, and within the next hour or so, this guy called his parent's and told them that he was detoxing from painkillers, relapsed, and needed to go to rehab. 


His parents flew to the place he was working and took him to the hospital. At the hospital, they gave him a blood test and a urine test. Both came back negative. They did the test again and got the same results. This was peculiar, but they still checked him into rehab anyways. 


A little over a week into rehab, his parents got a call from the treatment center he was at. They said that he went out for a walk by himself, and came back all cut up and bruised. When they asked him what happened, he told them that he took a large dose of benzos and fell into a bush. The treatment center was baffled that he was able to get drugs in there, and they wanted to see if he brought any other drugs with him. They gave him a hair follicle test, which can detect any drug use in the last 90 days. When they read the results, they were shocked to see that the results came back negative for every single drug they tested for. That is where this is at now. His parents are confused, me and my friends are trying to put the pieces together to have some sort of clarity. What we think is going on is that he has a very deep, dark secret that has been eating at him for a while, and he just completely lost it. So anyone have any idea what could be wrong with him? 


**TL;DR- Friend of mine who used to be very social has become quiet, distant, and seemingly brain dead. It kept getting worse and worse until he claimed to have a drug problem and needed to go to rehab. In rehab, they drug tested him and showed no signs of any drug use in the last 90 days.**

While I'll have incredible letters of recommendation, my gpa isn't good (3.3) because of some poor lifestyle choices my sophomore year (namely activities involving leaves). Unfortunately as far as all of this is concerned it seems only important for graduate school and doesn't seem particularly helpful as far as getting a job goes.

While I'm aware of everything I need to do as far as getting a job goes (throwing my resume everywhere, going to job fairs, looking online on cragslist, indeed and monster) does anyone know how difficult it is to get into the job market right now as an international student, especially one with a gpa like mine?

i deal with said dickbags by being super quiet and ignoring them. i'm usually very obedient but if there's something i know is wrong/refuse to do, then i just don't do it. in the end, said dickbags usually give a, ""well, that works too"" response knowing that i was right in the first place but just refuse to admit it. i don't know if that made sense but...yeah. for example, i received an once-in-a-lifetime internship my freshman year that needed my advisor's signature to put on my transcript, but he claimed it didn't exist. he even went great lengths to contact my parents to verify if it existed. in the end, i got his signature because he found out that i was already accepted/started and that it did indeed exist. his signature was just a formality for school/transcript purposes blah blah blah.

xd7fp,9,2012-07-29,Law Student to CS Major? ,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/xd7fp/law_student_to_cs_major/,"I'm a 24 year old law student attending a solid school just outside the T14. My grades are above the median, which puts me in a good (not great) place for landing interviews later on. I am currently taking a leave of absence from school to make sure law is for me. I got an unpaid six-month internship at a small law firm doing mostly paralegal work. I hate it. I've disliked studying law my entire first year at school, and now I realize I dislike practicing. It's not that it's too difficult - I just don't enjoy it. I tell myself that if I could do it all over again, I'd go into computer science. The idea of coding and creating a program from nothing appeals to me. Plus, there's a better market for CS grads than JDs. 
Problem is, I've never taken any real math courses in college. I've never taken a programming class. I'll probably need to audit some courses at a community college in basic programming to make sure it's for me. 
My question for you, members of this sub, is this: if I find out I like it, what should my next steps be? I have $40k in debt from my first year of law school and no background in math. Should I go back to school for a BS in Comp Sci? Should I start with an Associate's from a community college? Full time or part time? I'm single with no real obligations other than my debt. Are there any other options for someone in my position who wants to program someday? 
Finally, if I do go back to school, I'm torn between Boston (where I go to law school), Chicago (my friends/family), and Los Angeles (some family/where I'm working now at the unpaid internship). From an employment standpoint, which of these three is the best? Or is that even the right question to ask?
Thanks, all. I could really use some direction. "

I was right, I am able to do it but I had to sacrifice spending time with my girlfriend and my friends. Now, I am almost done with my second class (ends the second week of August) but I have lost all of my friends and my girlfriend just broke up with me. I am already stressed out enough about my workload and now I just lost all of my motivation to get anything done and since I won't finish anything, I know that my boss is going to murder me since I won't finish my work and I'm going to fuck up 30% of my grade by not finishing this program for class, which will cause my parents to flip their shit considering they paid $3000 for summer classes and my GPA really cant afford to take the hit of failing or even getting a D in this class. I don't want to commit suicide but it crossed my mind a few times because I'm already so depressed and I really don't think I can take any more abuse from my parents or my boss. I would really appreciate any kind words, encouragement, or advice.

I am looking for advice on my current situation. 
I am 20 and working at an internship in a very small store. There are 7 of us altogether, with 2 women working customer service, one man in sales, one man in the stock room and I am with 2 other women in the office. However, sometimes I get sent to help out the guy in sales.
Here's the problem - he flirts with me. A lot. 
He is very friendly, about 35 probably, and definitely not threatening. But its just awkward! He calls me 'sweetie' or 'sweets' and is always offering me candy, pop, snack, etc. If I haven't been helping him much he will come down to the office and 'check in'. I am in a committed relationship and obviously too young for this man. How do you recommend dealing with him on a personal level? Any advice on how to tactfully make it clear that I don't want his flirtatious attention?
Thanks for any thoughts you may have!"

So I've done FPGA and microcontroller (VHDL and C) programming before and would consider myself to be ""pretty decent"" at both of those. When they told me part of my internship was going to be making some iOS apps, I thought, ""how hard can it be?"" They said it was ""object-oriented"" which I translated as ""okay, cool, I get to use classes again like in C++."" After a couple weeks of poking around in Xcode, I'm still feeling rather lost.

When I pull up some example code, I feel like, line-by-line, I'm more or less okay. However, I'm really struggling with bringing the ""big picture"" into focus. That is, the high level meanings of and relationships between stuff like delegates, controllers, storyboards, etc. Does anybody have any good resources addressing this? 

edit: I thought another way to put it might be: It seems like there must be some sort of way of looking at the Xcode/iOS/ObjC package that makes a lot of sense to someone. I'd like to have that view too.

edit 2: Hey thanks for all the replies. You guys were all very helpful and I'll be utilizing the resources you gave me starting today."

On that note, does anyone have any leads or ""ins"" for an internship-- paid or unpaid-- in the realm of Finance? He's really hoping to get some kind of experience, and his ultimate goal is to stay in the US. While Raymond James would be excellent, he's certainly open to smaller companies as well.

in 2008, with barely a few hundred dollars to his name, antoine rode from san francisco to washington dc so he could work as intern at some congressman's office.  in dc, he volunteered full-time for bikesfortheworld.org (nonprofit sending used bikes to third world countries)

currently, antoine lives in rochester, mn and commutes to work by bicycle 36 miles each way!!!!!! (72 mile roundtrip). unfortunately, his bicycle is falling apart and he desperately needs a new one.  

this, is where YOU come in.  there is a competition put on by lynskey performance bikes where the person with the most facebook likes gets a free bike!  

please watch this video to learn about antoine and his story:  http://vimeo.com/14285203

http://www.facebook.com/lynskeyperformance/posts/346794778729064

the contest ends in another 9 hours, let's help antoine win this bike!

edit: here is the latest from antoine's facebook page:

The story goes like this I first met a Lynskey CX frame Angry Catfish Bicycle and Coffee Bar and attempted to negotiate a price equal to more than 10% of my annual income, nice fellows but also competent in math so they politely declined. So I did what any bike struck Lynskey fan does, I called them to ask about layaway and discounts on past models, and I joined their FB page. For weeks I enjoyed the Lynskey FB friends banter and drooled over their fan photos, admittedly at times I was even envious. I was curious about my chances for finding a frame on craigslist, so I called Lynskey to find out how many Cooper CX bicycles they produced in 2011 (it was less than 300), that day was July 12th moments later I noted on their web page a link to win a Cooper CX... 
The competitor had a 2 week head start and lulled at 169 votes. Since I joined the race he's mounted his bike again and has been drafting off of me. We are approaching 1,000 likes, my lead was 200 yesterday, a false finish revealed that he's holding reserves for the final push. The finish line is now June 1st, it will be noon in his home country and 5 AM here in MN, so please help me sprint to a lead of at least 400 likes tonight by messaging friends with this link: http://www.facebook.com/lynskeyperformance/posts/346794778729064 

On another note the other rider seems like a really nice guy who travels around with an under-appreciated blog. If he wins he promises to dedicate his next blog as he rides around NZ to a nonprofit. His blog mentioned that he broke a Lynskey Mt Bike frame in a race so he must be a fellow avid cyclist ergo a good fellow. His link (the link of my competition) if you should so decide to like it is: http://www.facebook.com/lynskeyperformance/posts/299045600192076 Note he is not related to Lynskey purveyors of fine bicycles despite his last name."

As the title suggests, I'm considering a move to the US. I'm a 27 recent-ish graduate with a BSc Biology (Uni. of Brighton) and a MSc Environmental Science (double from Uni. of Copenhagen and Uni. of Vienna) with a 6 month contract at a marine research institute and a couple of papers under my belt.

Seeing as I only have 6 months experience (+3 month internship at a forestry based company) and a 1 year gap on my CV - I'm interested in entry level positions. Also, residency is not a problem as I already have a green card. 

With highish rates of unemployment in the US, is it even worth (for a European) trying my luck over there? Would my MSc hurt my job chances with my lack of experience? How do you find out about smaller consultancies in such a large country? I'm very flexible geographically and will go to where the jobs are whether they are in central NYC or rural Alaska.

I'm calmer now, I feel like I've got a good argumentation for doing this, while before I was a bit unsure whether it was a good thing to try and I just felt bad every time I masturbated. I feel like I've received a cognitive sediment.

The first two weeks I didn't really experience any physiological changes. I just paid more attention to my body in terms of fatigue and making sure I slept enough. The third week I started feeling some itching down there, I got the feeling that my penis was getting bored (it actually itches hehe). I discovered the IAMA reddits from pornstars and I started reading every one of them. This really allowed me to put porn into context and increase my respect for pornstars. I especially like the testimonies about sex in personal relationships (both from male and female pornstars, and their partners). That world is much less promiscuous then I had expected and many actors appear to treat it very professional. It helped me because I was able to dissociate these women's acting on screen from how they truly are. I also discovered what pron lacked and why I would never find it in there, as much as I would like to. Although I took a risk here (could've turned me into smiley like snap) it really helped me view porn for what it is, and clearly dissociate it from what I want!

I don't know what will happen in the coming days and weeks, but I welcome it. I also started talking to this girl who was my intern for a while, and with whom I never felt so comfortable. Even though she's got a boyfriend I really don't care about that, she'll just have to turn me down. I don't think I would've ever tackled such a situation like this in the past.

At any rate, despite the deluge of the weekly traveling carnivals this month (especially Dice and MBE), the well really has run dry.  It's even worse if you are part of a job development program where you are by contract suppost to come up with at least three job leads per week.

You know things are getting really bad when you go to your preferred job category on Craigslist and seeing as how today is July 31st, there are still jobs from earily June and Late May on the first page.

Local employers need to know that posting a job lead on Craigslist is FREE in the St. Louis market.  In places like New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Chicago, there is a fee. But in smaller markets like St. Louis, employers are not charged anything.

I'm verily disgusted at this point as to the amount of internships being posted on SimplyHired, CareerBuilder, Monster, and all the other sites Indeed.com aggregates jobs from.  I mean, really?

Companies have dropped the ball here. There's a hurry-up-and-wait attitude going on where they want EXPERIENCED interns. ""We want someone with 5+ years experience. We're not going to pay them anything. We're not going to train them, they'll have to pay for that. We're not going to hire them until they pay for training at which afterwards we'll be wishy-washy about hiring new applicants.""  These are the jobs you neec to stay away from.

If employers aren't committed to hire anyone and the job developer is breathing down your neck to coerce you to work at a McJob when you are trying to move on to the next step after college, it really really isn't you.

Unless you had plans on a corner office in Malibu and making millions of dollars per minute (which if you are, post some jobs and share the wealth), you probably have some reasonable expectations.  Those just be having a steady job that pays the bills and feeds the kids.

Right now, the job market is an arid wasteland.

I don't know, perhaps we need to start shaking down companies for jobs, especially the ones that promise jobs on their website when your goal at the job fair is to find work on the spot, especially after getting all dressed up in clothes you can't afford, finding a printer cartridge you can't afford for a printer that probably doesn't work, to meet some folks who are not committed to meeting you after driving in the car you are barely making payments on.

As unemployed people, we must take a stand at this point. We can't wait for someone to start hiring after the next presidential election and we sure as hell won't stand for people who stop hiring over a healthcare bill or some other law or regulation that ensures employers get off their asses and hire someone.

If employers want to play politics with jobs, they should quit the business they are doing (and we do mean quit, non of this Romney ""emeritus"" crap, I mean put the company out of business) and run for Congress.  Eventually they'll learn a hard lesson that they may be a great business person but they don't know a damn thing about how to represent people in a government.  So go ahead and get it out of your system, all the John Brunners, David Spences, and especially ED MARTINS.

When the election is over for you and your unemployed, we're not going to let you take your job back until we see you eat some crow and call people in for job interviews.

The well has run dry. The summer is getting too hot. And the unemployed are really thirsty and tired of being offered water from the toilet.

Let's tell these guys at the job fair on Friday that TOMORROW IS TOO LATE!

I'm thinking of calling for a sitdown strike at the convention center for everyone who leaves empty handed and has not found work within the past month.  It's time to get the attention of the employers. "

My job is 10min away from my parents house.
I am allowed to live in my parents house for 2 years while I make some money. 

**Current Status**

 * I have no debt 
 * receiving ~6.5k$ from my parents 
 * I have had a credit card for 1 year and paid it off each month only going to ~1/3 of its limit each month.
 * Have used car that is completely paid for  
 * On parents health insurance till 26(I have to pay the deductibles)

**Expenses if live with parents**

* 1/3 of the utilities 
* 1/3 of the groceries my parents buy(this is what I will be eating)
* Car insurance &amp; gas
* 1/4 of the phone bill(on family plan)


I might get another job offer where my gf goes school for ~75k. This job is in the city so a higher cost of living.  I would be able to live in my gf's apartment till December(when she graduates) for $242 rent plus 1/4 utilities. My gf has ~$10k in student loans that her parents said they were going to pay for until now.  We plan on getting married as soon as both of us have jobs. GF currently works in retail for minimum wage and $90/month on food stamps. 

I would like to help my gf out on her last semester to focus on her grades and getting a job, instead of working retail. I told her try to get a part time internship for work experience(paid or unpaid). I would like to give her enough money to pay for her share of the rent ($242 rent plus 1/4 utilities if i live there or $362 plus 1/3 utilities if I dont live with her). I would like to also give her enough money to do one fun thing a month (~$20).  

We both plan on going back to school in ~2 years to get our MBA and would like to start saving for that.

**Questions**

* Is giving her this much money doable? smart?
* Which job would be better from a financial situation since higher cost of living plus having to pay rent?
* Should I start saving to pay off her loans(no interest till 6 months out of school)?
* What type of savings accounts, bank accounts, retirement plans should I set up?
* How much money should I be putting where?
* My parents are buying a new car for themselves and are extremely good at paying the bills on time and don't have a shortage of money. Is there anything I could do, like co sign to help increase my credit score?"

Help?",[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/xgbt1/dumb_accounting_intern_about_to_go_into_an/,"EDIT: Thank you everyone! To those that stated the obvious, from now on, I'm hoping to get my shit together. To others who offered pieces of advice on how to gain more self-discipline and motivation, a thousand times thank you. At least I know that tomorrow will be a learning lesson, either way.

Hey r/accounting,

I'm a summer intern at a corporate firm, and I love it a lot. The people are great, the environment is just right for me, and it's in tax.

Here's my problem: I've lost a ton of productivity. So far, the work they've been giving me isn't the most interesting. Instead of being the good intern and getting it all done ahead of time since it isn't very difficult, I keep delaying it. I keep finding excuses to do other stuff during paid time, like check my personal email, go on reddit, stuff like that. There's been also some late weeknights out with friends, and my boss has caught me falling asleep twice at my desk. Unprofessional on two counts now. 

(Currently, I'm able to post this because I'm on the mend from food poisoning, according to my doctor*. Took the day off and such.)

AND YES, OF COURSE I KNOW I MESSED UP. We've had meetings about it, and he's told me how unprofessional it is and I've learnt my lesson (or I thought I had). It's been going to bed early and coffee in the morning for a few weeks.

Yesterday, I was feeling terrible--probably from the poisoning--but I'd come prepared into work. I'd brought coffee, vitamin B12, everything to make me stay awake. I'd slept well... ish. Despite that...

I still either fell asleep or lost consciousness at my desk. I'm not entirely sure.

But he caught me again.

So now, I have a meeting tomorrow morning (should I feel healthy enough, I assume) with an HR rep and him, and you know what? This is reasonable evidence for me to be terminated.

How do I go out with my dignity intact (though I don't deserve it)? Or if I'm not going to be terminated, how do I try to avoid collateral damage?"

I am currently an IT Intern for a technology company. For the most part, I work with hardware and a lot of end user support, I don't get to do a lot in the way of work in networking, or servers, or really anything else a system admin does.

Recently, I have become a contractor for my company (and the IT intern at the same time, I'm splitting my time). My responsibilities at this contracting job are essentially to be the System Admin(for a company of 2-300ish employees). This is a great opportunity for me to learn a lot and look great on my resume for when I finally graduate college. But my problem is, [I have no idea what I'm doing](http://chzscience.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/funny-science-news-experiments-memes-dog-science-fuzzy-logic.jpg). There is one other ""IT"" guy at the company I'm doing the contracting at, but the responsibilities of System Admin kind of fell into his lap as the other IT people left the company. He has very little experience and expertise, he has just been making do with what he could and just trying to keep everything running. And I just found out yesterday, that he is leaving. So it is going to be me, 0 SysAdmin experience, working 20 hours a week at this company and now I'm losing my best immediate resource for answers. And to top it all off, they're infrastructure is horrible, so I'm trying to implements something a little more streamline and up to date (in the process of getting Spiceworks up and running).

Because I have very little experience with the responsibilities of a System Admin I'm completely lost. When questions pop up I can answer most of them and find most of them online. But my main problem is, I don't know what questions to ask, I don't know where to start, and I don't know what I should know, or try to learn.

I do have some great resources at the company I intern for, but I want to try and get as much help as possible.

Any advice or tips and tricks would be greatly appreciated! I really just don't know where to start.

**TL;DR** I'm being thrown into the fire of being a SysAdmin, I have Zero experience, and my best immediate resource is leaving. HELP!

me: 25 years old virgin female not waiting till marriage but until i find myself a healthy loving mutually fulfilling relationship with a great thoughtful guy.  working as a part time intern. muslim background but lived in the u.s for 10 years now.

him. 23 year old grad student also working as an intern at the same company. southern white preppy background with no previous history of dating someone ""brown"".

background:
so i met this guy through a mutual friend about a month and a half ago at an after work happy hour. i was in a relationship at the time and didn't think much of it when he casually said that i was ""a lovely pakistani girl"" and asked me for my number so he could ask me to hang out with him and our other friends. we did have a good conversation and i recall finding myself intrigued that even though he was a rich sheltered white preppy kid, he was passionate about the middle east and spoke farsi and arabic. i love intellectually curious people and certainly thought he was the kind of person i'd like to keep in my friendship circle.

two weeks later i was still reeling from my bf breaking up with me and met up with my friends for a farewell happy hour for an intern who was leaving for a new job. he was there and arrives late and finds a seat next to me.  we got to talking and in our drunken-ness flirt mildly back and forth. after a couple hours later everyone else leaves except for our mutual friend and his girlfriend and the boy and i. we decided to take the party to his apartment. once there he serves us wine and puts on amazing music and we sit back and hang out. sometime during the night he starts telling me how beautiful he thinks i am. i don't think much of it seeing as how he was piss drunk, and just laugh it off. he keeps telling me how gorgeous and beautiful i am. and just came on so strong. i was flattered and was very attracted to him as well but didn't indulge him too much. around midnight i tried i realized it was too late to metro home and he asks us to crash at his place. he gets me a pair of his pjs to change into seeing as how my work clothes were very uncomfy. i slip into his pjs and crawl onto his bed with a headache and wanting to sleep. sometime during the evening i find him curled up next to me and he starts kissing my neck...it feels great but i recall that he has a long distance gf. and pull back and tell him to stop.  he says that he isn't into his gf and she makes him so miserable. i say he should break up with him then. he says he wants to but he is so scared to hurt her and how it sucks breaking up with her. he tries to kiss me and i push him away. he says im beautiful and i say if he thinks so he should break up with his gf wine me and dine me and then he would even have a chance to kiss me. he stares at me and goes ""you're a good one aren't you?""

i turn around and fall asleep. in the morning the rest of us sneak out leaving him alone since he was deep asleep. the week that follows i recall being charmed and thinking he was sexy and wishing he was single. mid week our mutual friend IMs me to tell me that the boy broke up with his gf. i was horrified but he said it had nothing to do with me and was a long time coming. meeting me made him realize there were other women out there. a couple days later i get a text from the boy asking me if id be free to meet him for dinner/drinks after work.  i figure...whats the harm?

we meet for drinks/food. he is SO nervous. it is pretty evident he hasnt officially been on a ""date"" for a very long time. we have a pretty fun time and he regales me with stories about his crazy stunts from college. i find his boyish sense of mischief endearing and his intelligence mesmerizing.

needless to say we continue hanging out and after work. either getting drinks and/or dinner and then coming to his place to make out and cuddle. for fourth of july he hosts a party and invites me and says i should get to know his sister.i was nervous since it is WAAYYYY tooo soon for an official family meet but then was surprised how casual it was. 

a couple days later. he got sick and i cancelled our plans to watch star wars and insisted i drop off some soup. when i got to his apartment he was a bit aloof and more distant than usual.i was a bit put off but didn't want to jump to any conclusions. the day after he texts me saying it was very sweet of me to bring by soup. the following monday i texted him asking if he was free to hang out for a while that evening. he said he has some food at home and will be cooking. i go over and he prepares this lovely plate of bbq chicken with wine and hors d'oeuvres and cookies for dessert. it was pretty unexpected and i made sure to thank him for going all out. i slept over that night and in the morning he asked me to help him pick out his suit for work. after he insisted i stay as long as i like and shouldn't rush out with him. i browsed job boards on his laptop and munched on a pop tart before leaving two hours later. he texted me later that evening thanking me for the ""sweet"" thank you note i left on his table.

the week before he had asked if i wanted to go to the portrait gallery this weds after work. so come tuesday evening i text him to tell him that the gallery will be closed by the time we get around.he says he is on the phone and that it's ""lame"" that its closed. no mention of changing plans or canceling them.

weds evening i email him at work about if he still wants to hang out and do something else. he says he has had a bad day and was planning to just go home but i was welcome to join him. i get a bit irked at him canceling plans without having consulted/told me and say its okay and that we can reschedule. i do feel embarrassed and hurt for having been blown off so thoughtlessly.if i hadnt emailed him to inquire...would he have just left for home without letting me know plans were cancelled? i run into him in the lobby after and actually tell him that it wasnt cool that he blew me off last minute. he seemed aloof ""oh? you want to go to the gallery? lets go to the gallery!"" i was like...""weren't you listening? the gallery is closed"" and then i just say ""forget it. you're fine. its okay"" and say good bye and leave. 

i expect an apology text/call that evening seeing as how i was upset. but i dont get any. he doesnt contact me on friday either. when i ask him to get coffee at work he comes with but is pretty distant and aloof and makes no mention of future plans or apologizes for weds. 

sat afternoon i call him to ask whats up but he doesnt respond. i then call sunday but get no response either. i text him saying "" hi havent heard from you lately so just wanted to ask if you were okay"". he says ""sorry couldnt answer. having lunch with my folks. im ok how're you?"" i text ""oh thats good to know. im great."" he texts back ""good""

monday morning we run into each other at the printer. he makes a comment about my hair and then i ask if he is mad at me since i havent heard from him. he says ""no. why would i be mad at you? we're good"" and then says he has to go to the bathroom and says ""See you around the office"" without making any indication of hanging out.

at this point i stop contacting him and realize he isnt going to text or call or come by my desk to initiate a date. its been three weeks now since the initial cancellation of plans on weds and im not sure if i should pop by his desk to ask to meet up and ask him what happened.


what did i do wrong? did he lose interest or does he think i lost interest or am mad at him for being too tired to hang out? im so confused and any insight would be so helpful

I have gotten myself into a bit of a situation and am not sure how to proceed. And I apologize for the length of this post.

Background: I'm a 21F at uni, I have had only one LTR, which was through high school and beginning of college, and have now been single for almost 3 years.

I only have a few very good friends, one of whom is a few years older than me and is in grad school. Her name is Abby. Abby and my older sister Shania and I are all good friends. Abby has made some pretty cool new friends in grad school, one of which is a guy named Peter. At first, Shania told me that she thought Peter and I would be great together, we have many of the same interests, both goal-driven, fun, etc. So one night Abby and I go over to Peter's to play some video games. There are a few other people there but it's a pretty small get together, so Peter and I really get to chat and get to know each other. Things start to get flirty, but before anything serious, Abby says its time to go and we go back to my apartment.

Peter and I talk a little bit here and there but with finals we're all pressed for time. After finals, I come back to my apartment to find Shania, Abby, Peter and one of his friends drinking and playing board games. I join in and am having some fun when Shania starts texting me saying Peter and I are a no go because Abby likes Peter. I am obviously dissapointed but decide to lay off any claim because I want my friend to be happy. Everyone ends up pretty smashed and passing out around my apartment. When I get drunk, I often start compulsively cleaning my place. So I start clearing up and Peter, who's still awake, keeps talking to me and helping me out. Finally, he starts tickling me, one thing leads to another, and we end up making out on my kitchen floor. I ran to my room later and he slept on the couch.

Next morning, I had to work so I left early. I was very confused as I was obviously excited that a guy I liked had kissed me but also guilt that I now knew my friend Abby liked him. Well, that night we were all going to a big party over at Peter's. I knew that I should tell Abby what happened. But I didn't. She came over to pregame with us before and I just couldn't get the words. I'm a cowardly chicken shit, I know, but I didn't.

So we head over to Peter's (mind you, I have no pre-conceived intention of hooking up with Peter). I meet a lot of Abby's new grad school friends and have a generally great time. After a couple of hours of drinking, Shania comes over, looking slightly peeved, and saying that she's taking Abby home. Drunk me didn't catch on and and said ok, see you tomorrow! Night went on, I ended up staying over at Peter's.

Next morning I head home and the shame of what I did hits me. I pulled such a shitty move on my friend. But before I could talk to her about it, she moved home for the summer. Peter wanted to continue talking, but I wanted to talk to Abby first. So then I moved home, Abby, Shania and I are all from the same town. We were all so busy with internships, and my mom got married, that I didn't get to talk to her for a month. By that time, I assumed Peter had moved on. Abby and I talked, I apologized profusely, explaining what a shit friend I had been and we moved on. She said that she hadn't been in love with him but that it was more of a curious crush, thinking maybe something could happen later down the line.

Fast forward two months. I have a few weeks before I head back to school when I get a text from Peter. He says that I should come up to school early for a weekend. I'm a bit surprised as we hadn't talked in two-three months.

So, what can I do? I still like Peter and I think he may still like me. But I don't want to hurt Abby again, she is one of the few good friends I have.

TL:DR: Female friend introduces me to new male friend. Develop crush for said friend. Find out female friend has crush for male friend. Hook up with male friend anyway. Make up with female friend. Now what?"
xg9fo,2,2012-07-31,Time to join fapstronaut camp for real...,[deleted],NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/xg9fo/time_to_join_fapstronaut_camp_for_real/,"I've been lurking NoFap for about two weeks now and have decided it's time for a change. I'm 31 and have been fapping for probably 15 years now, many times a day. The biggest thing that bothers me about that is how many hours I've spent looping around the whole PMO cycle. It's an incredible waste of time. I feel fortunate that I haven't encountered any of the other issues that seem to be associated with PMO, such as social anxiety and ED. I'm lucky that I have any sex life at all, considering how much fapping there was in my life. I'm starting to realize that I've given up on a lot of relationships just so I could move on to the next sexual encounter, and it's starting to get ridiculous. I'm certain P has a lot of do with that. Also I'm still able to have good sex, I just know it could be way better. It's a rare occasion that I can get hard without being touched.

The only memory I have of engaging in a period of NoFap was about a decade ago when I was on an internship. I went maybe a month to six weeks without fapping. Coming here gave me a name to what I was experiencing during that time: flatlining. The thing is, I loved it. Having no sexual urges at all was amazing. That may seem ridiculous, as flatlining here seems to cause panic, but I have to say, I'm actually looking forward to it again. Sadly it didn't take long til I was back to fapping, and I can't think of a time since where I didn't go a few days at a time without.

Fast forward to a little over a week ago. I did NoFap for three days, usually about the length I go before I want to cave in. Ended up in bed with an ex and had some fumbling, drunk sex for a few minutes before we both just kind of gave up and passed out. The bummer of this was as soon as I was in, I instantly was ready to O. This was something I haven't experienced ever, and it kind of made me worry about NoFap. The next day I ended up PMO about 3 times and restarted my clock. Again, 3 days go by and PMO. Although I was bummed out, I realized something: in a span of 6 days (now a week) I only PMO'd on two of those days. For me, that's pretty good. I think I also learned that, the way I am, if I'm going to do this, I may need to do the first 90 days without sex. 

So now here I am today, at another day one, but now with a badge and an actual presence on the site. It's going to be really painful having to reset that badge, so as silly as it sounds, I think that will be a motivator. I'm committed to an initial goal of day 7 and getting that testosterone boost. I think feeling something will be helpful.

Thanks for listening/reading, and I hope that I can eventually be as motivational as the rest of you have been to me. Fapping is literally the one thing in my life I feel is a flaw and would love to finally get rid of it. Oh, and for posterity...

TL;DR: I fap a lot and have for a while so now I'm going to try not fapping."

She said that she hadn't been in love with him but that it was more of a curious crush, thinking maybe something could happen later down the line. 

Fast forward two months. I have a few weeks before I head back to school when I get a text from Peter. He says that I should come up to school early for a weekend. I'm a bit surprised as we hadn't talked in two-three months. 

So, what can I do? I still like Peter and I think he may still like me. But I don't want to hurt Abby again, she is one of the few good friends I have. 

TL:DR: Female friend introduces me to new male friend. Develop crush for said friend. Find out female friend has crush for male friend. Hook up with male friend anyway. Make up with female friend. Now what?"

xg5w7,3,2012-07-31,Funding: how can one become a competitive candidate? (x-post from GradAdmissions),dutchesse,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/xg5w7/funding_how_can_one_become_a_competitive/,"For some background: I applied to UW-Milwaukee earlier this year for a MS in Anthropology and was accepted. I had to turn down the offer because my father didn't agree to co-sign my loans on top of my student loans and the chances of funding were not likely.

So, I've decided to pay off my loans a bit further and see if I can build more research experience and potentially raise my GPA/GRE scores a bit. But in order for me to accept admission to anywhere (assuming I'd get accepted), I need funding so that's why I'm posting this here. I'm using myself as an example, but really, any tips or any kind of words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated.

My stats:

* **GPA:** 3.1/4.0--I graduated from UW-Madison which is a leader in the subfield I'm interested in. I intend on raising this and building my academic strengths by taking a statistics course and a biology course or two.

* **GRE:** (old scores): 630V (91%), 500Q (27%), and 5.0/6.0 (84%). I intend on retaking it to raise my quant score because it is embarrassingly low.

* **Research experience:** field school (top of the class), original research project (which I'll be presenting at an academic meeting in September), and lab work in a neuropsych lab

* One of my LOR writers is an expert in the field and another is pretty well known too.

I'm going to be applying for a paid internship where I'd like to get further work for a year. Then, apply to UIUC and a few other places. But in order to do so, I really, really need funding.

With that said, what makes a candidate very competitive for funding? Is it the entire package or what in particular do schools look for when providing funding to entering students?"

I will be applying for a winter internship/co-op during the fall while also taking courses. I'm wondering whether I can include the subjects and material covered in these courses on my resume. The problem is that although I do not know the material very well right now, I will know it by the time I begin the internship. However, I also don't want the interviewer to start grilling me on these subjects since after all I will be still currently learning them. The reason I want to include them is because I want a job in those areas (low-level/embedded software) rather than another web-dev job.

How can I include material I am currently learning on my resume?
Do 3rd year co-op/intern interviewers generally ask hardcore coding questions and will they grill me on this material?

Edit: Can I also include a personal project (I am making a video game over summer) even if it is not yet complete and may not be complete by the end of the interview?"

I've been out for a little over 4 years now (celebrated 4 years in May) and the other day I was with my sister (who's still active) and we saw my old Elder's Quorum President in the store. It's been a long time since I saw him last, probably a year or so, and in the past he would come up and we'd have a good chat about what was going on in each other's lives. This time though he just said a quick hello and sort of scurried off.

I asked my sister what was up with him and she told me when I quit the EQP told her I would be back soon. I would lose the spirit, my blessings and be miserable and that I would return, repent and carry on. She said as time went on my life got better outside the church, that he could tell from our talks that I was doing great and much happier out of the church than in the church. On the flip side he has stagnated in life, he's 28, still living at home, has no real direction in life, his goal of finding a wife has continued to fail, his only major accomplishment has been going on a mission while I've won national awards in my field of study and had a couple prestigious internships.

She said she thinks I shook his testimony and doesn't want anything to do with me now because I represent the biggest trial of his faith.

I don't really know if I feel proud or if I feel bad for him. Mostly I would just like to talk to him to see if I could inspire him to move forward in life, not anything church related. He was a good friend to me and fought hard to try to get me to come back. Although at the time it was annoying that he couldn't respect my decision to leave, I do know he only did it because he genuinely cared about me.

Anyway just a little something I thought I'd share from my post-mormon adventures."

She is working as a nurse still in training (nearly at the end of her 1st year) and was handling an HIV positive infected patient on blood-thinning meds.  

Anyhow, she had to remove a hollow needle/catheter from his arm and may have done this sloppy (or the result was unexpected), so some of the patient's blood splattered on her arm. This wouldn't had been too worse, but unfortunately she has 2 partially healed wounds on her arm and some splatters seemed to have dropped there aswell.  

Well, after that she cleaned up quickly and got taken blood, now awaiting test results, which should come back this friday.

As the title says, how high would you say is the chance that she has gotten infected? I may be wrong, but is it possible to actually diagnose an HIV infection after that short amount of time? If she is diagnosed with HIV positive, what are her chances? Well, I've often read that the earlier you are diagnosed the more beneficial it is for the patient. In what ways (since there is no cure yet...)?

On a sidenote: is it lawful that interns are allowed to handle (highly) infectious patients? I'm not quite sure on this, so Imay have to do a little digging.


Anyway, it's still not friday, so nothing is set in stone yet. I guess reddit is once again a vent for me. :|

I'm an engineering student looking to makret myself for internships. Last year I took quite a few notes and noticed that everyone was doing mostly the same thing, droping a resume shooting the shit, and moving onto the next booth. I decided I need to seperate myself from the fools who only go to school and have a 4.0 and not work full time to make ends meet. I'm going to do this by droping portfolios of my work instead of just a resume or CV like the others are doing. I've built a portfolio site and programmed solutions to most of the engineering bits of it, so in addition to the portfolio, I'm thinking of including a small flash drive with the executables and source on them inside the portfolio. I'm doing this based off of my time contract welding, I'd TIG 2 coke cans together infront of a prospect after they read my contract bid. It always worked.  

So 

Q1:    Is this a good strategy to make myself more attractive and ""pop"" compared to other candidates? 

Q2:    You guys market stuff, how do I do this the right way?"

So things were better up until this summer. She finally opened up to people, my personality rubbed off on her, and has made many new friends. The second half of summer I was selected for an overseas internship for my future career. I've been having the time of my life, but I have been missing my girl. We've been doing the sexy skype, post cards, etc. But she's been seeing my Facebook activity and noticed how much fun I've been having. 

For some reason, me being really outgoing depresses her. I try to comfort her and tell her that I love being in a relationship with her, but it almost feels like I'm being guilted for meeting new people and making the best of my life. I mean, this internship could get me a leg-up in my future career, which can mean a lot for us. 

I dunno, whenever I do talk to her or skype with her, she doesn't say much or seems bothered. I think I know what's bothering her, but I want her to say it. I need her to open up to me. I know she's depressed for me being gone, but I'll be back for her in the states in two weeks. I'm doing everything I can for her. 

Is patience all I really need for her, just to make sure she's doing okay? She is keeping herself busy with a part time job but doesn't seem to have a social life. I want her to be with friends. 

TL:DR - GF is having trouble adjusting with me overseas. Being depressed about me being gone, almost seems jealous about my shenanigans. "

One of my friends from high school went up to college the same college as me (coincidence) so we decided to room together during our 2nd year with 2 other people that we know. At the beginning of the year my friend (lets call him Sugar Sparkles from now on) would like to do talk to us all of the time and make plans with us. We got along perfectly. However, the 3 of us were not exactly happy with Sugar Sparkles because during freshmen year he planned on living with the track team he was a part of (before they kicked him off the lease) so he came to us at the last minute. I see this as his back-up plan. Then when we were looking for houses for our Junior year he decided to sign a lease with someone from his dorm from Freshmen year. Okay, whatever, we were expecting this. I mean he really didn't want to live with us the first time, right? Anyways this other person (lets call them Jackal...his facial bone structure is identical to one) came to one of our parties. Cool, I'm always down to meeting new people. Well, Jackal, invites a whole bunch of random ass people to our party (not cool, should ask the host first) then he proceeds to go to the fridge when he is drunk and eats all of the food. This is where I am starting to dislike him.



Fast-forward to spring quarter, Sugar Sparkles has proceeded to go out every Thursday, Friday and Saturday with Jackal (I like going out too but holy crap I do have priorities). I had this huge physiology exam on Friday (they were going out Thursday night) and Jackal brings 2 of his other friends. Okay, whatever, I dislike him but as long as Jackal and Sugar Sparkles are not too loud it is okay. Well, of course the music gets blasting so me and my other roommates put our earphones in to muffle the noise. They leave, finally at 11:30! Great! I did the usual where I texted Sugar Sparkles to call me if I am not awake he is too drunk to walk home and I will pick him up (I do this every time my friends go out). Wake up the next morning there is a mother fucking beer can that was opened purposely to be shoved into our toilet. Then there was piss in it too. So, Jackal or one of his friends must of done it. This is where I went from disliking him to me thinking he is the biggest douchebag around. 




Well, now I think Jackal is rubbing too much on Sugar Sparkles. The last 7 months Sugar Sparkles only wants to hangout with me when there is absolutely nothing else going on or nobody else can hangout. Then, he just keeps talking about how awesome Jackal is (all of Sugar Sparkle's stories involves Jackal. Every. Single. One) and how he can't wait to live with him next year and his 2 other friends. Gee, thanks. I invited Sugar Sparkles to go to lunch with me today (this is kinda where I drew the last straw). So, he came to the restaurant. I tried to talk to him but he barely responded. He is leaving for his internship tomorrow. I got him a Starbucks Gift Card (he is going to need the coffee) and a good luck card for his internship.




So redditors, I come to you. I really do like Sugar Sparkles and he has been a great friend to me in the past but I'm honestly just fed up putting all of the effort in to this relationship with barely any effort on his part. Even worse, I just feel like being a back-up friend is the biggest insult you can give to someone. I don't know if I should write a long letter and stick it with the card of all the things that Sugar Sparkles has done to piss me off recently (by writing a letter I can form everything I need to write, correct details and all of the other wrong this he has done to me and our other roommates) or if I should tell him to his face how much I have started to grown to hate him (where I risk offending him the most, possibly). I really want to stay good friends with him like in the past if at all possible but he really needs to put in the effort. Or am I just over-reacting/jealous that he has made a lot of new friends recently? I really do want him to be happy but not at the sake of my happiness too. Any advice on how to save this friendship if possible or what should I do? Also, does anyone know an assassin/ninja to take care of Jackal?



Sorry that is so long but I felt like I needed to put in a lot of details. Thank you very much reddit :) "

xfejg,1,2012-07-30,How do you REALLY ask for a raise? And any success/horror stories?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/xfejg/how_do_you_really_ask_for_a_raise_and_any/,"I'm 24 and have been working at my first ""real job"" for the past 15 months. My job is ok, I'm good at what I do, but I don't think I'm accurately compensated. Ive been promoted up from an intern in the beginning and now I help manage our new interns. I've received a raise, but not enough. 

On multiple occasions, I've heard how valuable I am to the company's owner and have taken on extra work, like writing sales pitches. Basically I'm at the point where I think I deserve a higher salary and I need to ask for it. I'm 99.99% confident they will give me one. But how the fuck do I ask for it and not look like a douche? 

My plan is to ask my boss for a meeting, layout the work I've taken on since my last raise, how much I value my position there, and that I'd like a raise in order to stay with with company. I'm not looking to give an ultimatum, but I'm not afraid to find another job. I assume I should stay away from mentioning that?

Also, any hilarious and/or mortifying stories of when you asked for a raise would be great. I need a confidence booster."

(x-post from r/sysadmin)",joe772,networking,https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/xfcl7/network_engineers_of_reddit_am_i_going_about_all/,"Hi. I'm currently going into my junior year of college, in an IT program. I'm doing a double concentration in Networking and Security with a minor in Business Administration. By the time I graduate, I should have:

* CCENT/CCNA/CCNP
* Security+
* RHCSA RHEL5/ RHCE RHEL6
* IPv6 Silver Forum Seal
* 1 Microsoft Cert (Not sure which one)


I will also have had 1 semester minimum of required internship, as well as any other internships/coops that I can get. On top of all of that, I am in the top 5% of my class, consistent Dean's List, as well as founder/president of one of the east coast's top eSports clubs. 

I was just curious, do you think I will be in a good position when I graduate? I know that experience is a really big factor in everything, but just going off my degree, the certs I'll have, and the expected internship experience, how do you think I will be? Any chance someone might possibly know a round-about number for a starting salary?

I look forward to being able to contribute more into this subreddit soon!

We both started working at the same company two months ago. We work in different departments. I just graduated and started a full time job while he's there for a summer intern ship. We met in the lobby while waiting for our prospective boss to come get us the first day. At the time that was the last time i thought i was going to see him. 


Well as the first week went by i looked around but never found him. The second week comes and all of sudden i notice him walking by my cubicle multiple time day during the week. 

This keeps up for 2 weeks until one day I was walking out of my cubicle as he was walking by. So i stopped and say hi and we chatted as we both walked to where we needed to go. 

A few days let we become facebook friends. Two days after that he was walking by my desk and stopped to talk to me. I mentioned how i really wish i could remember to download spotify at home so i could use it at work.

An hour later i get a chat message from him with a link to his cloud where he had downloaded spotify. We chatted for awhile. 

Since then we stop and talk when we see each other. We chat via facebook a lot but I have to start it usually. He will start the work chat messages normally. He is constantly suggesting movies and music for me to listen too.  

He has mentioned wanting to go to lunch with me but was busy with a deadline. Well last week i didn't bring my lunch so i asked him. He already had plans to meet up with a friend but invited me along. Which it turned his friend and i went to the same college. Which he stopped the conversation to turn it back towards him. Later that day he walked me out.

Now granted his internship ends really soon. Dating would be possible because he goes to school only thirty minutes away. So i could/would be possible. 

**TL;DR Met a guy at my first day of work. Not sure if he's into me or just being nice**

Not a great GPA, or anything really exceptional. Had an internship with an advocacy group but I didn't do to much/gain to much practical job experience.

I have been applying like crazy for about 2 months now, and I can not get any sort of job at all. 

I have had 2 interviews with Americorps, calls back from Starbucks and a security officer position, and I haven't gotten a job yet...

I feel like I am stuck, that I will never get a job, and it's getting pretty fucking depressing not even being able to get in ANYWHERE (even unskilled stuff).

I have another interview on Wednesday to be a server at a reasonably high end place. I hope (and feel like I should be able to) get the job, but I don't have serving experience, and I am worried I'm not even gonna be able to be a server.

Anyways, thanks for listening to my little pity-party story. Sometimes it just seems like I am never going to land any sort of job whatsoever, and it feels like a blow to my self-esteem.

edit: to make it clear, I'm reasonably optimistic about my long term options, it's just incredibly depressing not being able to get any sort of job in the mean time. I would like to move out of the small town where I am and get to a bigger city but it seems nigh impossible with everywhere turning me down."

xf577,1,2012-07-30,"Reddit, what have been your ways of getting sponsored or funded for something you didn't have the money for? ",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/xf577/reddit_what_have_been_your_ways_of_getting/,"

Background: Myself and my boyfriend would like to do an internship. 

First of all, we both have full time jobs and I am 6 months away from Graduating college and he has already graduated. The Internship is in December and we both have worked the past year and 1/2 to pay off all our debt. The only money we owe is about $9,000 and we are shooting to have that paid off my December, so saving money will be really hard to do while crunching back money to pay all of that off. We have both worked really hard to be responsible and we are looking for any type of organizations that would possibly help sponsor us or looking for any additional (legal) ways to make some extra money till then. Does anyone have any good ideas for this?

Go ahead and rule out family. I am the first person in my family to even make it to college and his family doesn't have the extra money either.

We both work over 40 hours a week.

The Cost of this Internship is approximately $8,000. The Internship would provide us with the knowledge and skills needed to Build and create superadobe structures. They are Eco-Friendly and a more durable and cheaper option than lets say a trailer. We are hoping to learn this material to bring it back to the Eastern part of the U.S. to help find better and safer options for living. 

Any creative or unique fund raising/sponsorship ideas that you have used in the past to help yourself out with a dream you had? 

Note: This is not a thread asking for money but asking for how you earned your money... "
