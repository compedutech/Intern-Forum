Job offer ""rescinded"" in 1 day",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/9q09n/do_i_have_a_case_job_offer_rescinded_in_1_day/,"I graduated from business school in April. I've been in the job market ever since. It's just been very, very tough. I might have applied to about 1000+ jobs. Anyway, so suddenly a few weeks back I got positive responses from 2 companies and scheduled interviews etc. Let's call them companies ABC and XYZ.

I got done with all the rounds of interviews with ABC, got an informal offer on the phone and then a formal appointment letter by email. The HR said she would FedEx a hardcopy that evening. I really thought all my worries were over and everything would now be fine, would be able to pay bills and student loans and life was good. 

Now, at this point I still wasn't done with all the interviews of XYZ. Since I really preferred ABC over XYZ, I wasn't even excited about my upcoming interview. I phoned the HR of XYZ and cancelled my interview saying I had accepted an offer with another company. Didn't want to waste anyone's time, plus I wasn't actually excited about XYZ.

Both these events took place the same day - i.e. got my offer in the morning and within an hour I cancelled my other interview. About 9 hours later, at around 8pm I get a call from HR of ABC saying that my appointment letter stands void because all the HR approvals hadn't come through. 

It's been 2.5 weeks now. I get no response from ABC (a well-respected company, not too big but with lots of promise) to all my emails. Company XYZ, no surprise, is not interested in talking to me anymore.

Fellow redditors, I am sure all of you know someone who is looking for a job now or has looked for a job in the recent past. Everyone knows how difficult it is to land an interview call and I read somewhere that job seekers exceed openings by a record ratio. I am so mad at ABC. I looked into their website and they've taken down that job posting. My contact in the company has no idea what is happening and doesn't want to get too involved. 

I'm wondering, if I don't hear from ABC in the next couple of weeks, can I sue them? Or am I being naive? My job offer from my summer internship was rescinded and somehow at that time such thoughts didn't cross my mind. Technically, it is the same as a job offer being rescinded but the SAME DAY makes a difference, right? In short, I cancelled my second interview because some idiot in HR of ABC just messed up. This is different from an offer being rescinded due to a bad economy.

Thoughts redditors. I am not thinking clearly now. Need help rationalizing."

We've been wanting to have a kid for several years but have put it off because we haven't been as financially stable as we like. We both went to college, and I went on to get a MBA. During this time we wanted to wait until I had a stable, decent job. Then the grand ol' recession happened. 

My wife currently has a job with limited insurance and income. It looks like (after several months of looking) a job is not impending in my immediate future. It's actually looking like I may need to go back to doing an internship just to keep my resume from getting too much white space. Very depressing. 

So it seems like it could easily be 1-2 years before I have a decent job. We really don't want to wait that long. We've considered private insurance (buying a plan through bluecross, etc) but they're expensive and I have sincere concerns they'd just try to screw us over if we got pregnant a month after getting the plan. 

Does anyone have recommendations? Good insurance plans for purchase? Alternative ways to limit the costs associated the having the baby? Think we should just keep waiting?

9qlkw,0,2009-10-03,The health care debate.,mei9ji,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/9qlkw/the_health_care_debate/,"Wow. Everyone has an opinion. How nice. How many people here are in health care professions? How many have actually looked at the bills and seen what they fund and how they work? I can't say I've done either but I can also say I don't try and spout a totally uninformed opinion based on what little I randomly hear and conviction I'm unsure of where they come from. I have taken some time to look at what is going on but I am far from an expert. 

It would be lovely if we could live in a society where people contributed and didn't need the incentive of money or other reward to keep them doing things. Unfortunately in such a society there would most likely be precious few janitors, trashmen, and other menial laborers to care for the necessities of continued society. While some say that means we should return to a ""simpler"" time, I disagree. We have an imperfect system, and as such we should take this into account when we propose fixes to this system. We already have socialized health care. Hospitals cannot refuse patients, however within a hospital any service outside of Medicine can refuse a patient. This means that many patients get funneled through a stressed system to be taken care of by a host of overworked staff. And these patients cost us thousands upon thousands of dollars because instead of being treated by a primary care physician, for say strep throat. They are now in the hospital taking up an unnecessary bed because they did not have access or take advantage of prior care. Now that it has gone untreated the patient now how Endocarditis, probably dying but might possibly be saved with extremely expensive care rather than a 10 day prescription of Penicillin. On the other side of the coin. We expect doctors to treat patients that they see, for what rate? Do you believe that the government will pay similar rates if they take over the health care system? Now many will argue that doctors are overpaid and who cares if they get a pay cut? What happens when there is little draw into medicine because it takes 4 years of college, 4 years of medical school, 3+ years of residency ranging up to and probably even passing 10 years for some specialties. Now, until residency most students will be paying anywhere from about 10k a year at an instate school to about 25k+ at a private school. Times 4. Now these students will apply to medical school. Another thousand or more into the system. Next these students will spend according to the AMA ""Annual tuition and fees at state medical schools in 2008–2009 averaged $23,581 for state residents and $43,587 for non-residents. At private schools, tuition and fees averaged $41,225 for residents and $42,519 for non-resident students. These figures do not include housing or living expenses. "" Again times 4. Now these lucky doctors will walk out and go into an internship making tons of money to pay off anywhere from about 150k to over 300k of debt. The average salary of the first year(specializing in Medicine) again according to the AMA ""Average resident/fellow compensation  	$45,788"". Now to some of you this may seem like a lot of money. Factor in living expenses taxes etc. it is mediocre at best, and you still have the mountain of debt you are carrying around. Now you are rewarded with a six figure salary once you do all this, but and here is a big one. IF YOU SCREW UP, OR EVEN IF YOU DON'T PEOPLE WILL SUE YOU. If someone is unhappy with their treatment and thinks you did something wrong, whether you did or not they can sue you. It will probably happen in your career. This means that the insurance you pay on it will go up. Looking at a particularly nasty(in terms of malpractice) specialty, University of Michigan's website ""Malpractice insurance premiums vary widely from state to state. Florida is the highest-premium state, with an average 2004 premium of more than $195,000, followed by Nevada, Michigan, the District of Columbia, Ohio, Massachusetts, West Virginia, Connecticut, Illinois and New York.

The 10 lowest-premium states are Oklahoma, at about $17,000 on average, and Nebraska, South Dakota, Minnesota, Indiana, Idaho, North Dakota, Wisconsin, Arkansas and South Carolina.

Many areas of the country, especially around major metropolitan areas, are experiencing large increases in the average costs of premiums. Between 2003 and 2004, Dade County in Florida, which includes the city of Miami, went from $249,000 to $277,000, an increase of about 11 percent.

In that same period, Cook County in Illinois, which includes Chicago , jumped about 67 percent from $138,000 to more than $230,000. Wayne County in Michigan , which includes Detroit, went up 18 percent, from almost $164,000 to nearly $194,000.""

Now continue with these numbers but let the government step in and decide to pay these doctors half of what they were before. Or not even as drastic, 10% less. What will it take to actually fund general health care, what will the government be able to pay for and how much will they pay? Will you have to ask your congressman for an expensive procedure? Will people want to go into medicine with all the constraints? Do you want the people that really want to help the sick? Or do you want the best and the brightest brought out by the idea of making money? Will medical schools lower their standards if fewer people want to go into medicine? 

One thing many people are looking at is a dual system. Have government health insurance that covers what it can. And private health insurance for faster, or more expensive, etc. health coverage. There are ideas out there requiring doctors to spend some time in a free or government sponsored clinic, maybe a day or so a week. 

Many plans have merit, but we must understand the system and what the changes we are proposing are going to do to that system before we start perturbing it. Otherwise it will be like driving a car blind making turns we feel are right rather than looking at the road and what pitfalls surround us.

I can't say I know any good answers to any of these questions but before you just spout off its good or its bad start to think about what we are really talking about."

I'm a female CS (omg we do exist on the intarwebz!) and linguistics double-major in my last year as an undergrad at a prestigious US university. The current plan is to apply to CS graduate programs to do work on natural language processing/computational linguistics, whichever title floats your boat. Information extraction/retrieval seems like a beautiful fit for me, given my particular set of interests.

My primary worry is that I'm only applying to PhD programs so that I can finally prove to myself that I really *am* smart--but not because I truly want to do research for the next 5 years. In the past I've done well academically (3.7 GPA), but have always felt like I've been ""faking"" my way through it. That being said, this past summer I had a really fascinating internship which really piqued my curiosity and interest.

Is this kind of academic insecurity normal? Should I be concerned or is this merely a quarter life crisis? Half of me feels like I'm over-reacting, but the other half thinks some time off would be good for me. What say you?

**UPDATE** (2/11/10): I applied anyway, figuring I could make the decision later and would only be out the application fees. Just got offered a spot at a good program with a great stipend and am not lamenting my decision to apply. Thanks again for all your advice!"

I have only really made your standard template Word resumes, and I figured since they were looking for someone with a basic understanding of design, I would use a more design based resume.  Does any one have any experience in it and have any pointers for things not to do?

Let me start by sending condolences to unemployed Redditors. Since I seem to have too many jobs send your resume to fckmyjob.temp@gmail.com if you live in Portland, OR and I'll see about sending it to whichever of these two companies I *don't* go with -- if you're qualified at least in my eyes.

So, here's the scoop: I recently graduated from university with a degree in Computer Science and I've been working a permanent job in support at a not-so-startup startup for about 6 months now. I had a chance to interview with a Fortune 100 company for a junior developer role about 4 weeks ago. I didn't get an offer -- everything went super well until my last interview in the loop which was with the VP...I ended up saying some really dumb stuff...but the director of the org and I got along really well. 

Anyway, he called me up a few weeks later and asked if I'd be interested in a dev contract at this Fortune 100. I initially said that I indeed would but I'm starting to get cold feet. It's strictly contract so there is no guarantee of work after the terms are up (6 months), but he did mention that if I prove to be good hopefully a perm. job would be open by then...or maybe if there was more work I could get back on contract with them...

Here's a breakdown of the ups and downs that I see:

**Positives**

* Biggest in my eyes: My support job makes me want to throw myself down a well
* Contract is with a Fortune 100 company with growth this year
* Really really want to work in development...in fact, all my previous jobs were in dev.
* Working with technology that I know very well and want to build a career on (.NET)
* Would get first-hand experience working at this Fortune 100 company and make some really good contacts within
* Would be making *lots* more money than I am now -- about $13/hr more
* Get to work better hours (currently working midnight-9:00am)

**Negatives**

* Only 6 month terms and *not* contract-to-hire
* Shit economy
* Current benefits are awesome! Health insurance, dental, vision, 401k, pretty good PTO, really great package.
* Girlfriend's internship is up at the same time as the contract ends. She is my roommate so there is a possibility that we would *both* be out of work at the same time.
* Current company is showing pretty good growth, possibility that the options I currently have would indeed be worth quite a bit one day...but also a Fortune 50 company has just entered our market so this might be moot in a couple months :)

I'm tired of thinking through this on my own, I would love to hear what your guys' perspective is on this!

So I'm a Junior/third year in Economics at McGill and I'm looking for a good internship for this summer.  I see myself hopefully going to law school after undergrad rather than continuing with Econ so I'd like to get something legal or political.  The problem is that I'm American so I feel like I don't really have any connections up here to help me find Canadian internships, and I really want to stay in Canada permanently after school, so a Canadian internship is what I'm hoping to find.

Some of my ideas:

* The first thing I did for US internship applications was to hit up my senators and representative for my state, so something like that in Canada (do MPs do internships?) would be cool.

* I'm taking Hebrew and I'm really into the language and Israel, so if there are any good Israel-related opportunities, that would be cool.

* I've lived in Canada for over two years and am ashamed to say that I've only been to Montreal, Ottawa and Thunder Bay…so something in Toronto or Vancouver would be really cool.  Ottawa would also be great, but maybe not Montreal, because even though my French is good, I'm not quite confident enough to handle a job that would be too French-intensive, I don't think.

Thanks so much for any ideas you have.  I tried our internship office but a lot of their openings were in the US too.  =.=  I'd love to hear some more Canadian perspective on what I can do up here next summer so I don't have to go south of the border again!"

In 2008 I got accepted to RIT for a MS in Computer Science.

I did alright the first few quarters, got A's in my ""Bridge"" courses and got by Discrete Math with an OK grade.  However I'm really struggling now.  I've gotten a D in my algorithms class, and just barely pulling C's in the core theory classes.  My GPA is dipping below 2.0.  I'm terrible at math and math theory which really sets me behind in the theory courses.

And the frustrating thing is through all this theory is that I've never designed an created a formal application, other than simple command line programs that output a correct solution for an algorithm or something like that, which means that my actual coding skills are very very week.

Because of this I'm unable to get co-ops and internships due to my lack of coding skills and dismal GPA and lack of overall experience

It's not from lack of effort, I'm in the lab 12 - 18 hours every single day busting my ass trying to complete my assignments on time.  I also spend a lot of time in the Tutoring Lab, but sometimes struggle getting it to sink in.

What I need to know here is if I'm completely fucked.  I'm sinking a ton of money in to this masters program and I don't want to just drop out of school, I really want a Masters degree. 

Has anyone been in a situation like this?  Would I have to start all over if I switched to an Information Technology degree?

Moved back home with my parents and have been commuting to NYC for work and hanging out with friends from home.

I've been an intern at this website for the past few months, getting a ton of experience.  Had a few job offers but I ultimately turned them down to pursue something I'd really like for a first job.  I am making a lot of contacts and have been talking to people in industries and at companies that I'd want to work in/for.  While the job hunt is frustrating, this internship is paying so I'm able to scrap by right now.

I've been hooking up with 3 girls (at the same and different times) but now all of that's over and I'm still single and having fun.  2 of them went back to college, one of them is 35! But to be honest, she's one of the most down to earth people I know.  She was very mature about making our relationship casual and fun.

I was working out for a while, but ultimately stopped.  I should get back on that exercise front, but I have been dieting better.

In case you were all wondering, I majored in Economics and Animation in college, and had a history minor.  I was also a serious college athlete so after working out ridiculously hard for the last 2/3rds of my life, I don't mind taking time away from exercising for now.

How do I handle the responsibilities of my job, without being stressed out every single day?",stressedout_itworker,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/9um7q/reddit_please_help_me_how_do_i_handle_the/,"I don't want to get into too many details, because my position is fairly specific, but I am a computer technician at the University Level, but am also in charge of a lot of University Purchasing, and also what amounts to being a retail manager all at the same time.

I started this job several months ago, and liked it because it allows me to interface with a lot of different people at different levels, from sales to support. The problem is that with the new school year, the workload is atrocious.

Right now, I have 14 repairs in transit. On top of that, I have been commissioned to facilitate and support a number of technology related workshops for the faculty, student, and staff of our University. I am also held accountable for tracking all of this in a CMS, which I am responsible for creating. I also manage several interns and give them day-to-day advice. I also manage a good amount of University Purchasing, and handle just about any and all administrative tasks.

My boss won't hire any help outside of my interns, who are there a limited amount of time, and have no interest in taking on any of my workload.

With everything I have to do, I don't have enough hours in the day. I rarely take lunches (For which I am admonished for, because I am an hourly employee), and every day I leave work with a stress induced headache. I even noticed hair falling out and my hairs are greying even quicker than before. I'm in my mid-20s. I came home this evening and slept for two hours, and that's why I'm now wake at 2am.

My boss's advice is to simply breathe. And to realize I can't help everybody. But he doesn't see it from a day-to-day perspective. I hate telling people NO, and frankly, most of the people I work with don't take NO for an answer.

And the pay is way less than what other repair technicians are making. I'd quit, but I live hand-to-mouth, paycheck to paycheck. So leaving right now would royally fuck me.

How can I not be so damned stressed out? I dread coming into work everyday, because there's always a storm brewing."

Unpaid internships. The epitome of exploiting labor. I'm still an undergrad, but I've been looking for a new part time employer. It's grown extremely frustrating. I have decent experience in a bunch of random office administration tasks (and design work, marketing work). Nearly 95% of these office internships are unpaid. And I understand, the economy is in the shitter.... BUT unpaid internships have been the case for years before this economic recession. Somewhere along the lines, internship positions being unpaid became acceptable among college aged kids.

It's the ultimate ""hanging the carrot on a stick,"" - walking for miles, days, weeks to get a measly fucking carrot. The thing is, it's not about the actual amount of pay - it's about getting some sort of pay. Minimum wage, while not preferable to many, should be the MINIMUM PAY for doing work. Not free connections. Not college credit. Not ""foot in the door."" 

Best of all, in many cases, it's fucking illegal - http://laborlaw.typepad.com/labor_and_employment_law_/2007/11/unpaid-internsh.html - and don't give me this ""College Credit"" bullshit. Seriously... secret time... this may be illegal... but all they fucking do to give you college credit is write a letter of recommendation and fill out a form provided by the college (at least this is how mine works). This can easily be forged. A 10 year old can forge it. Anyone with a computer and word processing software can forge it. And you work 20 hours a week for a minimum of 3 months for that shit? 

And don't tell me ""OH ITS TOO MAEK CONNECTIONS!!!!!!!11 NETWOKRING!!!!!1"" - GO TO A FUCKING MEETUP.COM EVENT FOR NETWORKING! GO TO A CONFERENCE! A MEDIA PANEL! YOU CAN MEET PEOPLE AT CONVENTIONS! SMILE, BE FRIENDLY! CONGRATS! YOU'RE NETWORKING... FOR FREE :D :D :D

I have a friend that has worked for at an internship for nearly a year now (he started in January). He is still unpaid. He has already graduated. He still goes. He enjoys it. He's not bitching. He thinks ""this is how it works."" This may be how it works now, but it shouldn't. He is a fool for accepting no monetary compensation for his time. He is a fool for thinking ""this is how it works."""

I am almost finished with my Masters (which doesn't matter to me at all), and on track to advance to PhD candidacy this spring. I'm officially in Cognitive Science, but practically I'm studying machine learning. I'm doing quite well by most standards : I have a few papers already as co-author, more in progress, and more funding than I can spend. I don't have to teach or take classes this year. My advisor is a dream; always supportive, never pressuring, and has all the right connections and knowledge. 

The biggest pressure is from my on again / off again girlfriend, and while that can fill a few threads of its own, for here I will just say that she constantly reminds me that I'm not where I could be in life right now, and that I could be making six figures easily, which is true. I was a CS major at CMU. 

Part of the problem is that I'm trying to deal with Southern California, which even as one of the better-paid students in my department, is hardly survivable at my stipend level. 

At this point, I like the work and doing research, but I am feeling stifled socially, and am really sick of grad students, but I'm watching my expenses so tightly even a burger and beer can feel like a stretch. Its not really possible to have a social life under these circumstances. 

So I'm thinking of either taking on consulting work, or just leaving for good. I've had a few interviews but never really took them seriously, and I've been so focused on academia for so long I'm missing things like internships in industry (opting to work in labs over the summer for research experience). I'm interested in consulting, but I have no idea what to do : I have a very specialised and particular set of skills in machine learning which are my most valuable asset, and while I could get a job simply programming or doing web development, I am not sure that I'm best suited for that, or that I can even be competitive, i.e. I don't think finding stuff on rentacoder.com is going to work for me.

Hey Reddit,

Since I didn’t feel like going to the bar across the street tonight.  I’m feeling very introverted.  So you all get to play bartenders.  Prior to the last 3 years my romantic life was f’ed up. 

My previous serious relationship lasted for 8 years.  4 of which were in a marriage.  This was with my high school sweetheart.  Whom at the time was a smoking hot Latina.  I would have done anything for this chick.  Yeah, I'm a sucker who got burned.  It happens to the best of us.  It was some fucked up stuff out of a Springer show.  One of those things that when you’re watching the show and you’re like that shit wouldn't ever happen to me - it does.  I didn't see the divorce coming.  But she had been planning it for months.  When I acknowledged that we had some relationship issues I was down for going to counseling.  Which she asked me to go - I agreed.  A month after counseling she told me that she had a big secret to tell me.  We need to separate, cuz she thinks she's gay and needs to move on in her life.  Of course she tells me this after I took out a big loan on my own credit for her own business six months before.  She tells me that chicks have been turning her on for a long time.  And demands a divorce because she needs a new life.  This shit continues to fuck with my mind 4 years later. I went to see a counselor for a while.  Then couldn't afford it and stopped.  The worst thing is that lez porn no longer turns me on.  Sad, I know. LOL Not my fault.  It's just life.  Anyways, enough with this dreary trash that I had to experience.

My life has improved.  I took a better, higher paying job since this whole experience and have recently received a raise and a promotion.  Most importantly I paid off this crazy bitch's debt.  I have the support of my friends and family and a good life.  And have also been putting myself back out there. 

 I found this great gal who is gorgeous and also has a brain.  Knew her from back in the day and reconnected on FB.  Seems like a rarity too find these days! Bimbos are a dime a dozen here in LA.  The big issue at hand is she's on the east coast and I'm in Cali.  We've been doing a long distance thing for a year now.  I go out there, she comes out here.  Last time I saw her it was this summer for a month.  This is my 1st serious relationship since the above bitter breakup.  She is finishing her PhD out there.  When we 1st started seeing each other we agreed to see where things would go.  Originally she agreed to moving out here and I in turn said I was open to the possibility of moving back east.  The issue now is she has mentioned she is no longer open to moving out west.  She wants me to move east.  Her reasons are school, family, and so she can intern there.  She’s also making promises when it comes to the longer term if I move out. Which came as highly unexpected.  We still are really interested in each other.  She’s coming out here in a week and later next month too.   Part of me wants to go for it and part of me wants to play it conservative. I don’t want to give up my life for someone else.  Already did that shit and it sucked.  If I went for it I would continue to wait out the economy for a bit.  I’ve had so much good happen to me that I’m crazy fearful of getting pissed on again.  However, I have feelings for this girl and we really get along well.  Plus she's not immature.  A big +. So reddit, what would you do?  I would appreciate the brutal honest advice from my fellow redditers.  Ask me anything

I have had 2 roommates in my life, one in college and one that I lived with for my internship. The internship roommate just fell out of thin air and offered me a place to live (my boss knew her and it just so happened that she needed a roommate) No searching required. I know I won't be able to afford it without a roommate. 

What the hell should I do? Where should I look? What do I need to think about? There's way too much for me to do alone and my head is spinning.

I'm from Germany (Stuttgart) and in my last year of my master's degree in a study that's called ""Computer Science and Media"" (software engineering, with a little bit of web+cellphone development, mobile networks, ...).  I will have to start writing my thesis in March/April 2010.
Usually, students in a ""University of Applied Sciences"" in Germany write their thesis at a company, researching a given problem and implementing a solution. The Thesis is, most of the time, a documentation of this process with some background information.

Seeing as my University doesn't have any problems with students going abroad during that time, I'd like to do my thesis in the US (Boston for personal reasons).
Seeing as the concept is pretty uncommon in the US, I'd be probably best of looking for matching internship to earn some money and hopefully combine my thesis with the topics of the internship.

It seems kinda hard to find a structured list of IT companies in the Boston area (or matching internships). I worked in large IT companies ever since my freshmen year and I'd also be interested in working for a smaller company.  
My two biggest interests at the moment are: Software scalability and the Ruby programming language, but I'm always open to new topics.  
Some random buzzwords of stuff I've worked with so it's easier to recommend companies:  
ruby, java, security, scalability, linux, infrastructure (dns, ip, apache, nginx, vmware, switches, wlan, active directory, ...), webscraping, ... (for more stuff, see my homepage).  
My current job involves virtualizing the build process for a smalltalk tool that generates embedded c code.

Any recommendations?
Thanks!

I've worked in tele-sales in some form or another for my entire professional life, and I hate it. I loathe it, I despise it. I hate cold-calling, I hate trying to convince people to buy something, give money, or accept a call from someone else, at least over the phone. I hate interrupting people, I hate being hung-up on, and I hate being brushed off. I need something else to maintain my sanity.

Thing is, I've officially run out of ideas as to what to search for. I thought I could move to a career in development for non-profits or performing arts, which Philly has no shortage of, but I can't even get an interview. I suspect this is because tele-fundraising has as much to do with proper development as LOGO has to do with programming in Assembler.

Whatever I do, it really needs to pay around $30k so I can maintain my barely adequate financial standing. I'm barely making enough money now, as-is. I tried going back to my second job doing tele-fundraising, but I lasted a week before illness sidelined me. I'm barely well enough to do my day job, and that's not paying enough because I'm not making my goal.

Please, please, PLEASE do not suggest volunteering, unpaid internships, or anything that will reduce my already poor income. Ways I can get better at my current, shitty job would be useful, but I don't want to do sales any more. I never wanted to.

So, I'm officially at my wit's end, and out of ideas.

I'm part of a program on campus designed to help people get into grad school. Last year I was offered a chance to do an internship abroad. I talked to my mentor in this grad school program about the opportunity but said I was worried about the cost. She said it would be no problem, and said that she could get me 8k to help cover the costs (it was a 6 month internship that paid almost nothing). So, with her help I filled out the paperwork (it wasn't approved by the time I left, but I had no reason to believe that it wouldn't be, she had done this before for several other students) and left for my internship. I come back 6 months later with 10k in debt on credit cards thinking its no big deal since I'm going to get the 8k, and I can pay of the remaining 2k with my financial aid. 

Well, that's when I get the bad news: my mentor has been reassigned to another position due to her mismanaging funds. She was giving out grants that the program wasn't authorized to give out (like grants to help pay for overseas internships), and my paperwork was denied. Blinded about how bad I was in over my head, I tried to pay down the debt myself. The 10k turned into 15k (couldn't afford the payments, had to use the credit card to pay for living expenses. Its a VERY bad cycle I let myself get into.)

I need to do something to get a handle on my finances. The 15k is spread out over two cards, 9k on one, 6k on the other. I am thinking about calling my credit card companies and letting them know that I can no longer afford the monthly minimum payments (it's about $450 combined). What I can afford is about $100 per month total.

Has anyone here done something like this before, or know how the process works? Is there any advice or things I should know before I do this?

9yd8m,2,2009-10-27,What You Can Do To Influence Congress About HC Reform and Beyond- Tips From the Inside.,[deleted],politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/9yd8m/what_you_can_do_to_influence_congress_about_hc/,"There's been a lot of posts recently asking people to ""Contact X about Health Care.""  I thought I'd give some tips.  Since I worked in a Congressional office for a while, I know how stuff gets handled.
    
1)  **Only write/call your own representatives.**  Elected officials only care about their constituents, and no one else's.  Under the Constitutions, you're represented by 1 person in the House, and 2 in the Senate.  Everyone is represented equally in this regard (except for people in DC).  Therefore, ALL Members of Congress ignore you if you're not from their district.
    
2) **Be Brief.**  You're call/letter will be taken by either a low level staffer or by an intern.  Members of Congress don't have the time or interest to read or listen to you.  They employ others to do it for them.  You're comments will be summarized as ""X person is for against Y issue.""  Do briefly explain why you take your stance, Any further elaboration is a waste of your time and the time of a low-level worker in the office, who has no impact on policy/voting decisions.
    
3) **Tell them your name and where you live**  This lets the office know if you're from their district or not.  Many offices send you an official response.  Don't worry about junk mail.  Every office is limited by law as to how much crap they can send you by mail.
    
4) **Calling and writing DOES make a difference**  Everyone in Congress wants to get reelected.  It is their job to represent their district too.  Although MoCs don't read their mail, they DO pay close attention to tallies of people for and against a certain piece of legislation.  So, you gotta clearly state your stance on the issue.
    
5) **Call or Write about stuff that is actually being debated/voted on**  MoCs don't care about your opinion if there's nothing being done on the issue.  If you call today about ""marijuana legalization,"" no one will give a crap because there's no legislation on it.
    
6) **If you want to personally contact someone you have two ways**  Campaign and Congressional events are your best bet as an individual.  No one will personally meet 1-on-1 with you are with some sort of organization.  Therefore, you should go to events on your own.  If you like the person- VOLUNTEER for them on some level.  You'll eventually get to know that person.
    
7)  **If you have a question, Google/research it first**  Offices are not good at answering questions, especially if they're detailed.  They'll mail you an official response of a MoC's stance on an issue.  If you want to know more- figure it out on your own.  You'll save some time and get a better answer.
    
8) **If you want to talk about multiple issues, call/write about them separately**  This makes sure that all your stances are recorded individually.
    
9)  **Still state your support on issues to people you DO like.**  99% of everything that a MoC gets is against something.  This summer, Congressmen (on both sides) were told 99% percent of the time that either a. ""I'm against HC reform"" or b. ""I'm against you for your stance on HC reform.""  *Guess what happened- HC reform stalled.*  Very few people in support of something or someone actually contact their MoCs, so MoCs only hear the opposition to things.  As a result- Congress gets little encouragement or positive reinforcement to do anything that have support, and instead are pressured to not do unpopular things.  
    
10) **If this isn't good enough for you, get someone else elected.**  Don't like your MoC, then work to get someone else elected who shares your views.  Voting is important, but volunteering and donating to other candidates can do much more.  You get one vote for yourself.  For every person you get to vote for your candidate, you take away 2 votes for the one you don't like.  1% drop in support for one and a 1% increase in support for another is a net gain of 2%.
    
11) **If you don't say or do anything, then nothing's gonna happen**  What you do has to be effective.  Barney Frank in the Reddit interview explained this well for Q#10 regarding Gay Rights marches.  Basically, MoCs want to get reelected.  Their district's support for something ultimately decides their vote, and this trumps special interest groups and campaign donors.  **The wants of donors/lobbyists/party/friends don't mean shit if there's obvious massive opposition in their district.  Simple as that.**"
9ye1u,1,2009-10-27,Student deciding whether it's time to live by himself for the first time- see text for more details ,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/9ye1u/student_deciding_whether_its_time_to_live_by/,"Hi Reddit, 
Long timer reader first time poster. Liked some interesting discussions I've read so thought I'd throw my current dilema out there.

A little about me:
I'm a 21 year old college student starting a condensed masters program in electrical engineering- I'll graduate June '11 in 5 years total. I'm in a lot of debt and paying my way through school by my (future) self, but I have been taking school seriously; I already have two internships and have interviewed for this upcoming summer with a few companies. 

My problem:
The people I live with. Mainly two guys, out of 5 of us. One is a year younger, he's generally immature. Unable to articulate himself (ie saying a sentence with out “shit” or “fuck”), messy, obsessed with computers and is always planning out what new computer his parents will buy him next. Always trys to talk to be about god damn computers. The other has been my friend since high school. We started hanging out because we both liked smoking pot. In a nutshell he has already dropped out of school and came back for rehab due to oxy-cotton addiction (thankfully I have never had a problem with drugs intruding in my life). 

More info about this dude:
He is just the epitome of a spoiled kid, given too much attention when he was young, and now the defining characteristic of his life is his drug addiction and subsequent recovery. His mom is very wealthy and always working, so when we were young we would always go to his house and smoke. He has driven a $27k car since he was 16, despite that he failed his drivers test twice before he got a license. He is very selfish, inconsiderate, and insensitive. Shortly after sobriety he got a girlfriend; if it wasn't for her, he probably wouldn't be back in school right now. He talks on the phone for hours every night. He cannot take any criticism and gets very defensive when you ask him to clean up after himself. It's very childish. He has never cleaned anything, let alone his room. His girlfriend does that for him. The type of guy that'll take his laundry home so his mom can do it for him, and is only taking 12 units a quarter so he can 'get good grades so he can get a PhD eventually' (because he likes the image of being respectable) all the while school is a free ride for him. He craves attention, he sings loudly and love it when people compliment him and laugh at his jokes.  
And of course, his mom owns the house we are all living in. 

The house:
Lived here two years, this is start of the third year. Last 2 weeks I had been studying for the EIT so I would be on campus 14 hours a day. The kitchen became atrocious. Ants all over the place, it took me 3 loads in the dishwasher to clean all our stuff. Happens all the time, a lot of dissemination of responsibility. People leave doors open, no one ever locks anything, and lights are left on all the time. Bills are split 5 ways (I pay them and collect money from everyone, no on else can handle that responsibility), so even though I don't want TV and don't waste electricity I pay for it. 

To the question:
So my original question was going to be: should I move out on my own, in a little studio type of thing? But I realized I already know the answer to that, the question I need to be concerned with is why am I so hesitant. Why do I see it as so difficult to confront him about all this? I feel like his mom must- “anything for you &lt;name&gt;!” Can anyone relate to this situation? I will have to give me 30 days notice in mid nov, so after finals in mid dec I'll move out. 

Additional reasons I should move out:
-Dad just got a new job and for the first time can afford to help me financially in school; already said he is willing to compensate additional costs if I move out
-Would be able to concentrate on school more.. which is important considering I'll be taking 500 level EE courses
-Would be free from what I consider a stale living situation. I am the maturest person in the house, no one there is really making me grow... 
-Just a change in general, and a new challenge for me

9yium,0,2009-10-28,Dear Reddit: who are the major players in developing Biofuel policies in the US Senate?,smalrebelion,politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/9yium/dear_reddit_who_are_the_major_players_in/,I'm an undergraduate at UC Berkeley and spent the summer working in a lab developing Algae Biodiesel.  I'm about to graduate and want to move towards working in renewable energy resources policy.  Ideally I'd like to spend some time working for a senator or government agency as an intern.  So my question is this:  Who are the major players in developing these policies in the US?  The media isn't exactly helpful in these matters and any pointers are incredibly helpful.

Help!",whaawhaa,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/9yo18/reddit_an_allpaid_semester_in_south_korea_or_a/,"This is how it goes. I have the chance of going to a university in Korea for a semester, all paid. All I have to do is teach English(shouldn't be an issue). But, at the same time I got an offer from an internship with a top 20 company in an area that's not that easy to get (Procurement Development?!). I know I should be blessed choosing between the two, but I'm honestly torn and I have to reply in less than 5 days. So I turn to you, trusted redditors. Any ideas?"

Unless some devoted souls do this themselves in the comments here, I will take my free time on sunday to add in all the titles.

I'll try to update this list every 1-3 days. Also, I'm still trying to get help with making starred threads stick to the top of the subreddit page using CSS. If you know how to do this, please let me know!

Enjoy!
