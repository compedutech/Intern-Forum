And I noticed that the media firm I'm looking to get into has opened up an undergrad summer internship for those who want to go back to school afterward.

Also, any advice for living in San Fran, since that's where it'd be located?"

At one of the questions he said his genitals sometimes bled. Even so, the test still gave a ""meah, you could go, not really necessary"" even though genital bleeding is one of the few symptoms of chlamydiae. I latched out on him for making money out of something so thoroughly unscientific and leading people into danger for having such unfounded responses.

This is a throwaway acc. I'm a clean, chill, and responsible college student (incoming senior) and I'll be interning in SF this summer.

I'm willing to share a room with someone (just need a place to crash + I understand it's not a particularly cheap area to live in). 

Also got a friend here who'll be graduating, Redditor as well, and will be in SF. So if you know of an inexpensive 2-bedroom/living room+1 bedroom spot, I'd appreciate that as well. 

Got a month left before the internship and am worried that I won't be able to find a place to stay. It's still finals period so trying not to think about this too much but meh. Also, I had originally booked a place to stay via airbnb but the guy bailed out me just last week, so imagine my surprise.

I have been dating this girl for 2 weeks. I have known her for over 8 months though. We have a connection that runs months deeper though.

So what this makes this story unique is that it takes place in Disneyworld. Yeah. I was working there as a college internship, with my now girlfriend as my coworker. I was single the whole time I was down there.

One night I run to catch a bus, only for interns, and get on and say ""You guys don't need to worry, I made it"" to which this voice responds ""Good I was really worried"" I look to see this gorgeous girl, with her roommate, and I say ""I think Ill sit down right here""

We start talking for a 20 minute bus ride, and she is snappy and sarcastic, which I go right back. I got off the bus, and wasn't mad, but she made me trip up over a whole bunch of things I said, I knew stuff I should have said, and I was upset that this girl beat me at a sarcasm match.

She also said ""I bet you are going to be a creep and add me on facebook"" because I saw her name tag. I was, but now I couldn't. So I sent her a message on facebook saying ""This isn't a facebook friend request"" We talked a little, and eventually she added me.

The whole time she said I was hollering at her, so I couldn't be predictable. So I never made a move after that, and we were friends.

Months later, I am infatuated by my current girlfriend. She is wonderful. Nothings going wrong, everything goes great, and we really like each other. 

I get a message from my friend. The one I met on the bus. We start talking, and topics go to topics, we talk about how we met. Then I say, ""well Im glad I didn't ask for your number, that would have been bad, you would have turned me down."" to which she says, ""You had an opportunity before I started dating my current boyfriend""

This girl is beautiful, and funny, and wonderful. My girlfriend now, there is nothing I can complain about, she doesn't have a huge sense of humor, but she is the nicest person I ever met.

Ever since that girl from the bus said this, every time I am on the phone with my girlfriend now, I think ""I really do not care what you are doing, I want to know what bus girl is doing"" Every time she text me, I hope its bus girl, and I know shes great, and nothings wrong, its just I cant get over this girl and this lost opportunity.

I don't think I can solve this, I just need to get over it, how can I reddit?

It's nice to be able to talk to people going through similar experiences. 

i'm a 19 year old engineering college student. My dad is a professor at the university at which i study. He pays my tuition and i live with him. This last semester i had been striving to get a co-op (like a paid internship but alternating semesters studying and working). My goal was to be able to pay my own rent and finally live on my own(meaning away from parents, not without roommates) without getting student loans. For once in my life, i was driven. I quit smoking weed completely this semester so that no matter what, even if the drug test was a hair sample, it would not fuck up my chances. 

Well, i got the co-op. i start in august. i'm really excited, but one thing kind of bothers me. since i quit, alot of things in my life have gotten better. I'm much more responsible. I'm alot more willing to step outside my comfort zone and stretch my limits. i'm 1000% more social and outgoing now. last year, when i using a few times a week, i was doing better academically, but all i did was school and then get high on the weekends. now i'm in a fraternity and actually have a social life. So my problem is this: i've been feeling what i saw Subduction refer to as a [reservation to use](http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gnu34/i_want_to_be_done_playing_this_game/c1oxwg7). And once i pass my drug test, i'll have no important reason not to smoke weed anymore. i'll be in a new city and living away from parents for the first time. I predict that at this time it will be VERY hard for me to not start smoking weed again. and i don't even know if that's a bad thing. I've gone long periods of time with what seemed to be controlled weed use. But i've also abused it. i smoked daily for about 8 months after graduating high school and my life most certainly went downhill. I know that i'm happy with my life now, but i also know that it's possible to use and not abuse it. but the possibility of using it without abuse makes it easy to start abusing it without realizing it. i don't know what's going to happen. i don't want getting high to become my default activity again, even if i'm getting all my stuff done. but i really miss weed. it's funny, if i were to get high right now i'd be so excited that i'd spend my whole buzz trying to decide how best to spend my buzz. it's happened before, and i always feel so pathetic when it does. i don't know what to do.

sorry if that was really disorganized, i just never get to talk about these things."
h2mq2,6,2011-05-02,Paid Job VS Unpaid Internship,[deleted],Design,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/h2mq2/paid_job_vs_unpaid_internship/,"I currently work at the on campus marketing firm for my college. I am making about $9 an hour and they give me as much as I want to work on. It is entirely campus related work, and it has been getting kind of repetitive.  

I have an interview tomorrow at a design firm in town who works with a lot of different clients. It would be a Summer only internship (so I would be out of a job in Fall) and the kicker, it is unpaid. They say it could turn into a paid internship or full time employment (I don't plan on staying in town when I graduate in December though), so there is a possibility that it could pay in the future.

My parents help out financially, but lacking a paying job could put a dent in a lot of my free time activities like concerts and eating.

Need advice,showerpower12,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/h2lno/sister_is_datingmoving_in_with_a_total_douche/,"My sister: graduating from college this coming weekend. Double-degree in journalism and English. She's got a great paid internship lined up in DC. Smart. Drinks and uses weed, but only 2-3 times a week to relax after a long day. Works as a waitress in addition to her full-time schooling to pay for rent and what-not.


Douchebag: Let's call him Blake.

Blake has no future prospects. Blake never went to college. Which is alright, I know some fine people who haven't. He doesn't have a job either. He was a bartender at the same restaurant my sister worked at until he got fired for drinking on the job -- one year ago. He currently lives with his parents, but spends most of his time with my sister and her friends on the college campus. He's not currently applying to jobs.

Blake also does a shit-load of drugs and booze. He's usually shotgunning Natty Light with his buddies or loading up on the jungle juice. He smokes weed constantly. Today (Monday) he said ""Dude, I haven't smoked since *fucking Saturday*, bro!"" Moreover, the bro smokes a pack and a half of cigarettes a day. I wouldn't mind that much, but the guy's father is on hospice with lung cancer due to decades of smoking. He's got a few months to live. Yet Blake still puffs away, despite everyone telling him what a fool he is when his dying father is staring at him clear in the face.

I asked the guy what he does for money. Well, he lives with his parents so no expenses, rent, etc. He tells me he's living off the money he made working a year ago. ""Dude, I've got like 3 grand saved up. That'll last me a looooong time.""

I can't even describe to you how much of a douche this guy is. Imagine those dudes from Jersey Shore, but more fist-pumping. His favorite pastimes include light beer, talking about cars, and watching baseball. Oh yeah, and pushups. He challenged me to a pushup contest. (I refused). His favorite movies are *Larry the Cable Guy: Health Inspector*, *The Boondock Saints*, and *Meet the Spartans*  To boot, he's like 6'5"", 210 and jacked. Which I wouldn't mind at all, but the idea of him plowing my 5'2"" sister makes the tapioca rise in my gullet.

She's moving in with him at the end of June. (They're getting an apartment with 4 other people in DC). How the hell do I tell my sister that this guy is a total loser?

TL;DR: Sister is dating a complete douchebag. She needs to break up with him before he ruins our family gene pool"

Basically this, I grew up in a great place with a great family. My Mom, Grandfather, Grandmother, Step-dad, uncle, and cousin are millionaires a bunch of times over.

I went to a public high school and lived normally, not even realizing that my family was richer than every other family I ever met. I never knew about this money until I was about 18. So that means no one knew we had money. Sure I was given a car when I was 16 and never had to worry about any kind of financial things growing up, but to me that was normal.

I went through high school not applying myself at all and skating by in all of my classes. I left with like a 2.8 GPA I think. I got into a college and did the same old thing, just basically skimming through and graduating with a 2.921 GPA. I barely worked at all, skipped a lot of classes, never studied, missed group work, the whole 9 yards.

I coasted through these years and had a great time while never really working for anything in school or even trying really. The only place I applied myself where at the 4 internships I had while in college.

So now reddit, I will be graduating in a week, doing pretty much nothing, never knowing of financial hardship, never knowing of anything really besides video games, getting high, and working for the various companies I interned for. I will also walk off the stage with my diploma and have a corner office and making 150k out the gate working under my step dad. I too, will be a millionaire for no reason other than my family has money and is well connected. This is what everyone is always going for, and really it is kind of boring. Some times I wish I could of seen what is was like to actually have a problem or a struggle.

Ask me anything :)"

First time out of education, and while it's been perfectly fine living away from home at university for three years, it's mainly been uni-supplied accommodation, or I've been able to get a group of friends to rent a place yearly from a student-accommodation company. Concerns:

- How do I go about finding a place to stay in a new city?
- Can I afford by myself, or will I need to find a flatmate,  
- and how do you even find a flatmate if needed?
- How much would I be looking to rent for in London, and how does it compare to other cities?
- Would it even be better to buy a house, rather than rent?
- Internships seem to offer £1k a month, how comfortable is that living-wise?
- Seems stupid, but how do you even go about making friends in a new city?

Thanks, and feel free to share any win/fail stories you've had about moving somewhere new for the first time.

h2abk,8,2011-05-02,Closed-off SO is driving me insane. Is there hope or is this a lost cause? ,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/h2abk/closedoff_so_is_driving_me_insane_is_there_hope/,"We (19M, 19F) have been in a LDR for almost a year now. We've been friends for 6 years since high school (though some might argue about the intermittent 2 years). The distance has been extremely tough on her, but somehow we've made it through to this point. It's also become increasingly clear to me that she has trouble opening up (to me, to anyone, but her aggression is more noticeable when we interact). 

A particularly bad but revealing phone conversation happened last night. She called while I was sleeping, but I answered it anyway. She insisted I go to sleep but I asked her to indulge my request for once (i.e., to talk to her). Our previous phone calls have all ended on bad terms, so I really wanted to break the chain of bad conversations before I head home and see her on Saturday. 

Throughout the time we talked, I spoke to her encouragingly about telling me what's bothering her, but she would dismiss my concern, stating she doesn't have to tell me anything and she doesn't have anything to say. As the call went on, she became extremely rude and insensitive to how I might feel in reaction to the mean things she's saying and the annoyance in her voice. 

I was getting restless and upset, but I stayed calm. I asked her why she bothered calling if she sounds like she doesn't want to talk to me at all. I don't think she knew how much she was hurting me. At the same time I understand she has this irrational fear of getting close to someone because they might hurt her (note: her parents had a bad split when she was young; her dad's a scumbag). The conversation ended badly with me not getting through to her and us parting in bad moods again.

I've thought about giving up on this relationship several times now, but she's the best damn thing to have happened to me. She's transferring to a closer school this fall, and we made plans to live together for the summer while I intern in San Francisco. Everything seemed fine, but the week before I head home, this happens and the implications really hit home. 

I want a girl who's not needy but also isn't afraid to open up and confide in me because she, like me, takes solace in knowing someone else is there for her even when I can't help her with her problems. I need someone who wants to talk to me, because a LDR is hard enough as it is without the physical presence. Not incessantly talkative, but feels comfortable telling me everything. Why do some people feel the need to be so defensive? It makes no sense to me, because a closer relationship benefits both parties, whereas one that's closed off is ultimately a lost cause. Should I try to fix this shortcoming or move on? This problem drives me crazy, and I don't know what to do.

**TL;DR** Girlfriend has trouble opening up to me, becomes very defensive about my trying to get close to her, doesn't talk to and confide in me like I wish she would. It drives me crazy. Fix or move on? "

I also have been putting in a lot of applications, have one summer internship offer (albeit not actually having anything to do with CS), and have a few interviews coming up for local software engineering positions.  
That said, the more I look at the US, and the more I think about my future, I don't want to be here forever.  And the more I think about that, the more I think I want to get away soon.  
I spent a year doing exchange study in Japan during Highschool, I speak Japanese well enough to get around, maybe not enough for a strictly Japanese corporate environment, but if I had to, I could get back up to snuff fast I think.  
I'm also hearing a lot of good things about Sweden through here and other parts of the internet.  
Does anyone have advice for someone in my situation looking to get into software engineering, or maybe graduate study in Sweden or Japan, or are there other places that are looking good for people looking for low level jobs for CS majors?

h1uv2,6,2011-05-01,I was turned down for my dream job...twice...help me remember that my career isn't everything in life,shattered_dreams,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/h1uv2/i_was_turned_down_for_my_dream_jobtwicehelp_me/,"There's a specific job I've wanted (for a specific company - not just the role) since my senior year in high school - 2006. Back then it was just a passing fantasy, a ""wouldn't it be cool if someday...""

But then in 2009, partway through college, there was an opening for the position, and I actually got the opportunity to apply and be seriously considered. I was up against tons of other applicants, so I wasn't surprised when I got the very nice letter (and personal) letter telling me that I wasn't quite qualified, but maybe someday.

Then in 2010, I was offered an internship with the company for which I wanted to work. During that time, I got to know a lot of people within the company, including the ones who make the hiring decisions. Soon after finishing my internship, I got a call from my former manager letting me know that there was another opening for the position, and that I was being considered for it.

They flew me across the country for the interview, and I let myself get my hopes up. I was under the impression that they had already made up their minds to hire me, and that this interview was just a formality (after all, I had interned for them, they knew me, etc). But I soon found out that three other people were being considered for the interview. Still, I thought the interview went well, and afterwards I was told I'd hear the decision within two weeks.

MONTHS passed, and finally I received a short email from them saying that they had decided not to hire anyone after all, but that I was on their shortlist if they decided to hire again.

So I graduated college, took a position in IT, and now work a boring 9-5 job in which I feel trapped and bored. And I feel like crying because of it every single day. I have no motivation to try to excel at my current job, and I also feel very little motivation toward anything else - I just keep thinking that my life would be perfect if only I had my dream job.

I have great family, great friends, am in a very happy relationship - yet I honestly have trouble caring about that. Jobs are such a significant part of life - they're where you spend roughly a third of your time, they're how you are able to provide even the basest means of survival for yourself. So I always told myself I was going to be one of those people with a job I love - that I would live to work, rather than working to live.

Reddit, please remind me that having a dream job isn't everything - that family, friends, and significant others are worth living for. Because I've completely lost sight of that."
h1uk8,1,2011-05-01,What's your best academic dishonesty story?,CheatOnTuringTest,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/h1uk8/whats_your_best_academic_dishonesty_story/,"In high school, I worked for the help desk for three years.  The office was right next to the IT department for the district.  There were two employees in IT, which was separate from the help desk.  One was a 50 or so year old man who had below-average computer skills and handled things like purchasing computers.  The other had initially set up much of the infrastructure, and played WoW all day until the network went down, then called Dell to come fix it.  As part of my internship, I got to do a final project, so I chose to do a security audit.

All the computers in the district had two local accounts.  One was for regular users (the acronym of our district) which used the same acronym as the password.  There was also an admin account.  Every computer of a given model was imaged the same way and Norton Ghost was used for computers not used by teachers to restore it to the same state regularly.

Instead of integrating Windows authentication properly, they just installed a Novell client of some kind which prompted users to log in to their Novell account right after the Windows credentials were entered.  Every student and teacher had their own Novell account, and we were supposed to keep all of our school-related stuff on our (protected) space on a network drive that was mounted by a script.  We were also told not to save stuff to the local drive.  The teachers disregarded this because nobody had access to their computers.

One day I remembered that all of the local drives are shared by default on Windows (SMB) shares.  You can access them from the local network as long as you have the credentials that would be necessary to get to them otherwise.  These shares are named ""C$"" for C:\, ""D$"" for D:\, etc.  They're also hidden in the network browser (""Network Neighborhood / Network Places"").  By visiting \\[computername]\C$, any user could easily browse the entire hard drive from the network.  If they had simply configured the computers not to require credentials for Windows' log-on, then it would not have exported these drives!

So, I logged onto all of my teachers' computers with the normal credentials, which were named by their building and room numbers like ""hs-314"" and realized almost none of them used their network drives to store files.  I downloaded a bunch of tests.  Most teachers who had been there for a while used the same four or so versions of a given test.

I told the IT department about this as part of my audit report, which I made immediately after finding out.  They said ""nobody would figure that out"" and ""people aren't supposed to put things on the drives anyway.""  I lied, saying that I asked teachers if they stored tests on their hard drives, and they said that they did.  He said ""tell them not to do that.""

So, I downloaded copies of these tests, which usually only had minor variations from one another.  Then I got trusted friends who were much smarter at me at humanities subjects that I would have to try really hard or do poorly at (AP English, AP World History), and, in exchange for the correct answers, I'd give them the test ahead of time.  I didn't tell them how I got them, but I did tell them not to tell anybody about it.  I ended up acing every test that I did this with over the course of 2 years, to the point that it was suspicious, but I never got caught.

As further evidence of their stupidity, I later cracked the administrator's password (it was an LM hashed on a Windows 98 computer that was used for one of the shop classes) and it turned out to be the name of our mascot.  He hadn't changed his password in years, either.

TL;DR: School's IT is retarded, easily downloaded tests well in advance, gave them to other nerds, they took them, I remembered their answers."

I read the FAQs (and read much more elsewhere) so please don’t tell me to go and do that, I’m posting this in hopes that someone has some advice personalized for me or can point out something I'm doing wrong.  

Some background info- I’m a 21 year old college student 6’3” weighing about 180-185 and have some previous gym experience but haven’t really been serious since last summer, and just started up again about three weeks ago.  It feels so good to be active in the gym again and I’ve convinced myself I’m never going to taper off again (and I quit cigs over a month ago woot!).  This summer I’m going to be working an internship back home so I’ll probably be working out almost every day.  
As far as supplements go I take animal pak in the mornings, recently started taking jack3d preworkout, and take whey post workout.
I recently bought starting strength but haven’t gotten around to reading it yet.

So I’m doing a split routine divided into five different days, usually in the following order:

**Chest**

* barbell/dumbbell bench press

* barbell/dumbbell incline press

* barbell/dumbbell decline press 

* cable crossovers

* dumbbell flys

**Legs**

* squats

* still working on this, need to start doing deadlifts but I’ve been too lazy to read up and learn about them

* seems like I don’t like a lot of the leg workouts but hopefully you guys know some that I should start doing 

**Back**

* wide grip pull-ups

* bent over dumbbell row

* barbell reverse grip bent over row

* close grip lat pulldowns

* hyperextensions (lower back)

**Shoulders**

* dumbbell shoulder press

* barbell front raise

* barbell upright row

* dumbbell lateral raise

* dumbbell bent over delt raise

**Arms**

* skullcrushers

* dumbbell bicep curl/alternate hammer curl

* preacher curl/barbell curl

* 21s sometimes

* reverse grip triceps pushdown

Some questions:
* The gym I’m currently at doesn’t have free standing squat/bench stations so I’m using a smith machine, am I really losing out on a lot by not controlling the weight myself?

* Are chickfila nuggets good for someone with a pretty fast metabolism trying to bulk (8 nuggets has 260 cal, 12g fat, 28g protein)? Now that I type those out it definitely looks like it’s a good option, and they’re so delicious and accessible on campus so I eat them pretty frequently..I guess I try to avoid fast food but when I get it I go for what I think would be high protein and relatively less fatty (ie stay away from fries, sodas,etc). 

* Any advice on getting those calories in as a college student?  I’m usually busy most of the day so I try as much as I can to keep eating but it’s not always easy.

* What’s better – controlled (slow) lower weight, or higher weight that I can’t control quite as well (not dangerous or anything)?  How many reps should I be able to do of a certain weight before actually moving up to it (ie doing 10 reps of 55 on dumbbell bench but only able to do 6, then 4 reps of 60)?

* Whenever I do my last set for a particular exercise, I immediately do another set with half the weight until my muscles are completely destroyed. I don’t know if that’s recommended but I’ve done it for some time now and it makes me feel like I take my muscles as far as they can go (ie repping 60 on dumbbell bench and can’t even get 30s up at the end)

* Any other suggestions/tips/criticisms?

Thanks for taking the time to read and respond.

We were together for almost 3 years and it was a terrible relationship. We didn't communicate well, fought often, sex wasn't that great, she was annoying as heck. I remember thinking near the end that the only reason I wasn't breaking up with her at that very second was because I was super busy with other stuff and I didn't want to deal with the drama. 

She winds up moving to another city for a semester for an internship while I stay behind for the toughest semester of my life. I didn't have time to talk to her often and when we did she would whine about being alone in a city and it just drained me so we grew distant. We would often talk about things going back to normal when she came back home but before she did she started dating another guy. that was almost 6 months ago.

It tore me up inside. I knew i was miserable with her but the thought of her with another man is really hard to bear and still is. 

I was taking an exam just a few minutes ago and I couldn't focus on the material because I couldn't stop thinking about her and him. I have even done some dating, even dated girls who were a better fit and more attractive but I couldn't help me feel like I was competing against her while she probably doesn't even notice and is happy without me.

I already have an unpaid internship in a Melbourne agency lined up for early August to early October, but 'til then I have plenty of time that could be spent helping some redditor/lurker.

I'm afraid that if I say something like this, he'll just go ahead and rescind the offer (he seems to want someone who's willing to start fairly soon).

Will it change?,throwaway5280,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/h4aq5/does_it_ever_get_better_will_it_change/,"I (male) have been going out with my girlfriend for over four years.  We are both in our early 20’s and have recently graduated from the same college were we met.  We do not live together, but see each other often, and sleep over three times a week.  For the first three years our relationship was great, I saw her as the girl I want to marry.  However, this past year has been the toughest part of our relationship, and I don’t know if it is worth it to continue.


I will try to be as unbiased as I can be describing the situation, but that is almost impossible as I can only take an educated guess at how she feels.  Consequentially, this is all from my point of view.

   

**Background**


From my point of view, the trouble started last September when she started an internship and her MBA courses (she is part of a 1-year MBA program, so the course load is larger).  The large amount of work that she has is causing her significant stress.  Additionally, around this time she went off her birth control and became paranoid of getting pregnant.



Around the end of November my Internship ended, and I was turned down for a full time position due to cut backs.  In the mean time I have been working part-time in retail while I search for a full time job.  She has told me that she sees me as the man she wants to marry, so my difficulty finding a career has been a source of stress for her.  I understand how this affects her, and I am trying to remedy this situation. However I don’t think she realizes how hard it is to start a career in this economy. 

   

**Sex Life Problems**


Since September our sex-life has radically changed.  Her paranoia about getting pregnant meant that we started only doing oral sex.  Up until January, we would be intimate once or twice a week.  In the past three months I feel lucky if it is even twice a month.

She has made what I feel to be no effort to be more intimate.  I have approached this problem with her, but it has become a really touchy subject. I have talked to her about it, and she has agreed that it is her problem and she needs to change it, but I still feel like she hasn’t done anything about it.  This is a great source of stress for me.

   

**Relationship Problems**


I recognize the fact that she has been stressed with her work load, and I have offered to help her in any way I can.  I occasionally drive her to and from school, help with research, proof read her work, write study guides, and cook.  However, I feel that recently she has been treating more like an assistant than a boyfriend.  She has started to act like me doing these things are my job since I am not currently employed full-time.  I rarely feel any gratitude from her after doing these things.

Additionally she has been a lot more irritable and tends to snap at me quickly.  This has never been an issue until now, and recently I feel like I need to always tread carefully around her.  Right now, if I were to try to bring up any problems she will have a break down, and I do not want to be the cause of it.

I feel like this relationship has been almost entirely one-sided with me doting on her because she is always stressed.  If you were to ask me what she gives me in return, I would honestly have to think about it (though I could be blinded to it due to my anger at the situation). *Edit: I have had time to think about it, and there are plenty of examples of little things that she does that show that she still cares about our relationship.  They are just not that easily noticeable.*



She graduates from her MBA course in June, and has already discussed with her internship about full time employment.  By my projections, I HOPE to have a full time job by then as well.  My current plan is to wait until then before approaching her about how this year has been, when both our tempers are cooled and the future is not so foreboding.

So my question is:  Will it get better?  By the end of the summer when we are both gainfully employed will things change?  Will I get the girl I used to be with back?



**TL;DR:**  Girlfriend is overworked, has low sex drive, and is irritable.  I am looking for a job and feel like our relationship is falling apart.  Will it change?

**   **

** *Edit:* **


*In the interests of being fair, I should tell you that one of her complaints about me as of late is that whenever we do anything fun together, she feels like she has to be the one to plan it.  My excuse is the when ever I have tried to plan anything, it always falls through because she is so busy, so I have recently stopped trying.*"

I'll work somewhere else to help pay rent, which I will split between two other girls and I. Long story kept short: I'll work my ass off, taking every opportunity i can, and hope that in the next decade, I'll be getting somewhere I'm proud of. I don't expect it to be easy, but I look forward to the experience.

**The questions**

If any of you live in California (near LA), could you give me some tips or suggestions? What is it like? Is there something you wish you knew when you were young? Anything from safe apartment suggestions &amp; cheap eats to job-related advice.
I'm from Texas, and, I'd say a small town, that's your typical Southern Texans. As said, when I tell people my plans, they talk on and on about how ""so and so""'s niece had to come home, or how ""mark, Steve's son, is barely making it by."" I kind of expect to hear this stuff when I don't assure them with a secure plan, career, or relationship. I understand there's competition and many optimistic people who move over to the big state for the industry and get no where.

Lastly, if there's a better subreddit for this question--just direct me there.

During my undergrad years, I interned with two companies and worked as an ECE teaching assistant, giving me about 2 years of internship experience.

Post-graduation, I took a job with the highly selective Edison Engineering Development Program at GE Energy. I left that job a few weeks ago because career growth for an electrical engineer with my interests (new/emerging technology, smart grid/energy infrastructure, space systems, etc.) is very limited.

I am most interested in developing energy infrastructure and new ""smart"" technologies. So far my work and educational experiences have been very broad, which makes me very versatile in terms of the types of roles I can fill. An ideal position would involve a good deal of hardware design, layout, and testing. It would be great to have some more experience with firmware development (something I have only a little experience with) as well as laboratory testing/validation. 

After a lot of research and self-inventory, I have decided that working for a high-technology firm in the Austin, TX area would help me both develop professionally and achieve greater work/life balance.

**Edit**:
Thanks for all the great responses!

So, er. I've been thinking about it a lot, and if I do what I love, I'm going to end up with a degree in philosophy. I have every MCAT prereq finished with an A except three, Math up to Calculus 2 (might get a B in calc 2 this semester, but an A in every class before that and a decent shot at an A in calc 2), actually have a 4.0. 

The only med school prereqs I don't have are Ochem 1 and 2 and the second half of Calc-based Physics. 

I'm thinking philosophy because I love arguing, ethics, public speaking, writing and debate. I love them so much I do them in my off-time. 

With this in mind, if I get a 4.0 in all the med school prereqs (OChem is obviously a bump in the road, but I have a lot of 4.0 sGPA credit padding at this point and only 3 total science classes left), do you folks think it would be okay to do a philosophy major?

h3pi4,3,2011-05-03,Do Unpaid Internships Discriminate Against Those Who Are Not Wealthy?,kliqzero,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/h3pi4/do_unpaid_internships_discriminate_against_those/,"Okay, so I've been browsing through my university's career website and looking up a whole slew of summer internships that I may be interested in. My only issue is that a lot of these internships do not pay anything! What's worse, most of them are located in Washington, DC, which is a hassle to commute to and from on a daily basis (especially if you're working 40 hours a week). 

My question is, how do these companies expect you to survive if you're slaving away 40 hours a week without any sort of compensation? (the ""really nice"" ones do compensate for travel) What about bills, eating, living, etc? How the hell do they expect me to afford my rent or grab dinner after work if I'm not being paid?

So this brings me to the conclusion that these unpaid internships unintentionally (I'm assuming) discriminate against those without any money and/or parental support. I can only imagine someone who's parents are loaded and covering practically everything from living arrangement to food to extra pocket cash to even slightly consider these positions. 

I do have parents, but there's no way they can help keep me afloat while I spend 40 hours a week at an internship that offers no guarantee asides from ""varied experience"". 

Anyone feel the same way? Perhaps differently? Has anyone been part of an unpaid internship? If so, did you get anything out of it?"

h3o01,14,2011-05-03,Emotionally and (occasionally) physically abusive mother - I'm at my breaking point.,linkinrepublic,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/h3o01/emotionally_and_occasionally_physically_abusive/,"I can't deal with my mother anymore.

Let me try to sum her up. This might be long.
Some info about me to start off: I'm 17, 18 in one month, a graduating senior in high school.

She is the most stubborn person I've ever met. Her opinion is the only right opinion, in her mind, and no amount of reasoning or calm debate or evidence will change her mind. She is impossible to talk to, so I've discovered. Impossible.

When I go out, she always asks me where and with whom. A lot of the time she even asks for a phone number of someone I'm going to be with. When I'm already out and she calls and I say I am doing so and so with herpderp, she will ask to speak with herpderp sometimes, just to verify I'm not lying. Or, if she can, she will drive to wherever I claim I am just to verify I am not lying. She yells at me whenever she catches me napping, or whenever she sees me lying in bed using my laptop. She thinks I use the computer too much and so she tries to unplug the internet router every night at 10:30 or 11pm. 

In terms of pressure, she thinks I'm a failure. I didn't get into an Ivy but I am going to a really good NON-IVY school, but she still tells me ""look how much you've ruined your life already"". Every word she spoke before had to do with getting into a good college and now every word she speaks has to do with med school. Like I'm useless for any other purpose than to get into schools. I've won countless awards and taken all the hardest classes and APs I could have taken, and yet she never ever congratulates but rather every day she comments on how much of a failure I am. 

Should I mention that I have a bf. He's 3 years older and long distance, and I've been with him for 3 years now. I told my mom 2 weeks after I got with him, he was my first bf ever. She was fine with it... until he went off to college and I still stayed with him. We'd stay up talking on the phone a lot, and she would see the phone logs, and she began to hate him just because of that. She would claim he was an idiot, a bad person, I can't trust him, he's just using me for sex, all this crap, even though EVERYONE else can see how in love we are and how sweet of a boyfriend he is. She just refuses to try to see. She's never actually talked with him. We've tried - for instance once he came over to dinner but she literally did not say one word to him, and she refused to come eat with us at the table, so we just said ""fuck this"" and left to eat out. I'm close with his family so his mom offered to talk to her in hopes of trying to knock some common sense into her. So our moms met up, and his mom came out of it telling me ""I'm sorry but I cannot deal with a person like your mother"". My mom now claims his entire family ""is full of idiots"" even though she's never even really gotten to know any of them. She just hates them for no reason.

I try to get out of the house as often as possible, because she's crazy. One day, I stayed out for the night, because I figured I NEED to rebel, she can't keep treating me like crap and like a baby. I texted her where I was and that she shouldn't worry, I'll be home tomorrow, etc. Then I shut off my phone. The next day, when I come home, I'm greeted by her right at the door, and she starts hitting me as hard as she can. She's a feeble, lame woman so it didn't hurt, but she was shrieking and kicking and hitting like a mad woman. I locked myself in my room and she banged the door so hard the lock broke. 

So now, tonight, she was telling me how my boyfriend is a piece of shit and his family too and I should break up, and then moved on to say that I should be looking for internships or volunteer jobs at hospitals this summer to prepare for med school. I told her that's not the point of senior summer, I'm going to enjoy the time I have left with my friends before college, when I will start buckling down again. She said everyone prepared for college applications since MIDDLE SCHOOL and I did not and look where that got me. I told her to get out of my room. She blew up again and started shrieking and hit my back as hard as she could, and continued to shriek around the house about how much of a failure I was and how it's all because of that idiot boy and how I will never succeed.

I've spoken with my dad before and I told him I think my mom is crazy. Like mentally ill. And that she needed rehab or treatment or therapy of some sort. My dad agreed with me actually, but he said she would refuse any of that, so it's not our choice to make. 
(Usually my dad is gone on business trips so he's never home. When he is, he's a pushover and always takes my mom's side.)

I don't know RA.. I'm fed up and I'm done with it. I can't wait until college, I can finally be away from her. But I feel like she's making me a miserable depressed human being, not to mention also screwing with my relationship with my boyfriend. She makes it hard to see him and be with him. And also  my life so miserable because of her reactions to him, I sometimes wonder if it's worth her emotional and physical abuse to be with him. I know it is, I love him and she's not going to separate us, but it's just unbearable. I'm at my breaking point. RA, what can I do?

**edit:** she told me just now that if I ever talk back to her again, she's not going to just shout or argue anymore, she's going to beat me. I have this terrible urge to beat the crap out of her in return next time but I know I can't, god, I have no idea what to do anymore."

h3msr,6,2011-05-03,Questions about getting into grad school ,gradschoolwha,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/h3msr/questions_about_getting_into_grad_school/,"To start out I'm a 5th year who has a horrible GPA. I was an idiot earlier in my career and it's ended up with me having about a 2.8. I am horribly ashamed... I'm interested in animal nutrition with the end goal to go to grad school and maybe beyond in comparative nutrition research. I've really only found my love of research in the past couple years yet my GPA is shit. My nutrition GPA is decent at about a 3.5 and I've been able to get a ton of research experience. I know that I may have screwed myself over early in undergrad. I'll be a late graduate because of a major change but how the hell do I fix this? Would everyone suggest coming back and fixing the GPA or just take the GRE and attempt to go into industry? I just hate that I feel like I found my passion too late and don't know what to do....

EDIT [Goals]: Ideally want to work in zoo nutrition. Preferably in an actual zoo although both academia at the university level or industry like Mazuri both spark my interest. At the moment it's a small industry but has been very steadily growing now that the zoo vet industry has finally caught up to being preventative vs reactive, vets and others are starting to see how lacking our knowledge is and how using a bovid for a base for a Giraffe just isn't cutting it any more. 

EDIT [Authorship Question]: How much does it help to be published before applying? I have a fairly decent chance to be like last author on a industry research project that I am compiling all the data for but has been banging out the details of what data they want collected since before the beginning of this year. I also might get the chance at doing a research project on my own this summer at my internship. If it happens the end result would either be a paper or poster that I could present at a conference. I know the person I work with in the lab has like 6 publications and said that he's talked to an advisor at his undergrad school and they've basically said he would have no problem getting in, he'd be much more advanced than his peers, and it would take much less time to complete due to that. So is that just a fluke or how much does being published beforehand help?

EDIT [Academic Question]: My major isn't actually nutrition because at my school that doesn't exist so I'm just a plain Animal Science major. BUT our major only requires 1 nutrition course and next semester I'll be on my 13th Nutrition course. One is from outside my major (Human Nutrition) but out of all 13, 10 are at the graduate level (670+). I pretty much have all A's in the graduate level courses except a couple (Horse people are insane) and a few times been the only undergrad in the class and fared well. I know I'm getting repetitive but how much does taking related courses in other majors help show your interest and how much does my performance in the higher level courses help me out?

EDIT: Thank you so much everyone! I posted a couple extra tidbits about me and questions (sorry about the wall of text) but I have so much more self esteem after seeing all your opinions!

One of my coworkers who is a fellow Americorps member has a rich dad who works for some giant corporation. He had the opportunity to hire two ""interns"" for a full paid (very good pay, not like a kick ass salary, but for an internship it's ridiculous) internship in NEW ZEALAND (the version of Australia that is more beautiful with no snakes or deadly animals). 

He of course gave his daughter, the experienced Americorps member first dibs, which she took, and her brother-in-law is getting the other spot. They're both well qualified, so that's fine.

After reading up on the benefits and where they were going to be living, and the pay, I'm not jealous, I'm amazed!

Does anyone know of any working abroad programs or internship programs that don't cost me an arm and a leg? I did a bit of research myself, and most of what I found consisted of paying your own way, minor visa assistance, and minor job finding assistance, not exactly what I was hoping for.

If you guys have any info, let us know! I'm sure there are many young Redditors going through college or other similar programs like Americorps who would love the opportunity to get out, see the world, and get some valuable work experience."

I'm currently going to school which gets out in June. However, I am finishing in May to take an internship. Now my roommate and I are on a month-to-month lease that we have each been paying for half of every month. When I moved in a year ago, I told her that I would need the place for the school year. In April, I told both the landlord and her that I would be moving out in May and would not pay for June's rent. My roommate is moving out in June. After looking around for some time, it seems extremely unlikely at this point that someone will live in my room for just one month. My question is: is it my responsibility to pay for the month of June?

The lease agreement (to make things complicated, I never signed it) says that if I move out early that it is her responsibility to find a new roommate or pay for it herself. All we have to go on is the implication that I would be staying for the entire school year (through June.) 

What it comes down to at this point, is do I pay for two places to live or does she? (or do we split the difference in some way?) I can easily walk away and lose nothing, but I'm not sure whether or not I am obligated to pay.

**Edit:** The rent for the place I'm moving to is being reimbursed by the company I'm interning for."

I'm not picky about the job I get as it's just a summer job to help pay for the holiday, I'd prefer weekday work as opposed to nights and weekends (i.e. bar work), but I'd do bar work if it was offered to me.

I'm also just finishing up a mechanical/electrical engineering degree so if anyone knows of anywhere that takes on summer interns that'd be ideal, but I've probably left applying for something like that a bit late.

Any help is appreciated, and I hope to go to a few meet-ups over the Summer.

We dated for 6 months, but it ended 7 months ago. My problem is, I can honestly say I've never been happier in my life than when I was with her. She graduated college in San Antonio about a month after we started dating, and moved back to Houston. We visited each other every time we could and things were going great. I made plans to move, attend the University of Houston, and work at an internship with a racing team. I lie to myself about it, but the main motivation for the move was to be with her. I wanted to marry her. Then, about two months before my planned move, she started acting distant and dumped me for no reason (that she would tell me). She said she just had a change of heart. The opportunities in Houston were still worth the move, so I went ahead with it anyway. We tried hanging out as friends a couple times before I moved, but even though she had said she loved me during our relationship, she was bringing new guys around almost immediately. I had been hoping once I moved we could reconnect, but that hasn't been the case. We haven't spoken once since I've lived here (4 months). I think that our relationship ended during the ""honey moon phase"" where everything is perfect, so I have her built up as the perfect woman in my head. I have to admit, the only flaw I can find in her is an immaturity with relationships. She's 23 but dates guys like it's middle school. When one relationship ends, it's right on to the next one.

I'm starting to see someone else, we haven't even kissed at this point, but I definitely like her. But I still think about my ex constantly, I even had a dream about her last night. I don't know what to do. I want to move forward, but I still can't get her out of my head. I feel like I'm trying to start a new relationship just cover up the old one.

 I'm afraid of being rejected if I try to reconnect with her, and if we started hanging out again I know my sole motivation would be to get her back. And even if we did get back together, I would constantly fear getting dumped again for no good reason. I'm seriously considering therapy at this point. I don't want to live the rest of my life fearing that the perfect girl for me got away. I know there are plenty of fish in the ocean, but let's face it, some are better than others.

Should I try to talk to her? Should I just ignore the feelings and hope they go away? Should I get professional help? She dominates my thoughts when I don't have something distracting me, and I'm sick of feeling this way."

Coding experience C/C++/Java/MIPS
I am A+ certified for computer repair
I have had experience with setting up networks and CISCO related products

I would post my resume, but I'm not really comfortable giving out my personal information.  Any ideas where to look or what I should say when I'm applying to places?  I do not expect to get one this summer, as school is over in less than a week.  But I would like to get at least one internship before I graduate."

I'm majoring in Writing. I'm not sure if I'm going to concentrate in creative writing or something else, or just not have a concentration at all. I have a minor in classical studies, and a minor in marketing. I like to think that I'm decent, but I certainly know that there are people better than me. I want to work in the publishing industry, preferably in editing. However, I know this is a difficult field to get into, and that internships are definitely necessary.

I got rejected for an on-campus job working as a writing tutor, today. I can apply for the spring semester, which I'm well aware of. However, this rejection has served as a reminder of how difficult it might be to get anywhere with my degree. I'm not sure how to make myself stand out when I'm applying for internships, though I'm going to try to get more involved in on-campus publications next semester. Still, I'm left wondering if it would have been a wiser decision to major in a different field. The job market is tough right now for everyone, I know that. But there are certainly some fields that would be more likely to lead to financial stability and job security. I considered a number of them when I was applying for colleges, but I knew I wouldn't be as happy in any other degree program, and that I wouldn't enjoy them nearly as much as I enjoy the Writing program. Still, I can't help but wonder if I'd be better off switching majors - or adding a second major - while I still can, and accept the fact that most people don't ever get their dream job.

**TL;DR: Going for what many would call a 'useless' degree, but a 'useful' degree program wouldn't make me happy. What's more 'worth it'?**

edit: I just want to clarify that I don't expect to end up being completely broke and jobless, regardless of what I do. One option would just result in more probable income than the other."

Edit: Thanks for the replies so far... Like all good redditors, I've been checking Padmapper and Craigslist consistently -- the problem isn't finding listings, it's getting the people with listings to write back to me (which people have, but then they're way too far from the subway or decide to take some local and stop replying).

One thing in particular is just realizing that I will probably never again have the amount of free time I did while in school, and that when it comes right down to it, the number of hours between getting off work and needing to sleep for tomorrow seems so short.  Do you have to plan a lot to figure how to use your free time effectively?

I come back from my internship, take the usual bus at the train station, when this *smoking* hot redhead HB9 sits in the same bus, wearing a tight grey dress. I am reading my book (in Hebrew) and try to get her interested, but then I remember that *I* am the one who needs to approach her. Got AA all over me and next thing you know, girl exits the bus. I spend the entire remainder of the bus ride and more kicking myself mentally for not even trying an approach. Get home by around 19:00

There is a house party at one of my female friends' places on around 20:00. I know I cannot get prepared on time (gotta shower and whatnot), so I arrive a total of around an hour and a half late. House party is meh, only social circle, so no real place for gaming.

At around 00:30, we move out to the centre of Brussels. Two of the group decide to go home, leaving us as a total of 3 (2 girls and me, one of them kinda HB 7, but not gonna try to game her). Eventually, I call one of our friends, and she and more mutual friends will be where we are in 5 minutes. We wait 10, and they still don't arrive, so we decide to go to the *Delirium* - basically Brussels' most notorious spot and, unknown by my female friends, a regular PUA are.

Fuck. So tired. Already 04:45 A.M. now... bite the bullet, finish this FR!

So we get to the Delirium. I decide to call my friends to see what's up. This is when things get interesting. A girl (HB around 7.5, let's call her Dancer) grabs me and tells me ""Let's dance!""

Me: ""I gotta call my friends.""

Dancer: ""Let's dance!""

Me: Or else what?

Dancer: she pulls closer to me, can sense some attraction in there (well, duh, she drew you in for a dance! I know, I know.

Me: No, really, I have to call my friends.

Dancer: I don't care. *continues dancing*

Me: *pulls her closer* Well, whatcha gonna do about it if I go? *smiles*

Dancer doesn't answer, but grabs my hands, so we dance a bit, and then she suddenly pulls away from me saying ""Very bad, D minus!""

I decide it's time to sit down, so I grab the nearest chair and another, and tell her to sit down next to me. I do some fluff talk with her with pretty heavy kino all the time, and then I stand up, and touch her armpits to make her stand up again (wanna dance again). Next thing I know, she's back with her friends without telling me anything. What the hell. Next!

That is exactly when my friends arrive, so we have some fun and laughs, then I notice a group of 4 girls, mostly HB7, standing next to the bar in order to buy a drink, but they're being hit on. I wait for them to go back to their table, make eye contact (keep the 3s rule this time), I stand up, walk to them, and start the conversation:

Me: ""Hi, ladies, how are you?""

HB7: ""Fine, you?""

Me: ""Well, I have a question for you - I saw you over there, from across the pub, and I wanted to come and talk to you. However, I don't know how. So, do you have any advice for me on how I should talk to you?""

She: ""You could start by buying my friends here a drink."" (she's the only one with a beer)

Me: *sits down on one of the chairs* Oh, I don't do that, as a rule of thumb. [fluff talk and some kino here, but I don't feel the attraction, so I eject as my friends are waiting for me].

Go back to my friends, talk some more, then I go to the bathroom. On the way back, I meet Dancer again. So I smile and say ""So, we meet again."" she says ""Yeah, I just have to use the bathroom!"" and taps me on the chest. I knew immediately what this was - pity tap. Meaning ""I don't really like you that much, but I'm going to touch you in order to give you some of my value and make us both feel a bit better."" I go to my friends and I sit there, looking for other sets to open, but there's nothing in this part of the pub. I notice that one of our friends has disappeared, so I go look for her. I find her standing alone, so I ask her why she's alone and not with the group. Next thing I know, some Portuguese guy comes and talks to her (and she likes him, 'cause she's 1) a slut 2)Brazilian). I go downstairs, where there also ain't a lot of people. I make eye contact with a girl (HB7) immediately, and walk up immediately.

Me: Hey, how are you doing?

She: *looks puzzled*

Me: How are you doing? *smiles*

She: I'm sorry, I don't speak English.


*BAM*. Dead in my tracks. I try Dutch, she speaks only French. Well, that's my cue. Time to leave.

Trust me.). So, if you're a central Illinois (whoo!) redditor, I'll so message you the name of this place so you may shun in solidarity if you so choose.

I graduated (with honors! Whee!) last May with a degree that's only useful if I go to graduate school. While that was (and is) the plan, I wanted a year off to BREATHE, to save money and to plan things with the SO. 

After applying for work for 4 months, I applied to this precious, locally owned/operated gourmet bakery and market. ""Woah!"", said I. This place had AMAZING food, great merchandise, laid back atmosphere, I just loved it. 

...they hired me without even checking my references. I begin working there in late October, things start to pick up and things start to...come to light. Dead baby roaches under freezers, being encouraged to LIE to customers about deli foods' expiration date, their tagline ""Always local, Always Fresh"" evidently meant food from Sams (!) that is in the deli case for 8-10 days.

I ALSO began to see employees drop off like flies. Not DYING, but QUITTING. In mass numbers.

ALso, they embraced the entirely legal (albeit annoying) practice of ""training pay"", where for the first 90 days of employment, you can be paid less than minimum wage. This ""training period"" lasted until Saturday morning.

In addition to all this, it's a locally owned business where the owner/proprietor is the head chef and her DAUGHTER is the payroll/hr person. So no matter how unhappy you were with either of their particular pathologies that leaned toward super-bitch, there was no one you could talk to.

Now for the fun. Due to mass employee exodus, I had agreed to work 3 46 hr. work weeks in a row. I have 2 other jobs...one from home and the other a minor paid internship. I was literally running from uptown to downtown and back again six days a week because I was cheap labor. However, on Saturday, I was unable to come in TWO HOURS EARLY to help with an expected breakfast rush.

I called, left several messages (which I thought was rather thoughtful considering the request come via text at 5:30 AM), and showed up at my regularly scheduled time. I was greeted with ""This is a BULLSHIT WAY TO KEEP A JOB!""...in front of customers, employees and a camera. 

...I left.

And had THIS in my inbox this afternoon:

I doubt you can understand what its like to run a growing business- but its beyond difficult to have paid employees who continually accommodate themselves at the expense of the business + co-workers, you have let the company + your co-workers down today.  

Your final check will be mailed to you Friday. I'm sorry we can no longer support your inability to be a supportive member of the team. As always, we wish you the best of luck.

Signed,

Superbitch. 

I assure you, there is not more to this story (like a closet coke habit or something that made me the worst employee ever). 

TL;DR: Don't work for local businesses. You will be fucked."

I have very little interest in developing commercial games when I exit college (unless I can work for Valve), but this might be a good exercise to familiarize myself with using different libraries.

I already installed the WP7 SDK and got the free eBook Microsoft provides for developing for Windows Phone 7.  I'm an Android user personally, and have no intention of getting a Windows Phone device, but the languages and .NET could prove to be very valuable to know.

**__An Open Letter To Science__**

Dear Science,

  With all the international secrets being released by Wikileaks causing political hullabaloo, it’s easy to see how science and technology can be used against many people’s interests. And, in these serious times it’s important for reporters not to go off on tangents.

  Fortunately, I’m not really a reporter.

  Are scientists truly focusing on the most important things? Do they have our (my) best interests at heart?
It’s 2010 and I don’t own a personal time machine. If a senile, bulge-eyed, crazy-haired “doctor” could make one with nothing but a flux capacitor and a wicked car in the 80’s then we should have them strapped to our wrists by now; better yet, following the ipod pattern, we should have one as big as my pinky nail.
  But I live without my time machine because I know that scientists are out there doing bigger and better things; like curing cancer and H.I.V., keeping the ice caps nice and solid, feeding the whole world, and designing unbreachable oil caps.

 It was at this point in the letter that I intended to show you some studies and statistics displaying scientist’s efforts in the problems listed above, however after hours of painstaking, in-depth research (5 minutes on google) I couldn’t find much.

 Although, I did find out what our scientists are really up to, and it’s even better than I could imagine; they’re solving problems I had no idea I even had.

 A British Columbia biotechnology company has created non-browning apples. I’m sitting here, writing this letter without the genetically-induced ability to move things with my mind, but at least I know in the near future I’ll be able to cut up an apple and not eat it for a while because I’m a busy person and I can’t afford to eat my apples before they go brown.

 The National Science Foundation has conducted a study to determine the properties of the substance that makes spider webs so sticky. Another breakthrough! Without this study how would we ever make scientifically grounded explanations of Spiderman’s superpowers?

 A study conducted at the University of Tokyo has determined that enzymes in the nasal mucus of mice changes the way they perceive smells. So please, rest well tonight, because we’ve finally solved that mystery.
   
 Remember Dolly the sheep? The sheep that was genetically cloned back in 1996. Well, she’s been resurrected. Yes, the same scientist behind Dolly has made four more of her, because as cool as it was to see an identical sheep in 1996, it’s even cooler, after 14 years of scientific achievement, to see the same thing - times four! It’s my belief that this scientist is just taking preemptive measures against a looming sheep famine that we are all unaware of.
 
 Astronomers (the dentists of the scientific world) have discovered that there may be up to three times more stars than we thought. Not only have these scientists admitted to miscounting the stars in the first place, but they’ve wasted time re-counting them. That’s precious time. Time that could be spent designing and building spaceships for us all. Spaceships that we could use to travel to the final frontier, exploring strange new worlds, seeking out new life; new civilizations, boldly going where no one has gone before.

 
 With all these scientists conducting such unbelievably pointless studies and research at least we can count on the scientists at the Institute of Cancer Research to work on one of the bigger problems. Scientists at the Institute of Cancer Research have conducted a study showing that men have a much lower likelihood of developing prostate cancer if their index fingers are longer than their ring fingers. I believe the same scientists recently stated their future study on the link between cancer and the correlation of hand size to face size. When one reporter criticized these scientist’s studies, the scientists simply responded with, “I know you are, but what am I?”

 Hundreds of years of scientific achievement and what do we have to show for it? Plumbing? A lot of good that did for anybody. The polio vaccine? I’ve never had polio, and I don’t plan to. Airplanes? If man was meant to fly then scientists would get around to making me a jet-pack.

 I can accept all the great things that science hasn’t lived up to, but one thing still really bothers me: the common cold. Really science? It has “common” right in its name and you haven’t cured it yet? And for that matter, where are our hover-cars? Where are our snarky-comment-filled, friendly robot companions who help us solve crime? Why is everyone allergic to peanuts? Why does my dog like eating garbage so much? What happens to McDonald’s fries when they go cold? It’s like one minute you’re eating golden slices of heaven and the next you’re chomping on mushy hay. What’s with jeggings? Are those really a thing now? Jeggings?

 Science, I know all these problems must be overwhelming. All this stress can’t be good for you. But I bet if you tried really hard on that time machine, we could all go back, just a little bit, and never read this long-winded letter.

Sincerely yours,

mcmurch

h6fmr,3,2011-05-07,Maybe I'm just being paranoid.,ttthrowaway123,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/h6fmr/maybe_im_just_being_paranoid/,"Okay so I don't know if I'm just being extremely paranoid, but here goes. I am in college and registered to take an internship for this summer. I applied at places here and there but also went on a whim and applied for an internship at a few brewing companies in my state in positions that would relate to what I'm studying in school. I ended up getting a reply back from one company (we'll call them Company X) and  I was stoked. I sent the company my resume and they seemed interested, but didn't make an immediate effort to set up an interview with me.

A little while later, the other brewing company (We'll call them Company Y) got back to me and seemed really interested. They set up an interview with me and I ended up getting the internship! The employees there are awesome and I'm so excited to be working with them. I'm even going on the beerfests with them. I emailed back Company X and told them that since they delayed so much, I ended up choosing another internship due to time constraint, and they were bummed because they thought it was already initiated that I would intern there, but they've been too busy to find a good time for me to come in for an interview. They've never had an intern there either.

During my interview with Company Y, the interviewer told me that Company X is one of their biggest competitors. The person actually told me they really don't like them personally at all, while the President of our company does talk to them sometimes (Company X is family run and small but very popular).

I haven't told Company Y that I ever applied or almost interned for Company X because I didn't want them to think I was insincere in applying for Company Y, nevermind trying to be teamed up with one of their competitors. So this summer, we will be going to beerfests across the state where Company X will also be present. Company Y is even headlining at one of Company X's personal brewfests. 

So my problem, I'm really paranoid that the company I'm interning at is going to introduce me by first and last name to the people I was communicating with at Company X and it's going to be SUPER awkward. There's really not a doubt in my mind that I wont be introduced to the people at Company X, it's going to happen eventually. I don't want Company Y to feel like I betrayed them, even though I never got a direct answer from Company X. Should I tell Company Y that I applied at Company X? Should I tell Company X that I'm interning at Company Y to avoid any awkward shock? Am I being really paranoid?

I'm not being paid at Company Y but they are interested in hiring me when my internship is up. I don't want to ruin it! I know this is confusing but I'll clarify if need be."
h6f3s,7,2011-05-07,How do I deal with other alphas who kind of rip into me a little bit? I think its relevant to life in general,pressureee,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/h6f3s/how_do_i_deal_with_other_alphas_who_kind_of_rip/,"I got to thinking about this at work and realized its kind of a weak area of my game and how I interact with others in general.  I often come in contact with guys who sort of rip on everyone but in a friendly way.  I don't really know how to explain it but they tend to make people qualify to them really easily.  There's a manager at work that I don't really interact with but am starting to (im an intern) and he's exactly like this.  He basically will walk all over you as much as you'll let him but at the end of the day still be a respectfull co worker. He definitely has this vibe where he's one step above you on the alpha ladder.  He's not a big guy or anything but seriously some people at this place are so intimidated by him it's ridiculous.  When he sort of fucks with me I play it off using the fact that I'm just an intern and have been avoiding a lot of his shit but it's quickly making me realize that I'd A) like to pick up some of these sort of pseudo intimidating qualities but more so B) that I'd like to be able to match wits so to speak and maintain my own alpha if that makes sense.  I feel its relevant to game too because often this type of thing is a huge DHV.  I've seen people almost bring girls to buying temp just by interacting with other guys in the mix. IMO it's way important for my percieved congruity.  It would really help me give the impression that I am confident in myself and alpha if I could not only handle the typical bitch shield but also easily deal with these types of other alpha guys if that makes sense.  I just can't seem to match wits and its pulling my game down. 

Does anyone here know what I mean? and have you figured out how to improve in this reguard? I've never been good with this and really want to get better.

P.S. I need to stress the fact that this type of guy I'm talking about is not an asshole, he's close but never crosses the line and deals out the praise when it's due. "
h7o8k,0,2011-05-09,I need to fly cross-country with three suits; starting to freak out about what to do.,[deleted],malefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/h7o8k/i_need_to_fly_crosscountry_with_three_suits/,"The day after tomorrow, I am flying across the country for a summer internship. I have three suits I'm taking, and I can't figure out how I can take the suits without getting them wrinkled. I know hotels have presses to get out wrinkles, but I'll be subleasing a place, and while I'll have an iron, I'm not sure if those are ok for suits. If it means anything, they are all new suits and haven't been worn yet. Also, I'd like to avoid checking a bag ($25 each way) because I'm poor, but I guess I might have to.

Here are what seem to be my options:

1) I've found videos on how to ""roll a suit"" to pack it in a small bag. I've tried this on a practice run, and I honestly can't see the suit coming out wrinkle-free, despite the video's assurances. Anyone try this method? You turn the suit inside out on itself and roll with some shirts stuff in the shoulder area. The main problem is with the sleeve area. Always seems to get bunched up.

2) Suit bag. I have one. It's just a fancy cover for a suit. Am I supposed to carry it on or check it? If I check it, how would it not get wrinkled? If I carry it on, do I only put one suit in it (and then wear another...leaving one suit in limbo?) That would leave one other bag I could take, which would be my laptop and stuff. That would require checking a bag.

3) Cancelling my flight reservation and driving. I have an OLD car and I've never driven this distance on my own before. If my car breaks down in the middle of nowhere, I have no clue what I'd do.

4) Just packing the suits however and paying to have them pressed when I get to my destination. How much would this cost? Since I have to have a suit the next day, I guess I would have to wear one on the plane.

I'm sorry for the desperate and off-the-wall tone of this post. Just with my last final tomorrow and my trip the day after, I'm bugging out at this point and could use the collective wisdom of people who have traveled with suits before."

I have seen a few posts similar to this recently in r/VictoriaBC and I apologize if I am cluttering the feed, but I am stuck.

I just finished my 4th year of Electrical Engineering at L'universite de Moncton in New Brunswick. Since February I've been looking for a job here in Victoria, primarily to be with my LDR girlfriend (who you may have met at one of the meetups as KittyMonster). 

I spent the first month searching primarily for jobs in my field, but after applying to several internships and cold-calling every engineering firm and tech company I could find with no luck, I started to branch out. 

I flew out to Victoria last week to job-search in person, and we're giving it two weeks. Since my arrival I have applied to every landscaping company, golf course, computer store and engineering firm that has posted a job opening, and cold-called dozens more. I've never had any trouble finding a job before and am at a bit of a loss.

Without boring anyone with my resume, I have 5 years total engineering education (2 years computer, 3 years electrical), 3 summers as a computer technician, and 7 years of golf course/landscaping under my belt and am motivated to do any job that presents itself. If you'd like any specifics, please feel free to comment or PM me and I'd be happy to give a more detailed account of my skill-set.

If anyone has any leads or ideas as to where to find work, I would really appreciate it. "

Then that job fell through and I was suddenly summer-plan-less and depressed, and I can't seem to snap out of that slump.


I'm not looking for help *finding* a summer job (though if any of you want to hire me, that'd be cool).  I'm looking for advice on how to not be so downhearted about not hearing back from ANY of the jobs I've applied for.  I've sent out resumes and cover letters to over 20 different internships (in New York, New Jersey and Atlanta, Georgia).  I've applied for a variety of jobs I found on idealist and through my college's career development center.  I've trawled craigslist for hours and applied to random part-time jobs.  I applied to be a camp counselor at a few summer camps in New York and Pennsylvania.  No one's gotten back to me.  No one.


At this point, I don't really know who else to ask for advice, whether that advice be on finding a job or not being so bummed out about not finding one yet.  I've talked to my parents.  I've talked to my professors.  I've talked to my family friends.  I've talked to former employers.  I've talked to my older sister and her former employers.  I'm smart and quick and capable, and I know that landing an internship or a job these days is way more about luck than anything else, but how do I convince myself of that?  I feel down and dejected and rejected.  If I can't find a job this summer, I want, at the very least, to be able to feel okay getting up and reading, jogging and working around the house every day.

h7gtj,9,2011-05-09,"I'm in college and in a long distance relationship. As graduation looms, we're heading different directions. Again. Help?",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/h7gtj/im_in_college_and_in_a_long_distance_relationship/,"I'm graduating soon. I have a girlfriend who goes to a different school in a different state. We see each other about once a month-ish--sometimes more, sometimes less. Before this, we were friends in high school and we still kept in touch. Recently (within the last e or 4 months), things have moved to being a little more... serious. 

But with looming graduation, we're facing a huge dilemma. She's been offered a job (more like an internship) with a company that would look great on her resume but is near where she went to school. I've got nothing to stick around where I am now and plan on moving out west after I graduate to be closer to some family as well there's more jobs in what I want to do, and the fact that I like the west coast. Her internship lasts around 8 months, until the end of December, then it's where ever she can get a job. She's talked about moving out west with me, but I don't want to encourage it because while we have known each other for a long time, I don't want to be **that** asshole who makes her move across the country when we've only been actually dating for about two months. 

I've always had this philosophy of ""No matter what, I have to do what's right for me."" I made my mind up on that before I ever met someone I cared about, but I still grasp the logic behind why I adopted that philosophy. And I expect her to do the same thing. I suspect that after she finishes her internship, she'll want to follow me out west but there's no guarantee about that. 

**My question comes down to this:** Once we graduate and I move away, is this the end of us? Is the best solution to break up? 

Do not get me wrong: I like her. A lot. I like her laugh, the fact that she's cynical like I am, is way too obsessed with british television, and hides the fact that she has a good heart and wants to help people. We've only been actually dating for a few months, so I hesitate to say that I love her because, really, what is love? (Baby don't hurt me--no more.) As cliche as this sounds, I know that she likes me too. She's alluded to it in many different ways, from how her friends laugh when she's on the phone with me because she becomes more 'feminine', a brutally honest conversation (we may have been slightly tipsy) that included the phrase ""I've dated other guys before. It's different with you. You're the one for me."" Yes, it can be written off as being enamored during the beginning stages of a relationship, but... I guess I don't want to.

I've been trying to remind myself that I'm young (22) and that in the grand scheme of things, if I'm supposed to be with her, we'll wind up back together. If not, maybe it wasn't supposed to happen. I'm a cynical person, so this idea of hopeless romantic love is hard to me to embrace. Breaking up makes the most sense, I suppose. But part of me doesn't want that to be the case. 

She'll be coming over this weekend, and I'm sure we'll hash things out more then. But I'm hoping for advice from people who may have been in this situation before. What can I expect vs. what solutions do we have. I know there are easy outs: ""Don't move so far away"", ""You're a dick for starting something this close to a period of transition in your life."", etc. While I understand the (probably deserved) criticism, there's rhyme and reason behind it all, and frankly it's not very productive.

h7g2w,1,2011-05-09,Question for anyone who tried a long distance relationship in college (Long story inside).,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/h7g2w/question_for_anyone_who_tried_a_long_distance/,"I'm graduating soon. I have a girlfriend who goes to a different school in a different state. We see each other about once a month-ish--sometimes more, sometimes less. Before this, we were friends in high school and we still kept in touch. Recently (within the last e or 4 months), things have moved to being a little more... serious. 

But with looming graduation, we're facing a huge dilemma. She's been offered a job (more like an internship) with a company that would look great on her resume but is near where she went to school. I've got nothing to stick around where I am now and plan on moving out west after I graduate to be closer to some family as well there's more jobs in what I want to do, and the fact that I like the west coast. Her internship lasts around 8 months, until the end of December, then it's where ever she can get a job. She's talked about moving out west with me, but I don't want to encourage it because while we have known each other for a long time, I don't want to be **that** asshole who makes her move across the country when we've only been actually dating for about two months. 

I've always had this philosophy of ""No matter what, I have to do what's right for me."" I made my mind up on that before I ever met someone I cared about, but I still grasp the logic behind why I adopted that philosophy. And I expect her to do the same thing. I suspect that after she finishes her internship, she'll want to follow me out west but there's no guarantee about that. 

**My question comes down to this:** Once we graduate and I move away, is this the end of us? Is the best solution to break up? 

Do not get me wrong: I like her. A lot. I like her laugh, the fact that she's cynical like I am, is way too obsessed with british television, and hides the fact that she has a good heart and wants to help people. We've only been actually dating for a few months, so I hesitate to say that I love her because, really, what is love? (Baby don't hurt me--no more.) As cliche as this sounds, I know that she likes me too. She's alluded to it in many different ways, from how her friends laugh when she's on the phone with me because she becomes more 'feminine', a brutally honest conversation (we may have been slightly tipsy) that included the phrase ""I've dated other guys before. It's different with you. You're the one for me."" Yes, it can be written off as being enamored during the beginning stages of a relationship, but... I guess I don't want to.

I've been trying to remind myself that I'm young (22) and that in the grand scheme of things, if I'm supposed to be with her, we'll wind up back together. If not, maybe it wasn't supposed to happen. I'm a cynical person, so this idea of hopeless romantic love is hard to me to embrace. Breaking up makes the most sense, I suppose. But part of me doesn't want that to be the case. 

She'll be coming over this weekend, and I'm sure we'll hash things out more then. But I'm hoping for advice from people who may have been in this situation before. What can I expect vs. what solutions do we have. I know there are easy outs: ""Don't move so far away"", ""You're a dick for starting something this close to a period of transition in your life."", etc. While I understand the (probably deserved) criticism, there's rhyme and reason behind it all, and frankly it's not very productive. So let's focus on the problem at hand.

I was wondering how difficult is it to get into internship for, lets say, facebook or google. Now, the obvious answer, of course, is to simply apply for it directly, but I'm afraid that if the application gets rejected, I won't be able to get a second chance that easy.

For some information : I'm a 2nd year pre-grad CompSci student, with not a particularly good grade average, 3.6 atm (on a 1-5 scale, 1 being fail).

I haven't competed in much programming competitions, and have almost no special achievements in my history. Pretty much best thing i did so far is getting perfect score in this year's google code jam.
I consider myself fluent in Java, and pretty good in C(++). I can dab around with SQL and php.
Also, I've got Cambridge's CPE (certificate of profficiency in english).

Question would be, is it even possible for me to apply, and if yes, will they take the application into consideration. Also, what would anyone suggest that I should learn (language-wise) to improve my chances.
Again, I'm sorry if this doesn't fit here, but it seemed like the best place to ask, and I am sure others could also use the information given by someone experienced in such matters."

Never been before. I will be living in Lincoln Park (edit: near N. Racine)  and half my time there will be commuting to Skokie, and the other half to the south (26th and California). I can take a car, but with gas prices, the distance I have to drive, and the unreliability of my junk car, I would rather just fly and rely on public trans if I can. 

According to Google, my public trans commute to those two areas (to Skokie, hoping a line and then onto a bus; to 26th, two lines) my commute would be around an hour (to 26th) to an hour and fifteen minutes (to Skokie). If I portion off two hours in my day to commute each way, how safe would I be in my estimate? Here in Pittsburgh, it's not unusual for a bus to just skip right past a stop during rush house because of lack of room on onboard. Is that common here?

    * Support gay marriage
    * Are pro-choice
    * Are not particularly religious
    * Believe in having a certain amount of ""free"" social services (e.g. health care, education, welfare, etc.)
    * Think Fox news is often particularly stupid
    * Are generally anti-war, anti-invading, etc.

**but, in the end, most of these issues amount to very little:**
    * Republicans are not going to criminalize homosexuality (We're mostly talking about the cosmetic difference of being ""Unioned"" instead of ""Married"")
    * Republicans are not going to ban abortion
    * Republicans are not going to impose Christian laws
    * Republicans are not going to take away public schools, Medicare, Medicaid, welfare, public libraries, buses, etc...
    * Democrat/Republican strategy in Iraq/Afghanistan would be pretty similar

**So even if Republicans are in power, they won't have much of a negative impact on these issues.  On the flipside,**
    * Republicans want to lower corporate taxes, which materially affects
        1. Everyone who owns a company
        2. Everyone who works for a company
        3. Everyone who buys things

Taxes have a large and visible impact on everyone.  When abortion clinics in West Virginia get federal funding, I say ""Yay!""  When corporate taxes go down 5%, I get $10,000 more with which I can start paying my interns, or lower my prices, or move out of my parent's house... 

That's not to say money &gt; beliefs.  Just realize that for many people, the economic benefits from voting Republican are large, while the social/ideological drawbacks are really quite small."

Lately (past month) she's been playing for more than 8 hours every day. Every time I confront her, she tells me that she's minding her business, keeping her out of mine since I work!

And I told her to get her stuff out ASAP. I was the gentleman, gave her the bedroom tonight, but after diasepam and some alchohol, im wondering if i made the right decision. What shoudl I do?!

I love her so much. She loves me too.. we have been thru everything together. Rich and poor, sick and health.

Sorry for spelling. Im drunk and full of antidepressants."

h99e0,6,2011-05-11,Getting sick of my boyfriend...because he's going through a hard time. I know I'm a terrible person. What do I do?,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/h99e0/getting_sick_of_my_boyfriendbecause_hes_going/,"The thing that initially attracted me to my boyfriend was how driven and on-top-of-his-shit he was. He's an aerospace engineer and just finished one of his hardest semesters. Until recently he always got good grades. Now he has to re-take some of his classes because he got lazy and stopped going to class, and then didn't even bother to cram right before his tests.


He's having a hard time handling all the stress, and I don't want to add to it by telling him that I'm losing a lot of my attraction to him. This isn't the guy I started dating 2 years ago. At the same time, he should know that I'm not happy with how he's handling things. I know he's not happy with it either, and me saying it would make things worse....


I'm also upset because we've been doing a long-distance relationship for a while now, and I was really excited to spend our whole summer together. Because he has to retake classes now, hes taking a month of summer classes, and I lose a month with him. (which is half of the time we had to spend together out of the entire year)



I'm just so angry with the situation, and I know he is too. And in the midst of all this, I just don't feel the same admiration and respect for him that I used to.


Do I wait for it to pass? Do I tell him how I'm feeling??



EDIT: maybe its the way I worded the title/the whole thing, but most people are getting the wrong impression of my relationship. Yes, I love my boyfriend immensely, and that's why I was willing to do 9 months of a long distance relationship. I'm upset because half the time I get to see him out of the entire year is gone since he dropped the ball on his schoolwork. I know its not all about me, and I've been very supportive this past year, but I feel like he has some guilt in it all. He's not doing his part in this relationship to take care of my needs (by making time to see me). It's a two-way street.


EDIT again: wow does no one see how important it is to spend actual in-person time with your SO?? I agreed to long distance because I thought I would actually GET TO SEE HIM SOMETIMES. Guess that makes me a selfish bitch... I make room in my **crazy** schedule (im in another country taking classes, doing volunteer work, and have been working an internship) to still skype with him **every day**, sometimes for **hours**, but he cant get his butt to class and then complains about being bored.

I'm a damn good girlfriend and I've taken incredible care of him through his hard times. My SO would attest to that.

maybe I didnt represent it accurately, but if you guys really believe that he has zero fault in all of this I can't take the comments seriously"

I’ve been dating this amazing guy for the last 5 months (he’s 24 and I’m 25 female) and we met on OkCupid and are really compatible in our personal lives and professionally (and it’s not just the algorithms telling me that!).  We both got out of serious LTRs about 10 months ago (4.5 yrs together for me and 1.5 yrs together for him) and from the beginning said we weren’t ready for a relationship but we liked how things were going.  He especially had a brutal breakup and although he isn’t in love with his ex, is having a hard time getting involved or feeling like committing to someone new, and has been very open and honest about it from the beginning.  

After about 3 or 4 months of dating (exclusively, no sleeping with or dating others) and meeting some of each other’s friends, he started getting really busy with school, work and a new internship so I began seeing him less.  From two nights a week sleeping over and a few lunches and/or dinners together a week, we dropped down to one night sleeping over after work and a dinner or two.  At this time, he brings up that he would like to see me more often after exams end, and I, of course, agree.  One Saturday we go out to see a movie, and instead of going to my place after, he decides to go home after but we go get an awkward coffee together first where I can tell something’s wrong or he’s kind of “off” but I don’t push it.  I call him the next day and ask him what happened, and he said that a part of the movie reminded him of an exchange he had with his ex when they broke up and he became really anxious after that scene and was questioning what he was doing with me or even trying to date and just really wanted to go home after and deal with that feeling.

Obviously this made me feel terrible, since I thought he was finally starting to get over the break up, and I told him that I needed some time to think about things between us, since he’s clearly not dealing with this well, and whether I would be ok with that (since I was starting to fall for him, although I didn’t want to tell him that).  He said that a break wouldn’t be the way to work through this, and to be patient with him, but I was miserable at that point so I said I wanted a week where we just don’t talk so I can figure out my feelings and my place in all of this.  He considered me wanting the break to be running away and that it felt like a betrayal to him opening up to me.

A few days in (coupled with changing out of a birth control pill that was making me batshit crazy), I wrote him a long email apologizing for pushing the abrupt break and that it was difficult for me to hear how he was feeling, especially if I might be ready for a relationship later on and he’s not anywhere close to that, but that I know I’d rather have him in my life in some capacity than not at all since we have fun together and he’s a positive influence in my life, and I just wanted to spend some more time with him to feel that closeness and intimacy that I’d like to build up with anyone that I’m dating, otherwise it would just be a waste of my time.    

We met up a week later and things were relaxing and back to normal without talking about the break.  A few days later though, we meet up for a walk and he tells me about how he’s becoming really busy lately with work, internship, summer semester and now he has to move apartments because of his roommate, and that he won’t have much time for me, but would like to continue seeing me if we could work around this.  Also reiterating that he still just wasn’t ready to commit more or feel closer with anyone.  I asked him why we were even dating then, if this isn’t going to go anywhere AND he can only spend less time with me (and not more, which is all I asked for).  

He asked if we could take another break, just for a week or so and he can take care of the things that immediately required his attention (most notably, finding a new apartment or a new roommate) and then he can deal with the subject of us, and to please give him the week because if we push the issue now he knows he would just walk away.  

So I give him the week, pre-deleted him from facebook so I wouldn’t be tempted to go to his page, and told him I was doing so.  And here we are, a week and a half later, and I texted him to say “Hi, just wanted to check in to see how you’re doing.  Call me when you’re ready to talk, and I hope you’re doing well”.  After a day, he responded that he would message me later that night, and then that night, he messaged me again and said that his grandmother had a stroke so it wasn’t a good time to talk.  I gave him my condolences, hoped it wasn’t serious, and told him to call me if he wanted to talk or vent (since I am going through similar grandma health problems).

So my question is: does it seem like there is even a good outcome from this, or does it sound like I’ve already scorched the earth by asking for that initial break?  If not, how do I fix things with him?  I feel like we went from the initial break, where I figured out all this stuff about what I want from this and that I should unclench, and without even putting it into practice, we dove into another break with no contact.  He’s told me that he likes to keep himself busy all. the. time.  I am quite the opposite, and though I have my friends, work and hobbies, I like spending weekends or some nights with the person I’m seeing, not having to entertain each other, and sometimes doing our own thing but just being together (yes, I came from a relationship where my ex-SO and I lived together, can you tell?).  Clearly our expectations in dating are different (which I’ve brought up with him before), and I know he doesn’t consider me just as a FWB, but is it true that whoever cares less has the most power?  I don’t want to play that game.  I’ve already deleted from facebook and hit the gym.  Any advice or criticisms are appreciated, thank you in advance!

TL; DR – Dating for 5 months, both fresh-ish from LTRs, he’s not over breakup and can’t commit but all I want is to spend time with him, I'm not ready for a relationship yet either.  I asked for a break to fix my issues about his feelings, and then he asked for another break to deal with work/school/moving.  Did I ruin things by suggesting the first break?  Also, are our differences in expectations of spending time together a dealbreaker?

h9690,1,2011-05-11,Erection problems.........,naddagettinhard,sex,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/h9690/erection_problems/,"So it is becoming difficult for me to get really hard, i can get partially hard but not like it used to be. I remember back a few months ago, when i first started dating my girlfriend, all I had to do was think about her and I kissing and BAM, rock hard (she was my first EVERYTHING, including kiss, I'm 20, so that might be why there). That was about 7 months ago.

I did break it off with her recently, not getting into that. However toward the end of the relationship I noticed it getting much more difficult to get as hard as I used to be able to (for instance, on spring break, we had sex twice a day, no problem getting stiff). My erection was very easy to lose, like when getting a condom on, and sometimes it would get about half way. I still had sex with her like this, but I wasn't very happy with my hardness.

Now we have been broken up for about a month (I broke it up with her), and I can't get very hard even watching porn. The thought of just looking at porn and the videos used to get me hard. Now it is a struggle.

The semester is over and so are finals. It is summer time and I start my internship in a few weeks, so I don't see any stress in my life. 

How do I overcome this obstacle.

Edit: BTW no changes in diet or lifestyle. Still taking multi vitamin, only thing i picked up was i started taking ginkgo biloba for blood cirulation."

I love planning events like academic conferences or charity galas, but I can't imagine a life of primarily planning weddings and sweet 16 parties. I have applied for a few event planner jobs at local universities, but they are few and far between and the competition is fierce. I have also applied for jobs doing technical writing or corporate communications/PR, and some research analyst positions, but again these seem hard to come by. I would love to work for a non-profit, but none in my area are hiring right now (though a few have said I will be their first call if they ever do hire, because I already volunteer for them and they know I rock). I wouldn't mind writing advertising copy or doing market research, but I refuse to do direct sales. I am stuck in my general geographic area (central oklahoma).

So, what other types of jobs should I be looking at? Are there any kick-ass careers that haven't occurred to me but that would be a good fit for my skills?

Already checked CL and the usual suspects for places. Wash U is too far away. I wouldn't mind Soulard, or the CWE, or anywhere else that is in an OK neighborhood, and reasonably near a Metrolink station (0.5 mile or so. I'm not lazy, I just realize that there is always the distinct possibility of rain, and from all reports, St. Louis is humid. Humid + Suit + Walking = Not Fresh)

Any reasonably priced places are ok. Like I said, I have a small stipend for housing, so while I can't pay for one of those ridiculously priced lofts @$1750 a month, I can afford a decent enough place.

So please, blow up my preconceived notions of where I should be, and drop copious amounts of knowledge on me, please.

Unfortunately, I did not have any luck with finding internships while in school and because of this, I wound up with no real world marketing experience coming out of college. I was able to land a job at a software company in my hometown (Chicago) right before graduation. Because of my lack of experience, my job options were not very diverse and so it led me to a position that is mostly sales. I took it because I was interested in trying to see if sales wound up being for me (it's not) and because they mentioned that there are some marketing tasks involved with the job as well. Well I've been here for about 2 years now, tried my hand and it and have found that I do not want to do sales and that this position actually doesn't have much marketing involved.

The agreement is a week to week rental from a lady in her apartment complex. Problem is I feel like it's not going to be a great fit, and want to consider moving out sometime after I get there, if I can find a better fit.

Here's the facts. I paid $780 by money order for 3 weeks of rent/deposit a few weeks ago, which, according to her schedule, covered rent for weeks 11-13 (July 23-August 12th) and I owe $480 on Saturday for the first 2 weeks of the sublet (she's subletting to me for $240 a week). 

The wording on the 2 documents I signed are 
&gt;	You are to pay rent of $240.00 a week in 2 weeks increments ($480) in advance before every other Saturday. First payment of $480 is due on arrival day of 05/14/11. 

&gt;	You are to pay deposit which is equal to 3 weeks of your rental for weeks 11-13 (total of $720.00).
&gt;
&gt;


and


&gt;•	Rent is $240 a week payable in increments of 2 weeks. See schedule for exact dates, increments and amounts.
&gt;•	Since you are planning to move in on Saturday it will get you through Friday each 14 days, so please have payment available by Saturday. You can pay before, but not after that day.
&gt;•	You can pay by personal check, money order, cashier’s check or cash.

This is the first time I've lived outside of my home that isn't a college dorm, so my question to Reddit is: do I have any worry about looking for a new place to live this summer?

Even if I had to eat the deposit...it would probably be worth it to me :|. 

Nothing in the agreement says anything except for the $240 a week 
for rent. 

I would appreciate the help very much! I also noted a line at the top of the agreement that says 'rental from 5/14/11 to 9/4/11' because she knew those were the dates I wanted to have a place. "

The thing is, I can't help wanting to be nice to her... and I was wondering if this is normal or if there is something wrong with me, or maybe I am just handling this all wrong.

So we started dating when I was 21. Things started out well at first - I guess that's what they mean by the Honeymoon Period. I trusted her completely... but slowly things deteriorated.

She would argue with my about the silliest things. Things that she knows I am right about, but she would just argue to save face. She would sometimes not speak to me for days and call up ex-boyfriends or friends who had a crush on her during these times. I always end up forgiving her; I guess I am just too soft. But I think that's when I started to develop trust issues.

During winter break 09/10, she went back to China, where she was from. When she saw me after she came back, she told me how much she missed me, how much she realized I am the one she would want to spend her life with. A couple of days later, I found out that she had been talking to her ex back in China, and has been writing him long emails about how much she misses him and how much she loves him. When I confronted her about it, she says the emails meant nothing, that she was just trying to get revenge on him for cheating on her the first time around. I wanted to leave her then... but she got physically sick every time I tried to break up with her, so with her I stayed.

Things were fine for a while... then I found out she has been calling and texting this guy who was interested in her. A LOT. And everytime I asked her about it, she told me there was nothing going on. I asked her to respect my feelings and back off a little, because I did the same for her. She would agree, but never actually carry out her promise.

One day, she just called me and told me that we should be friends because she might have to move back to China one day. She started telling everyone that I was single... but pretended that we were still going out in front of my closest friends. I just went along with it... I didn't want to hurt her feelings... I guess we are not dating, but she doesn't want me to see anyone.

This spring, she was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. She would bring this up every time I tell her about something that bothers me... telling her to leave her alone, cause she has problems. Three weeks ago, she left for another state for an internship... she told me that her phone died a couple days after she reached her destination, and that I shouldn't call and text her (which I used to do daily). I found out today that her phone never died, and that she's been in regular contact with a couple of the guys who she knows are interested in her.

My heart hurts. I don't know what to do. I know for my own sake I should avoid talking to her, at least for a little while. But I do know she loves me (after not seeing me for a couple months, she started crying the second she saw me and wouldn't let go of her hug), and she also has an anxiety problem, and I don't want to stress her out by distancing myself from her.

Sorry for the long post. I guess I just wanted some opinions on what I should do. Also... since she was my first girlfriend, I don't really know if all girls are like this? Am I being too sensitive? Any advice would be welcomed...

The agreement is a week to week rental from a lady in her apartment complex. Problem is I feel like it's not going to be a great fit, and want to consider moving out sometime after I get there, if I can find a better fit.

Here's the facts. I paid $780 by money order for 3 weeks of rent/deposit a few weeks ago, which, according to her schedule, covered rent for weeks 11-13 (July 23-August 12th) and I owe $480 on Saturday for the first 2 weeks of the sublet (she's subletting to me for $240 a week). 

The wording on the 2 documents I signed are 
&gt;	You are to pay rent of $240.00 a week in 2 weeks increments ($480) in advance before every other Saturday. First payment of $480 is due on arrival day of 05/14/11. 

&gt;	You are to pay deposit which is equal to 3 weeks of your rental for weeks 11-13 (total of $720.00).
&gt;
&gt;


and


&gt;•	Rent is $240 a week payable in increments of 2 weeks. See schedule for exact dates, increments and amounts.
&gt;•	Since you are planning to move in on Saturday it will get you through Friday each 14 days, so please have payment available by Saturday. You can pay before, but not after that day.
&gt;•	You can pay by personal check, money order, cashier’s check or cash.
&gt;
&gt;


This is the first time I've lived outside of my home that isn't a college dorm, so my question to Reddit is: do I have any worry about looking for a new place to live this summer? I've paid the deposit and will pay the first 2 weeks because I certainly need a place to land and get settled (certainly no problem living there for a while, just want to have a better fit if possible), but if I was to find a new place sometime in June, would it be feasible, given the wording on those agreements to do so? Even if I had to eat the deposit...it would probably be worth it to me :|. 

Nothing in the agreement says anything except for the $240 a week for rent. 

I would appreciate the help very much!"

I've been working at a small company that produces solar hot water heaters for almost a year now. I was hired as an ""intern"". The company had 3 other employees when I was hired, but now we're down to me, and my boss (not including the owner, and some people who work very part time for us). I said I was the ""intern"" because they hired me as the sole engineer to replace the engineer who helped found the company after he left due to money issues with the company (he was drawing way too large of a salary compared to what the company was actually making).

Since last summer ended, they kept me on (he got rid of the marketing intern), and I've been doing work for them between classes and homework. For a long time my boss has made it pretty clear he wants to keep me on after I graduate. Because of this I haven't made much effort to find other jobs, though I have been sending out resumes when I come across openings. Well recently the company hasn't been doing too well. The first versions of our tank are leaking, industry required test results were poor due to our design working differently than all other solar hot water tanks on the market resulting in lower sales, the original engineer wants his investment in the company back (despite drawing 3-4x in salary what he invested) and due to our supplier being in China we're constantly fighting very long lead times, large down payments, and expensive shipping. Despite this, some things are looking up for the company. We are in the process of getting new test results that use a new procedure more suited to our design, and my boss just got back from California where he ""sold"" several tanks through a leasing company we're also trying to start up. We've had many dealers tell us that our product is great and simple, but our test numbers are just too low, so once we get new test results, sales should pick back up.

Anyway, I talked to my boss, and there's not enough money to hire me on full time at a reasonable starting engineer's salary right now. They are keeping me on at my intern's pay (~$18/hr equiv) plus a little more. He's not trying to screw me over or anything, because I know he doesn't draw much, if any, of a salary right now either. Over the summer they want me to develop a new tank that can be manufactured somewhat locally, and hopefully cut down on lead times, and initial payments. Hopefully by then the company has improved enough that my pay can be reevaluated. My boss also did mention something about me maybe getting some equity in the company.

The reason I wrote this novel, is because I'm curious what advice, opinions or experience other people have with similar situations. I'm seeing most of my engineering friends (that can find jobs) leave for nice cushy jobs that pay $50k+ with benefits, and I would love to have a job like that. But I also feel that staying with this company would be an awesome opportunity for me because when/if it does take off I'll be the head engineer at this company. Should I get something in writing from the company regarding reevaluating my pay in the future? Also, if this company does go south in a few months to a year, is my experience worth anything on a resume? 

TL;DR: I'm going to be the sole engineer at a company I've been working for for about a year. There's not enough cash at this moment to hire me on with a proper starting engineer's salary so they're continuing to give me my intern's pay, but the potential future payoff could be really great."

The once dominate and 'natural governing' party of Canada was drubbed at the polls, while the NDP expanded its seat share. I don't propose to have the next major Canadian political party but I do feel that from all the fringe parties that do exist there is no serious alternative. Some might argue that the Greens are the next best thing but they still succumb to the same flaws as any of the major parties. 

I feel that an alternative is needed, if for only the purpose of showing what else can be offered in a parliamentary democracy, to Canadians. The same hum-hoe reform is not what I am looking at but real change and adaptation to modernize politics. With so much of what we do and how we interact found online it makes no sense for government and parties to not take advantage of instant engagement. Entire party nominations could and should be done online; there is no reason for a party to run a candidate that the riding would not potentially support. 

The notion that backbencher MPs are essentially a voting block and a vote for the Liberals is one for Michael Ignatieff or a vote for the Conservatives is a vote for Stephen Harper is sorely misplaced. We elect a representative to voice our concerns, but this is too often forgotten and MPs rarely have the chance to place their riding's issues at the party forefront. The problem does not lie within the parliamentary system itself but rather the party structure and the arbitrary decision of which riding will receive cabinet attention. Furthermore, while I am highly knowledgeable about Canadian politics I do not profess to know and understand every nuance of how parties are structured or how they interact via parliament. 

I am looking to form a political party/think tank to take a deeper look into, what I believe, to be an outdated party system. My ideas are mostly raw and only filling up paper, while others are starting to take form and resembling something with structure and purpose. The amount of work still needed to be done is overwhelming and has become more than a personal endeavour. 

If any fellow redditors are the least bit interested or have a better idea please feel free to share. I would ultimately like to build a site focusing on this discussion or at the least find a co-author to work on a paper for the Canadian Journal of Political Science. 

Anyone in the Ottawa area who wishes to help shape and form this idea please PM me. I commit as much time to it possible every week, but being a recent grad and making only minimum wage I work 44 hours and do an internship, I don't have all the time needed. I only am seeking help because I think this idea with some refinement and good discussion might lead to something interesting.

Yes this is a through away account I just wanted to separate my other post from this one. Ideologically speaking any one is welcome as long as they are open minded.

I would also like to thank you for even having the willingness to click on this post! I've been lurking /r/Law School and have seen plenty of these but it's time for me to give it a go.  

I think what would be most helpful to me is the following question...

**For anyone in a law related job, how did you end up in it? What kind of duties does your job entail? What's the best and worst aspects of the job? **

I'm not gonna burden you guys with another one of these but if you're willing, feel free to keep reading!

--Background--
From what I've read here, it's a daunting experience. I've been in the Law Society a few semesters and it's discouraging as well [discouraged by other better and more highly motivated individuals with jobs, internships, moot court, justice corps, etc]. I live at home so it takes me 2 hours to commute to school. Once I'm home I have two brothers I have to help with their homework. I go from ""fill in the blanks"" to a paper on functionalism. I've just never had the time.

Yet, I'm still interested in being a lawyer. However, I've read enough posts about the challenges of applying, going through law school, finding a job, being unhappy once you are a lawyer, etc so I want some first hand experience in the field. 

-Potential options-

Go straight to law school:

*    3.6 GPA, Philosophy and Anthropology majors

*    Honors Program at state school

*    Law Society, no leadership position

    I'm not an appealing candidate. I don't want to be in debt forever considering I really would like to help my parents out. For such a big investment, I want to be sure it's what I'll like to do for the rest of my life AND that I'll actually have a job AND that the job will pay enough for me to get out of debt. A lot of problems here that I find difficult to overcome. Mind you, I'm a first generation college grad so there's also a lot of pressure as well. 

Become a paralegal:

Definitely won't be paid as much as a lawyer but it's exposure to the field. I'll be able to save up some money as well. However, I've also read about people who settle and end up being stuck in this job and I'm not sure if it's something I'll be able to do for a living. I've also heard that finding a job sucks for paralegals as well (southern California). 

Get a masters and then see if you still want to pursue law:

This is really appealing considering I'll have more mobility. I imagine I would either get it in Criminal Justice or Health Care administration. This could potentially be a REALLY long haul but I'll have more options.

havgq,6,2011-05-13,I might be living alone with my dog next year and I need your advice.,husk4602,Pets,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/havgq/i_might_be_living_alone_with_my_dog_next_year_and/,"I'm an 18 year old University Student and I've just finished my first year of University. The past year, I lived with my 2 siblings. My second year of University is going to be a very different experience specifically because both of my siblings are temporarily leaving for year round internships. I'm essentially going to be in our leased house alone. I've never had to face the challenge of living alone and so after discussing it briefly with my parents they believe it would be helpful for me to have my dog stay over with me for the academic year.

I thought about having my dog live with me and I realised that similar to any situation there are positives and negatives. A positive would obviously be the companionship. However it could create many inconveniences for me, such as having to feed and walk him on a daily basis.

I'm worried about the idea of living alone because I feel that it's already going to be a challenge to be that much of an independent individual so suddenly (to the extent that I have to worry about what food I need to make, paying bills, managing the tough academic workload, having a good social life, exercising) I think that if my dog were to come live with me it would complicate things a lot more for me and generally making everything more difficult.

It's clear that the answer points to a no here, however after being on vacation I realised how much my dog is neglected by my parents. He's fed well but he doesn't get the full exercise and attention that he needs and I get the feeling he's a bit sad and lonely.

On one hand, I'm feeling guilty and want him to live with me because I'd know someone else is present around the house and he's a great companion. On the other hand I can't help but think that it'll become extremely difficult to manage everything and that I won't be able to handle such a complicated lifestyle.

I'd appreciate your advice.

hapv9,3,2011-05-13,4 Year Relationship (2.5 Years LDR) at a Crossroads.  Need Advice...,snkp360,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/hapv9/4_year_relationship_25_years_ldr_at_a_crossroads/,"**Background Info**
* I'm 26 she is 23
* Met while still in college my senior year her freshmen Year (I did the 5 year plan)
* I moved about 4hrs away when I graduated 2.5 years ago for a career
* She just graduated and moved home about 1hr from where I currently live
* In about a month she is moving 8hrs away for an internship for 9 months

**The Story**
Our relationship has been great, but like a typical relationship it has its ups and downs.  We we have done out best to keep things interesting and exciting.  For the first part of the LDR (1yr) things continued on as normal, albeit not seeing each other that frequently due to school/work etc but we managed and made it work. Her senior year she went to study abroad in Europe for a semester and that's when things started to take a turn for the worse.  


She started pulling away from me, not really putting effort into the relationship and what seems to me not really caring about us anymore.  She ended up going abroad when things were still on rocky terms, after a lot of talking and soul searching we worked things out for the better and ended up strengthening our relationship even further, I ended up taking a trip out there for 2 weeks and traveling with her.


After the study abroad our relationship was amazing, I was going to propose in July, up until the past couple of months when she started pulling away and not putting effort in the relationship again.  I think a lot of this was due to her being overworked in school/trying to graduate/work commitments coupled with me not physically being in the same town as her.  This put the mentality in her that ""oh hes not here so I don't have to worry about it"".


To summarize the last 5 months we fought constantly and she was always angry or frustrated at something, leading to awkward and angry conversations between us most of the time.  I did my best to support her/be there for her/love her but never really got reciprocation.  When we would see each other on the weekends we could, things were good and we had fun.  But every other time is was frustrating and hard.


About 3 months ago it got to the point where we decided we needed a short 'break' (I know a bad idea) to re-evaluate our relationship and how we feel about each other.  I took it seriously, thought a lot about it and came to the conclusion that I still did want to be with her, but that we needed to make changes in our relationship, really putting in effort because lets face it, LDR's are hard.


We got back together and I was putting everything I had into making this work, she was moved back home now so it was a lot easier to get together, but still wasn't seeing any effort from her in the relationship, no kissing/hugging/intimacy since before the break.


I come to find out she really didn't do much thinking and didn't take it seriously because she ""knew she was going to see me and talk to me after the break"".  She also went out on a date with a guy friend of hers that has been hitting on her and they kissed.  I know we set ground rules about etiquette during the break and it was basically do what you want, but still it really got to me.


About 2 weeks ago I ended the relationship because I just couldn't take anymore. A great analogy someone told me is it was like running into a brick wall constantly, you can only do it so much.  After the breakup I drove to her house to pick up some stuff, she broke down crying and apologized for everything, saying she was sorry for taking me for granted, how she treated me and how she acted.


I still care for her and would do anything for her but I just don't know how I feel.  We are currently talking and trying to figure out how we feel about each other and the relationship, I know she wants it to continue but I am utterly confused. I am worried that the fact that she is leaving again in a month will restart the cycle of her pulling away from me and not caring about the relationship.


I am not looking for a direct answer or exactly what to do, because I know only I can make that decision.  But any advice /r/relationships has to offer would be greatly appreciated.


**TL;DR.** Girl of 4 year relationship, 2 years LDR has pulled away from me in the past and did it again.  We broke up and she wants me back.  I still care for her and want to work it out, but still have apprehensions because she is leaving again for 9 months.

haprl,2,2011-05-13,"Getting an F Visa: Tips?
",RustedChainsaw,China,https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/haprl/getting_an_f_visa_tips/,"Hi there,

I'm an American university student who was just offered an (paid!) internship in Shanghai for the summer. It's completely legit (I've Skyped with many of those working for the firm including the COO, a Silicon valley veteran who has a solid track record as well) and they've even sent me a letter stating their intentions to employ me as an intern. Unfortunately, although I am getting paid for work, they cannot cover my travel costs, which is O.K. with me anyways. I'm now at the beginning stages of applying for an F visa and wanted to know what the best course of action is for applying for this kind of visa.

I've been to China twice before, but it was 3 and 4 years ago, respectively, and I went on a tourist visa both times. I used an agency to get said visa both times, very cheap and friendly people as well. Would this kind of agency improve my chances of getting a visa? The company is a recent start up (Since 2008) and I'm not sure if the name would have the guanxi to push it through. I'm planning on leaving in a month, so I want to start the application process soon, but I want to do it the right way.

Another question: Would it be easier to simply go for the tourist visa? It's a summer internship so I would only need the 60-90 days from that type of visa, and I have family living in China so it would be semi-legitimate."
hap51,2,2011-05-13,I need to make a cheap(er) alternative for an inclined impact tester.  Any ideas?,WeTreeThrees,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/hap51/i_need_to_make_a_cheaper_alternative_for_an/,"First things first, I'm an intern, so go easy on me.  If you don't know what an inclined impact tester (IIT) is, it's a device used for testing pallet setups for shipping.  It simulates the bumps and jumps a loaded pallet will experience during shipping in a worst case scenario.  [http://www.lansmont.com/ImpactTest/IT213-6K/Default.htm
](Here's an example.)  There's a link to the spec sheet on the right.

The only numerical requirements are that it accelerates a 5000 lb (2250kg) pallet to 7 ft/s (4.8 mph) (2.1 m/s), then stops it.  Additional requirements are that you can load the pallet onto the system with a forklift.  From the example testers I've looked at, an incline of 10-15 degrees is typical.  The model in the link costs $80,000.  Any ""home made"" version has to cost less than $50,000 total.

I've looked into boat rack systems (for putting boats on land), and some railroad carts.  Plus I've run the numbers using trig. and physics 1.  If the coefficient of friction between the cart that the pallet sits on and the track is 0.2 and the incline is 15 deg., it will take 12 feet of track to accelerate to the desired speed.  For a coefficient of 0.1 and an incline of 10 deg, it will take 10 feet of track.

These are for very low friction values, so I'm doubting that this will fit in a room if it only uses gravity to move the pallet.

Does anyone have any relevant experience or expertise they'd like to share?"
hanql,1,2011-05-13,I got a graphic design job less than 1 month after graduation. Just wanted to share the news / what I learned about job hunting. AMA,[deleted],IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/hanql/i_got_a_graphic_design_job_less_than_1_month/,"There's so much job seeking / unemployment talk everyday that I thought I could shed some light and give some good ideas. I'm 22, renting in Florida, and just finished a BA in Art with a Graphic Design minor. I had 2 graphic design jobs in the past 4 years totaling 10 months of employment plus 6 months of retail work. Because of my spotty work history I had no positive job references, no connections, and filling out the employment history section was always a pain. I'm not even that good of a graphic designer. There are about 10 brochures/mailers/posters I actually feel like showing.

So with all that out of the way, here's what I did. Before I graduated, I revised my resume and made 2 different copies. 1 is for applying to art and the other is for graphic design such that the art resume listed galery shows and materials used while the graphics one listed design jobs and freelance work with long descriptions of duties. I used online job searches and applied to those despite not meeting all requirements. Those are generally a waste of time unless you are over-qualified and it can be just like throwing paper into the wind. You have to go out on foot. I drove to a copy placer and had 20 copies of each resume printed on decent paper for about $7 total. I used Google maps and searched for art or design places in a nearby area. I drove to each of these places, walked into the office, and asked to speak with someone about ""employment opportunities."" I got to speak with someone almost every time and even if they weren't looking, they still gave me advice and kept my resume. There is always something to gain from talking to someone whether or not you get a job. Before you leave, make sure you get their contact info and when you finally get home, send them an email or a letter thanking them for whatever. Applications are a waste of time. If you know your application won't say much, try to find smaller places or get as far as you can without having to fill out any long forms.

So it turns out the place I now work is attached to place that printed my resume. I walked in there and only one person (out of 6) was in the office. I asked her about hiring and she said they were thinking of an intern or something as they economy has turned up a bit and they have extra work. I showed her a printed portfolio (bring something physical with you along with a resume to demonstrate your skill) and gave the resume since she said she would show it to her boss. Despite me being a bumbling idiot that day and knocking over a stack of business cards, I went home and sent her a thank you email that also worked as a cover letter. I told her I had looked at their site and I liked their stuff and I attached a digital copy of some more of my work. The great thing about follow-up emails is that a place can easily lose your resume, and that email is easily forwarded to management. I found out later that I made a strong enough impression on the woman I spoke with that he was kind of advocating for me.

But it's not done yet. I got an email from the boss asking to interview, so I said yes to any time she would like and brought the printed work from before along with another resume copy. I learned the most I've ever known about interviews during this interview. It was nothing hard or grilling. When interviewing, the interview has nothing to do with you. It's not about what you have done or who you are. It's about what they want and it's about talking. You are not representing yourself, you are just talking. Do not think of it as drawing from the limited bank of knowledge including your past and your skills. You are actually speaking from an infinite amount of possibilities aided by your previous knowledge. If they ask you a question, yes or no should never be the end of your response. Every answer you give should be a longer demonstration of what you could be for them. If they ask you what you know about a topic, you must say far more about that topic. For example, if you are asked ""What do you know about compressing JPG images without losing quality?"" You tell them all about JPGs and then about GIFs and PNGs and TIFFs. It's also important to ask them questions. Be inquisitive. There's probably some questions you honestly would like to have answers to but you're too nervous to think about. If you just start asking, those questions will come to you and you will become more confident in your position. At some point, ask if you can take a tour of the workplace. This gives you another chance to see what they work with and to say for yourself that you can do what they do or that you could improve something. If there is a boss above who you interviewed with, ask to meet that person or see if you can come back when they are available. When you go home, send another thank you.

I was always hearing about people getting jobs with luck, and it discouraged me. But that's what job hunting is, you are looking for that luck. The job you will get is most likely not listed anywhere, it's just an idea being tossed around an office. Sorting for candidates and posting jobs is a chore for employers, so if you can find them before they have to go through that, you have a much higher chance of getting hired.

Hopefully my info can help someone. I'll be moving around a lot today so I'll answer questions sporadically. I cannot give referrals and I do not know of any openings anywhere."

I went to one of the best undergraduate schools in the world and got a pretty good GPA by graduation. I then went to one of the best graduate schools in the world and got a 4.0 there. I even did research at both places. Got published as a second author a couple times as an undergrad and finished a full MS thesis as a grad student. I've worked as a thermal simulation engineer as an intern and am a full time field engineer now.

Despite all this, I don't feel like a real engineer or researcher. I don't really have a sense of how to create new mechanisms or develop new ideas. I have an idea of how the world works but it's all basic, there are no novel connections I can make. All my success I can pin on just being able to grasp things easily. I've taken classes in vastly different majors - eg physical chemistry - and been able to get As at a graduate level. But on an intuitive level, the sort where I can synthesize new ideas, I draw blanks. I don't really feel I have any skills, other than a smattering of knowledge in various useful software, like CAD and FEA.

I desperately want to work in alternative energy, but I have no idea what I could contribute in such novel industries. I feel like I would go to a company and just do drudge work that anyone with a knowledge of excel could do. I think it comes down a lack of risk taking in my mindset, an outgrowth lack of true intellectual exploration while in school. At the same time,  any ideas I do come up with lack solid physical grounding.

I have only student loan debt, I have never had any sort of large debt or credit bills (though my credit sucks from a lack of available credit history). I make enough money to get by, but not to save for the moment. Had I more money or better opportunities, I would pay off my student loan debt, take out a small personal loan just to pay it back and build credit, and then just save. I decided long ago I never wanted to own a home, I'm fine with renting and don't have any desire to live in a fancy place.

I feel like, having written this, it sounds like I sort of have my shit together. But I still feel a clinging desperation that I'm just going nowhere, that I should be doing more, but I don't know what I should do or how to position myself to make Future Me not regret more decisions than he already does. There's a lot of things I'm willing to change (losing weight, for example, giving up smoking which I've basically done), but I don't know the best things to go for with regards to self-improvement.

Does anyone have any advice? Perhaps a well-deserved swift kick in the ass?

I am graduating essentially a year early. I began college in the fall of 2008, so under normal circumstances I would be graduating in the spring of 2012. However, due to college in high school credits I am able to graduate this summer and have chosen to do so due to the financial benefits; plus, I'm so sick of school.

I'm graduating from an accredited university (choosing not to say which) with a BS in Information Sciences and a minor in Supply Chain Management. I was the treasurer and webmaster of my college's honor society for the past year, a member of the honor society for 2 years, involved in multiple other honor societies and clubs/organizations, I have an overall GPA of 3.8/4.0 and an in major GPA of 3.91/4.0, I have had two summer internships (one at a small local company, another at a major corporation), have a strong resume IMO, and an online portfolio. In addition to my degree I have experience with various computer programming languages, some more experienced than others.

I have applied to over 70 companies ranging from a local company that has less than 50 employees in the IT help desk position to developing/design positions at Apple and Google to entry level new graduate programs at various corporations including Microsoft and Google. There are many small companies and many large that I have applied to.

I haven't heard from anyone except for being denied by a new graduate position at NASA.

I know the economy is down and there is a lack of jobs, especially for inexperienced new graduates; but I know a lot of people that have received jobs ranging from their local high schools to HP and Google. I know I'm not perfect and dislike bragging, but these few friends that have landed these jobs do not have anywhere near the writing, communication, verbal, and computer skills that I do; yet they're getting jobs. I know some people in the same boat as me and some who have just taken jobs in retail at GameStop and some driving for FedEx.

But what is the deal? Any advice?

Not sure if this is relevant, but I am a white male living in the US.

So I and a few others on here are graduating seniors and in a fit of nostalgia and wanting to guide you youngers out there, I want us to share the best class(es) you ever took in college!  You don't have to be a senior to respond, by the way.  Anyone who has taken an awesome class can participate in this!

I have a few actually, and I can't decide among them.

First in the CS department, there is Video Game Programming.  This was great class, but a lot of work.  Professor Kelleher teaches you to look at game design from a different perspective than the one you'd originally see.  The whole goal is to make sure your game is *fun* before anything else.  No story, no graphics, nothing to distract from the core element.  I think a lot of the final projects turn out awesome because of the way it's taught.

Then there's Software Engineering Workshop (aka the iPhone App Class).  Basically, you work on learning how to make iPhone Apps!  The coolest thing about it, though, is while the class is fun, I would say it's one of the most important CS classes you can take at WashU if you want a job when you graduate.  Professor Sproull teaches different software development topics in between teaching the iPhone SDK.  One of the first questions they asked me at my internship interview was ""are you familiar with any software development processes?"" and I was able to answer ""yes I am!"".  They seemed surprised that I actually knew my stuff.

Finally, for a class outside the CS department.  I would definitely recommend Communication Design I and II to anyone who is even remotely interested in design.  Thanks to that class, I went from a computer nerd to...well, still a computer nerd, but one who actually has an eye for design.  I have used what I learned in that class in Video Game Programming, writing papers, formatting my resume, and even creating the [cover art](http://stereotypes.wustl.edu/music_files/familyties.jpg) for the Stereotypes' CD.  Almost every interview I have walked into, the interviewer has complimented me on how my resume is laid out.  That's because I don't use the default template in Word and the default font...like everybody else.  Essentially, this class can complement any major.  Highly recommended.  Also, the instructor is the best.  I haven't met anyone who dislikes Traci.

So what about the rest of you?"

Being a non-technical entrepreneur with a desire to join a startup (even in an unpaid intern capacity), where should one look for such positions?

It seems as if these positions don't exist? Would it be unprofessional or rude to email a few startups offering my cover letter and resume for consideration?

I am in a very tight knit group of friends. There are 5 of us, two girls and three guys. Everything has always been completely platonic. I am one of the girls. 

In the past year or so, one of the three guys and I have become very close. We were always very good friends, but in the past year we ended up taking a class together and got an internship at the same place so we spent a lot more time around each other. We have a lot of similarities and get along unbelievably well. We mesh effortlessly. He loves me to death and vice-versa. We do a lot for each other and take care of the other. 

I don't know whether or not he is physically attracted to me. He has made nice comments about my appearance in the past and I'm pretty sure he thinks I am generally good looking, but I don't know if that translates to ""I am attracted to you in that way"". I don't consider myself extremely attractive, but I'm not repulsive either. I'd say I am average. He is average himself.

Up until now, he had a girlfriend who he had been seeing since before we met for more than 2.5 years. He broke up with her a few months ago. They were not having issues caused by her, he just didn't want to be with her anymore. He felt they grew apart. 

I don't know how he feels about me. We care about each other a lot and would never want to ruin a friendship (although I'd be happier giving it a shot and returning to being friends than being afraid to try it for the sake of the friendship...I don't even believe in not dating for the sake of ""preserving a friendship""). I like him more than I'd like to admit. Sometimes I feel like he is my perfect match and it would be stupid to ignore that. We take care of each other, love each other a lot, spend tons of time together. The only thing currently missing from the picture is a romantic physical connection, because the emotional connection is already there. 

Is it even possible for two people to be this close, both single, and not fall for each other? Sometimes I feel as if this is obvious, and he must have feelings for me. But then I tell myself that is not true and try as hard as I can to crush any hopes and desires of every being more than friends. I am beyond confused. 

Cutting contact and running away from the situation is not an option. These are my closest friends and finding new ones is not something I'd ever consider. Throwing him out of my life in general is something I refuse to do. This is why the situation is so sticky. 

If you're a guy and were in a situation like this one, would you develop feelings for your friend (aka me in this situation)? Should I accept that I am in the friendzone and nothing will ever happen? Or should I try to pursue a relationship? And if so, how? 

How am I supposed to deal with these emotions?

hay9d,1,2011-05-13,I got a graphic design job less than 1 month after graduation. Just wanted to share the news / what I learned about job hunting. AMA,ishouldbepainting,IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/hay9d/i_got_a_graphic_design_job_less_than_1_month/,"Repost due to 0 votes.

There's so much job seeking / unemployment talk everyday that I thought I could shed some light and give some good ideas. I'm 22, renting in Florida, and just finished a BA in Art with a Graphic Design minor. I had 2 graphic design jobs in the past 4 years totaling 10 months of employment plus 6 months of retail work. Because of my spotty work history I had no positive job references, no connections, and filling out the employment history section was always a pain. I'm not even that good of a graphic designer. There are about 10 brochures/mailers/posters I actually feel like showing.

So with all that out of the way, here's what I did. Before I graduated, I revised my resume and made 2 different copies. 1 is for applying to art and the other is for graphic design such that the art resume listed galery shows and materials used while the graphics one listed design jobs and freelance work with long descriptions of duties. I used online job searches and applied to those despite not meeting all requirements. Those are generally a waste of time unless you are over-qualified and it can be just like throwing paper into the wind. You have to go out on foot. I drove to a copy placer and had 20 copies of each resume printed on decent paper for about $7 total. I used Google maps and searched for art or design places in a nearby area. I drove to each of these places, walked into the office, and asked to speak with someone about ""employment opportunities."" I got to speak with someone almost every time and even if they weren't looking, they still gave me advice and kept my resume. There is always something to gain from talking to someone whether or not you get a job. Before you leave, make sure you get their contact info and when you finally get home, send them an email or a letter thanking them for whatever. Applications are a waste of time. If you know your application won't say much, try to find smaller places or get as far as you can without having to fill out any long forms.

So it turns out the place I now work is attached to place that printed my resume. I walked in there and only one person (out of 6) was in the office. I asked her about hiring and she said they were thinking of an intern or something as they economy has turned up a bit and they have extra work. I showed her a printed portfolio (bring something physical with you along with a resume to demonstrate your skill) and gave the resume since she said she would show it to her boss. Despite me being a bumbling idiot that day and knocking over a stack of business cards, I went home and sent her a thank you email that also worked as a cover letter. I told her I had looked at their site and I liked their stuff and I attached a digital copy of some more of my work. The great thing about follow-up emails is that a place can easily lose your resume, and that email is easily forwarded to management. I found out later that I made a strong enough impression on the woman I spoke with that he was kind of advocating for me.

But it's not done yet. I got an email from the boss asking to interview, so I said yes to any time she would like and brought the printed work from before along with another resume copy. I learned the most I've ever known about interviews during this interview. It was nothing hard or grilling. When interviewing, the interview has nothing to do with you. It's not about what you have done or who you are. It's about what they want and it's about talking. You are not representing yourself, you are just talking. Do not think of it as drawing from the limited bank of knowledge including your past and your skills. You are actually speaking from an infinite amount of possibilities aided by your previous knowledge. If they ask you a question, yes or no should never be the end of your response. Every answer you give should be a longer demonstration of what you could be for them. If they ask you what you know about a topic, you must say far more about that topic. For example, if you are asked ""What do you know about compressing JPG images without losing quality?"" You tell them all about JPGs and then about GIFs and PNGs and TIFFs. It's also important to ask them questions. Be inquisitive. There's probably some questions you honestly would like to have answers to but you're too nervous to think about. If you just start asking, those questions will come to you and you will become more confident in your position. At some point, ask if you can take a tour of the workplace. This gives you another chance to see what they work with and to say for yourself that you can do what they do or that you could improve something. If there is a boss above who you interviewed with, ask to meet that person or see if you can come back when they are available. When you go home, send another thank you.

I was always hearing about people getting jobs with luck, and it discouraged me. But that's what job hunting is, you are looking for that luck. The job you will get is most likely not listed anywhere, it's just an idea being tossed around an office. Sorting for candidates and posting jobs is a chore for employers, so if you can find them before they have to go through that, you have a much higher chance of getting hired.

Hopefully my info can help someone. I'll be moving around a lot today so I'll answer questions sporadically. I cannot give referrals and I do not know of any openings anywhere.

It's an excellent job with decent pay and some nice perks, and I'm doing exactly what I've always wanted to do--work on a large scale web application at an internet startup.  

That being said, however, I have this feeling that if I continue doing what I'm doing I won't get a degree and I'll be stuck here.  It would be difficult with my job to go to school while working as it's a fairly demanding job.

I really wish I could fast-forward to 10 years from now when it will be really obvious which path I should take.  Has anyone else been in a similar situation?  Are you glad you got your degree or was it a gigantic waste of time and money?"

I picked it because I thought it was supposed to make a lot of money, and that kind of work would be easy for me I think. I am also really good at troubleshooting/repairing computers, but I didn't see an obvious or GOOD major for that. If there was something relevant, I don't think they make a lot of money (do they?)

Nobody I've talked to has any idea what this is, and the people at my college are very stereotypically awkward to talk to as the computer guys. Or they're really bitchy and I can't really ask them. Or I can't understand their accent. 

I haven't been able to get a job. I've been looking for an internship to try anything with computers like I wanted, but I haven't been able to get anything. Not even this summer. So when I graduate and finally see what it's like, I might not even like it.

It sucks being at home without a job again. I want to find a job so I can get my own place; my family goes to bed really early so I can never really have friends over. And if you want to meet people, you can't just invite yourself over to their house really.

I first of all don't want to, but I'm considering getting some entry level high school job. Maybe coffee or something like that (I don't even know what, and it's such a hassle to find a list of what people want to hire. And even then, it's all spam or babysitter jobs which I wont do.) Even with that though, I don't know if I'd even get enough hours to pay for a place. But even worse, I feel like I should be spending my time looking for a job relevant to what I'll be doing and if I get a high school job, I imagine I wont have the motivation to look for anything anyways. I kind of doubt I'll find a job like my maor though.

Anyone have any thoughts or advice? About the job situation, or if you know what MCS is/does? I've been looking for these answers for a while. None of my friends have any advice, they're in completely unrelated majors and jobs and have internships doing stuff they expected and such. "

hbnka,5,2011-05-14,How can I get a job in the industry I want?  I graduated from a state university 2 years ago to this weekend and still haven't had a true whiff of what I've been wanting to do.,volshans,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/hbnka/how_can_i_get_a_job_in_the_industry_i_want_i/,"I graduated Northern Illinois University in May of 2009, with a B.A. in Anthropology and a certificate in GIS.  It must have been awesome to have had a job lined up after graduation but as most people graduating large public schools knew, the cards were not in anyone's hands despite their good fortune.

I played my earlier decks well, almost accidentally, by not knowing how college worked after HS.  They passed some paper around the last few months of graduation asking where graduates were going to attend for college.  I'd not even considered the option seriously so I chose the county's community college.  I lived a grand two years, taking courses that made my mind whet and learned to live solo/progressively as best as I could.  I figured out how degrees work, how being vegan was no bueno, how raccoons scare the shit out of me when mountain biking solo at night and what treasures Appalachia hold for someone raised in the Midwest by Soviet Jewish parents.

When I graduated with honors there, I moved on to obtaining my Bachelor's at NIU.  I spent two years making intense connections with friends, dating a Japanese woman whom my family accepted as one of our own (hard to do with any gentiles ;)) and busting my ass to become happy with my dreams.  I started clubs, took over others and kept fit while learning to appreciate craft beers on the regular.  I didn't bother going to my graduation ceremony - I just wanted to get the hell out of DeKalb.  I was looking forward to utilizing what I learned there to better our society - that aloof college mantra.

Upon the final months of graduation, I dove deep into the Peace Corps process and passed through my interview process swimmingly.  But  I was disappointed in the placement so I abandoned the plans before undergoing the extended medical review.  Afterwards, I interned at a farm in central northern IL but ultimately never stayed the commitment because of factors out of my control.  I really wanted to farm, sustainably, but the winds blew me elsewhere at the time.

For a year, I worked a dead-end delivery job for my family's auto parts warehouse.  I begrudgingly watched the business fail as the economy fucked all of the service industry around us but especially the mechanics.  Laborers whose 10,15,20 year old shops went under because floating in the black was just too difficult.

Finally, after a year of dissatisfaction, I stumbled upon an internship for the North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources, Office of State Archaeology.  A glimmer of hope for me as I finally could showcase my ability to apply GIS to a needed function - digital transition to marking future dig sites.  I spent a vivid 2 months there, hoping that the unpaid internship would yield a future position with the department.  But a frozen State hiring landscape coupled with my inexperience left me option-less again.  I returned to IL once again, defeated but eager for more of what I had tasted.  I met a girl pre-trip who I'd begin dating but knowing the context of how I'd find nothing for me in IL, we'd expected a breakup when I'd somehow move away.

And so I did, move, almost instantly.  My step-brother wanted his work vehicle transported to AZ.  When he offered me work, both with him and a restaurant, I jumped at the opportunity.  I packed my seven-thousand base layers, climbing gear, track bike and will with me and drove across the US to crash at his place until I could find residence.  It took me less than a week to meet my current roommate who would be training with me for the tequila bar we'd both be working at.  I left my job with my step-brother and became a barback from busser at the bar.  The money's decent and tides me over for rent, ROTH IRA contributions and beans and rice.

But it's 2011.  May, 2011, for those still here with me.  I've been applying to GIS Technician jobs for these two years. I've submitted my package to two boards with the USAF now, results in September.  I've done nearly an internship a year since I started college and an Archaeological field school.

I'm at wit's end.  I pulled up a guide to learning Python because I'm tired of waiting for something to happen.  I've sent my info towards Teach For America because I didn't know the deadline for applying already passed.  I'm reluctant to study for the GRE because Grad School just seems like more debt to put on at this point and not means to an end right now.

I've got good amounts of cash saved. I've bought a car in cash.  I broke up with that previously mentioned girlfriend weeks ago and have been living solo for all of May now.

What am I doing wrong?  Why wont they take me?  I'm capable and eager to grow within a company.  Who keeps taking my opportunities away from me?"
hbmvr,0,2011-05-14,"Reddit, what was your greatest celebrity encounter?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/hbmvr/reddit_what_was_your_greatest_celebrity_encounter/,"I know there have been threads like this before, but I really like reading these stories. I have a pretty good one, so here it is (xposted from another thread).

The greatest encounter I've had was on a trip with my high school's ""Political Science Club"" (which I formed) to Washington, D.C. We had talked about a trip to DC throughout the year, but it was always us saying ""Who wants to go to DC?"" half-jokingly. So, we started fundraising to go and we soon realized we'd have enough money to go, so we booked a party bus for April 29, 2010. Now, earlier that year we had met a graduate of our school who was working relatively high up in the White House, so we decided what the heck, let's see if we can contact them and get a tour of the White House. We called three weeks before the trip and didn't hear back until the night before the trip. They needed all our Social Security numbers, but we couldn't get in contact with all the members of the club so we just told them ""looks like we can't do it.""

So, we left our school at 4:30AM and began our trip to Washington, D.C. About two hours into the trip, we got a call from a secretary of the person we knew asking if we had the SS numbers, which we did. We gave them to her and she said she'd see if we'd be able to get in. A half-hour out of D.C. we get a call saying we're getting a tour of the White House. We were all happy. I remember someone saying ""What if we see Obama,"" to which another member replied ""We have a better chance of seeing John Kennedy.""

Before the White House tour, we went to the Newseum (had already bought the tickets). It's a pretty cool place, but we were only there for about 15 minutes. It turns out Oprah was doing a live taping and had a correspondent in the Newseum for her No Phone Zone thing. There was a huge crowd, and for a brief period we all thought Oprah was there. She wasn't, and the crowd that had gathered really started getting in the way, especially since we were trying to get in and out. 

We got dropped off in front of the entrance to the White House where we met a White House intern that had been sent for us. She took us to the front of the line, which was pretty awesome. She also served as our tour guide, because strangely enough the White House tour is normally self guided. Before we went into the White House, the secretary told me and my friend ""I don't think I'm supposed to tell you this, but you're in for a surprise. Marine One is taking off at noon and we're going to put you on the South Lawn to watch it."" 

Wow. We didn't even know what to think. In fact, we were so out of it we actually asked the nice lady ""will the President be getting on it,"" to which she replied ""Yeah, it's his helicopter."" So of course we didn't listen to a word of the tour because we were anticipating watching the President take off in the helicopter. We met with the person who made this all possible, and they took us back to where we had began. We were briefed by Secret Service and the director of the White House tours as to what to expect and what to do in the event of an emergency. I remember the Secret Service telling us ""If there's gunfire, do not run. Duck and walk back here. This is your safe zone. Do. Not. Run."" That was probably one of the most terrifying things I've ever heard.

We were let [out onto the South Lawn](http://i.imgur.com/QgpIQ.jpg) 5 minutes before any other tourists because of our connection, and gathered in front of a rope line. I was surprised by the lack of security; all that separated us from where the president was walking was a thin rope. I'm aware if any of us crossed that rope at any time, we'd either be shot or tackled immediately, but it was surprising nonetheless. It felt so strange being so close to the [back of the White House](http://i.imgur.com/odGDC.jpg). 

Across from us was [the press pool](http://i.imgur.com/2nrDv.jpg). It seemed like an endless line of cameras. I was surprised by the amount of press there to film him walking from the White House to the helicopter, but I realized if anything had happened, they'd all want the footage of it. 

After what had seemed like an eternity, the [helicopter appeared](http://imgur.com/vOshE.jpg) out of no where. Then we waited for another lifetime, when suddenly the President [emerged from the back door](http://imgur.com/6EEnJ). As he was walking, I shouted ""President Obama"" as if he would hear me shouting and walk over. Then, as he was walking, he [saw the staffer](http://i.imgur.com/4Oprb.jpg) who got us there, recognized them, and walked over to ask why they were out here. The staffer explained the situation, so President Obama walked the rope shaking our hands. RIGHT BEFORE HE GOT TO ME, HE WAVED AND WALKED AWAY. I said ""No, Mr. President,"" as if he would turn around and come back. 

Well, he did. And he shook my hand (proven by [this glorious photo](http://i.imgur.com/a3ziF.jpg) of him turning back)

That was the best encounter, because of both the odds of it happening and the fact it was the President. Here's a [video I took of it all](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHi1_GP8fYE) and here's [a photo of me taking the video](http://i.imgur.com/cMrCm.jpg) and him shaking my friends hand. 

TL;DR I met the President on the South Lawn of the White House. [Here's the video I took](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHi1_GP8fYE). "

In order to get into dental school, a student needs to have job shadowing experience and letters of recommendation, among many other things. Therefore, last summer, I began to intern at a medical center which incorporates dentistry, plastic surgery, and medical spa all in one business. One thing that the dentist liked about me was that I had extensive experience in filming and video editing. The first project that they assigned to me was to film and edit their seventh year anniversary event. They told me that since this was outside my duties, they would pay me. I did get paid for this gig. 

After doing my third video project, the plastic surgeon, who is the dentist’s husband offered to do a surgical procedure for me, which costs about $2000. I thought about it for a long time, because I wasn’t sure if it was what I wanted and if it was going to put me in a sticky situation. After a month of consideration, I decided to do it. After all, I was putting in at least 8 hours every week, and the majority of my time there didn’t have to do much with dentistry at all. My main duties consisted of clerical work, such as putting in deposits, paying bills, installing software, getting mail, answering phones, and etc. Sometimes they made me take care of their personal businesses, such as picking up their cars in from the auto shop. Also, they wanted to use my surgery as a showcase for their business. Therefore, I was filmed during the surgery and had to conduct interviews of myself before and after the surgery. Finally, I created a 25 minute video capturing my experience of the surgery. 

After the surgery, however, they began to call me for their daughter’s talent shows, birthday party, and ballet recitals, to film and make DVDs from. They always said they would pay me for these extraneous duties outside of my internship, but they never did. I would have liked to get paid for putting in my time and effort, but never bothered to persistently ask for the money, because I didn’t want to put a strain on our relationship and I still appreciated the surgery that they did for me. 

This week, they assigned another video project to me (I think this is my seventh one, I think). I really did not wish to take on another project, because I am already busy with finals, looking for a research job, and preparing for my study abroad this summer. I finally told the dentist my concern, that I was straying away from what I truly came to do, to observe dentists and staff, to learn more about dentistry. I told her that I wanted to stop taking on projects and doing clerical work, and assist in her dental practice more. She became very upset, brought up the surgery, and told me that doing these projects and clerical work will show me things that dental schools don’t teach students. I told her that I was sorry, and that I really did appreciate her for giving me these opportunities, and that I would still take on the video project and help install new software tomorrow. She did not write back. 

I am just scared that I’ve put a strain on our relationship. I am wondering if I should just leave, because she probably will not write me a good letter of recommendation, and probably will not provide me the clinical experience that I need. However, I am also afraid that she will try to make me pay for the surgery if I leave. I would really appreciate it if redditors could provide me with some legal and personal advice on this matter. Thank you in advance. "

We met in grad school, and he just graduated and starts a job in another city 12 hrs away soon. I was able to find a great job in the same city, and we have an apartment where we will both be working.

The problem is, I am stuck in the city where our grad school is for the summer. My job is a teaching position that won't start until mid-August, and I have an internship in this city for the summer. I need to finish writing my thesis and defend this summer in order to finish my master's degree. So, I'm here, in a house with just a twin size bed, everything else moved to the new city last week. My cat and my man are 12 hours away.

Does anyone have any suggestions on how to make this summer suck a little less? I'm so excited to move and be with my cat and boyfriend in August, but in the mean time, I don't know what to do. We have been working together (both grad assistants) and living together which means pretty much 24/7 exposure to each other. Now, bam. 2.5 months apart.

TL;DR BF is starting a new job in a new city, and I'm stuck 12 hrs away trying to finish my thesis, living in an empty house without my man and cat. How do I get through this summer?"
hbk64,7,2011-05-14,I don't know why my parents are still together,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/hbk64/i_dont_know_why_my_parents_are_still_together/,"I had the best childhood that could have been granted to a kid. Loving parents, loving family, great sister, great school, everything. I was the happiest kid. 

I think that I discovered that everything was an illusion when I was around 12 or something. It was not only an early puberty hitting me, but it was me realizing that my dad has been cheating on my mother for the longest time. Multiple affairs with random hookers, everything. I told my mom about it too, and she told me she knew it.

I am having a hard time continuing writing. I don't know, I am not particularly bothered by this anymore as long as I don't bring it up, but deep down there are things that are not resolved. that's why every time that I get upset (which is actually rare), I think about these things.

My father is a cheater, but exactly a not a bad person either. I know for a fact that he loves me and my sister, and he really cares about my mother in his own way. It is just that I guess he is a horny guy and my mother can't satisfy him I guess, or something,  but it sucks to be aware of this as their daughter. 

I think when I was in a sophomore in high school though everything started getting a lot worse. Still no yelling, no shouting, no violence whatsoever, but constant passive agressiveness and ignoring each other-- and I guess each of them found me as an understanding person who would listen, so I heard a lot of things against my dad from mom (how he has all this money that he is not spending on our family but his businesses that are destined to fail, how he is a workaholic and how he should have paid more attention to us kids) These were all true, especially the attention part, we would only see our dad no more than an hour every day, and he would just ask us how our day went and he would go to his room and hang out there. Over the weekends he would hang out with his friends or travel alone partially for business and partially to hang out by himself. I honestly think that I might have other siblings that I do not know about. 

On the other hand, on the rare occasions that I'd spend my time with my father, he would constantly talk about his jobs and how I should be the person to take care of everything that he has accomplished, and how I should have been the person to follow his footsteps and continue with the businesses. I got a full ride to a very very accredited university and I was studying political science and literature when the last time he insisted that I took up his job, which led me to explode and tell him a big NO. After that our relationship has transformed and he started to do the exact thing to my sister.

I feel very very upset for my sister because she is only 14 now and she is living with my parents obviously. My mom became an upset and angry person over time, because of the dysfunctional marriage that she refused to get out of even though she has been making her own money. My sister being a regular teenager, my mom does not have a quarter of the patience that she had with me with my sister, and they fight a lot for non-substantial stuff, mutually hurting each other. Both of them deserve so much better, but they just can't get along and there is nothing to be done about this. In the mean time I am studying 1000 miles away.

I have received a summer grant for my summer internship here in Los Angeles and my parents were supportive of this up until a couple of hours ago. They have just found out that my internship is only two days a week, while my grant is enough to cover my rent and all my living expenses. Now they are telling me to come back and spend some time with them, and I don't know how to say that the only reason why I am actually doing this is because I can't stand seeing them constantly hurt each other. Maybe I should go and try to be the mediator in everything and fix things, but when I go home, it also brings the worst out of me, I become angry and upset too because I don't know how to deal with the multiple minor situations that arise everyday, I don't feel peaceful. I have crafted the perfect escape for the summer but my parents are not idiots, and it will hurt them so much if they realize I actually don't like being with them.

Honestly, I love every single member of my family (mom, dad, sister) dearly but they just can't get along, and I hate to see them fight (or ignore each other, or get passive aggressive), but I feel extremely guilty because I have chosen to run away-- I know that my presence would actually make things better regardless of me getting more stressed out.

Also, I feel a little alone. I am in Los Angeles now and all my friends have left as the school is over. I don't know anyone, I don't know what i'll do exactly. I've met a couple of people online and I've been to some dates, I am a socially capable person therefore it's not that difficult to make friends, but at the same time, it'll be nothing like hanging out with my best friends in my hometown. 

i don't know why I have been writing all these things, how any kind of advice will help me, or if I even need help. I just feel kinda guilty and I feel upset that my parents can't love each other. But at the same time, I know that I am extremely lucky as I am financially well off at 21, and that's all me, I am graduating completely debt free, I haven't even paid housing for school and I am not paying housing or any expenses for the summer, it's all taken care of because I studied hard and I've been lucky enough that my efforts were appreciated by institutions. I know that people go through really really fucked up shit and I shouldn't even be complaining about anything, but I don't know, I guess I feel the way that I feel and I just need to shut up and suck it up, or do something about it. I just don't know what. I don't know how not to hurt my family more with my absence or hurt myself with my presence. I am confused.

I'm a senior in college. Last summer I did a 6 month internship at a large, multinational company. I met this guy there who goes also goes to my school and was on an internship at the same place. Now let me start by saying this kid is 22 years old. I took him out for his 21st birthday. However I'm thoroughly convinced that mentally he's mentally a five year old.

Basically all he does is play video games. One of those kids. Except he doesn't even play intelligent games, he sits around all day playing his Wii. He once told me that he had stayed up until 5AM all week (while we were working) playing Carnival Games for the Wii. Or Mario Party on the Wii, with the baby minigames. That's the kind of games he plays all day.

While I was on my internship, he literally brought a backpack full of games to work with him every day. Tic-Tac-Toe, Checkers, connect four, simon says, stuff a 5 year old would enjoy playing. He literally had a backpack full of games like this on him at all times. We would play them at lunch sometimes, which was cool. I asked him if he could bring something like Chess or Uno (you know, something that takes more than the mental capacity of a 5 year old to play). Instead, he started bringing Mad Libs.

Now, this was all good and fun, for the first couple weeks at work. We would hang out at lunch and play games or pool. I would try to crack jokes, but they would always go over his head.

----------

Him: ""Hey want to play doodie-ull?""

Me: ""What?""

Him: ""Doodie-ull. See, I took the word pool, and replaced 'poo' with 'doodie', HAHAHA!"" (laughs really loud and obnoxiously)

Me: ""...""

----------

About the extent of his sense of humor.

And the fucking Mad Libs. We did a couple in the first couple weeks, each of us filling in the blanks with poop/gross related things. You know, like you do when you're 5. It's fun once in awhile. He could not keep his shit on the downlow though. He would always read these Mad Libs REALLY loud in the cafeteria, and laugh really loud and obnoxiously at them. While my coworkers were sitting nearby. Even after I would tell him to shut the fuck up, he wouldn't get the picture. After I quickly stopped participating in the mad libs, he would fill them out by himself, and then still read them out. LOUDLY. and laugh. really loudly and obnoxiously. Many times I just stood up and left in the middle of lunch it would get so out of hand. Once he literally sat there and read poop related mad libs out loud while the President and VP of this large, multinational company walked around and talked with people in the lunchroom. They didn't go anywhere near the table he was sitting at.

I thought it was obvious that you shouldn't act like that during lunch WHILE AT WORK. Aren't we trying to make a good impression here? This guy is 22 fucking years old. I figured he would have at least a cursory understanding of what's appropriate socially. I was dead wrong.

And it didn't start out that bad. He would just throw a doodie reference in there every once in awhile and we'd laugh. Eventually, over several months, it got way out of hand to what you see above. It was a gradual process. Saying stuff like:

""dude, keep it down""

""People are looking at us""

""Don't fucking shout""

""Dude, what is your fucking problem? Stop yelling about shit at the top of your lungs. This is supposed to be a professional environment.""

had no effect.

At first, I thought this kid was just a really good IRL troll. Because after all, who doesn't like a poop or fart joke once in awhile? But no, after knowing him for almost a year, I know that it's for real, and literally nothing else goes through that kids head. I would tell him this, sometimes rudely, daily. At first, we would talk about games, tv, music, etc, but he would ALWAYS degrade the conversation to poop, farts, and doodies. Every time. As time went on, there was less and less time spent talking about normal shit before he would start talking about doodies and laughing obnoxiously to himself.

Then the text messages started.

After I made it very clear to him that talking about that shit ALL THE FUCKING TIME, especially that obnoxiously at work, was not cool and he should shut up, he started sending me doodie text messages. Up to 5 or 6 a day. I would never respond or acknowledge them. Seriously, look at this:

----------

Note, I went through 3 phones over that internship, so these are just some of the messages on the phone I currently have. They started about a month before that and continued across all 3 phones.

In 6 months, I responded ONCE to these messages. Here it is for reference:

----------

* [sole response](http://imageshack.us/m/853/9049/snap20110415115756.png)

----------

Now again, I would get 5-6 of these per day, every day, AND NEVER EVER RESPOND. And he'd keep sending them. Eventually I blocked his number though my cell provider. No more messages. Until like 3 months later when I saw him in passing at school. I later got this from him on facebook:

----------

* [facebook msg](http://imageshack.us/m/233/8835/74551698.png)

----------

Yes, he actually called me ""Charmander"". He refused to call me anything else.

I didn't get any texts though. Until a couple weeks ago when I got another one. Promptly sent him this (green message):

----------

----------

A few days later I get this:

----------

* [wtf](http://imageshack.us/m/42/1529/snap20110415115845.png)

----------

Yes, after I blocked his phone number and told him, he used one of those web-based text message services to send me that.

Again, if I didn't know this kid personally, I would think he was the best, most devoted troll of all time. But no, this is literally who he is. This is literally all he thinks about and all that goes through his head.

A couple week ago I got this:

----------

* [wtf2](http://img694.imageshack.us/img694/2694/snap20110501214605.png)

----------

Then I got on facebook and messaged him and told him he has no life.

----------

Anyway, how can I fuck with him? Despite the fact that sending me this shit over 8 months after I told him not to legally constitutes harassment, I considered outing him publicly on facebook, but he blocked me from seeing or posting on his wall.  I'm still FB friends with him, but can't view any aspect of his profile at all.

----------

Anyway, I posted this on another message board I go to a couple weeks ago and people got a kick out of it.  I figure people here would too."

After I quickly stopped participating in the mad libs, he would fill them out by himself, and then still read them out. LOUDLY. and laugh. really loudly and obnoxiously. Many times I just stood up and left in the middle of lunch it would get so out of hand. Once he literally sat there and read poop related mad libs out loud while the President and VP of this large, multinational company walked around and talked with people in the lunchroom. They didn't go anywhere near the table he was sitting at.

I thought it was obvious that you shouldn't act like that during lunch WHILE AT WORK. Aren't we trying to make a good impression here? This guy is 22 fucking years old. I figured he would have at least a cursory understanding of what's appropriate socially. I was dead wrong.

And it didn't start out that bad. He would just throw a doodie reference in there every once in awhile and we'd laugh. Eventually, over several months, it got way out of hand to what you see above. It was a gradual process. Saying stuff like:

""dude, keep it down""
""People are looking at us""
""Don't fucking shout""
""Dude, what is your fucking problem? Stop yelling about shit at the top of your lungs. This is supposed to be a professional environment.""

had no effect.

At first, I thought this kid was just a really good IRL troll. Because after all, who doesn't like a poop or fart joke once in awhile? But no, after knowing him for almost a year, I know that it's for real, and literally nothing else goes through that kids head. I would tell him this, sometimes rudely, daily. At first, we would talk about games, tv, music, etc, but he would ALWAYS degrade the conversation to poop, farts, and doodies. Every time. As time went on, there was less and less time spent talking about normal shit before he would start talking about doodies and laughing obnoxiously to himself.

Then the text messages started.

After I made it very clear to him that talking about that shit ALL THE FUCKING TIME, especially that obnoxiously at work, was not cool and he should shut up, he started sending me doodie text messages. Up to 5 or 6 a day. I would never respond or acknowledge them. Seriously, look at this:

Note, I went through 3 phones over that internship, so these are just some of the messages on the phone I currently have. They started about a month before that and continued across all 3 phones.

In 6 months, I responded ONCE to these messages. Here it is for reference:

http://imageshack.us/m/853/9049/snap20110415115756.png

Now again, I would get 5-6 of these per day, every day, AND NEVER EVER RESPOND. And he'd keep sending them. Eventually I blocked his number though my cell provider. No more messages. Until like 3 months later when I saw him in passing at school. I later got this from him on facebook:

http://imageshack.us/m/233/8835/74551698.png

Yes, he actually called me ""Charmander"". He refused to call me anything else.

I didn't get any texts though. Until a couple weeks ago when I got another one. Promptly sent him this (green message):

A few days later I get this:

http://imageshack.us/m/42/1529/snap20110415115845.png

Yes, after I blocked his phone number and told him, he used one of those web-based text message services to send me that.

Again, if I didn't know this kid personally, I would think he was the best, most devoted troll of all time. But no, this is literally who he is. This is literally all he thinks about and all that goes through his head.

A couple week ago I got this:

http://img694.imageshack.us/img694/2694/snap20110501214605.png

Then I got on facebook and messaged him and told him he has no life.

----------

Anyway, how can I fuck with him? Despite the fact that sending me this shit over 8 months after I told him not to legally constitutes harassment, I considered outing him publicly on facebook, but he blocked me from seeing or posting on his wall.  I'm still FB friends with him, but can't view any aspect of his profile at all.

----------

Anyway, I posted this on another message board I go to a couple weeks ago and people got a kick out of it.  I figure people here would too."

I've got myself a kickass (but non-paying) internship at Marvel Entertainment in NY and one more year left of college. I'm currently living in a beautiful and super cheap apartment in Philly that I'd love to keep, but I'm having some trouble. Moving back home is not really an option at this point.

I have kept somewhat good grades (A's and B's) and they'd definitely be higher if I wasn't working so much. I currently work as a freelance web designer with odd but regular jobs on the side. I also take a lot of free and underpaid jobs, just to get my name out there. I work really hard. I have the biggest dreams for myself and my work.

Today my family called to ask me for a pretty ridiculous sum of money to help them pay their mortgage. They're in a great deal of debt and living with them, is living in a very unstable and stressful environment. They've got two other children to put through college, so asking them to cosign a loan is impossible. I know this. I've got no extended family to ask to be a cosigner, as our family was basically disowned.

I'm just asking for a stress free summer and senior year, so that I can focus on my work and make the most of my internship. I have been working really, REALLY hard this far and I'm reaching my breaking point. 

And yes, I've gone to financial aid on several occasions and it sounds like they can't offer us any more.

hckap,4,2011-05-16,"Reddit, have you ever had an experience with a fortuneteller or psychic medium that was inexplicably accurate? ",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/hckap/reddit_have_you_ever_had_an_experience_with_a/,"Let me preface by saying that I am a pretty cynical person and have a lot of trouble believing in anything supernatural. I've always assumed that psychic fortunetellers were opportunists taking advantage of gullible clients, and that any accuracy in their predictions could be attributed to either

1. Self-fulfilling prophecy (Wherein the client unconsciously attempts to make their fortune come true)

2. Vagueness (The medium's fortune is so vaguely worded that the client can twist it to fit any situation)

3. Telling a client what they want to hear so they are more inclined to believe it (""You have great love in your future!""), or

4. Pure coincidence.  

However, I recently heard a story that makes me more of a believer...

While driving through Florida, my roommate's mom decided to stop in the town of [Cassadaga](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassadaga,_Florida), which is called the ""Psychic Capital of the World.""  She met with a medium who not only knew the makeup of my roommate's family, but the short-term fates of each member. Without my roommate's mom revealing that she was divorced from her husband and that she had three children (two daughters, aged 21 and 19, and one son age 17), the medium told her that:

1. her eldest daughter (my roommate) would become a published author by the end of the year, and that her relationship was doomed to fail. My roommate interns for a very famous magazine, and her blogs have recently become published on their website with full credit given to her.  And, you guessed it, her and her boyfriend broke up (at the time of the break up, they never heard about this part of the prediction). 

2. her youngest daughter needs to practice safer sex.  The mom never found about this, but soon after this prediction occurred the daughter in question had a very dramatic pregnancy scare.

3. not to give up on her son.  The son is the ""black sheep"" of the family--overweight, drugged out, failing high school, etc. But since this prediction, he's turned his life around. He lost a lot of weight, got his grades up, stopped doing drugs, got accepted to a few colleges, and managed to get himself a girlfriend. 

4. the father of her children would get married within the year.  This, to me, was the most surprising. The father is a serial polygamist and cheater who, after divorcing the mother over 15 years ago, has not managed to date the same woman for over 8 months. He's getting married this June.

Because all of these predictions require intimate knowledge of each family member's situation and personality, I am finding it very difficult to write off the results as mere chance.  Reddit, do you have any similar stories? Are there ""true"" psychics out there? "
hciw5,1,2011-05-16,"I'm subletting with friends this summer, but they don't want to split the rooms evenly. Help!",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/hciw5/im_subletting_with_friends_this_summer_but_they/,"I thought I'd get a couple opinions on this one, so let's give it a go.

About a month ago, me and two friends decided that we would get a place for the summer, since we would all be in the same city doing undergraduate research with our school.

After two near confirmations on Craiglist, which led to two failures (you wouldn't believe how fast sublets get taken), we finally were able to submit a sublet form and confirm our housing with a nice three-bedroom apartment.

Now the backstory is that I've done about 90% of the work, emailing, calling, and checking out every single apartment we were interested in. Besides talking about the places over email or occasionally coming along with me to check out the place, I've been handling most of the conversations with potentials. We were originally going to be finding a three-bedroom and split it evenly three ways, utilities and all.

Now flash forward to the place we have now, and the people we're renting from have the bedrooms priced differently. We're supposed to pay each person separately as well. They're priced at about 750, 800, and 850 per month, for two and a half months.

Roommate B is automatically assigned the 800 room. He'll be staying for a couple extra days since Roommate A and I have early return housing to campus, and the 800 room is the only one open for a couple days extra.

Now Roommate A takes the 750 room. I let him choose that room, since he's been complaining he might not be able to get a paid research position this summer and thus siphoning his summer funds off his parents to pay for his part of the sublet. 

Now this leads to me to take the 850 room, obviously the largest room (but not by much). Disgruntled as I was at the time, I chose not to complain because - hey, what's a $250 difference (between the 750 and the 850 for 2.5 months) between poor college students? So we signed the contracts and confirmed out housing for the summer.

But obviously I wouldn't be here asking this question is $250 is a lot for someone like me. My parents can't afford to pay for any part of my summer costs, so I'm thankful I'm getting paid a couple thousand for the summer. Honestly, $250 can practically buy me groceries for several weeks here. 

So I approached my friends about this but obviously they seemed content to pay less than me and are basically saying no. Every time I approach the subject, Roommate A complains he's not getting paid and that splitting things between us evenly and then paying off the people we're subletting is too much of a roundabout way to do things. Roommate B does his best to do as little work as possible as well as shirk the question every time.

I've done pretty much all the work in finding the apartment, and I don't want to stir up trouble too much because money shouldn't have to get between friends. But when Roommate A said, ""In the real world, people don't give a shit about how much you work. You think Google interns get as much as the Google CEO?"" I was very much tempted to hold his head underwater for a couple minutes. (god I hope none of them read this).

I guess my mistake was in letting Roommate A choose which room he wanted instead of me jumping on the cheapest one, but he kept complaining about price and so I let it go and I hate being confrontation anyhow. And everytime I approach the situation, he tries to deflect it by saying we should be both be going after Roommate B for doing even less work and being less responsive. 

We'll still be splitting everything else evenly like utilities, but it pains me to have done all the work in acquiring the apartment, only to be paying the most out of my friends. I'm lost how to approach this now since it seems both my friends don't want to back down.

(sorry for the long post, but you have to read it to understand the whole story properly)

Do you think this is fair, and if not, what should I do!? This is stressing me out a lot actually, especially since they're both friends who just happen to piss me off at the moment.

TL;DR My roommates are paying less than me because of differently priced rooms, but I did most of the work and somehow got stuck with the most expensive one.

EDIT
Originally before signing the contracts, I talked to them about splitting it evenly, and they pretty called me out on making it more expensive for them so I backed down (""yes"" to anything you'll say about this part. I was retarded)

Techinically, Roommate B is making about three times what I am paying, and I'm making just enough to pay for sublet and food for the summer. 

So far I guess the consensus is that I was dumb and did it to myself. I wish I knew that I was going to be making tons of money down the road and looking back it wasn't going to matter, but architect majors end up poor D: Ah well... thanks for the advice everyone."

hccnt,4,2011-05-16,Losing weight and getting fit while constantly on the road?,gtslow,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/hccnt/losing_weight_and_getting_fit_while_constantly_on/,"I am wondering if anyone out there in /r/loseit are in the same boat I am.  I am most likely taking a consulting position where I will be on the road most of the time.  This will usually be Sunday-Friday gigs and I will be doing them 2-3 weeks out of the month on the norm.

I have lost 26 pounds from my peak which I put on starting during my internship during school and continuing through my current position.  I attribute my 268 pound peak to a combination of sloth and poor diet choices. 

I lost the 26 pounds through diet control mostly but I have also put on a lot of muscle through weight training.  Currently I am strictly doing 5x5 routine 3 days a week and starting to get my diet under control again after my wife and I recently had our first son.

I recently had my first take of life on the road, and although rewarding from a career perspective I found it hard to control what I was eating like before and getting to the gym was more than a challenge.  Breakfast was easy since I had oatmeal from the hotel's continental breakfast.

I will be working with co-workers at client sites for the next few weeks, but after that I will be flying solo.  

My thought on fitness was to buy a set of resistance bands and start doing p90x instead of my 5x5 routine when I am on the road.  If there is a suitable gym available I will do SL5x5, but most hotel gyms don't have free weights.  I absolutely abhor running and I think I am still a bit too heavy to do any sort of distance jogging for fear of hurting my knees.  Currently I weight 243.  Recent low before my son was born was 237.   

For diet I had a couple of ideas.  If the hotel room includes a small kitchen, I could always buy groceries and cook for myself.  I could make a single grocery shopping trip when I fly in.  If I am eating out I could pretty much stick to lean protein or something like subway.  If I eat mainstream fast food it is pretty easy to track calories albeit not at all healthy.

Do you guys have any thoughts?

TL/DR:  Taking job where I will be on the road.  Any ideas for workout/diet to continue losing weight?"

I don't know if there's a phobia or a term for this, but my fear of rejection is what keeps me from doing anything. In my mindset, I'd rather nothing happen than be rejected. I guess this can apply for other things too in my life; I'd never try out for sports teams because I would just assume I wouldn't be able to make it.

Experiences with this problem I can recall from elementary school; in 4th grade I wanted to ask a girl out so I made her a valentine card. I couldn't give it to her myself though so my rowdy friend had to practically steal it from me and give it to her. I wasn't there for it but he later told me she said it was against her religion to do it or something like that.

In 5th grade, a girl I liked more than a lot was practically best friends with me the entire year. Her friends even yelled at me for not asking her out and soon the year ended and it was too late because I wouldn't see this girl ever again throughout middle school and high school. She surprisingly goes to my college now and we smile and wave whenever we see each other.

The only time I've ever asked out girls has been on the internet, and once through a text to a girl who lived on the other coast of the country from me and I had only ever been with her during an internship. She accepted but we ended up never seeing each other again so we broke it off.

Sorry if this is the wrong place to post this, I just really needed to get this off my chest somewhere. Who knows, maybe this will give me a chance to get kicked into shape.

Last summer, I was going through a lot of family problems. It was a lot for me to handle. I met a really great guy, and he wanted me to date him. I was not in a good place mentally to date someone seriously. At first I tried. We kept scheduling dates, and something would happen and I'd have to cancel. We spent more time emailing, texting, and talking on the phone than in person. He was understanding about everything and tried to be my friend, but in the end he said it wasn't enough. We stopped talking in January because he wanted more than I could give him at the time. He told me that whenever I felt ready to date, to let him know. He didn't want to turn his back on what we could have. 

Since then, I've been going to a therapist and getting help. My family problems are getting better. I finally feel like I am in a good place mentally. I want to contact him and see what happens. The problem is that I am about to leave for the summer for an internship. I am going to be on another continent until August. So should I contact him now? Or wait until I get back in August?

I feel so antsy about contacting him. I want to talk to him because I miss him so much. But I don't think it's fair to contact him when I won't be around for a while.

In 5th grade, a girl I liked more than a lot was practically best friends with me the entire year. Her friends even yelled at me for not asking her out and soon the year ended and it was too late because I wouldn't see this girl ever again throughout middle school and high school. She surprisingly goes to my college now and we smile and wave whenever we see each other.


The only time I've ever asked out girls has been on the internet, and once through a text to a girl who lived on the other coast of the country from me and I had only ever been with her during an internship. She accepted but we ended up never seeing each other again so we broke it off.


I'm not sure if anyone even has anything to ask me but I just really needed to get this off my chest somewhere. Who knows, maybe this will give me a chance to get kicked into shape."

I'll be taking the GRE, TOEFL/IELTS, and French DALF B2 exams asap to get them out of the way. Because of the internship in France, I need to postpone my graduation date by a year so that'll be in May 2012. What should I do, and what can I do, to get a scholarship to do my Masters?

A bit about Masters: ideally, I want to do something interdisciplinary &amp; contributive, like Development Engineering (scoped courses in Tokyo, Netherlands) or Engineering &amp; Public Policy (scoped in CMU USA and CEU Hungary among others).

I'm really on panic mode; if I don't get any scholarship, there's no way at all to pursue this path, and I definitely don't want to be a Chemical Engineer or researcher, ever.

I've been following the connection trail to get in touch with people with interesting jobs, so I can ask questions about what they do, what skills/classes/experience I should be working on, that sort of thing...also, that way they know my name and I have a tiny ""in"" if there's an internship or job opening at their workplace. So far I've met with and emailed with a handful of really interesting people, but I've run into trouble on this last one. 

A family friend's partner email-introduced me to one woman, who gave me the contact info of this second woman, whose work is a lot closer to my field. The problem is that my ongoing depression/social anxiety issues (which I've been working on for a long time and have been handling well for the past year or so) really hit me hard during finals this semester...now it's been three weeks since I got her contact info, and I still haven't emailed her. During finals, I was too busy and stressed, and the thought of working on that kind of email seemed completely overwhelming. After finals, I started freaking out because I'd waited so long, and I felt like I needed to explain myself, but I didn't know how. 

I want to end the loop and write the damn thing, but I'm not sure how to explain what happened. Do I chalk it up to ""personal issues"" and leave it at that? Is that sufficient to explain 3 weeks' delay? She definitely knows that I've had her info this whole time, and I don't want her to feel like I'm ungrateful and I don't value her input...I'm worried that she'll just that if I'm too vague. I'd also really appreciate any advice on how to phrase my explanation, since I tend to stress a lot about things like that. Thanks for any advice!

Should I be concerned?,internconcern,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/hdkfx/noncompetition_agreement_for_an_internship_should/,"I am finishing college this year, and was offered a summer internship that I'm very enthusiastic about. I've been told that there is a good chance the internship can be extended and that there may be a possibility for a full-time position after.

However, I recently got the official offer paperwork, and it includes a non-compete agreement covering one year after termination of employment. While this is common in the industry, it seems very strange for an internship position with no benefits that may only last three months. I'm excited about the position but don't want to ruin my chances for a good full-time position in the future, although the document says that former employees may request exemption.

I really don't know much about this issue. Hopefully some more experienced employees on Reddit can help me out. Is this something I should ask HR about before signing? Any other advice?

Thanks so much in advance!

Edit: Thanks for the advice so far! I am planning on voicing my concerns to HR, but this whole negotiation business is very awkward for me, so I'm trying to figure out how to go about it. FWIW, I will probably take this position regardless, but I want to see if there is a way to avoid the non-compete/make sure it is not going to hinder me in the future. Right now, it is my only option after graduation, it pays well by my standards, and is in an industry that I really want to work in.

UPDATE: I emailed HR for clarification and it went even better than expected! I was reassured that it is only specific to projects and data that I would be working on, and that I would never be stopped from exploring opportunities with competitors.

hd6ec,0,2011-05-17,Second abortion 2 weeks ago today. Then cheated on my boyfriend. Not able to cope. What do I do?,stuff_and_stuff,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/hd6ec/second_abortion_2_weeks_ago_today_then_cheated_on/,"Hey Reddit,

I wrote the title to this post and felt like a monster, but there's no other way of putting it: it's what happened. I'm posting this to try and explain myself and get some help.

I had an abortion two weeks ago today. It was my second--I had the first one about two years ago and still think about it almost every day. 

When I told my boyfriend I was pregnant, it was 2 in the morning, raining, outside his apartment. He got really angry. 

His initial response was ""No"" and after we talked about it for a little while longer, I told him that I was thinking about ending the pregnancy. He agreed and told me that we were in it together but he needed some space to think and so I went home in a cab. The next morning I made an appointment at Planned Parenthood to get a medical abortion. 

Over the course of the week I moved between feeling complete despair and numbness, which had not so much to do with socio-cultural stigma or my even wanting to have a baby, but more this feeling that I'd really, really, really fucked up everything.

Medical abortion works like this: you take a pill at the clinic that kills the fetus, then you take another pill 24 hours later that makes your uterus eject everything. Lots of blood, severe cramping, lots of throwing up, for pretty much a full day. 

He went with me to the appointment, held me in the waiting room, took a nap with me when we got home. Then, he came over the next day and held me through most of the graphic, awful parts. And the next morning, I woke up and I could smile and feel okay because he was still next to me.

But over the next week, I went back to feeling numb or full of despair. We didn't really talk about what'd happened, I think because neither of us really knew how to. I guess I seemed outwardly fine, or that's what he told me.

Then, my ex-boyfriend visited me and my roommate. He'd been good friends with my roommate throughout college and we'd been on good, platonic terms for several months after not speaking to each other for four years. Anyway, long story short, we took a lot of xanax and drank a lot and then I cheated on my boyfriend.

Then, I ignored my boyfriend's phone calls for 2 days, lied to him, and kept taking xanax. Eventually, he came to my house and I admitted what had happened and everything fell apart.

It's been another week and I feel bereft and lost. I know that it's my fault--the relationship and the abortion, and that I have no right to ask for anyone's pity, especially not his, but I don't know how to cope with how I feel. I've let my job and internship slide, I'm broke, and no one but him really knows what happened. I feel like I need him and his support really badly in order to heal from this but I have no right to ask him for that.

Reddit, has anything like this happened in your life? What am I supposed to do now?"
hd69n,3,2011-05-17,I had sex with my ex and I really want to tell her current boyfriend,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hd69n/i_had_sex_with_my_ex_and_i_really_want_to_tell/,"Hi my ex girlfriend and I broke up over Christmas break because it was obvious that something was going on between her and some other guy (I had moved in the fall for graduate school). I thought we were in love she stayed with my family over Thanksgiving and I was suppose to stay with her's for Christmas. We were pretty serious to say the least I had plans to propose this Summer.

So, now she has an internship in my city for the summer.

She came over to my place several times last week and we eventually hooked up. When we were hanging out the next night I found out she had cheated on her current boyfriend(the guy who she ended it with me for) with someone else as well, and not only that, but had also cheated on me and every single one of past boyfriends followed by laughing. I know I also ""got on the good foot and did the bad thing"" but it is definitely evident that she is going to always do this. She told me that she just got bored easily, which is fine but she lets guys fall in love with her just to back stab them, and then tries to keep them in her life just to have someone to fall back on.

Should I let her current boyfriend know the situation? I would have really liked it if someone had told me before I got so attached. 

Oh, and I am never gonna talk to her again.

**edit** I told him,and he said he appreciated it. What's done is done."

I'm a woman in my mid-twenties managing a small company.  I am in charge of hiring and managing about 4-6 interns at any given time. In my field, most intern applicants are female but we try to create a gender-balanced workplace so I also hired a man in his early twenties. In the past this has been fine....but this fellow has been making borderline sexual comments to me (his boss) almost the whole time he's been working for us. He's referred to me as ""lil lady,"" said he wanted ""some of that reducereuserecycle [tool] action"" (referring to a tool he needed that I was using, and generally has trouble following my directions. He's here to learn and work, but often can't accept my criticisms and will make excuses as to why his (incorrect) way of doing something is ""okay.""

I'd rather not have to replace him at this point. He's a decent worker, quick study, and has learned to ropes of the operation quickly. So how do I put an end to the comments? 

Thank you!!

hd4no,2,2011-05-17,"I need Career Advice, Reddit.",[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/hd4no/i_need_career_advice_reddit/,"So I want to go into the film/tv industry.  I always have.  I went to college for Video Production, learned all about the ins and outs of shoots, and graduated in '09.  I kept hearing about how the job market in LA was awful at the time, so I stayed in my college town to direct a webseries, that I'm still finishing.  I then moved to Chicago last August to start my career in video production.  Since then the only production related job I've been able to get (other than a few random freelance gigs) was a four month, full time, unpaid internship in corporate video.  Everywhere I look for jobs it's all corporate video, or helping out for free or low pay on student films or low-budget indie films, or PAing on the few TV shows or movies that come here, but the people I know who do that have been doing it for years and are just professional PA's (not trying to knock PA's, it's just not what I want to spend the rest of my life doing).  

I know that I'm very young and have to work the shit jobs, I know that I have to PA and be the intern before I can move up, I'm just considering that Chicago isn't the right place for me.  I feel like I could work my ass off here and get into corporate video, which isn't my goal.

What I'm considering doing is moving home for a year, living with my parents to save money, and moving to Los Angeles.  I really want to live in Los Angeles, and the industry I want is there.  Should I leave Chicago when my lease is up in August to go home to save?  Or should I keep trying here in Chicago?  I love Chicago, I love living in a city, I DESPISE the weather here.  I'm at a loss, because I don't want moving home to seem like I'm giving up, because I'm not.  I'm just going in a different direction.  Now I'm rambling.

tldr: I moved to Chicago for video production but realized my dream is TV/Film, which really exists in LA.  Should I move home for a year and save up to move to LA?  Or should I not yet give up on Chicago?

hd0y4,1,2011-05-16,Help me create comedic art! Literally.,BreakingANDGentry,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/hd0y4/help_me_create_comedic_art_literally/,"Dear Reddit,

I am currently wrapping up the second year of my degree and have noticed lots of my friends have internships planned or have started their own businesses. They have something they can be proud of, something that they created. One of them is even a diamond merchant and a millionaire. So I thought, how can I compete with that? I realised, I don’t want to compete in a business sense or as a way of making money, I would like to have something, something created from nothing, something to be proud of to show others.
This is why I have come to Reddit, to ask of the talent here, to help me.

During 2010 and 2011, I have been living in Mainland China and every-time I have thought of something funny, I have jotted it down. This has helped to keep me sane from the culture shock of adjusting. I have now accumulated enough items for about 40/50 sketches. I originally wanted to film the ideas and make a comedy sketch show akin to “Picnic Face” or “Derrick Comedy”, however after much thought, I realised there’s so much artistic talent on the net that I’d love to work with some people and make variations on the joke. If I could set the scenario, then Reddit draws their versions of it, then they are hosted on a website, a gallery of art from a theme.

I originally came here to find a single artist to work with, yet I feel, that I don’t want to create a “web-comic” everyone and their mother has done that. I don’t want a weekly news feed and a comic section, as a matter of fact, I want the term comic, to be insulting to what you produce. I am here to ask for some “starry night” raw-top of the line art. Make it surreal, make it pop-art, make it modern art. Make it watercolours. Just make it your own and make it art.
I’d like to describe to you one of the first jokes, 




**The Mine**

Panel 1:
A larger, almost Santa like figure sits at the head of a long table, his face covered in mud, his eyes red, the table is long and lined with all his catholic children. In the middle of the table sits one solitary pie, steaming away.


Panel 2: 
The panel zooms into the dark gloom of his face, to show his weariness.


Panel 3: His perfect house-wife cuts the pie into pieces, making sure to cut a larger slice for father, father’s mouth twists into a grim smile of approval.


Panel 4:
One of his angelic blonde haired children believes that today is the day to test his luck, throws down his chair and shouts “Why every night do you ALWAYS take the largest slice of this families meal? Why not share equally? Is it because you believe us not your equals despite being your sons?”


Panel 5:
The father flies into a Catholic Rage, the crucifixes and paintings shaking on the walls and bellows “Listen you BRAT! When you have spent every one of your snivelling little days down the mine like I have, you’ll know some respect!”

Panel 6:
Silence falls upon their home,they stare at their feet, too ashamed to speak.


Panel 7:
The soft glow of a purple neon sign illuminates all around it; the dumpster next to it, the abandoned cars. The neon sign reads *“The Mine”.* 


Panel 8:
Inside we see the father in a fake tacky and dirty miners outfit grinding a business man in a suit for money,  as the businessman, clearly skinnier than him, glances at his watch in boredom. (I want this scene to still be purple, illuminating the figures.)


P.s Sorry if my grammar or English is not very good, I’ve spent quite a while in China speaking and reading Chinese everyday and hearing people speak Chinglish. Sorry!
If this one gets a few entries and goes well I’ll start posting the others. Thank you

TLDR: Let’s make some art, skip to the end for the first joke I’ve put up for people to try. Also shame on your for not reading my writing D:

One year experience working with children: Unless you count my days in high school as an student athletic trainer, then no.

The jobs in my field usually require at least a Master's. If not, then experience is required. I didn't take the opportunity to do an internship during school, since I was already working two jobs. Shoulda, woulda, coulda. Anyway, should I apply for these jobs even though I am way under-qualified or is this a waste of an employer's time to even look at my resume?

They have a job opening for a medical record specialist too. I did some work as a student administrative assistant that would actually be relevant. Maybe I should just apply for that position."

hem8q,0,2011-05-18,"Reddit, help. My roommate is an AC nazi",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/hem8q/reddit_help_my_roommate_is_an_ac_nazi/,"I've been living with two roommates for a little over a year now. We live in an older house that went through a few renovations, but none to fix the efficiency of the AC system. We have had disputes over the past year about the heat and what temp it should be at during different parts of the day. Last summer, I was out of the house nearly all day because I worked and went to summer school (I am the only one in the house who actually pays for my own bills; the other two just have their parents write a check). When I'd get back around 9pm, the AC would be set at 85. We live in Austin, so it's pretty damn hot during the summer. I usually would just turn it down to 74 when I got in the house. One of my roommates didn't start living with us until the fall, but since we had all moved into the house before the summer, she still paid for part of the bills. So when schools starts, and we're all living in the house, one of my roommates starts turning the AC off when she leaves. When we'd all get back from class that evening, the house would be at 85-90 degrees (I had all morning classes, so the AC was ok when I'd leave for class. She'd change it after I'd leave the house). This went on for a while. Even though we all talked and came to compromises, the two roommates never stuck to them and would always turn the AC either way up or off when I wasn't there. Their explanation was that the AC has to work extra hard to keep the house cool, so if we keep it at the same as the outside temp, the bill will be low. I tried telling them that our AC would be low if we kept it constant during the day, but they continued to argue. Eventually, I just started staying at my boyfriend's house. Things chilled out over winter (literally) and AC wasn't an issue.

Fast forward to this semester. I literally never see my one roommate; she lives alone in her room. The other roommate is constantly on my ass about the thermostat. I quit my job in March so that I could focus on GRE stuff, my internship, grad school things, etc., but it's cool because I saved money to pay for bills. I was home more often because I had a ton of things to do, so I had more time to experience the extreme heat conditions. At first, I'd do work in my room (the rooms are tiny, so you can feel the AC better them), and after a few hours of dying (the fans don't help), I'd change the thermostat from 79 to 74-75. It may be only a few degrees, but it makes a huge difference in this house. Within a few minutes, the roommate would leave her room and change it back up, either to 79 again or higher. I'd either turn it back down, leave, or suck it up. A few weeks ago, she wrote a sticky note and put it under the thermostat. [This is it](http://imgur.com/ptam5). She's never put it at 76 during the day, idk why she wrote that. Considering the cost of our last bill, 15% of our bill would come out to around $5 more per roommate. I don't know where she found that stat. I've tried to talk to her about it, but she just walks away and goes into her room. 

Last night was kind of my breaking point. My boyfriend and I were packing my stuff and moving it to my car. The house was at its normal high temp, so I asked my boyfriend if he could turn it down to 74. It was about 6:30, so I didn't think my roommate would care. While we were moving, my roommate had opened her door to watch us as she sat on her computer. When my boyfriend got to the thermostat, she took off her headphones and started yelling at him, saying that he better not touch the thermostat, yada yada. He told her that we were moving stuff and it was really hot in the house, and she started yelling louder, telling him that he doesn't pay our bill, etc, etc. He walked into my room to get away/grab some more boxes, and she followed him in there. She told him that we were wasting so much energy and causing the bill to be extremely high. He told her that if she cared so much, he'd give her a $10. She just kept yelling. So I go over to my room, and I hear my boyfriend tell her to go fuck herself. That didn't help the situation, but it was about time someone said it. I broke up their argument and tried to explain to her that the house was really hot, and that we'd turn it back up when we were done, but she just kept going on about how much money I waste by turning the AC down and how much energy I'm wasting. I told her I wasn't going to change it, and that our last bill wouldn't even matter because we were about to get our deposit check back anyway. She said that the deposit has nothing to do with the bill. I walked off. She just went back to her room and sat on her computer. It was a bit more dramatic then I'm saying, but it's obvious that she's a crazy bitch. My boyfriend and I finished up some packing, turned the AC back to what she had it, and left.

I have a week left living here. Can anyone help me with facts to support my argument, or something to take away from hers? I feel like she is just extremely wrong.



Some additional things:

-She used to go through my room when I wasn't home. I bought a new doorknob with a lock and she got offended

-If she saw my laptop plugged in, she would take the plug out of the wall, then my laptop would die

-When we had parties, she would turn it way back up when people were in the other room. That pissed everyone off

-She has never had a job, her parents buy her everything, she drives an Audi

-She literally does nothing all day except sit on her computer (the biggest iMac that apple offers). She puts her facebook status to ""offline"" so she can facebook stalk literally all day. I know this because she told me she does this.

**tl;dr** My roommate keeps the AC really high because she thinks it saves money, but it just keeps the house extremely hot and unlivable

I don't know how this will turn out, but tonight my heart is crying and for reasons I do not understand, I have no one to talk to.

Let me start with my bio. My name is Andrew and I was diagnosed bipolar and a.d.d. at age 14. I realized I was bi-sexual at a young age, although I have never had any opportunity to express my feelings, and have defensively repressed most of them. I spend most of my young life struggling with friends and dealing with these emotions that I could not explain. This could easily be the cause for my attraction to smoking pot. Outwardly, I have a good life, and am a gifted musician and an intelligent, passionate student.  

In my senior year of high-school, I met a girl named marianne. I loved her and she loved me perfectly for several years. She went on to a college 2 hours away from mine to study music, and I would visit her. With each visit, I felt her drift away until on one visit, she broke up with me. 2 weeks later she had a new boyfriend, and stopped talking to me completely.

I am now 20 years old and well along in my young professional life. This year at school, I met a beautiful chinese girl named Zoe who fell in love with me. We dated for a while, but I continually felt very detached. Before she left, she asked me if I even liked her and I couldn't respond. Now I have no way to talk to her.

Most of the time, i am very happy. Happy with the way I look, happy with my musical prowess, and happy with my excellent summer internship. Last night though, I had an emotional breakdown. I feel nervous and alone, as if I cannot deal with growing older. I can't keep my mind off marianne, although I honestly want nothing more than to stop torturing myself. Life is a blessing, and I love being alive, but I sometimes feel dead and corrupt. 

I don't want to feel this way, and I'm beginning to realize that depression is not something I can simply shrug off. I want new people in my life, positive people, but I cannot find them.

During my senior year of high school (little over 2 years ago) I used this car to go to school, and whenever it rained the engine would stall. I feared there was a crack in the engine block or some seal was failing but the local auto mechanic couldn't find anything. During the summers for the past 2 years I had no problems in the rain, but now it's happening again and I need this car to work for the summer to commute to my internship. Any ideas of what could be the problem? I'm a car noob, but please let me know if you need more information.

And if this problem isn't fixable, what tips would you have for looking for a used car? Thanks!"

**Budget:**  I have a budget of $100 from my mother to spend, and can float another $100 out of my own savings (which will come out of my 'fun' money for the summer) if it's really worth it.

**Other considerations:**I'll be in business casual most days, but will be wearing a suit (I have a navy and a light gray) occasionally. In this particular instance, I'm not particularly caring about durability. If it can last 2-3 months of hard wear and tear, it's good enough for me. While ideally I'd just grab a couple Park Avenues from Allen-Edmonds and be set for life, it's not realistic at this point in my life. 

Given these circumstances, does anyone have a good shoe/s recommendation? I'm thinking about getting a pair of [Bass' bucks](http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/catalog/productdetail.jsp?id=20238143&amp;navAction=jump&amp;isProduct=true&amp;parentid=MORE%20IDEAS&amp;isProduct=true&amp;cross-sell=true&amp;guide-bn=true) (for much less than $80) in brown, then buying the cheapest black oxford I can find that doesn't look like utter shit. I'm just not sure if the buck's are too casual for the job.

I've been trying to get a good pair of Allen Edmonds off ebay, but no luck so far.


Thanks MFA!

I have this conference at the beginning of next month and can already tell it is going to be fucking miserable here in DC for the whole time.  I don't think it's going to be 100 degrees or anything but the weather will almost certainly be uncomfortable to dress up in.

Tried to search, can't find anything relevant on MFA.. I need a slim fitting dress shirt that breathes as much as possible, preferably in a non-iron style and absolutely not linen or anything other than professional looking.

Can anyone point me in the direction of something similar?  Would prefer to be able to pick it up off the rack since it's coming up relatively soon and will possibly need to get the sleeves tailored.  I am 5'7"", 130lbs, cut / scrawny.

It's pretty brutal, I'll admit. So I logged into facebook after our pretty hard exam today and saw this from a fellow student: 

[Screencap of Facebook status](http://i.imgur.com/n26AX.jpg)

Now, the person who posted this is a total asshole. He's already been in trouble once for posting pictures of a professor on facebook without her permission. He constantly ridicules this one girl in our class over facebook, for no reason. Luckily I don't think she knows about it, but still, it's pretty immature. He is always posting about how he only wants the bare minimum grade and that is all he cares about (which maybe is fine for undergrad, but we're in professional school. Do you even WANT to be a pharmacist?) And he also just constantly talks about partying and gets angry when no one else wants to go out drinking with him in the middle of the week. 

He also has received scholarships and a pretty nice internship - I assume just by bullshitting his way through the interview. It's infuriating because there are so many nice, smart, people who deserve these things over him. People who actually care about more than just the paycheck and want to make a difference. 

So when I came across this status update this morning, I immediately thought of anonymously sending it into our dean. It is SO incredibly inappropriate, and he actually mentions our professor BY NAME. Obviously the context of having a hard exam is important, but still, if I were that professor I would NOT want something like this on facebook. 

So what do I do? Send it in to the dean? Ignore it and hope that karma gets him someday? 

EDIT - I should also mention that pharmacy is a small world. The only reason I'm even debating about this is because there is a huge possibility that I could end up working with this guy someday. I do plan on moving across the country, though, so I'm probably safe in that aspect. "

What did you do that I should, and what would you do if you were entering the job market now?"

I have a part-time retail job and I am taking Chem 2 in July, but I want something else to do so that I don't sit around all day.

Do hospitals look for people who want to volunteer? Or any other places? I was thinking of doing community service so that I felt like I was doing something productive that would help people, rather than just finding a 2nd part time job.

Or maybe volunteering at a national park? I don't know, lol."

First off, I am not quitting outright. I initially quit so that I could get clean for a drug test I may or may not have to take for a summer internship. One of the biggest challenges I faced initially was that I was still growing a few plants with my roommate (I have my medical recommendation). I also have a lot of friends that still smoke. There was just no way I would be able to avoid being around it.

This has definitely added to my cravings. The big things that helped me fight the cravings are: letting my friends know about my goal, keeping in mind my reasons for quitting, and my meditation practice. I began meditating about three weeks before I started my break. It has helped me deal with the withdrawal symptoms and the cravings immensely. It also gave me another reason not to smoke: having a clear head greatly improves my practice.

The hardest time I've had so far was 4/20. It was the day after my 21st birthday, so I was really hungover. I've learned to rely on marijuana to help with hangovers, so it took all my will power not to smoke that day. Hangovers are still my biggest trigger for cravings. Nothing fixes the nausea so fast and so well as a hit of marijuana. Anyone have any alternatives?

Well thats my story so far. I plan to start up again over summer. Although I'm not quitting permanently(yet), it's  nice to know that I have the will power to go from smoking everyday for about 3 years to not smoking at all for 3 months. "

Please let me know: if you are interested; how I can get started with this (i.e., if there is a website that caters to this); how much is usually charged in NYC and Brooklyn; and/or any other helpful info.

I may have a friend joining me as well but not quite sure yet.

I am meticulous, organized, trustworthy and ready to work so I can cover my expenses!

I would really appreciate any help you could give me :)

hdwve,6,2011-05-17,Computer Science and Career Paths,xuzl,compsci,https://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/hdwve/computer_science_and_career_paths/,"edit: I'm gonna go through and trim out some of the BS and make this story shorter. Sorry :P

I hope this is the right place. It's a bit of a life story coming up so I'm gonna put the tldr right here since it might even make the whole picture a little more clear. It's also worth noting that this isn't entirely about Comp Sci, in fact some of this might be better answered in some Engineering group. I wanted your opinions though, and your insight. I think you'll see it's pretty relevent. 

**tldr; can I get into a good grad school for computer engineering with a B.S. in comp sci, even if my GPA blows?**

So I've been at university for a while now. I did two years coming out of high school at a Community College. Walked away with a worthless AA in Liberal Arts and have been attending a rather costly University and taking out a lot of loans to do so. My first year I wasn't sure if I wanted to study Computer Science so I did a year of other interests. Sure enough, I changed my major.

Technically, it's Computer Engineering. I was always more interested in hardware and I really like the idea of a visual product as opposed to something that you can't touch. Nothing against that, it's just easier for me to be motivated for the prior.

Anyhow, I had decided that some form of consumer electronics was where I wanted to head. 

I'm going to be a 23 year old undergrad who hasn't taken time off from school. I am technically about 42 credits away from a B.S. in Computer Engineering. This can be done with normal schedules and one or two winter sessions, but the problem is that I am behind in Engineering courses and way ahead in Comp Sci.

The situation I am now forced with is that I cannot (in any form of sanity) afford more than 1 more year at this school. I don't want to transfer, I have certain attachments at this school that I don't want to abandon. I spoke to my advisor who tells me that while I am really not that far off from my degree, the way the courses are offered (one only in the fall and it's a pre-req for other courses I need, also only in the fall. etc.) it ends up being closer to a year and a half with summer/winter.

Computer Science however...this can be finished by this time next year - and with a normal course load. I spoke to the head and she told me that if my heart is in hardware, it may not be the right choice. 

I am thinking of grad school (which may be cheaper than this uni, but the point is that it has nothing to do with me not being able to afford more than a year here). She says that if I wanted to study Computer Engineering in grad school, it's certainly possible. But I'll be going up against people with degrees in Computer Engineering and it might be hard to get in somewhere when that is the case (and let's be honest, my GPA blows right now).

What do you all think of this possibility? Is it likely or wise?

I'm not even entirely certain if I would have to be bound in that direction. Like I said my heart was set on consumer electronics; although there are some things that have gained my interest; for example a networking course I took this semester.

What are my options here? I need an internship and a research project next semester. The department chair said we can focus both of those in hardware to help my odds of a good grad school for Comp Engineering, but this just feels like a lot of loose ends. I'm kind of lost on where to go from here. I suppose it seems obvious but I was hoping for input anyway, from people who have graduated and moved on or would just know better about what I'm getting into. Once I get out into the real world I might discover that I'm not so dead-set on hardware anyway. 

There's just so many ways this can go and I'm not too sure what to expect or do. While I find my engineering classes very interesting, I can't say they are more interesting than some comp sci options next semester like Game Design. Circuits put me to sleep in comparison to that. The difference is that while one isn't as interesting, I'm more upset about not doing it. I don't know what my drive is but it doesn't always feel like what is the most interesting, just what I think I could live with and be happy doing every day.

Thanks, I really appreciate any insight. This is obviously reality check for me, maybe even a turning point in my life / career. It's a little hard to put it all into words...that's why I used so many of them =]"

**georedd:** See his comment [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/gy752/reddit_technology_a_list_of_patents_and_products/c1rcald). ""Over 300 inventions as yet unpatented."" Why? pre-patented disclosure prevents patenting and each patent is a minimum of $6000 in fees.

**polyparadigm:** One granted patent and a few pending regarding ceramic processing, and another pending involving micro-miniaturized vacuum tubes. The latter is a little more interesting: hot filaments are a terrible idea as you get smaller, but if you get small enough, field emission becomes the easy way to get electrons out into the vacuum anyhow. At some small length scale, vacuum becomes (arguably) the reasonable choice again."

I've been sitting in limbo at a dead end job for the past year and a half. Post-graduation, I couldn't find a job for six months, so when I was offered this position I jumped on it.  Its mostly a data entry job, with some analysis here and there.  I spend most of my days in excel, so I've learned a bit there ... but that's pretty much all I've learned. What really worries me is that I'm not on a set career path, so the longer I work this job, the less marketable I'm making myself.


Part of the problem is I have no idea what I want to do with my life.  I graduated in 2009 with a BA in Economics.  I chose economics because I thought it would give me the opportunity to either pursue a career in finance or go to law school.  Looking back on it, I'm not even sure I have a huge interest in finance, I just wanted big bucks.  Well, that dream died when I couldn't land a decent internship.  I thought more and more about law school, but after reading all I have about it, the last thing I wanted was to go more in debt ( currently $30k in the hole), with only a small possibility of landing a good position.


Now I don't know where the hell I want to be.  For the past 4 or 5 years I've reallying searched and tried to figure out what I'm good at, what I like and where I want to be but got no where.  I've researched every career under the sun, but nothing I've seen has made me say, ""that's what I wanna do, I'm going for it.""  I'm looking for a career I moderately enjoy, that has a decent amount of autonomy, good pay, etc ... but who isn't?


Any advice would seriously be so appreciated.  "

Not sure if this is the right place to post this question. Please redirect me if there’s somewhere better!

**TL;DR** - My girlfriend of about one year is a virgin. We get along great generally. Is it unfair to base thoughts about “sexual compatibility” on how we interact now, or should I wait until when/if we have sex?

Her age: 24
My age: 27

-----

Dear me... I seem to have lost track of how long this post is. Sorry if it’s too long!

Although intimacy is the primary topic of this question, it’s possible that any issues are elsewhere and this is a side effect. 

I’ve been dating this wonderful person for about a year now. We’d known each other for about two and a half years prior to this, so we certainly weren’t strangers when we started dating. 

We get along well. Fantastic is probably a better word. When we’re together every concern is forgotten and we don’t have a care in the world. We frequently lose track of time and are both happier when with each other. That is, until we go to my place to hang out or go to bed... She seems to stay the same, but I’m starting to get frustrated and bummed out when we’re at my place or in bed.

We talked about sex fairly early on after our make outs got more exploratory and physical. She’s a virgin, I’m not, and our idea of when sex should happen is fairly aligned (couple should be happy with each other and comfortable in the relationship). We don’t have sex, but that’s not to say we don’t do anything at all!

Physical interaction followed a natural progression of how far we went over time. Kissing, making out, touching, removal of shirts. Pants/etc have never come off, but we have “satisfied” each other despite this. This is where it starts to fall over though.

Maybe 8 or 9 times out of 10 she tells me she doesn’t want me to move my hand south when I make motion of it (obviously not in those words!). The times she has allowed it usually only last as long as it takes for her to satisfy me (obligation perhaps?). Only 3 times of those have I been able to pleasure her, at least as far as I can tell.

At first I thought this is fair enough. She’s a virgin, doesn’t want to rush, all that business. We were at this point about 4 months ago. It hasn’t progressed past this at all in any form, and if anything our physical interactions have decreased.

A couple weeks ago I was really in the mood to give her attention and satisfy her. Her satisfaction always comes before mine (which really bites when she doesn’t let me), but the feeling was particularly strong  this time. We’re making out on the couch and I take her in to the bedroom. I light a couple of candles so we can see what we’re doing, but so it’s not so bright she’s self conscious. I give attention to everything I can without rushing, and try my best to make her feel beautiful and special, and more importantly, comfortable. Things progress and I make motions towards satisfying her, and she asks me to stop after just a moment.   Massive buzz-kill. Regardless, she continues for me. 

As soon as it’s over, bed covers pulled up, her shirt back on.

As we’re getting ready for sleep a bit later on I ask her why she won’t let me do anything for her. She answered that she’s embarrassed at showing any signs of pleasure.  I try to empathise with that, but I don’t really understand it, especially after natural physical progression over a reasonable period of time. I don’t care if we don’t have sex, but nothing at all after what we’ve done? In the past I’ve also asked her if she’s physically interested in me, which she’s answered in the affirmative.

Since when I last asked her we’ve done nothing beyond hugs and basic kisses. Admittedly, I’ve backed off to give her some space in case she feels pressured, but also to see if she initiates anything. This is something else that is prominent in my mind and overlaps with intimacy. She never seems to initiate anything (intimacy/dates/outings/etc), is always keen to doze after work (she’s an intern at a hospital and works long days), and doesn’t really show any visible level of interest in general, despite being quite attached to me and telling me I mean a lot to her.

I have absolutely no interest in forcing or manipulating her to have sex with me, or do anything to get my own personal satisfaction via her. Obviously I have my own drive that wants satisfying, but more than anything else I want to satisfy her and make her feel awesome.

There are many thoughts that have risen over the last few months out of this, one of which is whether she’s genuinely interested in me in general (physical interaction can be a good litmus for other issues I guess), but there are two or three major things for me:

1 - I don’t know how I can satisfy her in any way (including non-physical things); she can’t suggest alternatives after discussion about this. I feel completely useless and unable to do anything to bring us closer as a result

2 - When she stays over I’m often awake until after 2am due to sex drive. I get grumpy and tired as a result, which affects work, fitness, social interactions, she thinks I’m upset and feels bad for me not sleeping (whether she’s aware it’s libido or not, I’m not sure), etc...

3 - Through the course of her satisfying me, and not letting me satisfy her, I’m starting to catch moments where I think only of my satisfaction. This **really** guts me, and thinking selfishly like this is the last place I want to be... I used to imagine all the things I wanted to try on her, but these thoughts far less frequently cross my mind now.


I have no intention of breaking up with her as a result of all this at this point in time, but if she has a naturally low sex drive or just isn’t interested in sex in general, it will cause issues down the track, especially if/after we have sex.  I feel a bit selfish saying that, but if I’m thinking these things now, what will it be like in the future?

So, after this small novel, my question.

Is it valid to gauge sexual compatibility with my girlfriend, a virgin, before we have sex? 

Secondary question: is it likely that this is an indication of where our relationship is at, or perhaps some confidence/esteem issues she might have?


If anything needs clarification, or more info, don’t hesitate to ask. Although this seems centered around sex (it’s certainly a very prevalent issue in mind), I would not be surprised if it’s a secondary thing resulting from something else."

Please help.,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/hg2is/i_have_a_jealousy_problem_please_help/,"My SO went abroad to work in Europe this summer (3 months), and will be visiting Germany, Italy, England, Switzerland, and a few other nearby countries. He and his brother plan on meeting up for the last 2 weeks he is there to travel around and see the sights, e.g. Paris, Eiffel Tower, Stonehenge.

I'm having huge jealousy issues that are starting to spill over into my conversations with him. I'm snappy, sarcastic, and just generally unsupportive.

Mostly, I'm angry because he gets to go without spending a dime of his own money. This is because he received an internship at a Science Institute that pays for food, housing, and a paycheck. Additionally, his parents bought his plane tickets and gave him 300 euro in spending money while he is abroad. FURTHERMORE, his mother promised to deposit 100 dollars, american, into his bank account each week for ""extra spending money."" They have bought him a $200 backpack, clothes, toiletries, AND what is likely a $500 digital camera.

I find the situation ridiculous. He receives a paycheck while he is there, I feel that he does not need to also be receiving a paycheck from his *mother*.

I suppose I'm also upset because he doesn't have a job at home, and has normally a $100 balance on a month to month basis - while I work a part-time job just to stay afloat on my rent, and have money for groceries. His parents pay for all of that too. 

There is a little girl inside of me that wants to scream ""That's not fair!"" whenever I talk to him on Skype, and it's starting to become obvious in my mood that I'm upset. However, I don't want to ruin the experience for him.

(TL;DR at the end)

I am a 31-year-old female who just completed a B.S. degree in chemistry. I also just got engaged to my boyfriend of 3 years. We do not yet have any kids, but we are certain that we want to start a family, and soon. (In my case, I'm worried about the possibility of waiting *too* long, and not being able to...)

The plan originally was for me to get a job working for a few years, get married, start a family, then go back to grad school when the kids are old enough for daycare. People tell me that it is a bad idea to wait any length of time before grad school; however, I really just can't imagine trying to have a baby while in grad school. (If anyone actually *has* gone through this, please speak up!)

We also both want to move elsewhere... we're not too picky about the *where*, we just both know we don't like it where we currently are. Future hubby has been with his current company for 9 years now and doesn't like it... he stayed so that we could be together while I finished school. Unfortunately, I'm thinking that it's going to be difficult looking for jobs without a clear idea of *where* to look. It's also not helping that I have been told by a few people that the majority of jobs are found by networking rather than through actual job postings. I have a good network in this area, but as I said... the future hubby is set on moving.

I haven't actually applied to grad school yet (probably a bad move in retrospect), and right now my ""plan B"" is to get a 1-2 year contract position or internship around here and get into grad school as soon as I can. Again, though, the issue is that I *know* hubby is not happy here, and so I really would rather find something in another area.

Reddit, any opinions or thoughts are welcome! Thanks!

TL;DR: 31-year-old female, just finished B.S., wants to have kids before it's too late; hubby wants to move elsewhere, but I fear having a tough time finding jobs without networks in other areas. Also worrying about putting off grad school."

Apparently I can use my bank card in other countries, but there's a $3.00 surcharge, plus a possible additional charge from the machine itself, plus 2.5% added for the currency conversion. This seems like a pretty awful deal. It seems like credit cards also impose a similar levy.

I could get a bunch of the local currency from my bank here before I leave, but traveling with a lot of cash seems very risky. I'll need ~2,000 for rent, plus more for food, transit, etc.

Anyone have a recommendation? Are travelers cheques a good idea? I was thinking of getting a bank draft ahead of time from my bank to cover my rent payments - would that make sense?

hfwvl,1,2011-05-20,"Since graduating #1 in my college class in 2007 things have gone horribly wrong. No work, no school, what should I do?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/hfwvl/since_graduating_1_in_my_college_class_in_2007/,"I've had a rough few years since graduating and I don't know what to do with myself now.  I would really appreciate any advice my fellow redditors can give regarding planning my future and what options are out there for me.  Some background information:  I have only worked one job since graduating college and that was manual labor (hanging drywall).  I'm part of the first generation in my family to graduate college.  I have little to no knowledge or experience in the professional world.

Here is what happened:

Back in 2007 I graduated #1 in my class from the 10th ranked business school in the U.S.  I majored in finance, with a concentration in corporate finance and investments.  My only internship during college was with a traffic court judge, since I planned on attending law school after receiving my undergraduate degree.

During my first semester of law school I encountered my first setback.  Two weeks before finals were to begin my belongings were stolen from my truck while at a law school social event.  All of my law texts, notes, and my laptop were gone.  Faced with taking finals without any materials, the Dean allowed me to withdraw and retake the semester one year later.  During that year I worked hanging drywall.  I did return the next year, but only went to a week of classes before deciding that I couldn't take spending 14 hour days at the law school covering the same material again.

Shortly after giving up on law school I was in a wreck which badly injured my right hip.  Having no insurance, I sought care through the county medical system, which involved multi-month waits for every single necessary appointment.

A couple months ago I went to my last important hip appointment and I am finally able to get around enough to potentially work a desk job.  The problem I am faced with now is that I don't know if my degree from 2007 is even worth the paper it is written on, considering I never worked in the financial industry.  I'd love to work in finance (I really enjoyed it when I was in college), but I'm not sure that the industry is still open to me.  I am open to attending graduate school, auditing undergraduate classes to freshen my knowledge, or pretty much anything else to finally get my life started.

I've noticed many successful and intelligent redditors during my time lurking and posting here.  If you have any advice whatsoever I would be very grateful.  Just a reminder:  first generation college, no experience working as a professional, so no advice is too basic or obvious!  Suffice it to say that while I've succeeded in academics, I have no real world common sense.

Thanks."

She said to wait a month and if I didn't hear anything, then get back to her. I didn't hear anything so I replied with this:

""Hi again,

I hope all is well.

My dad has always been hard on me when it comes to school and work.  My grades were never good enough and I never seemed to work enough hours.  Well that was all fine and dandy in high school.  I firmly believe that parents should push their kids to succeed.  I'm extremely grateful for the work ethic he taught me.

Well when college rolled around, neither of my parents gave me a dime (my parents are divorced and I live with my dad full time).  So, to get myself through school, I worked two jobs.  This was fine.  I actually enjoy working and keeping busy.

I got my associates degree in Paralegal Studies and I would like to continue going to school part time to get a degree in environmental science (I probably won't actually get a degree until I'm 30, but that's moot).  Right now I'm working as an unpaid intern at a law office, and I still work both of my jobs.  So, as of late, I work between 60 and 70 hours a week.  I'm pretty proud of myself at this point, however my dad can't seem to get past the fact that the internship is unpaid.  He never fails to remind me how stupid he thinks I am for working for free.  When I explain to him how much I'm learning, he just tells me that knowledge isn't going to buy me a new car (or something along those lines).  

What makes it even more difficult at times is seeing my friends who have great relationships with their extremely supportive parents.  I didn't even bother going to my graduation ceremony.

I'm just at my wits end.  It's gotten to the point where I hate being home when my dad is here because I know he's going to ask me why I'm not at work or cleaning the house (I'm pretty much in charge of keeping the house, my dad does the yard work and such).

All I really want is to know that my dad is proud of me for SOMETHING.

Has anyone else ever experienced this; tried so hard only to have their efforts go seemingly unnoticed?

tl;dr: I bust my ass constantly and my dad still doesn't think I do enough.  Has anyone else ever gone through this and how did you get through to your parents?"

She has an 8 year old son and I've become a father to him now, he's everything to me. Obviously it was a very strange situation at first, but I'm a great dad (I'd like to think) and I take care of both of them with everything I have.

We got together during my Sophmore year, dated for a year, then moved in together and have been ever since. I love her with every bit I have to give, but it seems she's always finding a reason to be unhappy with me. I'm not sure why. I honestly believe that from her past experiences, she doesn't believe she deserves to be happy, so she finds fault with anything she can, that's merely speculation though.

Well, lately she's been talking about being unhappy in our relationship, and I'm about to leave for 3 months for an internship 2 hours away. I'm worried that she's going to see it as the time to leave me.

I don't even know where to begin. I have Social Anxiety and don't deal well with stress and confrontation, I'm a very chilled out person so it's never been a huge problem except in situations like this.

Essentially I feel like the life I've woven together for the last 2 years is near it's end, and if it goes that way I won't know how to handle it. Moving out, leaving who is essentially my son of 2 years, and being alone for the first time in 2 years, out of college with no set plan.

I will do everything I can to keep her, I've always sacrificed everything I had for her and will do it all over again, but I'm afraid it might not be enough this time around.

Advice? I'm slightly scared.

Edit: Last night she came to me crying at 2am, saying that she just didn't know anymore and that she wanted time apart, I'm leaving soon for my internship so I'm thinking after a week or so of being gone she'll decide if she wants me or not. I'm slowly starting to get over the initial shock, and at this point I just want her to make a decision so I can get out of the hellish torture that is wondering if I'm going to have her or not. If not, I'd like to start getting over it, if so, I want to feel like my fiancee loves me again. Either or. Tired of the games."

working at a company in the Philippines.  Everyone here has moved from their respective westernized countries to be here. it's mainly American based. (the owner is German. I'm British. if this makes a difference!?)

Prior to Arrival, we were specifically asked to lie on our entry papers and say we are tourists, plus whenever we renew our Visas we have to say we are tourists. This way the owner pays less taxes. Let me stress, everyone at this company came here for work, not for tourism. 

Also, on our contracts we are hired as ""interns""; this way - apparently - the owner can claim that this is a learning establishment and save yet more money on his taxes.

They want us to back pay our taxes to the start of our contracts. So anyone who started in January as an ""intern"" like me, will be left with php3000 to live on (about $70 or £40) once they eventually get paid.

So YES I know we're supposed to pay taxes as good hard working people, but with all of the lies we've already told to save this man's ass, along with them refusing to pay us, I just want to know if there is ANYTHING we can do - either as a group or individually - to try and change this ridiculous situation??

hfldl,0,2011-05-19,Have you ever wanted to call someone for lying about being gay?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/hfldl/have_you_ever_wanted_to_call_someone_for_lying/,"One summer I worked for a company in a foreign country so the company provided us housing.  We had a very nice apartment for the two of us, except she was probably one of the worst people I'd ever met.  What peeves me the most though, is that she lied about being gay (Or at least regarding her partner, though I don't think she's gay either).  She told the company that her ""partner"" would be staying in our apartment for the summer, but I'm pretty (almost absolutely) sure they were just good friends.  What pisses me off the most is that I arrived at the apartment a week before them and could have taken the master bedroom, but since I was trying to be considerate to who I thought was a couple, I took the smaller room and ended up spending the summer sleeping in a bed that was a racecar (I'm 6', 250 lbs).

I know people will want to know why I thought she was lying so here are the reasons:
- The alleged couple shared a king size bed, BUT kept a large body pillow in the middle that separated the two sides as well as slept with separate blankets.   
- I never once saw them be affectionate, cuddle, hold hands or kiss during the entire two months we lived together.
- They would call each other ""wife"" and make sarcastic posts to each other back and forth on facebook calling each other ""wife"".  It could have just me being suspicious and hating them, but it seemed contrived.  And while I'm not versed on lesbian couple etiquette, it just doesn't seem something a real couple would do.  I have tons of hetero-female friends who refer to their best female friends as ""wife"" in a similar sarcastic-joking manner.
- They had been friends since junior high, went to different colleges, one lived in North America while the other in Europe during the past 5 years.  I find it highly unlikely that two childhood friends both realize they are gay and then date many years later, after moving away and apart from each other. 
- Her ""partner"" had a ""friend"" visiting from Spain during our two months there.  Her ""partner"" traveled around Thailand with said ""friend"" for three weeks out of those two months.  You'd think that if she lived an ocean away from her partner and this is a friend who lives in Spain, where she lived, she would want to spend more time with her ""partner"" and not run off spending half the time with this guy, especially since they said they only see each other during the summers.  Also, she had a calendar taped up in her room that had a date circled with a heart and inside the heart she wrote ""Roberto (or some other similarly sounding European name) coming, YAY!""
- I took a weekend trip to a beach/island, but she had to work that weekend (She was a kiss ass and volunteered and then lectured me for not working, even though our boss said it was not a big deal and I spoke to him privately explaining I had coordinated the trip (with 2 other interns as well) and he told me to enjoy myself).  When we got back from the trip, not only did she lecture me about asking for the day off, she was also pissed I didn't invite her partner.  It baffled me because I've lived with my girlfriend and another roommate and it was always such a treat to have the entire apartment to ourselves, I thought she would have felt the same, but obviously not because she's a god damn liar.
- She got sick towards the end of the intership and left a week early.  Her partner stayed in our apartment, which I found weird since I thought she would have left with her sick partner and accompanied her while she was sick.
- They were very nitpicky about expenses.  Like paying each other back for a 20 baht meal (Exchange rate at the time was like 35 baht = 1 USD).  If I asked my girlfriend to pay me back the 65 cents I spent on her for dinner, I'm pretty sure she'd punch me right in the dick.

There was more stuff I'm sure, but I can't remember every detail now as it was 3 years ago.  I just talked to one of the other interns who worked with us that summer, last week and he brought her up, we all hated her.

tl;dr - coworker lied to company about being gay so friend could stay in our company housing."

I have been to every minute of every lecture and he never said we were not aloud to use the solutions manual to check our work on homework assignments.  If he had, I would not have touched the solutions.  

What should I do next?  He said there will be another email coming out once he has reported us and he will most likely fail us.  I need some logical advice because I am so pissed off and frustrated with this professor. I dont want to make the wrong move.  If proven guilty I will lose my university job, my future internship, and I will have to retake the course putting off graduation an entire term.

The last three years have been long-distance (seeing each other every two months or so) and at least next year will be long distance as well (I am in school).

We've already had bumps along the way (he broke up with me for a summer, three years ago, when we first realized that we would have to be apart) and I know he has questioned the relationship at other times as well (earlier on). 

He has recently told me that he is again wondering if we are doing the right thing. He thinks all of the distance has caused us to grow apart/become different people. BUT he says he just isn't really sure. 

What makes it even harder right now, is that we are actually seeing each other every weekend for the whole summer (I am doing an internship in a nearby city). Things feel totally fine when we are together. I see his family all of the time too, and am really close with them. Unfortunately, people keep asking us when we're going to get married, which is awkward, considering he isn't even sure we should be together right now. 

He has left it at, ""lets see how the summer goes"" but I don't know how much more ""doubting"" I can take from him (even though I understand it, and appreciate that he is trying to be honest).

Is it a sign that we shouldn't be together, but its been so long that he's just having trouble ending it (he's so comfortable that it is confusing him)? Did we get together too young? Will he (and maybe even me) resent the other person for taking away so many of our ""carefree"" younger years, when we could be dating other people? Has anyone else ever bounced back from this kind of doubt to have a good relationship? 

I don't want to end up being his bitter ex-wife down the road....
But I did always picture being with him forever, and used to think I could handle anything for the both of us...

I have an interview coming up for an internship I really like. Now assuming that I get this internship, theres a good chance that I'll be starting the job immediately however I already planned a small vacation to vegas for a long weekend in June with a couple of friends(friday, saturday, sunday and possibly monday). 

My question is how should I bring it up to my potential employer? Should I mention it during/after the interview or not mention it at all? Would it look bad if I mention it or would I have to cancel the trip all together? My parents said that it's bad idea to request a start date because there are plenty of people already fighting for a position already especially in this economy."
hgynp,5,2011-05-21,"Couple questions regarding salaries of aerospace engineers, especially ones with MBAs.",[deleted],aerospace,https://www.reddit.com/r/aerospace/comments/hgynp/couple_questions_regarding_salaries_of_aerospace/,"I am graduating in December and am trying to figure out what to do from there. I have done three internships in the past (all with large aerospace companies). I enjoyed all three of the internships since they were really applied. I have also been doing research at my school for the past 3 years and I really enjoy spending time on that. Since, I liked all of those things, I don't really know where to go from here. I figured the best thing to do is pick the one that will end up making me the most money. This sounds really greedy but I would really like to pay off my loans really fast.

So, here are possible options:

* Get a job with just my BS and make around 60k

* Go to school for masters (2 years at most schools) and then make around 70k

* Get an MBA (2 years) and I really don't know how much I would be making. I figured it would be more than the masters degree. 

* Continue with research and get a PhD (4 years) and make around 80k

I have also seen some schools have joint MS and MBA programs. I don't really know how much you'd make with the two. 

Has anyone here gone through the joint MS/MBA programs or gotten an MBA following a BS in Aerospace Engineering? Was it worth it? What kind of work do you do now? How large is the pay increase? 

The only thing that worries me about MBAs is not getting to do any actual engineering once I get a job. 


edit: I should also add that I would most likely apply for an MS in Electrical Engineering. I am interested in applied controls and feel I would get more out of an MS in EE than AE for controls. "

(Didn't learn how to cook until I got my own apartment with an electric stove and LOVED it. Have also worked with convection stoves and grills since then and did fine with those.) Anyway, she used to say that if I tried to turn on the gas stove, it would occasionally make a clicking noise and *not* light, and then the house would fill with gas and would explode. 

I know now this is exaggerating things, but now I am filled with fear when I hear the clicking noise and smell gas. I just moved into a sublet in DC that has a gas stove, the old-fashioned kind with open flames, lots of gas (one click is enough to make the tiny kitchen smell like gas), and seemingly long clicking time. Haven't actually lit the stove yet. Also don't know what to expect with a gas oven--does it click as well or does it just turn on? Is there a gas smell with gas ovens? 

Someone please console me? Tell me they have an oven like mine and it'll be ok? That I can still bake cookies for my boyfriend's care package with this scary gas oven? Standing by the stove trying to see how long I can stand to hear the clicking and smell the gas before I have to turn it off and give up before trying again is really wrecking my nerves.

EDIT: Just called my mom. She's not helping. Keeps mentioning that people have burned off (yes, *off*) body parts by using a gas stove wrong and I should stick to microwave meals while I focus on studying for the LSATs and my internship. &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;

I know nothing about him though, just that he's a rather silent cab driver back in Durham, NC who came running after me with my cellphone right when my train was about the leave the station for DC. I would've been completely lost without that phone, since it's my main contact for LSAC, my internship, my sublettor and sublessee, etc. Managed to get his name and address from the taxi company, so I'll mail him something. I always like to gift people with local chocolates, but with the heat between here and NC, I don't think they'll keep well in transit.

Any ideas on local things I could send him? Preferably nothing too cheesy like the glittery paperweights and things I see everywhere. Already got a nice card with a cherry tree on the front from the Washington monument gift shop, and will include a check for $20 for the trouble of making him possibly miss another passenger.

Sorry if this is something I should post elsewhere, I'm just looking for good unique ideas and figure that native DC redditors probably have experience getting relatives or friends DC souvenirs."

Didn't think about her much after that, since business is business. Bumped into her again a couple weeks later when we were both with our group of friends and I noticed two things:

* When I said hi, she shook my hand with her mouth agape. At the time, I asked her why she was so surprised to see me. 
* While we were both waiting for our friends, I sat down on the bench, and she turned her entire body towards me, sat cross-legged, and randomly suggested I try strawberry spinach yogurts, because they were the best things on earth.

Her: You know what you should try? Strawberry spinach yogurts. They're the best!

Me: Spinach? That sounds like one of the worst ideas I've heard all day. I'm going to file that one under ""bad ideas"".

Her: No! You defn have to try it. It's delicious.

And when we were done waiting for our friends, she mentioned it again as she was leaving. All the things together, I took as an IOI.

I don't like mixing business and pleasure, but I usually regret thing I don't do, rather than things that I do, so I shot off an email to her a week later, saying I thought strawberry spinach yogurts were a bad idea at first, but I wanted to try it and asked if she wanted to join me.

The answer came back yes. I can't take much credit for a pickup here. When she's interested, you just have to make sure you can read it, and pull the trigger, even if you're not 100% sure.

She invited me over to her place to cook together and make yogurts as a first date. She lives in a house with at least a dozen to two dozen other people with a large communal commercial kitchen, so I don't think it's what you're thinking.

I've been learning to keep my conversation lighter. I tend to ask about things that are more heavy in nature, like their jobs or their goals, when I let myself slip. You never want to have a girl talk about things that depress her mood, since she'll associate that feeling with you.

She was telling me about how there was a naked body painting party last night, and that's why there was a bra hanging from the ceiling. She said she didn't attend. Mistake here is that I could have done better here to escalate and tease her about lying about attending to start a push/pull

I did do some kino, mostly hand on the knee in brief for emphasis. I did find a way to kino when we were talking about allergies. 

Me: You got a cold? You're sniffling. 

Her: No, I have allergies.

Me: Have you ever had an allergen test done?

Her: No.

Me: here [takes her hand], they take your arm, [pushes up her sleeves], and then they poke you with different kinds of allergens, and see which one welts up. [pokes her forearm repeatedly]

It was just kino I made up on the spot, though I don't know if it's a good idea to associate my kino with allergies. In addition, she pulled her hand away first. I really should have dropped her hand first, akin to Mystery's kino advice.

In hindsight, I could have also added high-fives to the kinoing. When I tell her good news, she usually replies with 'alright!'. That's a good time for a high-five kino. lesson for next time.

We cooked and ate, and the funny thing about a communal kitchen is that the housemates will just gravitate towards prepared food. Hardly anyone was walking around when we were cooking, but when it was done, they just seem to come out of the woodwork. It ended up being a crowd of us and 4 others eating in the kitchen. I was able to talk and joke with them on various topics, all of which I was able to converse something about--which I assume is a DHV.

I was able to re-isolate her by mentioning that we should eat the (small) dessert that I brought, and we ended up sitting outside her place on another bench, and just talk and eat. Good convo, though I can't remember what we talked about.

Here, the only kino I managed to do was wipe some dessert off the corner of her mouth, and the usual arm and knee touches in conversation. 

No k-close, as I mistakenly kept walking with her back into the house and then decided to leave, rather than deciding to leave before we had entered her house at the end. She initiated a hug before I had much time to think. Then as I was walking away, she told me that I should give her a call and we should hang again. 

No yogurts were made, but I think overall, she had fun. And yes, I should have k-closed much earlier, esp with the dessert wiping off of her face. I need to stop thinking that the end is the only time one can k-close. Some texting back and forth since the date, and she's game for date #2. We're actually going to go get yogurts next time. And next time, I will escalate much faster."

We decided to make curry, and she wanted to put all sorts of vegetables that don't usually go into curry like asparagus, yams, and green peppers.

Cooking was fun, though there was far less kino cooking together than I thought there would be. At one point, I actually couldn't figure out how to work the can opener.

I'm a writer. Parents can't afford cool super expensive school where I can major in something useless (I.E. English.) Jealous of preppy ass holes who don't take advantage of their awesome education while I'm stuck in a commuter school with the grades and no cash. Sick of majoring in business. Can't stand it anymore. Don't want to be stuck in a cubicle. Thinking of dropping out. It's all a waste of time.

The less arrogant version is below.

LONG VERSION:

Hey, Reddit. Help me out here.

I'm a creative individual whose parents are forcing me to be a business major at a public, in-state school, so that I have something to fall back on. I wanted to be an English-ed major, but they say it won't get you a job (and in this economy, it won't.) Obviously having a backup plan for a creative individual is a smart move, but my problem is that I'm starting to fall apart mentally. I'm a hard working individual but I can't stand business and the thought that I would ever have to make a living doing that.

I recently failed my Calc final (which automatically fails you in the course) and my parents are pissed. It was my own fault. I lost steam towards the end of the semester and didn't put enough time into studying (I was writing instead.) I sort of went loose with repression on how its bullshit that I have the grades for great schools but I'm stuck in a business school, where I'm wasting my time studying for bullshit instead of pouring energy into my creative works*. I haven't spoken to them in a few days, but I told them I either want to transfer or drop-out, because I'm truly unhappy where I am, with writing the only thing saving me from total depression.

I know it's smart to have a back-up plan, but I feel like I'm wasting my time. I don't know whether or not I'll succeed in my creative aspirations, but I do know that I'll work harder than anybody else to get there - a passion that I feel no equivalent in with business. Why am I wasting my time majoring in a subject that I can't stand the thought of doing for a living? Why do people get to major in useless shit (I.E. English, History, Philosophy - all awesome and fun to learn, but rarely gets you a job unless you go to grad school) and have a college experience at some expensive, out-of-state (or in-state) private school? I just don't get it.

I'm jealous, I guess. Life's not fair. I wanted to go away to school - not to be a dumbass and go party everyday - but to live away from home, meet new people and enrich myself in knowledge and fun experiences. And meanwhile all these kids I know - whose families make shit for income - get to take out loans, live in debt, and get to tell me about what an awesome experience they had in college while I get to hangout with finance majors worrying about their GPA and paid internships at Lehman Brothers.

There's some part of me that feels like I'm being a whiny little bitch and I should just suck it up and appreciate what I have. You can't always get what you want (SEE ALSO: http://xkcd.com/863/) Now that I'm approaching junior year, I feel like all these business courses I have to take for the next three years are gonna suck the life out of me. They're hard courses that I don't have the time, energy, or dedication to make an effort for. This is not what I want to do with my life. This is not where I want to be. My college experience is shit and I can't fucking stand it anymore.

Help me out?

Thanks,

So currently I'm majoring in ME and set to graduate in December, and next semester is just finishing up some blocks and a math minor.  A professor who knows me fairly well has offered to take me on as a grad student for a specific project.  Before that, I'd felt no real interest in grad school and really didn't see it in my future.  This is a professor I have serious respect for, and people have described him as a great adviser.  The project is fully funded, is an RA position, and I'd be able to start getting paid for work on it this fall.  I think I've been leaning more towards taking the offer recently, but here are some of my thoughts on it recently.

**Cons:**

* I go to a small private school that is not known for its research.  I'm very happy with what I've gotten out of their undergrad program, but I'm not so sure about grad school.

* I'm currently in an internship that has shown signs of possibly turning into a full time position.  I enjoy the people I work with, and it's in the industry (aerospace) that I have the most interest in.  Either way, I don't think getting a job after graduation will be too difficult.  My peers graduating in ME haven't had too many issues

* The professor is becoming department head next Spring.  Less time for his grad students, although this may mean I'm one of the last grad students he takes on.  Currently he's someone who always makes time for his students, and I'm not sure how significantly this would change.  I may bring this up with him next week.

* I feel like I function better in a work environment over an academic environment.  Part of me just wants to get over with school and move on.  But the other part of me knows I should take advantage of my college years.

* To me, research can come across as fairly repetitive without a whole lot of payoff.  I like working with shorter term projects, and the thought of a two year project is fairly intimidating.

**Pros:**

* I like my school, department, and the city I live in.  No worries about living here a few more years.

* I'd get to spend a summer at the top R&amp;D labs of the company providing the funding, and it's supposed to be a great experience.

* I feel really comfortable working with this professor, and he's always incredibly helpful and willing to talk.  He described me as his first choice for this project.

* Construction on a new building dedicated to the school's ME and PE departments is beginning and projected finish date is Fall of 2012.  New labs and classrooms would be real neat.

* Materials science has come easily to me and held my interest well, and the project is heavily based in that.  (Corrosion stress cracking)

So those are my feelings.  Anyone willing to offer advice or share experiences would be great.  Thanks.

TL;DR:  Unsure if grad school is right for me.

Seats are limited, but it's there as a means to allow people on the outside and also internal employees who want to shift careers a free and critically valuable method of learning how to work as a specific job function.

  This should be commonplace among all employers the nation over.  If you are a CEO for a corporation, it wouldn't take more than perhaps 2-3 volunteer employees in any of your job functions and an open room for maybe 30-100 seats in your building to teach people.  Perhaps even make it FOR long term unemployed as in you need to display proof of your unemployment.

  You want humanitarian charity through Fortune 500 companies?  THIS is the path.  No more brain drain to overseas workers, create the path here for anyone who has the time and interest in doing it.  Specialized and targeted, the classes would produce entry level works grades above just a simple intern coming in from an indiscrimate degree.

  QAs, BAs, PMs.  Every company has a specific way of doing their function and often times what I hear is a manager saying ""I just want a good solid college grad or someone who has a little experience under their belt (some knowledge) of how to do the job, I'll train them from there"".  Many times it's not easy finding the person (as surprising as that sounds).

  Help me get this word out to the corporations.  The unemployed scarlett letter is a curse that once you have for too long you can't break.  Government wants to kill UI benefits down to 20 weeks in some states.  Give those people struggling a chance and make the nation a stronger place to work.

My understanding of their recruiting process is that they look at your transcript to determine if your GPA and extracurricular is good enough (I have a 3.69, president 2 clubs, have a few good community activities). 

Since I'll be transferring, I'll have no GPA and classes on the new school's transcript. The recruiters do require all college transcripts to be sent to them right, so when I'm applying for internships at the new school, they would just be looking previous transcript right? 

1. Will the Big4 treat me differently since I am a junior transfer? Will they interview students that have been at that university since freshmen year first? 

2. Will I be at a disadvantage by transferring to another school as a junior?

hhbmb,5,2011-05-22,Online backups of important financial stuff?,wassailant,Frugal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/hhbmb/online_backups_of_important_financial_stuff/,"Hey /frugal,

I'm currently beginning a pretty severe personal financial audit. I've gone from good to bad to good financial habits over the last few years, and last year was really good for me - I worked a range of jobs with multiple income streams and went from 2.5k in credit card debt, to paying for moving overseas (4k flights / insurance / admin stuff), upgrading my camera gear (an earner for me but still pricey at 4k) and having a wee bit of a savings buffer.

This year, I am earning practically nothing, as I am undertaking a low paid internship where I'm trading off pay for developing skills, learning and experience in a field I'm really passionate about but have had limited experience with professionally (travel).

I've moved countries, and I'm using this as an opportunity to redesign my life. Consequently, I would like to create some good habits, and one of the things I foresee as being really beneficial for myself is backing up my bank statements and other important financial information from the last few years and creating cloud copies, so that if I encounter computing errors I have additional protection of this information. I was undertaking a business for the last few years within Australia as well as receiving business development grants and working a range of jobs, so my financial situation is complicated compared to a standard single employer worker.

What I'm not so certain about is security. I'm Australian, and last time I checked Mint.com wasn't available to me (although this may have changed). I'm currently living and working in Germany and now have bank accounts in Germany and Australia, with two forms of currencies.

What is a good option for this type of goal? I have a private web server and I can store quite a lot of information on that, but I'm unfamiliar with online security practices like password encryption and hiding this stuff from Google trawling. Would I be better off finding a site that's designed to take care of this type of stuff?

My main worry with something like this is the potential for identity theft - if someone could gain access to wherever I end up storing this information, there is a severe risk of basically handing all of this information to someone...

I plan that at some point within the next few years (sooner rather than later if I have any say in the matter) my earnings will go back up again, and at that point I will probably benefit from seeking financial advice from someone who is familiar with the complications of Australian/German accounting headaches, but for the short term there is no practical way that I can spend money on advice like that.

Thoughts?"

And, no offense, but I don't want to give enough information to even give anyone a chance finding out my real-world identity.  You understand.  But a bit more:

Two months ago, I accepted a six-month internship abroad.  The plan was for her to wait for me, visiting for a month or longer in the summer, and then when I was finished we would (finally, after years of waiting) move in and get started on our life together, the life we have been planning for a half a decade.

After I had been here about two weeks, she broke up with me.  There are of course many details, but the crux of the matter is just that--she says she doesn't feel anything for me anymore.  This is just plain unbelievable.  And not just to me, to everyone.  I've had countless people tell me that they were stunned, one mutual friend said he literally fell out of his chair when he found out.  We were the perfect couple, the one that all our friends looked at when their relationships sucked, proof that true love does exist and that perfect happiness is attainable.  I guess the only one that wasn't taken by surprise was her--she says this has been coming for months, if not years.

I am receiving professional help, including medication (although my health insurance is not covering it, and that $200/week is not exactly helping with my stress levels).  I am talking with my friends back home, although it's very difficult because there is a large portion of the day in which, due to the time difference, none of them are awake or available (I am in Europe, so from roughly 10 or 11am onwards every day none of my friends in the US are available to talk).  I am on good terms with my coworkers here, and they know that I am seriously depressed (although I have not discussed suicide with them, as I have with some of my friends back home). I am doing everything I can, following the playbook step-by-step on how to deal with extreme depression, but still . . .

I see where this is going.  It's been a month and a half, and I'm not getting better.  I'm getting worse.  I'm getting much worse.  A month ago, I was afraid that I might commit suicide.  The idea that I might slide so deep into depression that I would take my own life terrified me.  Now?  Meh.  I'm not even that scared any more.  It just feels like an inevitability."

It's part of how I am coping with it now but if you are willing to read all of it(I will do my best to not wall of text you to death), please let me know your opinion.

So here's some basic description of the two of us.
*Imo, she is basically your typical ""perfect girl.""  Stunningly beautiful(imo), great personality, smart.  She matched my personality very well.  Not extremely out going and not many close friends other than myself.

*She is 2 years older than I.

*Dated around 5-6 guys prior but each relationship lasting no longer than a year

*We have been dating for almost 3 years.  For the longest time it seemed that we were going to get married.  I wanted it, she wanted it(until now).  

*Already met the parents.  We get along very well and have had dinner many many times.  Pretty much had approval from the get go.

*The past year we moved into a 2 bedroom apartment and around the end of April she dumped me.  

*Reasons do not include seeing another guy, me cheating, her cheating, any sort of wrongdoing on both parts.  

*I still love her to death.

**Reasons why we broke up(that I can think of):**

**1.  Demand for Sex.**  
Before you make false assumptions, our sex is great.  We are very comfortable with each other and are able to get each other to climax with no problems.  We are both physically attracted to each other.  Now to get back on topic....I was often unhappy when she would continuously reject my requests for sex before we go to sleep.  Understandably she was tired because she has work, but I don't think I was overdoing it.  Usually I will never ask her after a 12 hour shift day of work for any fun time.  Normally I would not ask but if 2 or 3 days go by I will ask.  I don't think it's too unreasonable in that case to get some action.  When it goes on for a week I will noticeable be a little frustrated.    

**2.  Our living environment.  **

We are both pretty messy individuals so our place often times gets pretty messy fast.  We are both very tolerant of it but I sometimes think that if I had been more clean and provided a nicer living environment for her things may have been different.  

Also, in the past year we went and started raising 2 kittens and a puppy.  I did not know I would have a negative relationship with cats until we started raising two cats.  Since I was always more of a dog person I was not used to how cats were not as loyal and loving.  Quickly I began to hate the cats and often times was visibly frustrated at them.  The added on responsibilities of raising cats, housebreaking a puppy may have been too much for us to handle.  This definitely added on additional stress.

**3.  Relationship gone vanilla.  Got too comfortable.**  

In the past year we haven't had as much time to go out and do things and explore life.  She being a nursing student and also working full time during the weekends, it was hard finding time to spend time and have fun together.  Simply going out to dinner doesn't really cut it.  I'm talking more like going out hiking, traveling, trying new things, exploring life.  It's hard to blame this on either person as we are both college students with heavy workloads and the fire in all relationships eventually die down.  I was still very happy with the relationship as is.  In fact I was still very much in love with her.  I figured that when I graduated and started working I would be able to do this again.  It seems that she did not feel this way.

**4.  Age?  Inexperience?**

I am 21 and she is 23.  She has dated 5 people prior and me only 1.  Her stints last around 6-8 months normally and my previous gf also lasted around 2 years.  


**5.  I put too much responsibility on her to making me happy.**  

During one of our post-break up conversations she told me that she always felt pressure because she felt that I found nothing in life to make me happy other than her.  This is slightly true since most of my time is spent studying and going to classes, and coming home and seeing her does bring great joy in my life.  I don't see this as anything wrong.  I would have thought this was a plus.  Inversely, I haven't had as much time to pursue hobbies or do things together as stated above in #3.  I spend much of my time in front of a computer either surfing or doing homework.




**The Break-Up:**

Ever since March, she insisted that we should move back into separate 1 bed room apartments side by side to each other.  I did not understand the reason for this as we would have had to pay much more money.  This argument persisted until she blurted out that we should break up.  For some reason it did not occur to me that the reason why she wanted us to move out was that she probably did not enjoy living with me anymore.  


**Coping with the breakup:**
I will admit that it was excruciating.  Considering it was around the time I needed to really gear down and study for finals it was very difficult to harbor my emotions.  It also did not help that we had to still live together until 5/25/2011(next week).  It was very strange because during the day we would act as if everything was normal and we were good friends still.  But, when night time came and I had to sleep alone, I felt immense pain and felt very lonely.   It was a very difficult month but friends, exercise, and pursuing old hobbies has helped distract me.  I feel like I've survived the experience and have matured greatly from it.  I've begun to find more ways to enjoy life and myself instead of putting all my happiness into my girlfriend.






 Now, Reddit.  Here is where I want to get your opinion.  She has had some pretty interesting things which make me wonder if it means that she still has feelings for me or not.  Reddit girls, let me know what you think and what a typical girl is thinking when they do these things.  

**These events occur post break up**

**1.  She offered to let me live with her in her 1 bedroom apartment.**

She began to feel guilty about having to make me go live in a 1bed which is noticeably more expensive than splitting a 2 bed and making me and my dad pay more.  I would be sleeping in the living room while she took the bedroom.   Seemed kind of strange but I accepted and it seemed as if we were both very happy with this decision.  The next day she changed her mind and decided not to let me move in.  

**2.  Chasing me at school.**

One time I drove to school while she walked because she wanted exercise.  I arrived at school and parked in the parking lot.  Suddenly I notice someone tapping my shoulder and it ended up being my ex who had ran across the entire parking lot to catch up and walk with me.

**3.  Asking me to pin her at her nursing graduation pinning ceremony**

Usually this is considered more important than your typical graduation for nursing students.  Usually, students have their parents come up and put on a pin or medallion over their neck in diploma handing out fashion on stage.  She wanted me to do it for her because I was her ""rock"" through the past 3 years and she felt she couldn't have gotten through nursing school without me.  I ended up rejecting the offer and told her mom to do it considering her family was going to be present.  I ended up attending this event in one of my best suits with roses and she looked very happy and also complimented on how good I looked.  I told her that she looked amazing in her dress and she lit up when I told her this.  

**4.  Still having me over for dinner with the parents post breakup**

Her parents came up to school to attend her graduation and in the past couple of days I had been invited to all their dinners and activities.  It was definitely a bittersweet couple of days.  While I was very happy to be around them, it hurt that I wasn't spending time with her family as her boyfriend.  During the past couple of days I would look at her and feel extreme pain because she wasn't mine anymore.  

**5.  She wants me to move into a 1bedroom close to hers**

Self explanatory.  She still wants me to be near by.


*Overall, her actions have had a negative effect on me trying to get over her. *




Conclusion:
I will be working during the summer at an internship out of town and I  see this as a break for the both of us.  Should I shut off all contact with her and then continue to pursue her when I get back or should I start seeing other women?  Some of me wants to move on and see other girls but I also feel like if I let her go I will regret it for the rest of my life. I don't think that I am being blinded.  I really feel that she is everything I want in a woman. I am still head over heels in love with this girl.

So, reddit.  What do you think?  Should I?


TLDR version:

Perfect girl breaks up with me after 3 years.  I think she still likes me.  Should I use the summer as a break and try to slowly get back together with her again?

hh1e3,11,2011-05-21,"Girlfriend wants a poly relationship, I'm still uncomfortable with parts of it but willing to listen (x-post polyamory)",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hh1e3/girlfriend_wants_a_poly_relationship_im_still/,"First, let me apologize in advance for my lack of knowledge of proper terms: this is new to both of us and tend to explain ourselves at length for the sake of clarification.

**Us**: dating for 2+ months (feels like so much longer for both of us), extremely communicative of whatever the situation is. Both in college, she a grad-student(F/22), I going into my senior year(M/21).

**Present**: She is travelling in Israel in her birthright, with plans to extend the trip to England and Copenhagen to visit family, eventually going back home to visit family then coming back to where I am presently. I am up in between summer jobs, waiting to hear back from several places ranging from internships to day camp.

**Situation**:Before we started going out she had mentioned that she just got out of a serious monogamous relationship 3 months prior. And that never having been single since high school, had her first casual relationship in the interim. At that time, she told me that she could back out from that while still remaining friends (they had known each other for a year prior).
From the time we started going out, she had mentioned that she was interested in sexual relationships with other people. She would mention that she could go off and try other things, and then bring them back to us. I was adamant in that I felt uncomfortable with her having sex with other people, if just for that reason alone. Time goes by, usual relationship business (date nights, movie nights, Dr. Who with her friends) and she brings it up again. This time as a friends with benefits situation. I remained open to discussion, but couldn't properly express myself (I still feel I can't). Now it turns into ""I'd like a full fledged relationship"".

**Where she's coming from**: Sex is a logical extenuation of friendship. She has such deep bonds with several of her close friends that physical intimacy is the next step. She says she loves me, and that she's looking for an ""and"" rather than an ""or"", an addition to our relationship with the close friend/casual relationship she had back prior to me. That if anything were to get in the way of us, then she would not take that route because she is happy with me. When she says all these things, I trust her, through and through. She wants to reach a point where I'll be comfortable with this just so we can try it out.

**Me**: I'm open to listening to the idea of a poly relationship, but the truth of the matter is that I'm still uncomfortable with the idea of her having a sexual relationship with someone else. When she says that it's different than with me, I understand this; it still doesn't make the fact that I gag every time I picture her with another guy any easier. It's a non-issue as long as I'm uncomfortable, she says. But the fact of the matter is I'm torn because I know this is something she wants to try and that it will make her happy; meanwhile I keep picturing her with this other guy and it is literally driving me insane. It's not even the concept of her splitting her time between the two of us, just the sex. As a result of knowing that this is what she wants, but also understanding my limits, it's just one giant ball of stress on my end because it's affecting us. I'm not as happy as I was knowing that she wants to have sex with someone else.

**Note**: Not as much now, but the it bothers me that the other guy (prior casual relationship who wants this to happen) wants this to happen as much as her, leaving me as the odd man out.

**Now**: Just got off Skype with her via Israel. I feel like a dick because here I am back home being miserable and made her sad as a result. I just can't control my brain when it comes to this. She says it's not an issue at the moment because I'm uncomfortable with it, but it's still all I can think about. I'm open to listening about it, but I really don't feel much of anything will change my mind.
I've talked to my friends about it (all think I'll lose it), I've talked to her friends about it (who are all for it as they've done it before) and all in all I'm just unhappy.

**TL:DR** Girlfriend wants to try poly, I'm uncomfortable with the idea of her having sex with other guys. Can't stop thinking about it, affecting otherwise stable relationship.

I'm sure there's more to this than I'm explaining, feel free to ask. This just seems more of a rant than anything, but any advice from a third party would be helpful.

hh0av,18,2011-05-21,"Girlfriend wants a poly relationship, I'm still uncomfortable with parts of it but willing to listen",systematicOverload,polyamory,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/hh0av/girlfriend_wants_a_poly_relationship_im_still/,"First, let me apologize in advance for my lack of knowledge of proper terms: this is new to both of us and tend to explain ourselves at length for the sake of clarification.

**Us**: dating for 2+ months (feels like so much longer for both of us), extremely communicative of whatever the situation is. Both in college, she a grad-student(F/22), I going into my senior year(M/21).

**Present**: She is travelling in Israel in her birthright, with plans to extend the trip to England and Copenhagen to visit family, eventually going back home to visit family then coming back to where I am presently. I am up in between summer jobs, waiting to hear back from several places ranging from internships to day camp.

**Situation**:Before we started going out she had mentioned that she just got out of a serious monogamous relationship 3 months prior. And that never having been single since high school, had her first casual relationship in the interim. At that time, she told me that she could back out from that while still remaining friends (they had known each other for a year prior).

From the time we started going out, she had mentioned that she was interested in sexual relationships with other people. She would mention that she could go off and try other things, and then bring them back to us. I was adamant in that I felt uncomfortable with her having sex with other people, if just for that reason alone. Time goes by, usual relationship business (date nights, movie nights, Dr. Who with her friends) and she brings it up again. This time as a friends with benefits situation. I remained open to discussion, but couldn't properly express myself (I still feel I can't). Now it turns into ""I'd like a full fledged relationship"". 

**Where she's coming from**: Sex is a logical extenuation of friendship. She has such deep bonds with several of her close friends that physical intimacy is the next step. She says she loves me, and that she's looking for an ""and"" rather than an ""or"", an addition to our relationship with the close friend/casual relationship she had back prior to me. That if anything were to get in the way of us, then she would not take that route because she is happy with me. When she says all these things, I trust her, through and through. She wants to reach a point where I'll be comfortable with this just so we can try it out.

**Me**: I'm open to listening to the idea of a poly relationship, but the truth of the matter is that I'm still uncomfortable with the idea of her having a sexual relationship with someone else.

**5/24 Update** So what I've realized after talking with her further is that I'm uncomfortable with her physical aspect because it's something I don't want to know is happening with someone else. If the situation presents itself when she comes back from her trip, I said I would be willing to try it for some undetermined time. I can see this working: the only real difference between what's already happening now is the sex, and I've asked if she was ok with several caveats. Taking the next logical step in the progression, even if this does work out for all of us and I recognize this, but don't want it to continue anyway, what would you do?

I realize that we're dealing with something that may not even happen for another two-three months, so nothing definitive can be said. Also that there are a lot of variables that need to fall in place this summer for it to happen that much sooner (me getting job in her area, him also being in the area; none of which is definite at this point). This is just where my brain is at. To me this is something serious and I'm having trouble putting it on the back burner and focusing on other things. Shes going to talk with whom she wishes to start this with at some point this weekend and then he'll talk to me. As much as I don't want to know about their relationship, I'd like to know where he sees this going in the future, his end goals, and frankly how he feels about me. Because if this is something where he just wants to experiment and have fun, I'm not sure I could go through with it. Thanks for all your words of support, you all have been more than kind and for that I am truly grateful."

Resume looks ripe and fit for grad school, but that's not an option for me at this point. Would like to work in a research/policy capacity at a think tank or non-profit full-time, but definitely open to other options.

**Public Relations/Public Affairs:** Worked at the Department of Defense in their Office of Public Affairs as a New Media intern last year. Helped coordinated and spearhead internet outreach projects, and wrote press blogs and media analyses.

**Research Experience:** I've worked as a research assistant for two professors (one on Porgy and Bess, currently on the relationship between the military and the American military complex), and have conducted my own year-long research project on the use of internet media and Eastern European revolutions. 

**Customer Service:** I was a sales assistant at a clothing/accessories store for a few years, and have worked part-time at my university's computer store as a sales associate since my freshman year. 

**Miscellaneous** I'v held leadership positions before for college clubs/sorority, so I have experience (and actually really enjoy) event planning and project management. 

I love History and Political Science, so I'm even open to high school tutoring in reading, writing, AP US History, AP Government, and college admissions essays.

I'm really hope to find something in government/politics/research because those are my true passions. I lived in DC last year from June-December 2010, and absolutely loved it. I am moving back to the Bay Area after graduation, but I'm not against moving out to DC again for work. 

I can provide references, resumes, and my personal website/linkedin profile upon request.

i'm an intern in the school of biological sciences of an university, working under a prof that specializes in toxoplasma gondii, the parasite.

my project involves me cutting up adrenal glands of rats into sections 50 microns thick with a cryostat, and then staining and mounting them. i've had quite a lot of problems so far and my slides are far from perfect. 

i use OCT medium to embed the adrenals in when sectioning, and because my noob techniques are horrid, i sometimes end up with a lot of OCT on the slides. during staining, the sections get washed off.

may i know if there is any trick to ensuring a good microscope slide of sections when you're using a cryostat? i'm doing the haemotoxylin stain. also, i've been trying my best to separate the OCT from the sections before putting them on the slides so that only the adrenal gland sections get on the slide. however this brings up another problem of torn sections.

It's part of how I am coping with it now but if you are willing to read all of it(I will do my best to not wall of text you to death), please let me know your opinion.

So here's some basic description of the two of us.
*Imo, she is basically your typical ""perfect girl.""  Stunningly beautiful(imo), great personality, smart.  She matched my personality very well.  Not extremely out going and not many close friends other than myself.

*She is 2 years older than I.

*Dated around 5-6 guys prior but each relationship lasting no longer than a year

*We have been dating for almost 3 years.  For the longest time it seemed that we were going to get married.  I wanted it, she wanted it(until now).  

*Already met the parents.  We get along very well and have had dinner many many times.  Pretty much had approval from the get go.

*The past year we moved into a 2 bedroom apartment and around the end of April she dumped me.  

*Reasons do not include seeing another guy, me cheating, her cheating, any sort of wrongdoing on both parts.  

*I still love her to death.

**Reasons why we broke up(that I can think of):**

**1.  Demand for Sex.**  
Before you make false assumptions, our sex is great.  We are very comfortable with each other and are able to get each other to climax with no problems.  We are both physically attracted to each other.  Now to get back on topic....I was often unhappy when she would continuously reject my requests for sex before we go to sleep.  Understandably she was tired because she has work, but I don't think I was overdoing it.  Usually I will never ask her after a 12 hour shift day of work for any fun time.  Normally I would not ask but if 2 or 3 days go by I will ask.  I don't think it's too unreasonable in that case to get some action.  When it goes on for a week I will noticeable be a little frustrated.    

**2.  Our living environment.  **

We are both pretty messy individuals so our place often times gets pretty messy fast.  We are both very tolerant of it but I sometimes think that if I had been more clean and provided a nicer living environment for her things may have been different.  

Also, in the past year we went and started raising 2 kittens and a puppy.  I did not know I would have a negative relationship with cats until we started raising two cats.  Since I was always more of a dog person I was not used to how cats were not as loyal and loving.  Quickly I began to hate the cats and often times was visibly frustrated at them.  The added on responsibilities of raising cats, housebreaking a puppy may have been too much for us to handle.  This definitely added on additional stress.

**3.  Relationship gone vanilla.  Got too comfortable.**  

In the past year we haven't had as much time to go out and do things and explore life.  She being a nursing student and also working full time during the weekends, it was hard finding time to spend time and have fun together.  Simply going out to dinner doesn't really cut it.  I'm talking more like going out hiking, traveling, trying new things, exploring life.  It's hard to blame this on either person as we are both college students with heavy workloads and the fire in all relationships eventually die down.  I was still very happy with the relationship as is.  In fact I was still very much in love with her.  I figured that when I graduated and started working I would be able to do this again.  It seems that she did not feel this way.

**4.  Age?  Inexperience?**

I am 21 and she is 23.  She has dated 5 people prior and me only 1.  Her stints last around 6-8 months normally and my previous gf also lasted around 2 years.  


**5.  I put too much responsibility on her to making me happy.**  

During one of our post-break up conversations she told me that she always felt pressure because she felt that I found nothing in life to make me happy other than her.  This is slightly true since most of my time is spent studying and going to classes, and coming home and seeing her does bring great joy in my life.  I don't see this as anything wrong.  I would have thought this was a plus.  Inversely, I haven't had as much time to pursue hobbies or do things together as stated above in #3.  I spend much of my time in front of a computer either surfing or doing homework.




**The Break-Up:**

Ever since March, she insisted that we should move back into separate 1 bed room apartments side by side to each other.  I did not understand the reason for this as we would have had to pay much more money.  This argument persisted until she blurted out that we should break up.  For some reason it did not occur to me that the reason why she wanted us to move out was that she probably did not enjoy living with me anymore.  


**Coping with the breakup:**
I will admit that it was excruciating.  Considering it was around the time I needed to really gear down and study for finals it was very difficult to harbor my emotions.  It also did not help that we had to still live together until 5/25/2011(next week).  It was very strange because during the day we would act as if everything was normal and we were good friends still.  But, when night time came and I had to sleep alone, I felt immense pain and felt very lonely.   It was a very difficult month but friends, exercise, and pursuing old hobbies has helped distract me.  I feel like I've survived the experience and have matured greatly from it.  I've begun to find more ways to enjoy life and myself instead of putting all my happiness into my girlfriend.






 Now, Reddit.  Here is where I want to get your opinion.  She has had some pretty interesting things which make me wonder if it means that she still has feelings for me or not.  Reddit girls, let me know what you think and what a typical girl is thinking when they do these things.  

**These events occur post break up**

**1.  She offered to let me live with her in her 1 bedroom apartment.**

She began to feel guilty about having to make me go live in a 1bed which is noticeably more expensive than splitting a 2 bed and making me and my dad pay more.  I would be sleeping in the living room while she took the bedroom.   Seemed kind of strange but I accepted and it seemed as if we were both very happy with this decision.  The next day she changed her mind and decided not to let me move in.  

**2.  Chasing me at school.**

One time I drove to school while she walked because she wanted exercise.  I arrived at school and parked in the parking lot.  Suddenly I notice someone tapping my shoulder and it ended up being my ex who had ran across the entire parking lot to catch up and walk with me.

**3.  Asking me to pin her at her nursing graduation pinning ceremony**

Usually this is considered more important than your typical graduation for nursing students.  Usually, students have their parents come up and put on a pin or medallion over their neck in diploma handing out fashion on stage.  She wanted me to do it for her because I was her ""rock"" through the past 3 years and she felt she couldn't have gotten through nursing school without me.  I ended up rejecting the offer and told her mom to do it considering her family was going to be present.  I ended up attending this event in one of my best suits with roses and she looked very happy and also complimented on how good I looked.  I told her that she looked amazing in her dress and she lit up when I told her this.  

**4.  Still having me over for dinner with the parents post breakup**

Her parents came up to school to attend her graduation and in the past couple of days I had been invited to all their dinners and activities.  It was definitely a bittersweet couple of days.  While I was very happy to be around them, it hurt that I wasn't spending time with her family as her boyfriend.  During the past couple of days I would look at her and feel extreme pain because she wasn't mine anymore.  

**5.  She wants me to move into a 1bedroom close to hers**

Self explanatory.  She still wants me to be near by.


*Overall, her actions have had a negative effect on me trying to get over her. *




Conclusion:
I will be working during the summer at an internship out of town and I  see this as a break for the both of us.  Should I shut off all contact with her and then continue to pursue her when I get back or should I start seeing other women?  Some of me wants to move on and see other girls but I also feel like if I let her go I will regret it for the rest of my life. I don't think that I am being blinded.  I really feel that she is everything I want in a woman. I am still head over heels in love with this girl.

So, reddit.  What do you think?  Should I?


TLDR version:

Perfect girl breaks up with me after 3 years.  I think she still likes me.  Should I use the summer as a break and try to slowly get back together with her again?

Senior year of high school I met an amazing (well, amazing then) girl, and after we both worked through our awkwardness we ended up in one of those relationships everyone envies.  But my depression and self-sabotaging tendencies got the worst of me, and slowly but surely our relationship tanked.  I was too good for her (in terms of gifts, willingness, ridiculous personal beliefs), and she was too complacent, too willing to do what I asked.  Eventually she became so ""indebted"" to me things got out of hand.  Add to that the fact that we spent 2/3 of the year apart due to school, things basically fell apart.  When I pushed her too far, she finally cheated on me to escape it all, and that's when she chose to end it (online, after 3 years, what a disrespectful end to rip all of my self-esteem and confidence away from me).  

Needless to say, I spent about a year to this day trying to get over her, and to be honest (and this is the most scary thing I've admitted), I'm still not over her.  I'm still not over that girl whose become a pot-head slut wannabe, who almost failed out of her grade and internship.

Lately I've been doing okay, but I always allow myself to relive all those memories, especially the breakup, right when I need to study for important exams or have projects to do.  This sends me tailspinning.  (Also, pretty sure I just messed up an opportunity to have sex with one of my few girl friends).  

But there were many good memories, those innocent memories. There will always be the memories of those days spent together, the nights spend exploring each other, and those moments when we just sat together, in love, needing nothing but closeness to one another.

So my question to you, FA (and reddit), is should I keep the memories I have of her (conversations, pictures, etc.), or should I finally purge my life of every living memory of her?  Be honest, and spare no judgement.

TL;DR: GF left me a year ago, and to my dismay I'm still trying to get over her and rebuild my life (a life I've spend alone beside from her).  Should I keep my memories of her (physical and emotional) or get rid of everything?  Spare no judgement and be brutally honest."

My parents are still together, yet they do not live in the same household. They used to, up until 2 years ago when my dad was laid off. He found work in a different state, and jumped at the opportunity. It was my senior year of HS, and my brothers last of middle school, so the whole family didn't want to relocate at that point. I just joined my dad for the summer to work an internship with him. I was looking for a guitar pick, and he said check his room. In his nightstand drawer was 6 or 7 condoms and a empty bottle of cialis. This is pure evidence to him sleeping around, because my mom has yet to visit him in this new state, he is always the one to come home and visit. What do I do know? Pretend I didn't find anything? Or start asking questions?

I've looked around and read all kinds of mixed up things about getting certification, experience, etc. Some people say that A+ certification is laughable and worthless, while others say it's great for getting my foot in the door.

I'm not asking for anything except information and advice. Regardless, I have the materials I need to study for the A+ exams and I want to pass them in order to at least feel like I'm doing something worthwhile. That goes a long way, at least for me.

Thanks in advance, reddit. You guys are awesome.

I was wondering if someone would be kind enough to provide some advice.

I'm a Canadian University student, will be graduating in 10 months. I do consulting work, and took some internships to gain experience/money. All in all, I have 8.3K in savings, with 6K sitting in a tax free 2% savings account. I currently have no debt, and no credit cards. I live with parents, and don't pay rent.

I will need 9-10K to pay for my last three school terms - so that accounts for all of my savings. Hopefully I will make enough money by the end of this summer to make up the difference, and pay for various life expenses.

I never had a credit card. I've applied for them couple of times (for student ones), but was rejected. I had a cell phone account go to collections agency once, so that probably screwed up my credit history.

I would like to figure out where I stand in terms of my credit score, and how to build up a good credit history. Without having owned a credit card, and having had one account go to collections for couple of months (value of about $300), what would be a good next step? 

I'm considering applying for a secured credit card, and putting ~1K towards it. Will using such credit card, responsibly, be a good step towards building up credit history? If so, how should I go about doing this (e.g., let the balance sit until the monthly statement is issued, and then pay it off - or transfer funds to my CC right away after purchases?).
I'm doing OK without a credit card, making all of the purchases in cash or PayPal, and using gf's card for things like airplane tickets.

Any advice on what's a good secured credit card to get in Canada will also be greatly appreciated :)

Thanks all :)"

AMA",bluecastle,IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/hj357/iama_girl_who_was_confined_against_her_will_for_9/,"Here's the background to what happened. I am 20, I am Canadian,and I grew up homeschooled in a very conservative Christian family. My parents are borderline paranoid and very controlling. We had all the normal issues through my teenage years, but my parents over reacted to everything, and finally came to the conclusion that I needed to be locked up and fixed. Where I live, in Ontario, after I turned 16 I have the right to live wherever I want, and my parents couldn't tell me where to be. I still lived at home, and was a very good kid. I had never smoked, never drank, never had a boyfriend. 

Nevertheless, when I was 17,  my parents tricked me into going to Utah to ""visit a school"" that they had found and thought I would love. On arrival I found out I couldn't leave the building or contact anyone. I had my things searched in front of the other students, almost everything was confiscated, I got a uniform, and that was that. There was little to no privacy, punishments (for things which they knew I had no part in) involved days of almost complete silence, group excercises, and sitting on our beds without leaning on anything for most of the day.

It was a ""Christian boarding school"" so we were forced to attend Bible classes, and passing the tests in those classes was required to advance through the program towards eventual release. It was several weeks (maybe a month, I'm not sure) before I was even allowed to speak to my parents at all, and then it was a 5 minute phone call monitored by staff. All our communication (only with family) was staff monitored for any negativity about the school.

After three months(if they behaved) the students are allowed to leave the building with staff supervision to do community service work, and were allowed to have some free time to socialize with the others. We could not communicate with the opposite gender at any time, and would sometimes be rebuked for ""looking at them too much.""

Anyhow, I made it through my 9 months, behaved, and was released right when I turned 18. It changed my life though. That used up all the money my parents would have used to send me to college, and it made me pretty paranoid. Some pretty awful things happened there (one girl I knew almost managed to kill herself while in a room with the others, a male intern I knew went to jail for sex with a 12 year old student, etc) but I miss it like crazy. Still, three years later, most of my dreams are set in that program. I went back for three months a year ago, as an intern. It changed my life completely, but I can't figure out whether it was the best thing or the worst thing that ever happened to me.

So, yeah TL;DR, I was a naive little goody-two-shoes girl who got sent to a troubled teen program out in the desert in Utah for 9 months, it changed my life. Go ahead, AMA.

Edit: I'm willing to prove it if anyone has an idea how. "

I was with my high school sweetheart for about 5-6 years before we were married. We lived a pretty modest but OK lifestyle while she worked and I finished my certificate program. She and my family helped support me during this time. 

I went for an (unpaid) internship in a different city while she stayed home. The relationship was strained at this point and of course this didn't help any. We became more and more estranged during this time but still tried to work things out. We got married hoping it would help a little, but it didn't. I switched schools and had my own place (that I paid for) in a different city, though we were still together. Finally she asked me for a divorce and I said OK. We're both 27.

Now she's claiming I owe her money for the time she was working and I was in school. She says I left her high and dry, even though her claim is based on supporting me. She wants me to agree some kind of alimony before she'll sign divorce papers. I earn a small salary at school but not enough to support myself and pay her. My family still helps me financially.

We've split our stuff, in fact I let her keep most of it. I don't think I owe her anything residual. I agree that she helped support me, but my parents gave us money and gifts as well. The relationship breakdown wasn't just my fault either.

Her argument doesn't seem fair to me, but is this how it works? Does my wife have a strong case? She says she doesn't want a trial but has threatened it saying any judge will take her side. I'm worried if this goes on and I eventually get a real job, she'll be entitled to my future income if we're still married. Should I force it to trial or just agree to her terms or try to wait her out?

The rent for 2 of us would be 700 bucks a month not including utilities and when you are working a minimum wage internship its impossible to afford.
  
Now, some additional info.  After spring break, we came back to a leaky faucet upstairs and mold/mushrooms growing in our kitchen on the main level.

I guess today my fingers must have been made of butter and as I took it out of my pocket I ended up juggling it into the air. Well the juggling didn't make me catch it, instead it ended up going higher into the air until it came down flat on the ground and I heard an audible *POP*. 

Picking it up I knew I was screwed and sure enough the entire front screen was shattered. Even the corners looked like it had been mangled in a losing fight with a lawnmower and it had landed flat on it's face. Fortunately it was still usable even though it had small pieces of glass coming off it when I swiped across it. So I made an appointment at the local genius bar.

When I walked into the genius bar after checking in I had about a 30 minute wait until one of the Apple guys introduced me to a genius and told me he was going to be double tasking me with another person. He asked what was wrong and as soon as I took my iPhone out he cringed. I told him what had happened and before my first attempt at iPhone juggling it was working fine. That's when he told me it was going to be $200 to replace it and that's all they could do for me.

I told him I had to have it replaced as getting small fragments of glass in my finger every time I tried to answer a phone call wasn't an option. That's when he told me to hold on a minute and went into the back. When he came out he asked me if I thought I was lucky. I told him no since my career as an iPhone juggler was quickly coming to an end and that's when he dropped the kicker, he was going to replace my iPhone free of charge. I signed a piece of paper saying he gave me an iPhone and left.

I can't believe it. I don't know if this is Apple policy or the guy just was truly being nice. Whatever the case I know that Apple has cemented my business for future items.

Now on to the problem, I've built one or two very successful AMD based builds, using newegg and tigerdirect for parts. I'm looking to completely overhaul my current PC, which to give you an idea, has:

* AMD Phenom II X2 Black Edition CPU
* 2 GB RAM (Can't remember the type as I'm on my laptop)
* ATI 4650 

I built this almost 3 years ago during my WoW era, and as a consequence, it doesn't run (well) a whole lot of newer games I want to play. 

What I would like to do is build a completely new PC, but I'm having a tough time deciding if I want to go the AMD, or the Intel route. 

I was thinking about the i5 2500k, and the HD 6950, but I have little experience with Intel and any mobos that are needed for Intel builds. Can anyone offer any advice?

**edit:**
 My budget is around the $1,200 ballpark, and I don't really need to have it right away. I have an internship this summer that is going to be covering the majority of this build, so at the end of the summer is when I'd really start building.

I know it's a ways off, and I plan to utilize my resources in the International Business college as I get a bit closer to graduation (or possibly internships next summer). I was wondering if anyone who has ""gotten out"" recently would have any advice for someone who is this far out. 

For reference, I'm really hoping to move somewhere in northern/western Europe (preferably not Mediterranean Europe, but anywhere in France, Benelux, Germany, or Scandinavia would be great).

--I am also applying to work for Cvent, Inc as a finance intern and an office assistant. Basically reconcile credit card, copy papers, file reports, etc.
--I also applied as an student budget analyst for the Department of Justice. There I won't do any accounting work, rather analyse fundings, present budget proposals, speak with several federal agencies. (They still haven't called me back yet even after I left them a voicemail)
My question is which job looks better on the resume for Big4 recruiting? I will be applying for the Big4 this Fall and want to show them I have work experience.
Tl;dr Does the Big4 value having an actual accounting job more than a ""big name company"" job that doesn't relate to accounting? Should I go after the big name company or the small company that is accounting related?


**EDIT:** Thanks for all the responses guys! 

One more question pop up in my head: In terms of networking with the recruiters to get internships, if people that worked/are working at the Big4 put a good word about you with the recruiters, would that help me a lot? I have a few friends interning now and am friends with a T.A who worked there."

MFA's thoughts on versatile formalwear?,MisterYan,malefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/hii0p/19_year_old_with_an_office_internship_mfas/,"Hey MFA, I just got a summer internship with an investment banking firm.  I get some leeway since I'm just an (unpaid) intern, but suits are the usual outfit for the office.  At the very least, I would need a jacket and tie each day.  I own enough shirts and ties to get by, but besides that I have one cheap black suit, one black sportcoat, one pair of black dress shoes, and a couple pairs of good slacks in khaki and black.

I'll probably end up buying another suit out of necessity (charcoal or navy).  Would looking on ebay for good designers in my size (38 or thereabouts) and getting them tailored be a viable option?  If that fails, I'll probably end up at the cheap suit store (~$90 a suit) near me.

In terms of non-suit businesswear, I'm open to any suggestions.  Should I invest in any more casual jackets/blazers?  Would chinos, a jacket, and tie be acceptable in a situation like this?  Is there a particular type of shoe I can pick up that would work well formally and casually?  Can I expect to get use out of any piece of clothing I buy for this on an everyday basis at college?

I have the $80 gilt credit to Bonobos and the first-timers $50 discount if that's helpful, and I could make a point to shop at some outlets in the near future.  My price range is low, seeing as I'm not getting paid, but I'd really be open to any suggestions.  Thanks MFA!

hihl6,5,2011-05-23,"I see your fired girlfriend and I raise you a fired spouse who engaged in what could be considered an emotional affair with a homeless, mentally ill client.",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/hihl6/i_see_your_fired_girlfriend_and_i_raise_you_a/,"My spouse of five years and I were in charge of running a program for homeless individuals (transitional, long term housing), mainly focusing on mentally ill adults.  I have been in the field for 5 years, working for this particular company for about 4.  My wife came on board nearly 2 years ago on a part time basis.  It is worth noting that while we get along well both professionally and personally, our marriage had been on the rocks basically from the beginning.  In Feb, my wife went to full time to cover me while i pursued an internship for my masters program.  Somewhere around the time that this all went down, she also began wanting to consider divorce.

We had a resident who was our age, intellectually high functioning and likable.  We had both remarked that he could be a friend, in another context.  About three months ago, I started noticing that my wife was treating him differently than other clients and spending exorbitant amounts of time with him.  I, inappropriately, confronted her at home about what I was noticing.  She denied it, said her Methods were clinically justifiable and asked if I was jealous of one of our clients.  I subsequently brought my concerns to our supervisor who shrugged me off, suggesting that my thinking was off due to our increasing marital strife (which I had kept her aware of).  Despite being shut down twice, my suspicions remained (though I felt quite paranoid for it).  I found my wife lying to me regarding being with him at points during the daytime.  I began tracking her with find my iPhone and noticed inconsistencies in where she said she was vs where she actually was.  I never addressed it directly but made passive aggressive attempts to communicate that I was on to her...even though I didn't know what.  My wife is very sharp and I couldn't imagine her actually cheating with a client, despite the fact that tHis was my prevalent fear.  

Everything came to a head when I looked into her personal email, after catching her in a few more lies, and found correspondence between the two of them, including mention of me and my insecurities regarding them.  I saved this info and sent it onto my supervisor, mainly because I didn't know what to do.  I knew my wife would be outraged that I went into her email.  My supervisor attempted to gently address this by issuing a company-wide policy forbidding communication with clients via personal methods and outside of the workplace.  She then specifically addressed this with my wife and this client.  I then began hearing rumors from my other residents that something was going on between my wife and this resident.  This was a few Fridays ago.

Finally, the following Sunday, my wife said she was going to the grocery store.  I was suspicious and checked the location of her phone.  I could see that she was stopping off at our workplace.  I hopped in my car (with our two children) and met her and the client of them in a park where she had taken him.  I took pictures for any potential legal purposes and there was a intense, but not explosive confrontation.  

Later that night she came home and we talked about it.  She informed me that they had not slept together but had kissed that day after the confrontation and said that she loved him.  She also stated that she couldn't say whether she loved me and still didn't want to be with me.  

She lost her job the next day, he lost his housing a few days later.  She still sees him ""as a friend"" sporadically and we are currently taking time to figure out where we go from here.  We have been up and down alot, emotionally, as you can imagine.  I had initially stated that if she wanted to consider staying with me, she needs to commit to working on the relationship and cut him out.  She agreed to this but then backtracked a few times, saying she felt forced into it (with the alternative being that she loses her home and potentially the kids).  We are in a holding pattern because she feels she cannot make any decisions, even regarding him or me, at this point.  We are both in therapy working on the issues that led us to this point.  

She is still very angry at me for invading her personal space and betraying her by sharing it with our supervisor.  I am able to respect and understand that.  She also feels that the company was overly punitive for both her and the client. That one, I'm not so sure about.  She says she connected with him because he listened to her and made her feel okay about various qualities.  Said she could talk to him about anything, that they thought alike and felt he was deep. Said she also related to him in regard to her own ""mental health"". These are certainly things that our marriage was missing and I can freely acknowledge it.  She feels the romance/sexual attraction resulted from the secrecy and hiding.  keep in mind, while I was in the dark about them, she concluded that she was not sexually attracted to me and that I was not deep enough for her.

People she talks to say ""he turned you in?!?"" and people I've talked to seem to think I'm being too passive and that I did exactly what any other guy would've done.  

So, what say you, reddit?  And this can be an AMA as well, I suppose.  In fact, she is a redditor and is considering doing her own AMA.

Tl;dr my wife and I ran a homeless program for mentally ill.  My Erie had an emotional affair to a client and the result of my actions left her unemployed."

Last summer, she was just about to start grad school and then her father passed away so she went back to Japan to take care of her mother for a little while. She was supposed to come back to the US and resume her studies, but now that looks like that isn't happening. See [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hjdiq/long_distance_relationship_with_girl_from_japan/) for details (Its long...).

Meanwhile, I'm one online class away from graduating with a Computer Science degree, and I'm in a pretty good position in my life to move to her instead. I also studied Japanese (never got a minor or anything, just took language classes) and I've been there a couple times now so its not going to be a giant shock for me to go to move there; I'm sure it will take time to adjust, but I really love learning the language and culture. 

However, I need a job. Specifically, one that will get me a visa so that I can live there. I have about 3 years of experience now working at various internships, and my Japanese ability is probably daily conversational (on a good day). I really don't care what it is- if I have to bite the bullet and teach English or something that would be tolerable- but since I have an actual skill thats in demand, it would be much preferred to do something in the IT industry. I'm hoping to visit her this summer for a few months and look for a job, but until then, I'm stuck here in the US so that probably makes it more difficult as well.

Hey fellow ents. I recently was offered an internship for a field related to my major. However, one of the requirements is a drug test before I am hired. I'm scheduled to take it today in a few hours, but worried I'm not clean yet.

I stopped smoking two weeks ago today. Before that, my smoking pattern went as follows: Smoked daily for 4 weeks, off 1 week, smoke 2g (with roomate each time) for 1 week, now clean for 2 weeks as of today. 

I took an at home drug test, one I bought from Walgreens for ~$18, and THC specified. It tested negative (no THC on this particular test), however, the line stating it was negative was very faint.

I've asked questions of r/filmmakers before and you've always been helpful...so once again I must call upon the wisdom of those more experienced than I.

So...I'm a film student in NYC and I just started an internship at a small post house/camera rental place that deal pretty much exclusively with RED. I thought it'd be a great chance to learn the camera and work flow and all the stuff
Associated with the RED. I never had any glorified ideas of what an internship would be bit so far this has been a pretty bad experience. I've spent all my time doing absolutely nothing, lugging equipment around  the city to return it to other rental houses or (my favorite) doing dishes, vacuuming and taking out the trash. 

So my question is...do I stay? The people are nice enough most of the time but I just don't feel like I'm learning anything worthwhile, which isn't that supposed to be the point? Its and unpaid internship and I'm not using it for credit and so the reason to stay would be to learn and for it to look good on my resume, which currently lacks in the interning dept. Yet I feel my time here could be better spent honing my crafts and building myself a good reel and a website. So reddit? What's should I do? I'm gonna look for another internship obviously but at this point into the summer most good positions have been filled I think so if I don't find one should I stay or should I go? Any advice?

TL;DR - I'm a film student in a crappy internship and I don't know if I should leave or not.

I am a mechanical engineering student in my senior year, working my last co-op rotation at a company I would really like to be hired after I graduate next year. I also would like to apply for the company’s career development program which is a fast track to a supervisor/manager role. 

To get into this program the student must have a combination of grades, work experience and extracurricular activities, especially in a leadership role. My grades are average for an engineer and my work experience is very extensive IMO.

This summer I am kind of working with a few freshmen interns. We are not all working on the same exact projects but we are in the same department and all sitting at the same cubes. I feel this is a great opportunity to get some leadership experience and to help the interns out too.

I need your help and ideas to prove to my boss and his boss that I am a capable leader AND this would be a good topic to discuss with the career development committee when they select candidates next year.

What are some ideas to organize and lead the interns?  I just grabbed a big whiteboard and cabinets for the team.

Thanks in advance!

I have a bachelors degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Multimedia. 
I have school experience with Java, Python, but have not programmed since leaving school two years ago. Definitely something I could relearn and bring back up to speed if needed.

For the past year and a half I have been working as an I.T. Specialist for an Environmental Saftey consulting firm, doing mainly desktop support, all aspects from hardware and software configuration, Windows OS, Windows Server, Mac OS, Office suites. In addition I do occasionally work with our servers (Dell 710/510) Active Directory, Group Policy, Microsoft Exchange.

In the past I did web design for about 5 years for small clients. Strong skills in HTML, CSS, XHTML, and basic skills in XML, JavaScript, PHP. Something again I can bring up to speed if needed. Just never had the need for any projects I worked on so I never spent much time mastering. 
I also worked on the new US Department of Radiation website during my internship with www.PNNL.gov
I did about 90% of the data migration and formatting of the site content from the old site to the new site, located here. http://lowdose.energy.gov/

I have over 10 years working directly in customer service in the medical environment, and also the retail environment doing sales and as a supervisor. I can assure you that I am a reliable prospect able to jump right in, and I do not look for the easy way out. I have had (aside from one internship right out of school) three jobs, including my current place of employment, in the past 14 years.

I am looking to stay within I.T. But of course would consider other opportunities as well. I really enjoy working with all the hardware and back end equipment and would love to continue that career path. I would also like a permanent position as opposed to contract.
I am looking for a salary in the range of $60,000 to $70,000, but I do not moving up a ladder to that goal either.
I can send resume if interested. 
I'd rather not post all my information online.

Thanks, Jeff"

hjnoc,2,2011-05-25,In college for a ME degree in Texas. Any hope of leaving?,Nathan_BS,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/hjnoc/in_college_for_a_me_degree_in_texas_any_hope_of/,"So I have finished two semesters at a low-cost college in Texas using the Texas Tomorrow Fund, a college system which allows for somebody's family to make gradual payments into the program, then the kid will use that money to go on to college. The only loans I have accepted were to rent books and to have cash to eat on campus, so I would say that equates to around $1000.  I have finished my Physics portion, two semesters of history, and one ethics course for engineering.
Like many people here, I want out of America. I have yet to decide where to, but really right now I just want out of here before it's too late.  I'm watching our political system run our country into the ground with the help of big corporations which feed off of nothing but profits and practically farm us citizens for cash, at the expense of our well-being. I don't want to fight an inevitable fight. In fact, I don't want to be a part of it at all.
I have decided that my most open option would be Mexico, since I'm in Texas.  Of course, Mexico isn't in such a great shape either.  So if not Mexico, I guess I could flee to Canada? Of course this is a very long trip, so I have calculated that, by driving using stocked-up gas tanks from my city (~3.75 atm), that I would be spending an average of 376.83 when driving my 25 mpg car. Of course I could save some gas by leaving in the winter, but anything could happen in the given time. I will also need money for food, which I guess would be about $100 if I eat sparingly. Then there's the loan I need to pay back, before it starts adding interest. (all subsidized, thankfully) So adding in motel costs, I am looking at, hopefully, only around $1700 in costs to leave by car. Of course I could leave by airplane, but I would be packing a lot. In fact, far too much to actually be worth the cost of shipping. I have a pretty roomy car, so driving looks more attractive.
Of course I don't have $2k stashed in my closet right now, (and screw banks too) so I need to get a decent job and save/raise some cash. I currently work at the Cowboys Stadium, so I don't get much of a paycheck, but I am job searching and hopefully I find something pretty decent. (and legal!) I guess I could also sell some of my unimportant commodies which I have bought over the years? Another delay in the road may be that I might get accepted for an internship at Bell Helicopter (not so much snag, as much as a magnificent blessing involving some patience) where, if I do intern for them, I am obligated to work for their company for two years after graduating.  So here are my current questions:

* What can I expect as far as starting a new life in a Canadian city?
* Should I finish college in Texas, given that I quit taking loans and continue with the Texas Tomorrow Plan?
* Will there be any other sure expenses which I haven't taken into account?
* Should I intern at Bell Helicopter? Will two years of experience + internship with their company look good to Canadian engineer firms?
* Are there any legalities involving leaving the US to Canada? ( I couldn't find any)
* Other places are also in consideration, unless they are within US border. Any closer well-off countries which I have overlooked?
* If I get an friend to save up some cash, would it be a good idea to bring him/her along to help ease the boredom of a multiple-day trip?

Ultimately I think it would be nice to live in Sydney.  The thought of living in Australia has always seemed very cool to me, especially as a kid when I watched The Crocodile Hunter all the time.  Of course I know the very notion of moving to Sydney right out of college is ludicrous, so I am going somewhere somewhat reasonable (Canada?)

Any helpful advise?

EDIT: I have decided that I am waiting until after I finish college to make the big move. In the meanwhile I will be doing research on how to get a visa, and possibly join a program for studying abroad so I can get a feel for another country, possibly across the sea.  I would probably also talk to my family and friends about it first. I see the most resistance with my family though, they have a very pro-american mindset and I need to explain to them why this is such an important choice to me.  Thanks for the help!"

Here's the position description in general: 

A new IT project is looking for a full time IT Support person and intern, to provide support to the Senior Developer. The role would involve learning a lot of valuable skills, including web development, Salesforce Administration and general IT support.

What we're ideally wanting is someone with as much interest and exposure as possible to a range of IT tasks, including PHP, CSS, MySQL, Email Config, Office, Apple, Windows, cPanel, Reddit...

This position would suit a junior web developer who is willing to take on IT support work, or a skilled IT support person who is willing to learn web development.

Salary will be based on skill and experience, but within a fairly broad range.

SalesForce experience would be super highly regarded, but not an expectation for this role.

As said earlier, this is a full time role, and would not suit a current student.


The position (and also salary) is actually fairly vague in that we'd tailor the position to what we get, rather than looking for a really specific set of skills.

If you are (or know someone who is) a tech supporter with web dev experience, or a starting web developer who knows their stuff outside of the web dev environment (setting up laptops, doing data entry, etc) feel free to PM me.

This is a career starting entry level position in a fun and casual small company, not a step in a career for a proficient developer / programmer, so there's no need for years of experience or super high level skills.

Feel free to PM me (as I said before), or if you want to ask questions, abuse me for random things, or make a series of puns that distract from the point of the post... hey, it's reddit, that's what the comments are for!

I originally wasn't going to do it at all, but she convinced me and I applied.

I'm sure there's much more to it than that, but I will find out more later.  I am incredibly excited! This is going to be a great opportunity!

The interest quickly developed and I have since been studying design through online articles and a few books.  I've also had some real world experiences including an internship for a graphic design professor,  being design editor of the yearbook at my school, as well as various local freelance jobs.

So, I ask everyone here what is your opinion on a good design program?  To anyone in a similar program, what should I expect to get out of this that I haven't learned already?  I know and understand both sides of the ""a degree in design is pointless"" argument.  But to be honest, after about 4 years of teaching myself about design, i fucking love it.  I couldn't imagine myself going to school for anything else and hey, a degree definitely can't hurt you in the long run."

I'm an Electrical Engineer going into my senior year, and despite going into this year, I'm still pretty clueless about my own industry, especially revolving around jobs. I get the idea that barely anything you learn in school will really be needed in the real world, as most companies will teach you everything you need to know. So my questions are to any fellow EE majors with jobs or anyone that can help me are:

1) Given the economy, should I apply for jobs now?
2) What are some possible companies I should be on the look out for? I know Siemens, but that's really it in terms of Electrical stuff.
3) Do websites like Linkedln really work? How can I go about meeting people in order to actually have a shot at landing a job once I get outta college?

Any tips you guys have for me would be fantastic. As you can tell, I'm pretty clueless when it comes to job hunting. 
Thank you guys!

Some background: I don't have the greatest GPA, but I'd say it's respectable for engineering, and I haven't landed an internship. Mostly because I've spent my summers trying to catch up on classes missed during the year. "

Hey guys (and girls).

Myself and some guys have had a version of this site internally in our job for a few years. We decided it was time to let it loose to the world and see what everyone thinks.
Sadly we had to take a large amount of the content off, as it was incriminating to us... and our employer.

Feedback is welcome. Hope you guys like it., Feel free to add to the list we've been making over the last week.

It all started one day as a joke because one intern wasn't doing shit, even though he would tell us otherwise.


We are all serverside developers, so its not pretty. It never was, so we just left it at that.
Anyways, hope yous like it,

I’m a little nervous. 

I don’t want to admit that it’s my first time, but it is. I’m nineteen and a bit clumsy; I fumble in my wallet while her eyes stare holes into me. I would be lying if I said I wasn’t a little scared, a little anxious, and a bit excited. There is a line behind me. I have to hurry I tell myself, and I finally find what I’m looking for within my wallet. I slide my trailpass through card reader and move backwards through the bus to find a seat next to a decrepit looking lady who seems either to have several cats, or killed her first husband and locked his mutilated body in the basement freezer. This is my first time on the bus, but it won’t be my last. My internship deep within the confines of Shallcross Bus Depot had just started and I would be making the almost two hour trip, daily, for the next six months.  

It’s November, and I knew I was about to get into it, a bad situation, the shit, nothing good. There are no seats except near the back of the bus where all the high school and remedial school kids sat. My IPod’s batteries died on the subway earlier, but I had learned to stick the ear buds into my ear just in case someone decides that I look like I’m interested in the fact that they used to live in Maryland, but they moved down here in 1995 with their ex husband, and now they work retail at the Franklin Mills Mall, but things are looking up because their youngest son just graduated high school, and their middle daughter is about to leave the correctional facility she was in for assaulting two other women at a corner store because they cut in line. There’s no music playing, but the illusion keeps the crazy away to point.
 
I take a seat behind a group of tattooed African American youth. I know they’re only starting high school or ending middle school because they can’t be much taller than my shoulder. Every one of them has a cacophony of tattoos. From their necks to their hands; stars, names, skulls, skylines, teardrops, chains, and other generally unsettling things I’m not used to seeing on a kids shorter than 5’3”.  At this point I’m feeling a little out of place. My khakis and tucked in Polo clearly mark me as an outsider here. I lack that generally menacing look in my eye, and this probably signals to these kids I’m not from around there. No one seems to mind my presence so far. No comments were made in indecipherable Ebonics in my direction and I took this as a good sign. Like a rabbit that had made a home among wolves I felt a little strange, but it’s either this or standing, and I was much too lazy for that. 

The bus stops. A large black man in hospital scrubs gets on and sits across from me. He ran into the same problem I did with the lack of space. He’s massive. At least 6’3” and severely built, his trapezius muscles look like they are trying to break free of his neck. The short sleeves he wears show off a mosaic. Tattoos that took years to acquire, some fading with age, others standing on edge, like they have just been placed there, years of intertwining ink blending into his skin. I try not to stare.
  
 Crack. Skittle. Skittle. Brush. Then the soft sound of cigar tobacco hitting the floor of the bus, followed by the sweet, sticky, slightly repulsive smell of marijuana. 

“Yo fool, you best roll that blunt right, nigga,” says a voice I’m not supposed to be hearing. 

“Shut up cuz, I got this shit,” replies another voice I’m not listening too. 

“ha ha you nigga’s better not spill any my fucking weed,” chimes in a third. 

“I can’t believe that nigga Trey, fucking bailing on Saturday. I had to run for like four blocks before I lost the cops,” Says another

“You still on that shit, cousin,” says a voice I think I have heard before. 

“Fuck him, If I ever see that nigga again, I’ll get J’s gun and lay that nigga out,” Says a voice I’m definitely not supposed to be hearing. 

“Yo nigga your rolling that jawn too tight!,” Erupts a voice.
“Chill cousin, chill,” soothes another. 

“How we going to fucking sort Trey out man,” inquires one of them. 

“Fuckin’ A, man I’ll swing by J’s and talk to him about a gun,” One of them not quite whispers. 

I’m at the edge of my seat. I’m pretending with all my might that I’m tuning into some music, because I’m clearly not supposed to be hearing this. It clearly sounds like these kids probably all less than 15 years old are planning to kill someone. Someone named Trey, who clearly bailed on Saturday. I try not to laugh at how simply ludicrous this seems. I put all of my effort into becoming scenery.

Then something unexpected happens. My fellow passenger, the man in the scrubs with all the arm tattoos and the bulging trapezius muscles leans forward. He is not wearing headphones. He is not pretending to listen to music. He looks like he has a lot more in common with these kids than I do. The look on his face is stern. As he shifts his massive body towards them, one of them catches his monolithic figure moving slightly towards the posse out of the corner of his eye and prompts the others silently to turn towards him. I catch all of their faces, I’m still wall paper. 

“If you’re going to do some shit like that, you tell no one,” says the man. 

He leans back. He has finished talking. The kids all stare at him for another minute. Some of them have their jaws visibly dropped. The one with the blunt has tucked it behind his ear. 

“Aw, sheet,” is the only thing one of them says as he pulls the line to signal the next stop. 

Then in an almost eerie silence they depart. Some with their heads low, other’s talking about sparking that shit. 

I continue to sit there, I’m still wallpaper. 

Only 45 more minutes to go.

He drunkenly heard a story from someone that a girl he knew had sex with a guy in a bar, and immediately thought it was her because she had gone out that night.
So drunken ex yelled at my girlfriend and grabbed/shoved her in the house before trying to carry her upstairs so ""he could have his fun too"".

I've always had a love of programming and computers and learned the basics of C back in elementary school, along with several other languages, and now do robotics building at my university.

However, my question is other than the obvious routes (finance or econ) which are unavailable to me for certain reasons, would it be more advisable to choose accounting as a major and supplement it with some finance classes, or marketing as a major and supplement it with finance classes?

I assume that a case could be made for either since institutional sales is still sales... So supposing that I am able to supplement it with finance classes as well as finance-related extracurriculars, does it matter what I pick between marketing and accounting?

I stopped smoking last sunday (even though I did smoke everyday for the past 6 months), and have been religiously taking this along with lots of water and cranberry juice since then. I'm about 130 lbs, pretty lean, but don't excercise as much as I really should. I'll have 10 days of not smoking by the time I have to take the test. Should I be worried?

Out of 81k ents, I hope there's someone out that that has tried this. Please, if you've tried it, tell me if it's worked or not. I will make sure to post my results once I find out next week.

Last week I bought a bottle of [Sonne's #7 Detoxificant](http://www.amazon.com/Sonnes-Organic-Foods-Detoxification-liquid/dp/B000I83GGY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=hpc&amp;qid=1306371254&amp;sr=1-1). I've read in many places that this can get rid of THC in your system and let you pass a drug test by taking a spoonful of this twice a day for 7 days along with lots of water.

I stopped smoking last sunday (even though I did smoke everyday for the past 6 months), and have been religiously taking this along with lots of water and cranberry juice since then. I'm about 130 lbs, pretty lean, but don't excercise as much as I really should. I'll have 10 days of not smoking by the time I have to take the test. Should I be worried?

Out of 81k ents, I hope there's someone out that that has tried this. Please, if you've tried it, tell me if it's worked or not. I will make sure to post my results once I find out next week.

I gotta say that even if this doesn't work for THC, ever since I've taken it I feel much more ""clean"" and energetic. I recommend it just for the health benefits. 

(If you haven't tried Sonne's #7, please upvote to get to front page so others may see this.) I don't care for the upvotes, I just want to find out if this works."

-familiarize her with programs that she will use no matter where she teaches in the county (our math website, our district website, our gradebook/lesson plan book)

-contact information for curriculum specialists in the districts

-weekly meetings and a log book where I record my comments/kudos/suggestions for what she has done for the day

I graduated in Summer 2010 with a Bachelors in Biotechnology and after a 6month unemployment period I found an internship with a big IT firm doing data entry of clinical trials for the big pharmas until March 2011. Since then I have joined a professionals 24 month masters program in a prestigious university in North America listed in the top 100 list which combines science with business.  I would be needing to complete a long internship in industry if I want to complete this program (most of 2012). I know this is still some times away, but I would preferably like to secure a position or just get into contact with professionals who can point me in the right direction in the coming few months. If needed immediately, I would not rule out the idea completing tasks from home. I would preferably want to relocate to Europe for this position but if you have an opportunity/position not in Europe, I would also like to hear from you. I have a good understanding and experience of both the business aspects and the scientific aspects of this field.  I have experience working in small self-managing teams with a given budget to complete projects with profits in mind. Though I have the basic lab skills (PCR, running assays, gel electrophoresis etc.. I would prefer to get into the marketing/sales/business side of this industry which is what this program is geared towards).  Though they help us find such positions, I rather branch out on my own and not be limited to what I am offered only. 

I do not mind whether I am working for a startup or a big established firm. I have an international background, having lived in every continent besides Australia and Antartica so I can relate to just about anyone.  I'm fluent in English and Hindi, Advanced in Spanish, and am currently learning French also. If you guys need more information PM please! so we can discuss my experience/background more in depth as I do not want to release too much information publicly."

I haven't had a job since I graduated in Dec. '10. Though I did ""intern"" with the chair of the department I majored in after graduation, though it wasn't technically an internship, I was more of a research assistant who got paid 100 bucks about every week from his own pocket and meals and beers every once and a while. 

I only had one real job while I was at university, and it was mostly a desk job, though at the beginning I had more responsibilities than I ended up with. I also did telephone survey research for about 2 months.

I have an arts degree in Religious Studies, but I'm applying to a Master's program in Library Science. I honestly know nothing about creating a good resume, and don't feel I have a lot of experience to fill one out that would even make it one full page.

Any tips to help out would be lovely.

hlq54,1,2011-05-27,Have you ever been arrested for installing software?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/hlq54/have_you_ever_been_arrested_for_installing/,"Super long story made not quite as long:

I worked as the Senior Systems/Network Administrator for a company for almost 5 years.  The company had 75 employees and 3 in IT: Director of IT, Me, and the Helpdesk/Configuration Technician (and technically two more IT ""interns"" - one was a web developer and the other was the nephew of the owner).  When I started, there were no Group Policies, no controls on equipment or software installs, and everything was basically an ""honor system"".  I got things locked down without being too intrusive.  Part of my day was testing software and patches before rolling out to the general employees.

The IT force (Director, helpdesk, interns, and myself) would play jokes on one another during absences - if the director would go on vacation we would foil his office, or when the interns would go on vacation we'd change their profiles and passwords etc.  They had never ""gotten"" me.  To make sure my record would stay intact, I installed some encryption software on my workstation PC.

During last year employed there, I requested and was given a 2 week vacation. On my way out the door, the IT director asked for my password and I gave it to him.  Halfway through the vacation - when I was out of the country - I received a phone call asking for the password.  The last day of my vacation I received a call from the owner saying the company was ""moving in a different direction"" and that I would no longer be employed there.

When filling out unemployment benefits, my form was rejected because the company stated I was fired due to violation of the company conduct handbook.  That ""installing encryption software without informing anyone in management of the password"" led to my termination.

Fast forward 18 months - The local police arrested me for Computer Tampering.  Basically the law reads that if you install any software, or alter the computer in any way - without permission - that you're in violation of this law.  I don't disagree that I installed the encryption software.  Apparently I'm allowed to install any number of software titles - and even reformat the workstation several times (XP was on there 3 different times, then Vista a couple times) - but if you encrypt you must be a criminal.

Now when you google for my name you can find ""arrested for computer tampering"" pages.  That'll make finding a new job much more difficult.

So yeah, I was arrested for doing my job and testing software."

Early 2004 my parents divorced, and as a result of that my grades went down a LOT! In 2006 I dropped out of highschool, started working at random places for a few months and then decided to apply for college regardless of me not having a degree of any kind. I got accepted, and after going to college for about 3 years I got stuck in the same old routine where I just skipped lots of classes and just didnt care anymore. In 2009 I dropped out of college, and I haven't been doing anything ever since. Until recently when I got in contact with school again and they offered me an opportunity I couldn't refuse. They gave me the option to resume college where I left off, in the last year. All I had left to get my degree was to find an internship for 20 weeks and complete it. So I did.

In January 2011 I found an internship and was able to start in February, I have since worked my ass off to get my degree and hopefully a job at my internship. Until today. The unthinkable has happened. They offered me a job! I have 2 weeks left on my internship, and then I am officially an employee."

I am currently a sophomore Computer Engineering major and am currently debating whether to stay in my major or switch to computer science. This is partially due to my change of interests and concern about my GPA, but I really am not sure what I should do. 

Right now my GPA isn’t so great (2.5). I am also a student athlete in a highly touted program, which takes a lot of my time, but my education is still very important to me. So far I’ve taken mostly core engineering classes, a lot of which are EE classes on circuit theory and analysis, which I really don’t enjoy. My professors haven’t been stellar in those classes, but I am just not enjoying them either (I usually eek out Cs in those).  My computer engineering classes, which have mostly been intro classes and on programming microcontrollers I do enjoy much more (usually Bs). Computer Science has always been my thing, and I find it really easy to understand, so I usually get As in those classes. 

I’ve always had an interest in robotics, and really like programming microcontrollers and working with systems similar to that, which is why I chose Computer Engineering. I’ve had computer science internships for three summers now and enjoy programming.  I am not entirely sure what I want to do when I graduate, but I feel a Comp. Engineering degree gives me more options. My concern is my GPA, and how much that will effect me getting jobs.  Also a Comp. Science degree is a BS, not an engineering degree, which I think will also change job possibilities.  I’m a crossroads and not sure what I should do. Any help is greatly appreciated

**TL;DR I’m a soph. computer engineering major with a 2.5 GPA and thinking of switching to computer science. Is it worth getting a BS instead of an engineering degree and hopefully graduating with a higher GPA?**

hm6bk,1,2011-05-28,"So, /r/China, I need some career advice.  Should I make the jump from education to trade?",mthmchris,China,https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/hm6bk/so_rchina_i_need_some_career_advice_should_i_make/,"As an aside, a little bit of background: my undergraduate background was finance, and I had all the good luck to graduate in the midst of the financial crisis.  Came to China, started teaching English and doing some postgraduate Finance work (CFA) on the side.  The CFA's almost finished with, and recently I've been lucky enough to bump into a handful of what I think to be interesting opportunities.

**Managing a English Training Center:** Currently, I work for a joint English/Mandarin training center in Shenzhen.  It's foreign run, and has a real vibe of a start-up.  It's an enormous amount of fun - there's tons of development that has to be done, and I've enjoyed being able to actually *create* things (making an internship program for college students interested in teaching ESL, an exchange program for Chinese students to go to America, curriculum development, etc).

The company is expanding fast and is opening a second branch elsewhere in the city (the location would be... absolutely phenomenal). The head of the company told me that he wants me to go over and manage the new branch, which I think would present itself as a great opportunity.  It would give not only management experience, but also a chance to implement things that I think the company will need if it intends to scale - e.g. a real management system, a better pricing structure (i.e. pay by month, not by course), a move from cash-based to accrual accounting, and so on.

It would be fascinating.  But not only that, in some sense, I feel the company needs me.  While profits have been good, at time I feel that the school's been getting by the skin of its teeth - most of its success derived simply because it's probably the best place in Shenzhen to teach English (happy, experienced teachers that share methodology and care about students generally makes satisfied students).  If the school wants to scale, it's going to need more.  

**Working for a Chinese Courier:** (what up Asizo?) Just a short time ago, I met someone that recently moved to Shenzhen to work for one of China's larger couriers.  Apparently, the company would like to expand overseas in the near future, and were recruiting trainees.  The work environment is all Chinese, and while the salary is low there would be an enormous potential to both work on professional-level Chinese and learn about logistics.

**Working with an Israeli importer of iPhone parts:**  One of my close  friends from university randomly hooked me up with one of his family members in Israel, who is looking for someone to handle the export of iPod parts from China to Israel.  They said that they would train me and teach me everything that I would have to know in import/export.

Anyway, this ran way long.  What would you do if you were in my shoes?"

Just some quick information: we are both 21 years old (I'm a male) and we have been together for 6 months.

My friend jokingly asked my girlfriend if she's okay with me working abroad after college (I fully intend to do so), which lead to talking about my internship I have to do next year (4 months)

I told my girlfriend I probably won't do it, and stay here for my internship. She then asked why I won't do it abroad

I told her I probably won't get selected either way (my grades aren't all that good), I can't handle it financially (I'm a student living on his own, got kicked out of my parents house/financial support) and that I don't think it's a good thing for our relationship to be apart for such a long time (I wouldn't be able to see her once during those 4 months)

She now keeps telling me I HAVE to do it, that it's an opportunity of a life time, and if she's such a big reason for me to say no, she would even leave me.

This makes me feel really uncomfortable/sad

She is not the main reason (mainly the financial part, I **won't** be able to pay for it) but she's a reason as well

Is there anything I can do?"

I just finished my third year as a mechanical engineer at a large public university. I have been trying to get an internship for this summer but no luck thus far. I am not giving up though! My GPA is around a 3.15 (is that good/decent, honestly?) and I have no prior intern experience. I was a tutor my sophomore year of college and I worked in retail for a short stint in high school. My backup plan for the summer was to take summer school, and that starts next week. I have to make the decision to either drop all my classes to get the full tuition amount back and work during the summer, or take these classes and have no intern experience when I graduate in May of next year. If I don't take summer school, then I'll graduate in December of next year. That would also free me up to potentially have another chance at an internship next summer. What should I do? Do I have a chance of landing a full time job if I don't have any relevant experience, and with what I consider a low GPA? I recently made the decision to hold off summer school, thus graduating in December, but now I'm just not sure...

Oh and I should note that I was recently contacted by a company and was told that I am on the ""second wave"" of applicants (the second wave usually doesn't start work until June 10, according to this gentleman) and I should ""expect a call next week"".

hm44i,4,2011-05-28,CPA Exam Advice?,counteraxe,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/hm44i/cpa_exam_advice/,"After graduating with my BA in Econ I went back to community college to get my accounting units for the CPA (just finished this semester!). While back at CC I got an internship working in an investments office, and I kinda shifted my focus more toward finance, and really haven't been thinking about CPA. I figured that I would continue the accounting courses and try for both investments and auditing jobs. Yesterday I got a job offer for an Auditing position. 

Now that I will be doing audit work I am planning on going for the CPA. I just finished cost accounting this semester so I'd like to take BEC first, maybe in the Oct/Nov testing window. I am worried though because that will start my 9 month window, and the test will be changing in 2012. I am worried about the delay between the new test coming out and the updating of prep materials. 

Also, I am interested in what prep courses you have found useful. My employer is apart of the partnership program with Becker, which brings the cost of their course down to $2,500 for me, but my employer doesn't reimburse. I am also thinking about the [Yaeger](http://www.yaegercpareview.com/) course, which is basically the Wiley book and software plus video lectures. The total cost is about $1,500 for all four units. 

TL;DR: Is it unwise to begin the exam during the fall testing window? How soon do prep courses release their updated materials? And what prep courses do you recommend?"

So, I've been with my GF for nearly 7 years now (22 y/o male here). Not my first GF but first really serious one. We've been living together for the last year and it's been going great. I love spending time with her, we talk about everything, and I feel like we have a solid relationship. 

I'm going back for my last year of college after this summer though and I'm starting to fear that I'm going to regret having lived a 'in-a-relationship' style lifestyle my entire college life. I've only been to a couple parties and gotten drunk one or two times, with her, and haven't really ever left my comfort zone and developed the ability to meet and talk with people fluently. I've made no real friendships in college and am starting to regret that. 

I hate that I feel this way but I'd like to go out and get drunk and hit on/sleep with girls while I can just so I don't look back and regret never having done it. Every friday night that passes, while other people are having the years of their life, and I'm sitting around, I feel awful. I'm an intern over the summer and intern groups form up and go out to bars and the like at night, for example. What do I do, leave my GF alone and go to bars without her? Am I the guy who brings his GF to everything, even unrelated functions? I don't know what I am supposed to do here, and at the moment, it's just miss out on opportunities.

I feel selfish for this but I also can't really help it. It seems like such a shallow thing, and that's not lost on me - but I have a real fear that I'm going to waste my only chance in life to get drunk, have fun, and meet people before I enter the working world and I'm really going to regret it when I get older.

My girlfriend isn't really into drinking, not really very adventurous when it comes to going places (and I'm not that much as well, but I'm trying to open up to that), so I'm not sure how I'm supposed to go about this. 

The positive thing is that my girlfriend seems to be more open about the sexual part than most. I mentioned to her before that I don't know how I feel about only having sex with one girl my entire life (she's had sex with one person before me, she's my only) and she said both that she would be ok with me having sex with another girl as long as I asked her about it first and she was okay with her, and I know she's open to a threesome. However, the amount of realisticness of this ever happening given that I'm in a relationship so I have no viable reason to go to places where I can meet girls seems pretty near-zero to me.

I want to be with my girlfriend. I can see her as the person I eventually marry. I love spending time with her. But this is wearing on me and depressing me. I don't know what to do.

I want to bring this up to her but I'd like to run it through here and make sure I'm checking my own viewpoints first before I open the floodgates.

Questions I have:

1) Is this something I should try to get over or something that should be addressed?

2) Is it possible to experience the things I'm missing out on in a long-term relationship in college? If so, how?

3) If/When I talk to her about this, what should I be focusing on/saying specifically? I don't want to hurt her, and the thought of ruining our relationship over this makes me sick to my stomach, but I want to be blunt about it. 

4) Is this even a feeling that can be addressed while staying in a relationship?

5) Anyone else have similar experiences?

hm12x,1,2011-05-28,Help with a Girl,bills11,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/hm12x/help_with_a_girl/,"Hey guys, long time reader, first time poster here, sorry if it is a long post.  I am a 21 year old male in college who really has no major experience with girls (kissed one once and took a few to high school dances but that is it).  Basically my story involves me and two girls (G1 and G2).  I met G1 in January at school doing an internship together, kind of had a thing for her right away but didn't push it really because of my shyness, lack of confidence and being afraid of rejection.  Eventually about a month and a half ago I sent her a fb message (didn't have her number or see her much) saying how school only had a few weeks left and we should hang out more and stuff and gave her my number.  She said that we should which was cool but after that never gave me her # or texted me and didn't respond to my next few fb chats.  I've pretty much realized she isn't interested in anything more than friends and kind of accepted that.  

Now is where I go back to G2, who I met through G1.  We met randomly one night during the semester when I was in line for a basketball game behind G1 and her friends (before I sent the fb message), we made small talk but eventually G1 and most of the group had to leave because they weren't season ticket holders, leaving only me and G2.  G2 and I eventually went to talk for about 45 minutes (a real feat for me) about a ton of things, and I honestly would have asked her out then but she had a bf which she mentioned.  

Now is where it gets somewhat tricky for me, since the semester is over I have tried talking to G1 (not really gotten anywhere) and G2 more.  My talks with G2 have gone better and I think/hope there is a possibility there.  The good thing, for me at least, is I think she might not have a bf anymore due to some relationship is over type of fb statues, but it doesn't say single of in a relationship on her profile so I don't know for sure and don't feel like it is appropriate to ask.  The other side of that though is I did give my number to G2 as well in a fb chat (she could have missed it but I don't see how really) and she hasn't texted me either or given me her # (same as G1).  

Now I am really starting to like G2 but unfortunately won't be able to see her/ask her on a date till August because we live far away in the summer.  Do I tell G2 i like her now, even though we won't see each other in person for months?  Do I wait it out and hope she is single all summer?  Do I ask G1 (who is the only friend of G2 I know) if G2 is single and I would have a shot?  Do I do this all on fb chat or try to get her # again or skyp or something?  Am I completely wrong and have no shot at all?

To end it I will add I would still try to go out with G1 if she was interested but I have kind of gotten the hint she isn't, and am starting to like G2 more anyway.  Also, I don't really hang out with these two girls much due to just meeting them but would like to at least do that more if I could in the fall.  

Thanks to anyone that read all this, I really appreciate the help!"
hlyhi,2,2011-05-27,Gas leases - fraud? Contract law question,obsessive_cook,law,https://www.reddit.com/r/law/comments/hlyhi/gas_leases_fraud_contract_law_question/,"Doing an internship and been collecting natural gas leases from landowners, getting stories from them. Many of these leases are for hydraulic fracturing, a controversial new technique that landmen are apparently presenting to these landowners as safe as older techniques. Within days of drilling, some of these landowners can no longer get water out of water wells, or end up with methane bubbles, or chalky white water, or water that is at a lethal dose of several chemicals. Talked to neighbors of a house that exploded from the methane buildup. Evidence of harassment and blatant lying by landmen as well, but that's another story.

So, a question about contract law. If these gas companies do not disclose anything about risk at all in these contracts, but it's technically still uncertain to say for sure how much risk is in the new practice of hydraulic fracturing (more due to lack of research but there are a couple papers and EPA studies out there...gas companies deny any proof), what *is* this? **Is there a case for fraud/deception/mistake/unconscionability/etc.?** Attempted cases seem to be frequently thrown out of court or doesn't even get there at all due to lack of lawyers willing to represent the landowners or unwilling to hire experts to testify. 

It's really killing me right now gathering these stories and reading the leases all day...I come out of the office attempting to shake off the reoccurring thought, ""society is shit."" 

Unfortunately I can't get into too many details at the moment, I don't want to give out anyone's private information or reveal too much about the report all this research is going into, but just looking for some general direction and maybe any precedents that demonstrate contract fraud/unconscionability/etc. in relation to risk disclosure. May be deleting this post later on.

Also, if anyone knows of a person I could contact about this, whether it's a landowner or a lawyer who's dealt with this sort of thing, please PM me!!

When my girlfriend is here, we seldom do anything else but just sit on our respective laptops, stopping occasionally to talk. I just feel so sad and lonely. I would love nothing more than to pack a bag and migrate to another city a hundred miles away by myself and start again in a new and exciting habitat, but financial problems have anchored me....

A bit of background: I'm 22, she's 23. We've known each other since 2006, but only in the last 10 months have we been together. Before we finally hooked up and became 'a thing' officially, she had been in nothing but shitty relationships, all of which were degrading to her (a couple even involving verbal abuse against her). Additionally, her life aside from bad boyfriends has been incredibly stressful and painful for her. I was her first ""good relationship"".

As far as me, I've had mostly good, if unremarkable relationships in the past. I'm pretty whitebread, and don't find many insecurities or baggage with myself.

We live in different states.

In the typical honeymoon phase, we got along so well that I could hardly believe what had happened, even despite her past and current troubles. There was an undeniable sense of great love on both of our parts - indeed, she even told me that she'd never said that she loved anyone as quickly as she had with me - and I couldn't believe our compatibility. We loved video games, had similar musical tastes, and could talk about anything and everything for hours, via phone or by texting.

A few months in, she graduated with her bachelor's degree and planned to hop into grad school. This was when she first visited. Every part of those few days was blissful and perfect. When she had to fly back home, we both ended up crying at the airport, and promised we'd visit again soon. In all, she's been over with me once, and I've visited twice, with the last being in January.

The trouble began in March of this year. Her graduate courses began stacking up and overloading her in adjunct with her terrible retail job and chronic illness. I tried to be there all the time, as often as I could, often getting in trouble at my own job for texting her and calling her when I shouldn't have had my phone out. She's a trouper, and made it through just about everything life had been throwing at her, all while maintaining our relationship.

We had an understanding of the importance of school in her life. It was essentially an all-encompassing effort to at the least better her chances of working within her field tenably. She had done so much, in fact, that she began to amplify her illness as a result of the stress. Ulcers, mystery illness, breakouts, near-meltdowns, the works. During all of this, I knew just how fragile she was at this stage in her life and did all I could to support and encourage her, and she continued being as sweet and lovely as she ever was.

Then, gradually, our text conversations shrank in volume and frequency, and began to contain less and less of the same affection there once was. Her sex drive had vanished since the beginning of March. Even still, we got along just about as well as we used to (it took very much rationalizing on my part to not confront her about what I took as a sign of distance). We then had our first real fight when I brought up that distance I felt.

She flipped her shit. Told me I didn't understand what she was going through, how disappointed in me she was because she was convinced that we were okay, and that I knew what she was putting up with. And, knowing how much shit had utterly buried her life, I relented. I agreed with her, asserting that I did understand her workload and that I was only worried about us.

We haven't had a phone call since sometime before that fight (which was expressed through texts). I've tried to initiate them, but every time I call her without us planning it first, she doesn't answer, excusing her way out of it; every time I try to plan with her, she evades it, or doesn't even acknowledge that I mentioned it at all. She never makes calls to me, either.

In the time since then (about the middle of April), she's finished her first semester of grad school, left her old, shit job, and even been accepted at a couple of internships. Life seems to be improving for her. Our relationship has very greatly stagnated, however. We've gone for about 1-2 days at a time without contact at a time. She has little or no apparent affection for me anymore (I haven't been told that she loves me in a week or so). I've lost sleep over it and have become an emotional wreck. I'm afraid to bring anything up with her, because she'll most likely either A) snap at me for not being understanding enough; or B) will completely ignore what I say.

As it is now: we haven't spoken in a day or two, our conversations are comparatively miniscule, and I feel extremely unloved and neglected. I'm torn between wanting to break up with her and move on, and not wanting it to end, but being unable to confront the issue with her since we have only ""spoken"" through texts for months now, and not wanting to lose her more than I've ever wanted not to lose anything in my life.

I'm on the brink, reddit. What can I do? What *should* I do? Thanks for reading.

**UPDORT** 6/4
Finally, after four days of no contact, I texted her again and told her everything that's been troubling me. I asked if she thought the relationship was tenable (she didn't know). I let her know that I felt neglected and that I didn't know if she still loved me. I explained that I understood her priorities, and was willing to work with her to format some sort of schedule so we could stay in contact while still respecting her very busy and demanding schedule.

She refused.

1) While I've been offered some financial aid from the school, I'm still left with nearly $30,000 in tuition and other fees. 

2) I'm getting little to no support from my family. I will be receiving monthly allowances of money (until next July) from my father as dictated in my parent's divorce terms. Other than this, my family tells me that they are in no position to help pay for my school. My father is now supporting a whole other family of 4, earning less than he ever has in the past and spending more on them. My mother is spending money left and right paying for her ridiculous hour long daily commute, college, and other things while claiming that we have no money. I have some suspicions that she's been saving away a ridiculous amount money for herself as a security blanket. In summary, no financial help from family.

3) How do I go about securing loans to pay for my next year of college. What loans are best, will give me the most time to pay back, etc. 

4) What are some grants and scholarships I can look into? 

If there's one thing I'm sure of with the next year, it's that I will work my ass off. I'm hopeful that I will have an internship by the end of my first year, and a job in my dream career within 2 years. 

If it helps, I'm majoring in film/character animation. 

Any help is most appreciated. Thank you."

It used to be that I found myself playing the part of an adult. I had internships, jobs, conversations, whatever, where I couldn't goof around and had to maintain some type of facade where I acted and carried myself as an adult, being responsible and the like. I could always easily snap back into the semi-immmature, whatever-happens-happens attitude without any real concern about the future or consequences of my actions (to an extent- i'm not a total idiot, I promise). I would catch-as-catch-can and float about without any real worries, as well as wild aspirations that I felt were easily obtainable without actually parsing out a plan to get what I wanted. It was careless and awesome, and I had a shitload of fun living in the moment.  

Now, however, I feel as though I am suddenly an adult who can revert to childish, whimsical behavior when I want to, but its not natural. The balance of the force is off kilter. I'm struggling to explain this well...I just feel like this is the beginning of a new section of my life and I really miss the old one that had college (I graduated a year ago), high school, underage drinking, chasing girls, studying, dank headies(these are still around but I miss the nugs I've smoked in the past), mischief, tom-foolery and a general disregard for ""the future"" and all is scary unknowns. 

That being said, I love smoking weed. Although my experiences with the green mistress have definitely changed over time, from paranoid bowl rips in the woods to refined spliff rolling and luscious vaporization in the comfort of my own residence, it has always been a great tool for reflection. I love you Ents, and maybe I'm older now and maybe I can't be a wild dipshit all the time anymore, but I'm pretty excited for the next chapter or whatever. The proverbial ""next bowlpack."" I'm excited to meet a new girl, as past relationships have either fucked me over or petered out. After some single time, I'm ready to make out and stuff with a hot chick. 

I'm willing to bet there are a lot of you that are in a similar place. I'm not trying to be grim at all, I'm truly excited for what is to come. I'm also just sad and nostalgic and miss what I have had. Anyways, thanks for letting me vent, dudes and dudettes. Hope you are all having a lovely weekend and starting your summers right.

I've done running in the past but saw no results in fat loss, became disheartened, and stopped. I realized that exercise alone wasn't going to cut it and stumbled upon keto. I read the guides and now have a basic idea of what it's all about.

I've already started eating lots of meat, eggs and vegetables. Yesterday, I took in around &lt;20g carbs, 88g fat, 86g protein. Today, I feel like I overdosed and took in 137.3g fat. Seeing that made my heart stop. I suppose I'm still in the mindset of fat=bad. 

* Will keto help someone trying to get rid of the last bit of stubborn fat? 
* Should I be severely limiting my carb intake and starting HIIT to order to see results? How important is exercise? I walk to get around everywhere, but I have classes and my internship is an office job. By the time I get home, I'm too tired to do anything.
* How much fat intake is ideal? I know that we run on fat, but is there such a thing as too much?
* The vegetables I eat are all cooked, does that affect the carb count?
* What are some good sources of fat? Stuff like butter, cream cheese, cheese, mayo, and bacon are not easily accessible to me at the moment. Can I live on just meat, eggs, almond and oils from cooking? What about fatty cuts like pork belly? 
* How do calories come into play on a keto diet?
* What's the consensus on non-tofu [shirataki noodles](http://www.amazon.com/Miracle-Noodle-Shirataki-7-Ounce-Packages/dp/B004CLCEDE)?

After sitting down, he notices the most beautiful woman he's ever seen in his entire life. Unfortunately, she's wearing a nun's habit. Unable to contain himself, he thinks ""What have I got to lose?"" and gets up and walks over to her.


""Excuse me, miss, but you are literally the most beautiful woman I've ever seen. Would you like to go out on a date with me?""


The nun blushes and politely declines.


The man, heartbroken, returns to his seat near the front of the bus. The bus driver, having seen the exchange takes pity on the businessman.


""Hey, man, don't get all down, that broad's just a raging slut anyway.""


The businessman gets offended, and rushes to defend the nun's honor, ""How dare you!? That woman has offered herself to god and has pledge to keep her chastity in the name of lord!""


The bus driver scoffs and laughs. ""The only one she's pledged herself to is the old priest in the church on 3rd Street. Every night at midnight she and the priest go into the confessional to have sex."" 


The business man stares at the bus driver in disbelief.


The bus driver chuckles, ""And that's not all. Get this, they only ever have anal sex because they think it'll keep her ""pure"" for the lord, like god is just waiting in heaven for virgin vaginas."" Laughing, the bus driver stops at the businessman's stop and lets him off.


Wrought with anger, the businessman simmers all throughout the work day, snapping at his interns and employees. ""That hypocritical little bitch!"" he thinks. ""That's it, tonight I'll teach her a thing or two.""


That night, the man goes to the church and finds the priest. Asking to speak with him privately, the two enter the priest's room. Before the priest can react, the business man knocks him out and steals his clothes.

That night, the business man waits in the confessional for the nun. Sure enough, at the stroke of midnight there comes a knocking on the confessional door. 

""Are you there?"" comes the muffled voice from the outside.

The businessman doesn't say anything, and opens the door. It is dark in the church so his face is obscured and the nun can't tell a thing.

The two have some seriously disgusting anal sex, with a whole lot of pig noises and squealing and other such things. 

Gasping after they are done, the businessman finally spins the nun around and announces to her, ""Ha, you miserable slut! I'm not the priest, I'm the businessman!""

The nun grins back, ""I'm the bus driver."""

I want to do things 100% this time.

What I want to do, is go back and get a bachelors in public affairs, re-do my minor in Telecom (with relevant coursework), and go directly into the graduate program from there. So, I'm looking at about 6-6.5 years before I am done - I am 23 now. I also believe that I would be more marketable for internships in my field by taking the time to learn the necessary skills. I would be up for summer coursework, slaving away for my loans, anything, because I know that I would be working towards something I am truly passionate about (my media processes &amp; effects class was one of the few classes I was excited about in all of my undergrad).

In the mean time, I will be living at home and trying to save as much money as I can. I am potentially looking to move to the state the school is in to work and try and establish residency to help with the cost.

Has anyone done something like this? I probably sound really crazy, but this is what I am passionate about, and I should have figured it out sooner (I know), but now I want to go back and get started. Is it even possible to be a freshman again if I already have a degree from the school? I will be talking to an advisor in the program I want to be in, but I just wanted to bounce some ideas off people. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

P.S. the reason for not going directly into a graduate program is because I do not feel that I have the skills or educational background to be successful. I really want to learn and I feel that ""re-doing"" my undergrad is the best bet for this.

The shoot involves green screen, blue screen, and on location night shots.
Sounds fantastic, and is fantastic, however I was only told about it today and the shoot is on Thursday, so I have a lot of research to do, so I can be the best camera assistant possible considering my experience. 

Does anyone have any useful tips regarding;
Jargon?
Kit to bring to set?
Or anything else that might be vaguely helpful.

Extra Info: 
I have only ever dealt with broadcast style cameras.
Never worked with film before. (Much to my dismay, but our institute removed film from the course the year after I started, meaning I never got to use it.)

&gt;(3) Where a person is prevented from resisting by any intoxicating
or anesthetic substance, or any controlled substance, and this
condition was known, or reasonably should have been known by the
accused.

I was attending a local community college after high school, because my grades weren't good enough to get into any schools nearby, and my family is pretty broke. I had 2 classes with this girl Melinda who I had a huge crush on. I'm kind of nerdy and overweight, so I never had the balls to ask her out or even ask to hang out. (Plus this is before I realized she had a boyfriend)

A few weeks into summer I got a job at a Walgreens (It's a drug store for those of you not in the USA) where I worked full time. This girl Melinda came in one day and we bullshitted for a while, and somehow her broken PC got tossed into the conversation. As a nerd, this is one of the few openers that work, so I suggested to fix it. She agreed and we made plans to meet the next night at her house. She offered to pay me, I just said to get me a beer or something.

I went over there the night after the next because she was busy, and I fixed her PC in like 5 minutes because all it was was some simple spyware popup crap. We started drinking and smoking pot and just bullshitting. It was really great because I have NO game. She began going on and on and on about how she was always fighting with her boyfriend and what an asshole he was. I thought ""SCORE!"" We ended up drinking and smoking the entire night, and we ended up cuddling on the couch watching the Wizard of Oz. Up until that point, I hadn't even held hands with a girl.

After a while we started making out, and to my embarrassment I accidentally ejaculated in my pants. A LOT. I was so embarrassed, but she gave me a towel and I removed my pants. I couldn't drive because I was so hammered, so I crashed in her bed with her. A lot of kissing and grinding and such and before I knew it we were having sex.

The next day I heard nothing from her. The day after that she wasn't in class. She didn't answer my calls. I didn't quite understand it. I got home from class, and started getting ready for work. There was a LOUD knock at my door. A police officer asked me to come with them, and they needed to ask me some questions.

Not knowing my rights or anything, I told them the truth. We got drunk, we smoked pot, I stayed there and we had sex. I was arrested. It turns out after I told a few people, it got back to her boyfriend. The boyfriend confronted her, she said she didn't remember because she was so drunk. I could barely remember it either, but I know it had happened. I don't think anything can overwrite the memory of losing your virginity.

I was sentenced October 2004 after about a year of fighting my case. I was released November of 2009. When I was released Jessica's law was still active in California, so I couldn't live with my parents. They had bought me a 1996 Subaru Legacy Wagon, which I lived in slightly on the outskirts of the town I lived. I tried to go back to school, but you have to register as a sex offender at colleges you attend. when I registered the student security intern told a couple of girls he knew, and before I knew it the entire school was harassing me. So I left. I have had 3 jobs since my release. I was fired from all three when someone found my face online. I am currently on Social Security Disability for post traumatic stress disorder. According to my therapist I have it due to my prison experiences. (I saw a man die from a gang beating, I was stabbed [superficially] with a pencil because I'm a rapist)

I'm currently living with my parents again. I haven't gotten back to school, but I'm thinking of taking classes online. I don't know much else to talk about, AMA away. I'll try to keep up with this.

TL;DR I became a rapist when I lost my virginity, lost 5 years of my life, and I'm trying to get my life together.


Edit:
=====================
I have gotten alot of requests for verification of my story. I didn't know that worked until recently. I did however send the following to the mods:
&gt;I have a topic on iama talking about my experiences as someone convicted of rape. This is a throwaway account. I don't know how I can get confirmed or if I can even without exposing my identity. As someone who is a sex offender, what little privacy I have I protect fiercely. I wasn't careful in the past, and I had a few jerks on xbox live that tracked down my information and got my account banned. They also found my facebook and had that banned too, but not before saving all of my photos and posting them on 4chan. So is there any way to confirm myself without exposing myself? I have racked my brain trying to find a way to do so, but short of exposing myself (No pun intended) I have no idea how to do so.
Any suggestions would be wecomed!

I received a reply from a gentleman/woman named ""flyryan:""

&gt;There isn't a way to prove yourself without exposing yourself. As a reminder though, verification is totally optional. It is not a requirement.
So, if you don't to verify, you don't have to. However, if you do, I can promise that we take privacy seriously and anything you send would be kept confidential and used for verification only.

I have decided to not identify myself. I appreciate the curiosity, and I understand the desire to see behind the curtain, but the internet is a very mean and harsh place, and I don't trust people very easily. If you don't believe it, fine. If you do, fine. Whatever. If you don't feel this is authentic no one is forcing you to participate. Thank you"

hn6ys,9,2011-05-29,Is Piracy Ethical or Not?,[deleted],philosophy,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/hn6ys/is_piracy_ethical_or_not/,"My opinion is that piracy is wrong (though it isn't ""stealing"" in any meaningful sense). My argument focuses on dishonest and expectation:   

Why is it okay to borrow books from a library, or share recipes for a dish (as I saw in an old r/Philosophy thread with which I disagree), but not okay to pirate? What if you download an mp3 file and then delete it?  

But it's not about functionality. I know that using a library DVD is almost functionally equivalent to using a pirated DVD. The difference is that when you pirate, you are being dishonest because the artist, who wanted to make money, never intended for you to use the DVD in that way. (of course, if the artist in question CONDONES piracy, then the piracy of his music is not wrong.)   

A commercial artist only produces music (or movies, etc) on the basis that he receives money from it. There is a customer-salesman relationship here. He EXPECTS to receive money from you. **If you do not meet these expectations, you are doing him wrong.**    

Similarly, **it's wrong for an employer not to meet your expectation of a paycheck if you're a worker**. But if you're an intern, it's A-OK for you to go without any money at all! The same principle applies.   

That said, the important thing is whether or not you think morality is important. Some people think it is, some say, ""oh, I know it's wrong but I do it anyways."" But regardless of this, unless you have some radical philosophical beliefs, even if you are a pirate, you'll have to acknowledge that it's morally reprehensible to freely take someone's work that was made with the intention of profit.  

Some say that ""piracy's good!"" in a fit of self-righteousness. But I think that it's not that piracy is good, it's just that convenience is better than piracy is bad.   

Even if pirating music somehow benefits artists (e.g., free advertising), that's a justification for piracy, not a reason. Pirates (including myself) are not some white knights who purposely give free advertising to artists because of genuine concern; they're just like me, a chump who wants his music without paying.   

**TL;DR:** Piracy is wrong in the same way that withholding payment from a worker is wrong; you defy his expectation. Similarly, you do wrong to the artist by pirating, because he expects to receive payment in exchange for possession of his mp3 file (even if you do absolutely nothing with such a file!).   

---------------------------------

**edit:** About intellectual property: What I'm saying is that regardless of your stance on IP, you still have to respect that of the author (the author's opinion does matter in my opinion -- it's like a contract). For this metaphor, let's say you're at an art museum where you have to pay for a ticket.  

""Paying to see art! How ridiculous"", says the hypothetical person. ""I believe that you shouldn't pay for this.""   

The ticket salesperson says, ""I'm sorry, but you have to pay to enter. No payment, no entrance.""   

Piracy, then, is when you *sneak past the salesperson and go to the museum anyways*. The pricetag on an mp3 IS a contract, and you DO have to acknowledge it. Just because the internet allows you to sneak past it doesn't make it moral. You're still dishonest for sneaking by.    "

I'm a new San Franciscan--going to be around for the summer for an internship and might be back in a year and a half for good. I'm trying to figure out transportation.

As it stands right now, I'm in the Mission and my place of work is about five blocks away, so I don't need something immediately. However, good groceries are a bit of a trek, I like being self-sufficient for transportation, and I have friends in North Beach, Oakland, Sonoma County, and will be paying occasional visits to Bolinas, so I need at least *something*. As it stands, I'm divided between a bike and a motorcycle.

I have a pretty good idea what I'm getting into with both--I'm an experienced bike rider (although more rural and mountain biking than urban riding), and have owned bikes before. Similarly, I'm a licensed motorcyclist, have taken MSF courses, have gone riding with my father and friends a few times--but I've never owned one.

They each have their pros and cons (bicycles don't need gas, motorcycles let me go further, I've wanted to ""make good"" on my licensing by getting a motorcycle, bikes are far cheaper (but I do have the money), bikes keep me fit, motorcycles are more fun &amp; more dangerous, etc.) but a pretty big part of it at the end of the day is how receptive the city is. Given that I'm new here, I don't really know the ins and outs--do any of you have any experience with either? Is San Francisco particularly welcoming or unwelcoming to bicyclists or motorcyclists? Have any stories to relate?

On some level, I'd love to have my desire for a motorcycle justified--they're fun, I like them, and I'm young, so it's a pretty good time to have a one-person means of getting around (vs. later when I'll need something more). On the other hand, I understand that a bicycle may make a lot more sense, so I don't want to spit in the face of reason. 

For what it's worth, I have a car on the east coast, where I'm going to school. Come the end of the summer, I can either ship whatever I buy back there, or leave it at my parents' house in Bolinas.

Anything would be helpful. Thanks!"

My lovely girlfriend of two years is having a problem known as ""vaginismus.""  We've always had this problem, but only about nine months ago did we figure out what it was.

I thought the diagnosis alongside knowledge that others suffered with her would help her face the problem, but so far things have become worse.  She curses the disorder and calls herself a freak, and even threatens suicide.  She blames me for not showing enough sexual interest.  Her plan is for me to pretend that things are working to make her feel better in bed, but this causes frustration, painful chafing, and tears.

She tried dialaters for a while, but was unable to insert any, or even a tampon.  She has never been able to touch herself without underwear (I have not been able to do this more than a couple of times).

We are trying to find knowledgeable therapists and resources in the Northern Virginia/Washington D.C. area, but neither of us know where to start, nor whether we can afford them since she is unemployed and I am working at a low-pay internship.  If I can convince her to tell her parents, we may be able to use their health insurance.

Does anybody have any advice?"

I'm kind of in a bind, and any legal advice or advice in general would be fantastic. I applied for an internship at a graphic design firm and was accepted, and agreed to take the job. The firm went ahead and bought a copy of Adobe CS5 for me. After purchasing the software, they sent me my internship paperwork and the following email:

""Also, [company name] paying for your copy of CS5 assumes that you will stay with us for the duration of the internship this summer, otherwise, we will need to be reimbursed.""

Now, I never agreed to this before the software was purchased for me. I also never asked for the software, and this clause was not in the contract I signed for the internship. 

However, I went ahead and picked up the software anyways because at this point I had to take the internship. I assumed it would be an enjoyable learning experience. It has only turned out to be a pretty horrible internship, and I want to terminate it, but I am stuck until I can pay the $450 dollars (student edition) for the software. Considering I am only paid a $650 stipend a month, I can't really afford that.

The only instance in which this software fee is mentioned, however, is that email. I never responded to it saying I agreed, and once again the email was sent after the software was purchased without informing me of this fee beforehand. Would this email hold up in court, should the company seek compensation after an early termination of my contract? Or should I take the risk, end my employment, and hope there are no legal ramifications?

I've already browsed some of the ""what do I do in nyc"" threads and none of them seem to give many things not pertaining to art."
