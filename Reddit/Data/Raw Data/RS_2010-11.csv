dzek4,4,2010-11-01,"Reddit, I've fluctuated with my weight and eating habits all my life. Can you help?",tazzgonzo,Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/dzek4/reddit_ive_fluctuated_with_my_weight_and_eating/,"First of all, hi! I’ve read up on the FAQ so I think I’m ready to post here for the first time.

I’m currently a 26 yr old male, 6’1”, and weigh about 235 lbs. 

Growing up, I was always on the bigger side of things. My parents basically let us eat whatever we wanted, whenever we wanted. When I was 17, I was 6’1” and weighed 255 lbs. But because of the clothes I wore and my general body frame, it never looked like I was that big. 

The year before I went to college, I decided to do something about it. My parents had bought a treadmill so I ran an hour per day (burning through complete seasons of Buffy and Angel) for about 6 months. I ate less and was able to bring my weight all the way down to about 180. 

I entered my freshman year of college at a healthy weight with semi-healthy eating habits. However, that’s when I started binge eating. I didn’t make many friends my freshman year so I stayed a lot in my dorm room playing video games and studying. I joined the campus gym, but was never really consistent about it. I always had a “new” workout to try out, which I’d quickly get bored of. Whenever I felt sad or just bored, I’d binge on fast food or whatever was available. I’d feel guilty about it the next stay, but then I’d just binge again. 

I guess my mental state was “f*ck it, I already lost, I’ll start fresh next Sunday” but we all know how that goes. I was either on full on eating like crap mode or hardly eating/ exercising a ton mode. 

This, obviously, caused my weight to fluctuate all throughout my freshman year. 

Ever since then I’ve been stuck in this all or nothing approach to healthy eating and exercising. Most recently, last year, I joined a Gold’s Gym near my work and ended up paying a personal trainer (it was the only way I remained consistent…knowing that I PAID for someone to hold me accountable) for 3x a week gym sessions. I lost a good amount of weight and looked and felt better for about 5 months. 

I had to stop the personal training due to, well, it being expensive, so I cut down to once a week sessions, which failed miserably. 

Around this time, I started to make a lot of unhealthy eating choices. I always put off exercising and eating right to “next week” or “next month” and gained back the weight I had lost and then some. 

Back in June of this year, I got fed up with being so unhealthy (this is a re-occurring theme, btw) and joined an all Paleo, all Crossfit gym. I thought that I had found a perfect fit for diet and exercise. I kept up with them for about 3 months. 

My job currently has me traveling a lot (you can see where this is going) so I would be out of the gym for maybe a week or two before I went back. During these trips, I would somehow justify that eating unhealthy was fine because I would make up for it when I got back. I even packed gym clothes that went ignored. 

When I got back to the gym after these trips, I’d feel ashamed and didn’t want to return the next session because I felt that everyone was judging me, or that my performance had slipped. I stopped going because I, for some reason, thought that I needed to eat healthy and get back into my normal habit before I went back to the gym. This didn’t happen, and I kept making unhealthy choices. 

During this time, my significant other’s sister had just returned after a summer internship in New York (she lives with us). When she returned, she was almost unrecognizable as she had dropped from 250 lbs to 195 within 10 weeks. She had taken up running every day (1 hr) in the streets of New York and stopped eating so much food. 

Inspired by this, I took to running the streets of San Francisco on a daily basis. I started on September 19th and ran almost every day until October 16th. During that period, I ran a total of 96 miles and lost some weight. I also threw in 100 daily crunches and a minimum of 20 push ups. I canceled the Crossfit gym membership, because I wanted to lose weight before going back. I realize that's a stupid excuse, but I'm incredibly self-conscious about how I look in a group fitness setting. 

Even with a week business trip, I managed to keep up the workouts (though I did slip on the healthy eating). 

Now I did mention the cyclical nature of my eating/working out and this is where I’m currently at. My brother and his family recently flew down to visit for two weeks. They stayed at my parents’s house in San Jose (I live and work near San Francisco). Almost every day and every weekend I spent going to go visit them and driving back to San Francisco to spend the night. 

In my head I thought, “ah well, their visiting, so I’m going to give up my workouts and eating healthy and make up for them when they leave”. So during those two weeks I ate. I ate a lot. I think I’ve gained all the weight I lost from running already.

Today I said goodbye to them (they leave tomorrow). Know what I did to celebrate this? Ate tons of Halloween candy because “tomorrow I’ll start the running and eating healthy again.”

Here’s where I come to all of you. 

When I get back “on the wagon” tomorrow, I want to be able to make it a permanent thing. I’ve never had a healthy relationship with food and dieting for a period of time longer than 6 months. I don’t want to stumble and fall into this cycle again, and I definitely don’t want to weigh 235 lbs. 

Any advice or tips? 
Also, should I focus on running, as I have been, and lose all the weight first and then look at getting back into crossfit?

Sorry for the length, but I just wanted to paint a better picture of my situation. Thanks in advance.

**TL; DR version:** I’ve fluctuated a lot in weight/eating habits throughout my entire life. I want to make a permanent healthy lifestyle choice. What is your advice?

Which one would Druggit suggest, and why?",slhww,Drugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/dzx7n/i_am_interested_in_experimenting_with_other_drugs/,"Background: I am 20 years old, attend a state college as a mechanical engineer.

The only two drugs I have ever used are cannabis and alcohol.  My first experience drinking came my junior year of high school, and my first experience with weed was my freshman year of college.  During my sophomore year I became what most would consider a ""pothead"" and fell into a mild depression that, while generally negative, in my opinion, has led me to grow significantly more mature.

I am now significantly happier in my life.  I only use weed and alcohol in moderation.  I landed a summer internship that made me feel like I really progressed my life.  I am doing well in classes, and my relationship with my girlfriend of three years is especially strong.  I have wonderful friends, have gotten myself in to great shape, and am eating healthy.

Didn't mean to ramble, but I feel the back story is very important.  Anyway, I have spent the last two months or so educating myself on what most would consider ""harder"" drugs.  Simply, I'm interested.  I have spent countless hours reading Erowid, watching documentaries, reading /r/drugs, speaking with friends, etc.  I want to experiment, though I have little idea what I want my first drug to be. Salvia, Mushrooms, MDMA, Acid, DMT, and Mescaline all interest me.  Any suggestions on what to try, when to try it, and what to avoid? Advice appreciated!

TL;DR - I'm now more secure in my life and feel this would be a good time to experiment with a new drug. What would you suggest?

EDIT: One thing I forgot to mention was DXM.  With the ease and availability of cough syrup, and the ability to control plateau levels, could this possibly be the best intro-hallucinogenic drug?

EDIT 2: Sigh... Prop 19... Really thought Cali had it in 'em this time.  Maybe again in another few years."

",bfalava,finance,https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/dzzps/hey_rfinance_this_is_my_short_cover_letter_for_my/,"Even being an economics student, I must recognise that before attending Careers Fair in Imperial College London I had heard very little of Standard Bank. Yes, perhaps I had seen a few quick notes in the Financial Times, but never paid much attention. However, when at the Careers Fair I approached Standard Bank's Stand (I'll be honest again -they were giving away awesome mugs!)  and talked to the staff I discovered another way of approaching banking... there actually exists a bank that specialises in emerging markets! I could not let this opportunity scape.

From the many different specialisations that my degree offers, I have been inclined since the beginning towards development economics. And hence my interest in Standard Bank. The opportunity to apply my knowledge in economics and politics to actually help other economies to come afloat (instead of just speculating and acquiring currency) is, at the very least, refreshing and exciting. I would be very grateful to work in a bank where development is not ""just a part"" of the policy, but one where it is the spine of all the bank operations. And I think Standard Bank's summer internship is the best means to achieve this end. I was not thinking of applying to banks before I heard of you. Now I apply with renewed eagerness to one of the few banks that share my values.

e03ww,16,2010-11-02,The Process to Becoming a PE,AgentMull,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/e03ww/the_process_to_becoming_a_pe/,"I'm a senior in Mech Eng and I currently work for a small solar hot water tank manufacturer. I was hired this summer as a summer intern. I stayed on over the school year, working on the days I don't have class. I'm basically the head engineer at this company. The old engineer who was the president of the company quit earlier this year. My boss has indicated he wants me to stay on after I graduate and has started talking about me becoming a PE.  
  
I was already planning on taking the FE next semester, but I had never really planned on becoming a PE. My boss though thinks it might be a good idea,  but one problem is since I'm the senior most (read: only) engineer at this company I wouldn't be able to work under a PE to fulfill that requirement. It doesn't make sense to hire a PE because that defeats the purpose of having me (and my pay) grow with the company.  
   
Is there really any benefit to me becoming a PE in this field? Right now since we are small we are looking to do business any way we can, and sometimes that includes installing our systems ourselves in buildings. For some of these projects we need to have the roof racks for the solar collectors approved by an engineer. But we are looking to get away from being installers after sales pick up and we focus more on product development and sales. Also, is there any way I can get experience equivalent to working under a PE with out actually doing so?  "

I am looking for a summer internship beginning in Mid May with a construction or renewable energy company in or around the Denver area. I have been applying online to various companies but with the way online applications are I feel they are almost useless. I have sent out cover letters and resumes to different engineers but haven't had much luck. I am now hoping Reddit can help me.

I plan to live there after graduation and am hoping to align myself with a company early.

My dad started his own residential building company before I was born so I have been around construction and job sites my whole life. I saw every aspect of the business from floor plan design to closing. Honestly, I probably could have built a decent single family home by the age of 15.

I knew I was going to study mechanical engineering in college but it is not what I was expecting. I was really expecting more hands on and building. I have done well but am getting discouraged with my upper level classes. As a kid I was able to use my dad's tools to build anything imaginable but have not been able to do projects like I used to. I grew up admiring Leonardo da Vinci, Nikola Tesla, and Einstein and love reading the works of these geniuses. I truly love learning and spend some of my free time reading textbooks and learning as much as possible about anything.

During the summer of 2010, I spent 6 weeks in Pamplona, Spain taking courses on Spanish and renewable energy. The region of Spain I was in produces 70% of its energy needs form renewable sources. The classroom work was discussion based led by local engineers working for various companies. The class work was supplemented with visits to solar and wind farms, a mini hydroelectric dam, and a large scale biomass boiler. We discussed and compared international energy policy with the policy of the US (or lack thereof). Apart from classes, I also had the time of my life Running with the Bulls and watching Spain win the World Cup.

I understand the need for corporate responsibility in regards to environmental issues and climate change. My study abroad experience changed my attitude towards energy production and waste. Especially after the monstrosity that was the BP oil spill, it is important now to change the way we use energy.

I was also voted Time's Man of the Year in 2006 if that is worth anything. (Seriously, look it up)

I don't know if this post is a job request, a plea for help, or just a misguided attempt to impress someone enough to PM me regarding possible employment. I will be on vacation in the Denver (Vail) area for the first week of January 2011 and will be more than happy to give up a day of skiing to meet with someone anywhere close by. Thanks for reading this reddit and if you know of any opportunities please let me know. I can easily send a resume if that is needed (I've done it plenty already).
tl;dr- I want to work in Colorado.

I checked my credit report today because I want to buy a new car after the holidays, and I wanted to make sure everything was in order.

I noticed that I had an old Discover Card account open that was completely paid off. I thought that I closed it after I paid it off, but I guess I forgot.

I called today to cancel it and Discover told me that doing so could hurt my credit (since it had been open for about a year and 3 months with no balance).

I decided to hold off on closing it until I found out for sure. 

For the sake of simplicity, I'd like to only have one credit card, but not at the expense of a huge hit (Discover said ""like 50 points"") to my credit.

I don't mind if my score drops a bit because my score is already in the mid-700 range, and I figure it will go up a bit once I pay the $2000 off my main card.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, I'd appreciate some advice.

Edit: Thanks for the advice guys, I plan on have all of my debt paid off by the time I start looking for a car loan, so I am just going to close it since my debt-to-credit ratio would be 0% anyways"

Since graduating, I have been unemployed for 6 months now (""long-term unemployment""), and these have been the worst 6 months of my life, easily. I have no idea how other people do this for much longer than me. Almost half of all unemployed people have been unemployed for 6 months or more, some much longer than this. I feel a deep sympathy for anyone who has had to do this for a long time. 

I hate constantly whoring myself out. I hate pretending to be interested in things I am not actually interested in. I hate having to compromise on what I do because what I am good at isn't hiring. I hate going to bed and waking up late because I don't care anymore. I spend almost every day inside, and on the computer, because if I'm not looking for jobs I feel worthless. I've been gaining weight, I've got more acne than I have had since high school, and I am constantly, oppressively unoccupied. 

It is hard to relate to my friends anymore, because they all have jobs. I can't understand them any more than they can understand me. And probably 4-5 times a week, I find myself in a position of having to explain to others that I currently do not have a job...the sting and anguish of having to admit this is shameful. My girlfriend is still in school, and I visit her often, but I feel like a hopeless hanger-on, the pathetic guy who visits all the time because he has nothing better to do. I hate going to events during the daytime and getting the stare that says ""why are you here?"" 

I am living with my parents, which is awkward for over 9,000 reasons. And my father is retired, so my day is often spent listening to him tell me about the importance of working for a living and how I should move out. 

I have had numerous disastrous interviews for technical jobs that I was not qualified for, and I have moved down the ladder to attempting to secure an internship. So far, still no luck...and most internships require you to be pursuing a degree anyway. I would go for a writing job, if they existed, but I've got to rely on my coding skills now, ironically skills which I learned in college for the express purpose of not being unemployed after graduation. 

I am questioning my abilities, my mind, and my self worth. I have not been happy for a long time now, or anything close to it. I want out of this goddamned prison so I can show the world that I can get things done, that I am at least somewhat competent in something. Right now I am suffering under painful stagnation, boredom, and depression. 

How do you get through your days? Has anyone here managed to find happiness without work? Is this possible?

e1rvl,9,2010-11-05,Why are Redditors so poor?,richgamer1,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/e1rvl/why_are_redditors_so_poor/,"I realize that I probably sound like an ass, but hear me out.

Many Redditors are in the 18-26 age group, and they're in school or entry-level jobs, so it's understandable that they're poor (though often ""poor"" means waiting for mom to send that check). But there are a lot of older Redditors (I'm 32) who have been out in the wild for a while and still can't put a couple bucks together.

I make six figures working for myself from home. Truthfully, I spend most of the day on Reddit, visiting cafes or walking to the store for my daily candy bar (why can't I quit you, Kit-Kat). 

There are a shitload of Redditors who are way smarter than me (trust me that whenever I ask a stupid question like this one, you guys are quick to give me intelligent insight). It's often these same people who are dirt poor. In fact, I often see them wearing their poorness as a badge of honor.

I was a poor student and grad student, and though my family was middle class growing up, in my early 20s my mum killed herself and I'm estranged from my dad, so I haven't had much support.

I had some hard times in my 20s, but eventually I realized that anyone of moderate intelligence can make money. I don't rely on my specialized education to make money: I am self-taught in the field in which I work (no, I'm not going to plug it or even mention it), and don't rely on my formal edu at all.

Making money is NOT that hard. I was working a shitty entry-level day job when I started working for myself on the side. To be fair, I worked my ass off when I came home from my day job and when I started out, but I'm far more lazy than a lot of Redditors.

I know that the majority of poor Redditors will cite extenuating circumstances. You have responsibilities that were thrust upon you (btw, I do too. I take care of a family member who can't take care of himself). But in this era you can start an online businss in the time it takes to make a rage comic, so there really are no excuses. 

You can start a computer repair business on the side right now. Or post some flyers for your newly-established dog-walking service (""But I'm not bonded and insured!"" So what - you can start with your current resources and build form there). Or help local businesses make a website (establish contact over email so you don't need to sell anything in-person if you're shy). 

And maybe you have more noble aspirations than being a professional slacker like me, and want to work in a non-profit, and that requires you take an unpaid internship or whatever. That's fine, but you can always make money by leveraging your talents into side projects.

So what is it? I'm not seeking personal anecdotes of why you're poor. I want to know why so many Redditors remain poor as a whole despite being so smart. Is it fear of money? You guys seem to rail against anyone who overtly desires to make money, so maybe that's it. 

**edit:** I realize I'm being a bit of a troll here (though I haven't made anything up). I seriously love you guys, and I feel bad about this post. I'm a dick. I promise to contribute whenever Reddit has it's cause-of-the-hour.

**edit 2:** BTW, I live a modest lifestyle. I don't even have a car, which is possible because I live in a city with decent public transit (and Zipcar, which is an hourly car rental service I occasionally use). This isn't really relevant, except to say that having a little extra cash doesn't mean you have to be a cigar-chomping guy in a striped suit.

**Final edit:** Thank you everyone for your comments. I will be abandoning this account now. Sorry for being such a troll. I hope Jesus doesn't punish me by taking away my financial security (I don't believe in Jesus in that way, but just in case, sorry Jesus!). Sorry if I sound like a condescending ass in this post. I will be donating some money to Redditors in need later under my other account (seriously)."

e1xyp,9,2010-11-05,Because there's not enough of this... beginner here!,White_Hamster,DJs,https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/e1xyp/because_theres_not_enough_of_this_beginner_here/,"Hey DJit ... no that's awful. I have been on Reddit quite a while, and have recently decided to start getting into DJing after some money came back from my summer internship (I've had an interest for a good 7 or 8 years, without the funds to do anything besides that). My current setup is:

* Numark Mixtrack
* Traktor Pro (absurd sale going on, had to)
* Native Instruments Audio 2 DJ
(In case anybody is interested.)
I have been listening to electronic music of all sorts for a long time, and I feel like Traktor at least makes it easy for me with my humble interface and amateur skills to put out a constant beat with some of my interesting music, that other people could dance to. Maybe I'm too dependent on sync, but it's a tool just like any other, you use a main few until you learn about other tools to add to your box.

So basically, I have played an hour long set (for my self) of music with a constant beat, no drops, a couple of interesting juggles with cue points and whatnot. I think this is more than enough skill for something like a friend's apartment party for less than 100 people that will be pretty drunk. What I want to do is a part for my work, which is only a little more employees than that, but will be a mix of drunk and not drunk. So I'm not ready for the club circuit by far is what I'm trying to say.

My question is what kind of skills should I be practicing, besides preparing, practicing and choosing a set list carefully? I'm trying to learn to beat match without the visual cues from Traktor, just to get the feel of what I'm playing a little better.

Also, I know I'll have a smorgasbord of requests, and I could say that I don't really do that, and stick to my house/dubstep/etc, but it would be nice to be able to work one in, every now and then. So my next question is: what's a good way to work some typical request songs, like if someone wants Don't Stop Believin', or Freebird (and they have a gun pointed at me) or anything like that. Even some more modern hip hop stuff (or even Common or Tribe because I feel like it) that the immediate detected beat doesn't match well with the 125-128 my music tends to be around. The easy thing to do is slow everything down, or speed it up, or just cut to some cheesy sample (b-b-b-by request) and then just drop the new song, but none of that seems like DJ iTunes couldn't do the job, you know?

My dream setup is something like 2 Traktor Kontrol X1s, an Audio 4 DJ and a 4-channel club mixer like the Pioneer DJM line, all with Traktor Pro. I'm pretty good at hardware hacking, so I can (and actually am) making custom interfaces I could use with Traktor. I like the idea of timecode control, but honestly don't see much value to it besides the historical aspect of having vinyl on two turntables. Although maybe I'm too inexperienced to really see an advantage. But with Technics discontinuing parts of their line, and with no desire to go to CDJ, I feel like I'll stick with Computer DJing.

Thanks, Reddit!

Small background: Finished my Master last year after 7 years of studying. Have been working 
since then as Web-Developer in an awesome local company (part time) with great benefits. 
I am using part of my spare time to do smaller, paid projects which I have been doing all along 
during my studies. Although webdev wasn't my expected path,
I thoroughly enjoy it since it also crosses with many disciplines I grew fond of, like design,
usability, accessibility, ux, interaction design, and so on. But I'm also interested 
in a vast majority of other areas in CS, despite not having had enough practice in the past few years.
While having one of the more prestigious master degrees in CS you can get around here
I am by no means a superstar nor feel that I'm particular above anyone. I still think I'm a good
programmer with an open mind to learn new things. I have been doing C++ for most of my life and also a few things in other languages.

---

Anyway, I'm not here to ask ""what should I do"" (might do that in a later post, heh) but I have a 
few questions regarding working in the US which might eliminates a few possibilities for me.
I plan on going to the US in december for two weeks and I may want to take the opportunity to look around
the job market then and maybe even visit a few companies spontaneously.

How are working conditions in this field? I often read about health insurance issues and not many
vacation days. Is that the case for the majority of companies in CS as well? Or are there exceptions
in companies where the non-superstar can work as well? What about the _internet_ ones like flickr,
twitter, foursquare, etc?

What are the chances I can land a job in an area I haven't made a mark for myself already for years 
elsewhere? Would the entry salary be ""good enough""? Or would I even need to do an internship first? 
For example, Android development. I have been doing several projects with the SDK but haven't yet
released or finished any apps.

What about part-time jobs; 80%? Do they exist?

Contract-work/freelance possibilities? Is it swamped with freelancers?


My ideal destination would be a large city such as NY, for example."

I'm 22, I'm about to graduate college with a CS bachelors. I had an internship last summer. I'm physically fit(I'm no god but I'm alright). I powerlift 3 times a week, I completed an 8 mile race at just above a 10minute pace two months ago. I have passions - playing and watching competitive starcraft.

I fucking hate myself, though and I'm convinced my life will be a whole fucking lot worse before it has a chance to get better.

See, theres my on and off girlfriend, who I hate and love at the same time. Shes obese, bisexual and a furry. I've caught her sleeping with, but not having sex, with another guy, on top of which a mutual friend. I can't socialize with any of my friends because of that situation. I don't trust anyone in the social circle my girlfriend is in. The result is that I have a grand total two friends in the same town I'm in.

I'm coming to the damn internet because those two friends I'm not on a close enough level to discuss this kind of stuff. And I haven't spoken to my girlfriend in 3 or 4 days now.

See like, I like to sleep with her and have sex with her, and even talk to her from time to time, but theres nothing to fuckin do with here. All I want to do in my free time is play starcraft. And go out and drink and have fun. Haloween weekend I went out to a party while she worked and I had a fuckin blast, the most alive and carefree I felt since two years ago when my close close friends from my hometown who also went to this uni we're still here. But they've graduated and since then my life has been getting shittier and shittier. 

Anyway,My girlfriend showed up to the party to drive me home, I didn't even want her there and I tried to skirt out of the conversation but damn if I'm not a pussy. I try to continue being my drunken self, and I get punched in my side. Every time I drink around here I get hit or yelled at or she gets all pissy. So I don't drink around her anymore.

Anyway this isn't /r/relationship advice and I know its a prime case of cut/gym/fb and I've already done 2/3s of that. We're not even up on fb as dating, and I lift like crazy because its the only thing that makes me feel good.

But last summer right, among tons of on/off shit with the girl, I worked an internship. 40 hours a week.

I ABOSLUTELY FUCKING HATED IT. YOU CANT LIVE ON A 40 HOUR JOB. And thats what I have to get when I graduate?! fuck man. It crushes me, keeps me up at night, makes me miserable just thinking about it. I hate it. I don't want to be a fucking drone in a cubicle. Its so depressing. I don't want to say hi and make smalltalk with the old receptionist lady who I'm afraid of because I was raped by a middle aged woman last summer. (oh yeah reddit laughed at me for that 'hurr 1night stand' that sucked. My girlfriend was the only person to listen to me and take me seriously. We had broken up at the time but her listening caused us to get back together for that iteration of the breakup/makeup cycle.) I don't want to solve problems for shit I don't care about. I don't care about any kind of programming.

Fuck man, I'm about to graduate with a degree in software engineering, and I can't program shit. I don't know if i like or dislike programming because I've barely had to do any in the last 4 years.

I don't want a god damn 40 hour job that I hate again. I can't work like that and not kill myself. up at 7, in bed by 11. Constantly behind on sleep, wanting to wake up early on weekends because those are the only 2 days you get to be awake and not in a god damn soul-crushing cubicle. Never being alive. I can do it, and keep lifting, and return to low-carb dieting this summer. I can be fucking amazing. Rich, sexy, successful. But I'll absolutely fucking hate it because none of that shit matters.

The last 3 days, my phone hasn't gone off. I've talked to a few internet friends on sc. part of what depresses me is that I have a pipe dream of becoming a progamer and competing with the best of the best in starcraft, but I'm not good enough. I'll never be good enough even if I committed to practicing. I'm 22 and about to graduate and its time to let go of my dreams.

I played drums in two garage bands in high school. I still play drums from time to time, its a fun little passion. I'm by no means technically skilled. In one of my bands, the singer and guitarist stayed together and kept the band going through high school and the last 4 years. They got married. They do shows all the time, striving to hit it big. They're hungry, they're going for it. The bastards. I wish I could go after a pipe dream.

I can't socialize. I'm afraid of girls i find attractive. My last two girlfriends, they both have lasted over a year, both obese. not like chubby, obese. I live in a very small college town where there are few people to socialize with, and I can't bare to talk to them. I'm out of every social circle now because of the god damn furries and their deception.

I'm afraid to apply to jobs. Job interviews scare the fucking shit out of me. At least when I try to socialize, I can tell myself 'its cool, theyre not actually judging you you just think they are' but in a job interview THATS EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE FUCKING DOING. They're finding weakness and fear and helplessness. They want you to fail. They want to find your strength, abuse it, give you just enough to keep coming in at 8am in the fucking morning and giving them your time and effort and YOUR FUCKING LIFE until 5, where you have just enough waking time to get a workout in, then go home and be too tired to do anything. Then you die.


fuck man. I hate this. I hate where I'm at and I hate where I'm going. I want to die."

I don't know if i'll be any good in the long run, but the ultimate goal is just to run a small diner with my SO (currently does not exist)... Not expecting to be rich but enough to pay bills and maybe a reddit gold account :D...
   

Any comments or suggestions are welcome...
  

Anyone in the industry that can offer some advice? I'm really worried about not making enough to support a modest living...
My fall back career is health inspection... so closing down restaurants rather than opening them up :(..."

Long time lurker. First time poster.

I need some help. I would love to get into the advertising industry here as an account executive, but I currently don't have any experience. However, I do have a marketing degree(Mizzou), B2B sales experience, non-profit advertising experience and a love of advertising.

Reddit seems like a pretty diverse place. Does anybody work in advertising? How did you get your foot in the door? I'd be willing to do an internship in the hopes of gaining experience, but I'm not sure if that's a possibility since I'm no longer in college.

General advice is appreciated as well.

Thanks

On the off chance that someone would like to see a resume please send me a PM."

-What grad schools would interest me? I'm leaning towards entering the business world with a PhD in IO, I have interests in linguistics, logic, economics, law, and biology (beyond psych, of course). 

-Whom should I research and/or talk to?

-What should I do now? I work two jobs during the academic year; I'm a Resident Assistant and a Writing Tutor. During the off-months, I intern at an informatics company. Should a thesis be a goal? Field-specific internship? 

-In my very formal google research, I came across the Society for Industrial Organizational Psychology. Is there any merit to investigating this organization further?

-Anything else?

I ended up not getting the position, but in an effort toward continuous self improvement I went in search of other interesting properties of bitwise operators. Here are some I found or knew previously:

* Left shift can multiply by powers of 2
* Right shift can divide by powers of 2 (remainder is stripped)
* You can determine the value of bit n by ANDing the number on 2^n
* NOTing a signed int flips the sign and subtracts 1;
* NOTing an unsigned int is the equivalent of subtracting that number from the largest possible value.


Are there any other properties of bitwise operators that are interesting?"

Not that those particularities materially change the discussion.

So here's my story in a nutshell.

I fell hard for a girl in high school. While it took a long time for our feelings to synchronize, reminiscing about how it finally happened instantly brings a smile to my face. We got together senior year, and had a summer where I was convinced that the universe was composed of nothing more than warm smiles, fluttery embraces, and love. I wish such an experience on everyone.

Though we were accepted into the same universities, over several teary-eyed sessions, we responsibly chose to go to the ones we believed suited us best despite their geographic separation. That was smart of us. We also responsibly chose to take a break our first semester to not miss the college experience. That was mature of us. As evidence of our feelings, we got back together immediately afterwards.

Unfortunately, between our junior and senior year, the relationship began showing signs of the damage long-term long-distance can do. We both had academics as a top priority, and little money to spend on flights, so we were separated even during summers as we pursued internships and research positions elsewhere. Our relationship was constrained to the phone, a medium I've never liked, but did because it meant I could talk to her. It became clear that we were drifting apart. Our hearts spoke intimately, but our minds were drowning in the superficial, grasping for something new and concrete to relate by.

Nothing ever went to shit. We loved each other too much to do that. The stress of gradually losing someone I love, the resulting distraction from my workaholism, and most importantly, the impossibility of being geographically close in the future, rationally led me to suggest we take a break. Not long after, she told me we shouldn't get back together. It hurt. That marks the end of being an insider with her thoughts, but I do know from my end that the overriding feeling was futility.

We finished off our senior year, she went to a top graduate school in her field that’s even further away, and I have also done well for myself. We’ve spoken no more than the number of fingers and toes I have, which I don’t have too much trouble with; we’re both terrible at keeping up with people in general. Moreover, we’ve both been with others in long-term relationships since.

I’m writing you all to share and listen. What are your thoughts about feeling a deep connection to a love long lost? In hindsight, I haven’t been in love to the same degree as when I was with her. Are the thoughts that she’s a part of who I am forever, and probably the foremost expert on what makes me tick, out of line? The subsequent relationships I’ve had have had their strengths, but I haven’t felt that they holistically were as strong as my connection with her. For those that had amazing high school relationships, have you been able to get fully over them? I’m not looking for a cure, I’m quite comfortable the way things are, I just want to hear other experiences.

All in all, the process of writing and, therefore, confronting these thoughts has been unbelievably cathartic. If you’re a lurker who has itching thoughts, try writing a post—this is my first, and it surprised me."

It gets intimidating working with some of the other interns because they are much more experienced.  These guys have about 2-5 years on me in some cases (two in particular, one is older than me).  

I'm trying as hard as I can to catch up and get ahead in my studies so that I might have a chance at being hired here upon graduation but I'm incredibly overworked between this job and classes and the stress starts to get to me.  I often want to go home to work so they won't see me struggling trying to learn new things.  It also seems like every time I figure out something new they completely outshine me with their own most recent discovery.

Also I don't like to play the gender card but I am the only female in this group.  I've always believed that if you want to play with the guys you need to man up, but right now my confidence is shot.  I'm just as intelligent as these people;  I just don't have the time under my belt.  

I feel like if I don't get these self-esteem issues under control asap that they are going to undermine everything I've worked for and that I'm going to start tripping when I need to be owning this.  I'm also never going to be able to earn their respect if this keeps up.

If you have any advice whatsoever I'd greatly appreciate it.

Edit: some people have said definitely don't speak up unless you know what you're saying is valid, and I can say, unfortunately, from experience that you are right on.  I've only done that once and had the ego smacked out of me, so to speak."

Now I have a full-time job as a production artist at an ad agency, and I'm on the path with the company to becoming an art director. 

The problem is, I'm not sure if I'm really cut out for it. I got in to advertising originally because I like concepts and relating ideas, and the art is more a means of expressing it. The more I've looked into it though, I find that there isn't much of a position for people to just facilitate ideas, it's mostly art directors and production. 

I don't want to be stuck behind a computer my whole life doing production, and I don't think I'm some revolutionary artist. I don't like constantly worrying about my portfolio or making new designs. I mean I love art and visual design, but I don't wake up each day with new concepts that I need to bring to life.

I was just hoping to find some insight/advice from others in the field of Computer Science.

I'm a 21 year old student, currently taking the semester off to continue working my summer internship as an applications developer at a major corporation. For the most part, I'd say the experience has been positive. I've learned A LOT of important things that are not taught in school, and I think it's made me a better programmer and given me a leg up over a lot of other CS students.

However, recently I have found it very difficult to be motivated to do work. Usually the feeling that I get after programming something awesome (you know what I'm talking about) is rewarding enough to keep me going, but the stuff I have been doing has just been plain not interesting to me and it doesn't feel rewarding at all. Between all of the red tape and the increasingly boring material, I find myself on reddit a good bit of the day (far too much, and I feel extremely guilty about it, which makes my job even worse)

I have been pretty much given an offer to return for the summer and to come on board full time after I graduate, spring '12. I feel like the fact that I already have a job locked down means I'm obligated to take it, what with the economy being in the shitter. There are pros, I already have a 401k, I'm getting paid pretty decently well, I'd have pretty good job security, the company is stable and theres a lot of room to move around within the company.

The cons are what bothers me. I do not like the city I live in, and I don't know many people here. I'm afraid of being trapped here with no other opportunities. I would love to take some time off after school just to be creative and do some independent development for fun, but I really feel like it would be stupid to turn down their offer and lose that valuable experience on my resume (I know it's tough for CS students straight out of college.) 

I just feel like this isn't what I want to do for the rest of my life. I do want to do something programming related, just not so structured. I've always wanted to try my hands at coding video games (like every other CS student in the world) but I've never had the time to really focus on it. I dabbled in it towards the end of the summer but I had to go a few weeks without working on it, other things started to fill my time and I lost my motivation.

I've also toyed around with the idea of starting a gaming bar, which I think is the best idea ever, but would probably lose money and end up being a massive fail. I still like to think about it. It's not so much that I think I will ever actually end up doing this, but I daydream about it sometimes. Then again, I tend to be a ""grass is always greener"" kind of guy.

Maybe I'm just being immature. Are there any redditors who manage to make a living off of self-employment/freelance programming? How does that work out for you? What do you do? Am I retarded for wanting to try this with no real resume experience when I have an offer for a stable job?

I have a year and a half to figure things out, and who knows maybe I'll even send out some applications to graduate school (but I dislike the school system and feel like I might be able to learn more on my own), but I have been thinking about it recently because everyone's asking me if I'm coming back and I don't know what to say.

tl;dr: In an internship w/ ""the man"", don't really like it but can get a full time job from them. Is turning this down in hopes of finding something that interests me more a bad idea?"

Many of you requested that I update you as things went along. It's been over a month now, and the coroner has finally contacted us with a cause of death. 

My mother passed away due to an accidental overdose on Benadryl mixed with a minute amount of alcohol. The coroner said she fell asleep and just stopped breathing; there was no pain. 

I made the programs for my mom's funeral, which was on the 10th. Here are some scans of them: [front](http://imgur.com/EPioL.jpg), [center](http://imgur.com/yjCVR.jpg), [back](http://imgur.com/roax2.jpg). The back of that was also used as a template for an obituary in local papers. 

I also ended up giving my mother's eulogy. My father was supposed to give it, but at the last second asked me to because he could not do it. I miraculously made it through the entire thing without crying, and I was even able to make a few people laugh.  

The last month has gone by quickly. I returned to school after 10 days at home, something many of you will remember was up in the air for me at one time. I'm signed up for classes next semester and I've decided I need to finish my schooling. 

I returned to my RA position and my position on the newspaper staff. I wrote a [column](http://imgur.com/jUide.jpg) about the experience from home and it was published while I was away. I have gotten more comments on that column than any other I've written. I also submitted it in my package of clips for my internship applications. 

On that note, a few weeks ago my paper staff traveled to Louisville, Ky. to attend a journalism conference, where we accepted the Student Press Law Center's Freedom award. It was the biggest award they gave away, we got a standing ovation, and afterwards I was mobbed by 4-year school recruiters. I also applied for internships with several local papers, the SPLC, and the Seattle Times. I'm hoping for the best. 

My father is doing much better, and my brother has still had no reaction. I've gotten so much support both from this community and my friends at school. I think I'm going to make it through this. :) 

I hope you all don't mind me censoring the last names on my scans... Safety first on the internet. 

tl;dr: My mom died of an overdose of benadryl, I'm picking my life up, my family is fine, thank you all so much. &lt;3

e5hb1,3,2010-11-13,Just graduated - What should I do now?,CluelessGraduate,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/e5hb1/just_graduated_what_should_i_do_now/,"Hi reddit, I'm a long time lurker and first time poster.

Just wanted to add in some background info: 
I'm from Melbourne, Australia and have just graduated from highschool. There is about a month's wait until we find out what Australian Tertiary Admission Rank - ATAR (basically what you rank amongst your peers). 
I am aiming for an ATAR of 90.00 in hopes of getting into Biomedicine in university. The subjects I took are chemistry, biology, mathematical methods (middle difficulty), further maths (easiest), English and Religion/Society (I am not religious btw). 
I have finished my last exam two days ago and am completely free for 4 to 4 and 1/2 months with nothing planned.

During this break I plan to both gain new experiences and earn to bit of money to help support my parents. I have been thinking over the past few months on how I would achieve this during the break. Currently I have two ideas:

1) Start a small 'business' - Basically I was thinking of selling personalized products off www.artscow.com. I really enjoy photoshop despite not taking any artistic subjects in my senior years of highschool. I've made a few things off artscow such as a watch which generates a lot of complements. 
This sparked the idea of doing something like this as no one I've met has ever known about artscow and seem intrigued by these products. It's almost Christmas and I was thinking of firstly advertising online, then door-to-door and dropping flyers off.
I would collect images and take notes of anything the customer would want done to the image and what kind of product, etc. Then show them the finalised design and have artscow deliver to my house, remove all artscow logos,etc and then deliver the items myself.

Personally I really like this idea and would think it'd be fun - but I'm not so sure about the success or the probably a hundred other factors I have not taken into consideration. But there's a few things that are putting me off this idea including how much to charge for certain items vs profit, the fact that I have no business or any other experience and that shipping takes two weeks and it's only around five until Christmas yet I have not started any advertising, audience or anything.


2) Get a job - I've posted a job wanted online and have responded to several ads. I don't exactly have a preference but one particular type of job that sparked my interest is fund raising - which surprisingly gets paid $17/hour. 
However of the two that have responded, I have been rejected because there was a requirement of 18 years old age - I am 17 until the start of university and the other has not responded after I emailed them my mobile. Also I do not have my driver's license which rules out certain jobs. I have some experience in volunteer tutoring in mathematics for younger students, St. Vincent de Paul society at school and helping run retreats for the junior students also volunteer.

So basically I'm not sure what to do with my time. I don't want to waste it like many of my other peers by going out and partying for the whole holiday. I would greatly appreciate any words of wisdom you, the reddit community could offer. Particularly those who have gone through this and could share their experiences which I presume would be 95% of the community.

Also I have applied for a scholarship in uni who also provide an internship program for next year's summer holiday. They contacted me twice yesterday after I sent in my application the day prior. It really shocked me that they would contact me so soon and found out who the number was via google.
However, the first time they called I was sleeping so I missed it. I then contacted them but no one was there so I left a message. The second time, I accidentally hit the wrong button before I could pick up. When I tried calling again, I was directed to the answering machine. I think I've already left a bad impression on them. What can I say to excuse?
Also if I am called to an interview, how can I prepare for this?

Cheers,
CluelessGraduate"

Compliance is a big part of that: They make sure that the ad placements are actually what the vendors have sold. That means a lot of looking at websites for ads and making sure that the website is the sort of website that the ad should be on.

e63mo,2,2010-11-14,Reddit; Help! About to change career paths,Defender,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/e63mo/reddit_help_about_to_change_career_paths/,"Hey there,
This is my first self post. I'm greatly in need of advice/insight/opinions.


**To summarize; tldr:** 

I'm seriously about to change career paths since I can't find work where I am, don't have the money to relocate, feel extremely underqualified for most jobs I see, and can't afford to continue to do unpaid internships for experience. This is leading me to debate giving up a life dream in exchange for financial security. 

**Non-tldr:**

Well, I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place from where I'm sitting. I'm not quite sure how to continue on with my chosen career path. I picked 3D Modeling and Animation back around 1998 because of my love for all things 3D and the artistic possibilities with the new medium. Also, my obsession with gaming as an entertainment medium and art form. 

I graduated with a two-year degree in Multimedia Development and Management in 2003. From there I college-hopped for a few years because not all my credits would transfer between colleges even though most classes were the same. Every school wanted me to start over, and I was striving for a BFA. 

I worked a few non-industry jobs and a couple industry jobs until 2007 where I found a college that accepted all my credits and got a Bachelor of Business Administration. I'd been doing 3D Production at a studio regularly until the market tanked and I haven't been able to find industry work since. I thought that my prior computer art degree, business degree and real-world production experience would mix well. Thought process at the time was to possibly start my own studio one day, or have the management experience to lead a team of artists and manage projects at a company. 

I currently reside in New York (not NYC) and find it extremely hard to find any open positions that are not senior level, or non-5+ years industry experience jobs outside of NYC. Many of the available entry-level jobs are on the opposite coast for games development. I can't even afford $ of the 4 hour commute to NYC and back (I'd do it, I've done it).

The question I'm asking myself is how do I get experience when I can't get experience? I'm 27 now. While that may not be that old by modern standards, I've been trying to attain this career path since high school and don't even feel I really have my foot in the door. I've worked on an award-winning mod, TA'd for colleges, taught a few classes and trained myself. Now I strive to find work in a niche and over-saturated market.

I feel if I take time doing non-industry work than I fall behind a fast-paced industry and further alienate myself from my specified goal. By lacking advancement of skills in areas I haven't had the chance to explore (drawing, painting, sculpting) it's nearly impossible to find time and money to do it all. 

**The question is more, due to these circumstances;** 
Do I continue working as hard as possible, unable to afford functional vehicles and food, to strive for my goal and keep working jobs that provide experience but pay nothing, or do I just use the other skills I have to make a living while possibly hating the work I do and letting my goals fall to the wayside?

*This is more of an open thought and I wanted to hear other people's insight. I'm open to both positive and negative feedback, constructive criticism and opinions. Reddit is always good for having a multitude of helpful people with good insight.* 

Thanks for reading.

HELP, reddit!",EDClinicFatty,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/e653h/i_work_at_an_eating_disorder_clinic_and_im/,"I am a student working at an eating disorders clinic, in which we have a nutritionist and a few therapists. We have a special program that allows clients to stay during the day, eat with a group, and do some therapy in house. I have noticed since I have started working there that I am pretty much required to eat meals and snacks with the clients. The clients are learning to ""eat any food,"" meaning that they must try eating everything. They eat dessert every day with lunch, which is ice cream, pudding, cookies, etc. This tends to trigger me into eating more sugary, high fat foods during the rest of the day.  

I am having great difficulty maintaining or losing weight. I have gained almost 10 pounds since I started working at the clinic. Our nutritionist is kind of a hardass, so I'm a bit afraid to mention to her that I feel uncomfortable eating with the clients all the time or getting stared at when I bring in something smaller or less caloric than what they are eating (they have to eat more calories since many of them are on weight restoration). Everyone besides the nutritionist is overweight or OBESE. I feel like I'm on my way.  I will likely have to continue working here for another 6 months or so. Any ideas on what I can do to lose weight or at least stop gaining?

TL;DR - I'm a student interning at an eating disorder clinic and getting fat eating the crap they eat every day. Any suggestions?  

**UPDATE**  Thank you guys so much for the comments and suggestions. I am actively looking for a new internship. I think there is too much political ""stuff"" to deal with if I talk to the nutritionist about my concerns. I only have a month to find one. I will let you know if I do!

Here's an excerpt; completely unedited.


Knock knock. 
“Who’s there?”
“Lance, uh, I’m an intern.”
“Lance who -- I mean. Come in.”

Lance enters the office, dressed internly, (white button-shirt, black tie, suit jacket that just looks off for no apparent reason, [way too khaki] slacks, [also, for no apparent reason]  and, of course, the kind of loafers that only twenty-somethings wear.)

“Hey, sir, I was just coming to uh, make sure I didn’t like…I mean, the coffee -- it’s your kind right, like, your favorite, kind?”

“Sure is. Thanks for the gesture.”

“Oh yeah, sure, no problem. Anything else I can (holy shit this kid is a kiss-ass. He’s going to be promoted) do for you? (in no time.)

“No, no, thanks, I’m good. But uh, what’s your last name again?”

“Tarkington.”

“…”

“…”

“Oh, okay. I’ll uh. I’ll remember that one.”

“Oh….Thanks! I should, uh, get…back to work….”

“Right right. Thanks for the coffee.”

Slam.
 (Well, it sounded like a slam, I mean, every door in this office sounds like it has been slammed [don’t know why, maybe because we’re 4 floors up,] when it’s closed, but, no way he actually meant to slam the door, right, [but wouldn’t less air pressure make the doors harder to close? No, wait, that doesn’t make any sense. Whatever.] of course, wouldn’t make sense. Surprised he hasn’t actually come back in, to apologize, for the [non] slamming, I --)

“Oh, sorry there Mr. Greenwood, (oh holy hell, this kid.) I just, didn’t mean to slam it, I mean.”

“You’re fine.”

“Oh, ohhkay.”

Slam.

I turn back to the window. The snow I browned/dirtied up with my tires this morning still sits, meltingly, outside the firm’s lot, outside the black iron gate, with the Volvos and Camaros, (and was it snowing that day, too? I don’t remember being cold, at all, I mean,) and Oldsmobiles and whatever else and whoever else and everything else and everyone else. Who cares. It’s outside the lot. Outside of the fence.
Inside the fence, the snow is unbelievably white. Not a single tire has besmirched the sugary purity that rests in the medians and front gardens. Not a single shoe or boot or intern’s loafer has dared make imprint mark 1. How nice.
This coffee is really doing the trick, I swear. (I do remember, though, specifically, something burningly white. Awfully. Could have been anything, anything would have been too bright, that day, with how hungover I was.) I boot up the computer, that sits, toweringly, black and ominous and classy and flat,  perched atop the faux/quasi wood desk, (but still, I think it really might have been snow, I remember I was actually in it, whatever it was,) with the keyboard oh-so stealthily and classily and modernly stashed beneath, in a lap drawer. (tossing in it, trying to figure out what the hell was going on, way too bright, even with my eyelids shut, achingly bright,) What’s on the agenda for today….Two new messages….(and someone was laughing, that I remember, that I know. I think. That I think.) Nothing major. I could probably leave, for today, and suffer no ill consequences. Maybe. Probably. Whatever. I don’t want to be home today, anyways. Outside the lot. 

(There was, most definitely, a Ronald McDonald blow up statue, waving, in the breeze, inviting me to stuff my organs with non-processed fat and whatnot, which, of course, I did, because there was/is nowhere else to eat, on the Interstate, and Jack, somehow, liked/[likes? I haven’t talked to Jack in ages,] Big Macs, so, there we were, under the waving Ronald, [didn’t I get a Christmas card from him once? Or something? Wedding invitation?] with myself practically being carried by Jack and Green, soldier-style, with one of my arm’s behind each of their necks,  [Of course he’s married {I was at his wedding, duh} but, to maybe his kid’s wedding? Why would that/{I even be invited} even happen?] being carried off the field of battle, but of course, they wouldn’t be my comrades,) Not with her, at home, with The Issue, The Elephant standing in our living room (literally.) (not if I had a choice, which I didn’t, I mean, I wouldn’t have even wanted to be a soldier -- but, extended metaphors aside,) Though she probably will have to forget about the whole ordeal by Christmas, which is how many days from now? I’ve forgotten, (I remember being deposited into an empty plasticized booth, while Jack and Green got Big Macs for the three of us, [where were Alexis and Sovereign? Wait, weren’t they at] which, I mean, again, no choice, but I probably would have eaten yellow snow at this point,)  and according to the calendar, it is exactly 17 days until Santy Klaus comes a’knockin and, [the McDonald’s? Oh, that’s right, Sovereign just had to try and slide down the big slide with a plastic tray, and Alexis was probably trying to subvert/egg on such efforts,] (so a greasy burger probably wasn’t such a stretch, thinking about it, even a Big Mac) hopefully, everyone will get what they want and shut up about it, but, honestly, I doubt that She will ever shut up about this Fagscot thing, which come on, honestly. (so I sat in the booth, faithfully awaiting the promised bounty of greasy nonmeat, [and then, yes, that had to be it, because then Alexis came in, covered in snow, half-laughing, half-worried, and Sovereign had a broken nose, but was almost laughing as well, because apparently it was just So Goddamn Funny.] (it’s not that big of a deal, honestly, he’ll grow up, he’ll be fine, if anything I feel sorry for the kid. Telling him he’s going to hell is probably not the best course of action, (as I remember Jack saying to Sovereign, but I was way too busy to give a shit, considering my level of hunger, and such. But then I realize; I‘m supposed to be somewhere.) Not to mention; I know for a fact she “experimented” with her roommate in college, and no, it’s clear, she does not just care about his mental/sexual/developmental health or whatever she says, it’s a personal projection issue, gotta be, ([ and before I could tell Jack and Co. that I had to be back at campus pronto, I have a final, a very important final, Alexis sits down, opposite me, and unwraps his Big Mac, calmly.]) because otherwise, if this issue were based around anything else, she would be all pity (for Him) and anger (for Everyone Else), so, she has to be afraid for him, afraid that he will end up like herself, ([ and I frenetically ask Where is Jack and Alexis just looks up at me, slowly, and says “He just left to take Sovereign to the Hospital, weren’t you listening?” And, clearly, “No I wasn’t, why didn’t we go too?” Which, why didn’t we? Can’t remember.) which, I don’t know, why would that be so bad, to her, unless she is hiding something I don’t know, from me, away, out. {Like what?} (But Alexis just stares at me, for a moment, before I blurt out, “Dude, I, I have to be back at campus ASAP, I’m supposed to be taking a final right now,” and shatter his look of pity/complacency and re-assemble it into one of empathy/panic, [that was actually pretty comical, in retrospect, like the way a sitcom actor’s face looks when something goes awfully wrong within the three walls] and I know, before he says it, that we have no car, and so, of course, as the legendary story goes, we end up calling a taxi, and pay the guy like 100$ to get to the university, and step on it, and so he does, and I make it back with 20 minutes to take a 60 minute final, and, of course, answer every question, and get an A-. [according to legend.]) She has to be legitimately bisexual.

Knock knock.

I realize I am sitting Indian style at my desk, and have spilled a little coffee onto my tie. I have no choice.

“Come in.”

Wendy opens the door, her black, slick, smooth hair obscuring her face, because, as I realize, her neck is craned down, and she’s staring at a stack of papers, and she talks into them, knowing I don’t care.
“Hey, did you get that memo, from Anderson?” She produces a white sheet from the top of the stack, without looking at it much. She holds it out for me. It’s a copy. (I don’t even have to ask/check.) She knows I don’t check the memos, but she wishes I did. (for some reason.) So she makes copies.

“Oh, no, must have missed it.”

“Oh, too bad. It’s semi-important.”

“Semi?”

“Yeah. Apparently we are having our first ever casual dress day.”

“Wow. That’s something.”

“It is. It’s on the day before Christmas Eve.”

“Oh. Makes sense. The interns will be overjoyed, I’m sure. (and I imagine Lance standing, coffeepot in hand, wearing an American Eagle t-shirt, with whiskered jeans and flip-flops,)

“So yeah. Just thought you might care.” (but of course that doesn’t make sense; it’s winter.) She lifts her head up, flashing a curt smile, politely ignoring the stain on my tie, not even glancing twice before stepping out of the office. I sip my coffee and slip off my tie.

My sorority little sister, 'Jane,' is probably going to get engaged soon.  Her boyfriend, 'Bob,' has bought a ring, and is planning to pop the question sometime before Christmas.

The thing is... I think he's a complete twerp.  He's so annoying that I can't stand to be around him; I don't know of anybody who can.  One of my friends *turned down an internship* just because there was a possibility that Bob would also be doing that internship.  That's how annoying this fellow is.

But Jane likes him a lot.  He graduated last year, and so they've been doing long distance for a few months, which takes quite a bit of work.  And he treats her well enough, and I suppose she is happy.  Do I think she could do better?  Hell yes.  She's attractive, smart, loves video games, is bisexual, and drives a BMW.  Any man's dream, right?  And yet she's with this tool.

I graduated from college during the summer of this year.  One of the new employees asked me if I get paid extra for overtime hours the other day, since I get paid by the hours.  The Georgia state law states that if a person works over 40 hours, each additional hour pay should be 1.5 times the regular rate.  I found this out today, so after doing some research at work, and even looking at our employee law poster, I addressed this issue to my boss.  My boss and the CFO gave me a long talk asking what the difference between a part-time and full-time intern is.  I do not mind getting paid the regular rate for extra hours I work, but since I read it in the laws, I wanted to clarify this issue.  After I addressed this law, my boss and the CFO were saying that the solution would be to make sure I do not work over 40 hours and maybe even giving me only part-time…therefore, cutting some of the days I work…Should I be earning the extra for the overtime hours I work as an intern? 

I was wondering if anyone more familiar with the law (I am not exactly sure if it is a state or a federal issue) could comment on my situation. Is this something worth pursing? And what can I do? I know that it seems trivial, but I just want to be paid correctly.

what do?",exemcee,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/e75te/boss_laid_off_went_from_intern_to_only_it/,"**tl;dr Hired on as a part-time intern with only two people in dept--my boss the system admin and me. He got laid off, and I'm out of my depth.**

Some backstory: My cousin is an engineering co-op at a college we both go to, and he got a job at a shingle plant nearby. He mentioned one day that they were having some kind of database issues, so me being unemployeed and needing some money wrote up a little PHP interface in a few hours and gave them a demo and offered to set it up and everything for some money. Instead they gave me an internship, which was really nice of them.

So I show up, and it's a Windows house. No big deal: I grew up with two Linux guys in the family, but I've been using Windows for years. All of the customer-oriented stuff is second-hand after years of figuring it out on my own. I got put to work clearing out the help ticket backlog, imaging computers, cleaning up AD, that sort of thing. My long-term project was migrating Access databases to the intranet with ASP.NET and Microsoft SQL. Took awhile to get the hang of new languages, but I was trucking along.

Now, a few months later, my boss gets laid off. Our company used to be two companies, one bought the other out. The plant I'm at used to be one of the smaller companies, who had local IT divisions. The bigger company did all of their admin stuff from corporate. So, when it comes time to make cuts, the system admin was the first to go.

My boss's boss made a strong case against it, and I think he was right. We just don't have the infrastructure for management from somewhere half the damn country away. Their compromise was letting them keep me, a full-time college student (with a non-technical major) to handle things if shit hits the fan.

I have no idea what I'm doing. I kind of know how networking works on the non-physical side, but looking at the boxes in the room downstairs makes my vision go a bit fuzzy. I keep getting confirmation e-mails that tape backups were successful but I've searched both server rooms and I'm damned if I can find the rack. I don't know how to lay cable, or what it means.

**My request, then, is this.** I have no idea in which ways shit can hit the fan, and afterwards, how to clean it up. Desktop support I can handle, other things corporate will do, but if a server goes down we lose thousands of dollars a minute and it's all on me. I'll go in, power cycle the thing, then admit defeat. What emergency situations do I need to know how to handle? What are some resources that I can use to learn how to handle them?

**UPDATE**: After I went through every bit of documentation my boss left and talking to managers, I feel much less fucked about the whole situation. At least the people at the plant don't have huge expectations and let me keep a very reasonable schedule around my classes, even though I'm not sure what corporate thinks about my situation because apparently they hate returning phone calls and e-mail.

I really appreciate everyone's advice, and it was a huge part it making me feel less like the world was about to end and a lot more confident that I could salvage the situation before something critical happened. From the previous sysadmin's lack of documentation (seriously, the ""network diagram"" was 5 clipart pics with the labels ""server"" and ""plant 1"",""plant 2"") I assume that he had way less responsibility than I assumed and that the corporate office takes care of most of the important stuff.

Thanks again! I'm working on setting up a linux box that I can feel the system out with. (I had mentioned it last month but my old boss told me that IIS doesn't work well with non-Windows machines, which after a bit of research I think is a load of shit.)"

I'm doing an internship in Toronto, and moved into a house for 4 months. The landlord lives upstairs, and I was told I was going to have to share a large room with someone. When I moved in, turns out I was going to be sharing a room with her son. 

Now, for our rental agreement, it was just an email outlining that I would be living there for 4 months, and what was to be expected in the house (cleaning etc.).

Anyways, her son and I became really good friends, and loved playing video games. The thing is the landlord thinks playing video games is ruining her sons future, and they would argue and scream about it all the time. I thought it was just limited to them.

Today, they had another screamfest, and she shut the internet off (this is supposed to be included in the rent, shes shut it off before until her son convinces her to turn it back on.) I had a report due at work the next day, so I went and told her to turn the internet back on and discipline her son another way. She said she needs a few minutes to think about it, and when she comes back, she tells us that both of us have 2 weeks to leave, we are being evicted. When asked why, she says ""Her son is causing her undue stress, and because of that, I am also causing her undue stress (because I play video games with him)."" 

I have no idea what to do?! I don't even know where I would do. I only have 1.5 months left before I go back home. I've always paid rent on time, and have never directly bothered the landlord.

I just finished an internship over the summer writing in-house code for the IT department of a company, but that experience is making me rethink my commitment to this field. The dress code was business casual (button downs and khakis mostly. I didn't mind that part, just using it as a way to describe the type of environment), and I spent everyday sitting in a cubicle cranking out ASP.NET code for the various web apps they wanted to create for their users. In short, I found myself thinking: ""Is this really what I would be signing on for if they hired me full time?""

It sounds dumb, and I'm sure a lot of people would think: ""You're a computer science major... what the hell did you think your job was going to be like?"", but if my internship was an acuurate portrayal of work life, then  I guess it's just a far cry from what I imagined. (Not that I had an accurate idea of it in the first place.)

 I guess endless hours spent with my friends cranking out C code for the projects I had in my Operating Systems class, or our software engineering projects just painted a different picture than what I was introduced to over the summer.

e7nkw,2,2010-11-17,Ideas for a potentially rained out date?,[deleted],seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/e7nkw/ideas_for_a_potentially_rained_out_date/,"First a bit of background information..

A couple of weeks ago, a cute girl about my age started working in my office building. I'm a 20 year old student working at my college internship in an executive suite type environment with lots of small businesses on the floor. I work at an IT consulting company. The girl is a couple years older than me, as she graduated from a local state school last year. Her job is some kind of part-time office assistant for the people who own the executive suites.

So since last week I've been flirting it up with this girl a couple times per day, and I'm feeling pretty confident that she's attracted to me. She looks at me with those puppy-dog eyes, returns my flirty looks and laughs at my jokes. She recovers from the occasional awkward pause in conversation. More importantly, she seems totally stoked to go on a bike ride with me. Our original plan was to meet up on Saturday around noon once she gets off her other job teaching synchronized swimming lessons to 11-year olds. Lunch during the week isn't really an option because she doesn't take a lunch break, as she works weird hours that straddle the normal lunching period. No biggie. Lunch dates are a bit bland anyway.

I suggested we go bike riding on the local trails, find a park and have a picnic and her eyes lit up. So I'm pretty sure I'm clear to transition into some heavy kino and a mid-date kiss on Saturday. I've already tried to kino as much as possible, but it's difficult because most of the times I see her, she's behind the reception desk. 

(Side-question: I haven't gotten her number yet as I haven't really felt a good reason to, since getting the girl is more important than getting the number, right? I was originally planning to casually get it on Friday, because I'll probably want a way to contact her pre-date on Saturday. But otherwise, is there a good reason to bother getting it sooner? I've already got the date.)

So here's the situation. There's now a 70% chance of rain on Saturday, which really isn't ideal for a bike ride/picnic. I'm thinking my best option is to postpone this particular date but I still want to chill with her on Saturday. I think as long as I take charge of the situation this week and let her know about the change of plan, I'll be fine. I'm already planning to meet her at a local BART station (SF Bay Area), so that makes things really easy. 

I'm thinking instead of a bike ride, maybe I'll ride the train with her into the city and go to an art museum (she was an art history major). There are plenty of places to hang out indoors in SF.

So Seddit, any ideas for this potentially rained-out date? General suggestions?

**UPDATE:** I went up to her and told her about the possible rain. She still wanted to go biking most, but was also down with my SFMOMA suggestion. Given that the weather report is never surefire, I suggested we play it by ear and that I'd just give her a call on Saturday to figure things out. She easily gave me her number, and suggested I could have already found her on Facebook, but I said I didn't want to stalk her *that* much. Overall, things are looking pretty great. Thanks for all the help guys!"

I tried grad school after getting my BS in Bio (done with the classes, needed to write my thesis but lost complete interest due to my advisor being a complete airhead and not knowing anything about anything), which was a fail.  Let a girl ruin my life this past summer and, along with having to be hospitalized due to being suicidal (which I recognized and made someone take me) and kidney stone complications that lasted half a year, I lost everything.  I had to file bankruptcy due to losing my internship that paid quite well and bills were due.  Moved back in with my parents and now I get to listen to my mom ask me every day if I'm ""going to get all this taken care of.""  I keep telling her there's nothing I can do until I have my meeting with my creditors (which is tomorrow, btw, and I know this was the trigger for my episode tonight) but it's like she doesn't listen.  I can't talk to anyone else about my problems due to trust issues stemming from my childhood.  I tried a therapist, who never really tried to connect with me, so I stopped going.  I tried talking to my other family about it, but it's like no one really understands what is going on in my head.  I don't even understand, but for me, going to a therapist is like watching someone come clean your ""messy room"" and put all your stuff in unfamiliar places - I am the only one who knows where everything in my mind goes.  It may look messed up to everyone else but I know why I think the way I think.  I try to get others to understand what's really going on, but the few times I've opened up to by best friends...I just get stares in the way of ""whoa wtf are you talking about why would you think like this"".  

Three of my family members have killed themselves.  My father.  My dad's mom.  My dad's brother.  Why do I feel like this cycle doesn't end with me?  Why am I letting all the stress of the bullshit that's happened affect me in this way?  Everyone thinks I'm bulletproof because that's how I make myself appear.  I can help everyone but myself.  I don't know why I can't, but I tell myself until I'm blue in the face to follow my own advice.  I never do, even when I know it's what could help.  I stress out over stupid shit due to an innate fear of losing everything (learned behaviors are a bitch) and that was just reinforced this past summer.  I have no idea what I'm going to be doing in the next couple months.  Since I dropped out of grad school in July, I've done nothing but clean.  Trying to get my life back in order.  Throwing out all the shit I don't need or want.  Too bad it's not that easy with your mind.  I would love to be able to forget this past year ever happened.  It's done nothing but destroy me when everyone else thinks it's made me stronger.  I feel like I'm the anchor for my family and have been since my dad died.  I never had a childhood and just want to do nothing for a while, since I was never given that opportunity, but since I'm an ""adult"", I have to conform and ""find my calling"".  Too bad my calling won't make me a fucking dime and isn't respected by anyone in my family (for the record, it's Magic.  My mind just loves the way that game is played, I love playing it, and I'm ranked nationally...but it won't pay the bills).  I'm selling whatever I can just to make it by with my mom and step-dad supporting me in whatever way they can, but I hate, hate, HATE, being a leech.  Most of my extended family abused the hell out of welfare and the generosity of my family when I was younger and I made a promise to never, ever do that, no matter how bad things got.  

I love my family but I feel like I can't be honest with them about anything.  This includes my cousin sexually abusing me when I was 6, as it would tear us apart.  When I do talk to them, my mom demands I go to the hospital for ""thinking this way"" and won't back off for months.  I can't take that stress.  She complains when I'm at home, then calls every day when I'm not, ""just to make sure you're ok"".  I can't take it much longer.  I haven't killed myself because she's already lost a son to brittle bone disease and a husband to suicide.  I can't put her through that; the thought of her going through the loss of yet another son is worse than hell for me.   But I just can't do this anymore.

I rambled, which I apologize for, but that's how my mind works.  It won't shut off, even when I'm blazed out of my mind on the highest quality of green.  SSRI's make me completely numb and I'd rather feel like shit than nothing.  General CNS depressants that should help calm me down do so, but only for minutes at a time, when they are 
""supposed"" to work for at least 3 hours, therefore I've either built a tolerance to them or they just don't work.  Alcohol helps, but since alcoholism runs on both sides of my family, I'm conscious of my intake.  Talking is the best therapy for me...the problem is, I can't talk to anyone here since they have preconceived notions about what is going to ""happen"" whenever I try to talk out my thoughts.  My anxiety is crippling me and I'm already balding due to it... no one in my family started losing their hair until their 50's.  

The stress of this is killing me.  I actually just watched a Nat'l Geo docu on stress today...I know I need to control it.  I just don't know how.  I worry about everything, even shit I can't control, and it makes me feel like a failure.  Why can't I just not give a shit and do what I want for a change?  Every time I try, someone always has some comment that hits me in my soul and sends me back to square one.  I'm a genuinely caring person and would take a bullet for anyone I know, no matter how shittily they've treated me.  I've tried suiting up and going to the gym, but exercise does nothing for me.  I can't run or walk, since my hobbit feet don't allow me to go further (farther?) than half a mile before cramping up to the point it puts me in tears.  I'm no ""fat neckbeard"" (I HATE this term btw), but I've tried for years to lose the weight I need to (I'm 5'10 and 220) but I can't get below 210, so I know diabetes is on the horizon (another thing that runs rampant in my family), and it kills me that I've failed again.

If you're still reading, thank you.  I'll end this rambling with the following.  Eminem is the only other person I know that would know what it's like to be trapped in this sort of mind.  You want to know how my relationship with said-ex who ruined my life was?  Listen to ""Love the Way You Lie Part 2"".  That was it to a T.  You want to know who I am at my soul?  Listen to Recovery as a story, not a CD.  Welcome to my life.  I'm really just looking for another Redditor to talk to...I can't promise I'll be of much help to myself, but to anyone else out there who is going through anything, I'm here if you want to talk.  I want to help.  I just don't know how to help myself."

e87b2,6,2010-11-18,I am dropping out of college. Time to live life. I rant a little inside. I would love any tips or advice.,dropping_out,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/e87b2/i_am_dropping_out_of_college_time_to_live_life_i/,"So I have been going to college for 3.5 years after this semester. I started off studying computer science and mathematics. But starting this semester, I switched programs and I am now studying Film.

I love it. This past summer my friends and I watched so many beautiful films, and the discussions and excitement was wonderful. Compared to computer science, which had grown stale on me, it felt amazing! I knew right then I wanted to make films. And that is my goal.

And now I feel I must drop out, for two main reasons. The big reason is money. I am out of it. To continue, I would need to take out loans, which I have done so far. But, problem two, I don't think the film program at my school will be worth the debt. I didn't pick this school because it had a great film program, and now I feel it may not be worth my time or money.

I am extremely self motivated. In fact, I often feel college is holding me back. Don't read me wrong, I love to learn for learnings sake! But I feel a lot of college is bullshit, and that my time could be better used. I taught myself programming before I went to college, and I think I learned more that way, and I think I could do the same for film.

Dropping out will not mean I take it easy. If anything, I will push myself even harder. But I will make sure that I am always learning, and always spending my time wisely. Because that's the point. I plan to spend many hours writing, and learning the technology, and studying styles and other films. This excitements me so much, I can't wait! I know it will be hard, but it will be fun too.

Also, I am fully prepared and planning to get out into the community to start making connections. Local art-house theaters. Meet other film makers, actors, and creatives. Really get in touch with the art scene. I am already doing this a little, with what time I have.

I also know I will need to take on shit jobs. And I know this seems like a step backward, as I would still be doing things that I know are not worth my time, but I am not so delusional to think I can escape this. I have lots of skills and experience (web design, math tutoring, office assistant experience, engineering/research internships), so I am certain I could find a way to support myself, even if it means living minimally (my favorite way!). And I am certain my family will take me in if I need a place to stay and eat. And I am not so big headed that I can't at home while I get my shit together.

I am also considering going to a different school, when that is possible. A film school. My grades are nearly perfect, so there is no concern about that. And I feel if I developed a portfolio, maybe I could get into a great art/film school. I would only do this if I felt it was worth my time and money, though. And I wonder if I was good enough, if I could get film school paid for.

Really, I want to be an artist. I want to make something great. And I don't think by following the same path everybody is taking, and by never taking risks, and by never putting myself in uncomfortable positions, that I am ever going to do that. I want to walk across a desert, and then walk back.

I think I have always taken the easy path. And I am sick of it. Dropping out may be really stupid, but I think I need it. I need it to grow. And, if I continue to pursue this creative desire, then I think I need it to be great.

I don't want a family. I don't want the big house. I don't want the new car (heck, wish I didn't need any car). I don't need a big apartment. I don't need lots of clothes, or even clean clothes. I want to experience life, not experience stuff. Money is not a concern here. Living is.

So I come here not to ask if I should drop out. But to ask for any tips or advice or maybe even opportunities you want to share. Also, maybe I just needed to vent a little, and if you have read this far then thanks so much!

Phew.. that was a good vent. Thanks a lot, Reddit!

note: temp account

tldr: I am dropping out of college, to pursue film making, and would love any advice.

**edit 1**: I would have to go to college for about 1.5-2 more years to finish any program. Just how things worked out. I couldn't graduate after one more semester."

e893m,9,2010-11-18,When to start learning different language(s)?,DriderProg,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/e893m/when_to_start_learning_different_languages/,"I read Peter Norvig's [Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years](http://norvig.com/21-days.html), and he recommends (as I've heard many others do) learning multiple languages which focus on different paradigms (functional, oop etc).  However, I'm not sure at what point in my learning I should start this branching out to other languages.


**Background:**
I've been learning programming on my own over the past year or so from books and lecture videos and have used several programming languages in connection with them (some C++, Python, C but with little depth beyond syntax).


I settled on C# to try to gain 'deeper' knowledge with a single language, and feel pretty comfortable with approaching the simple problems I try: completed 20 problems on project euler so far, made console window tic-tac-toe to practice using classes/error handling, etc.  Generally I feel pretty comfortable in C# with being able to look up what I need to not get stuck when making small programs.


However, C# seems to be absurdly deep with all the .NET framework stuff that doesn't seem relevant to me at the moment.  I'm not sure if I should just dive in to all the available libraries and such for C#.NET or if that's beyond 'learning the language' and I should just learn that stuff as needed if a project comes up.


For some added context, I recently graduated with an engineering degree in Civil, but I'm very interested in software development and so I'm trying to learn all I can to become a good enough programmer to one day get an internship or perhaps return to school for a formal cs degree.


**My Question:**
I was thinking of branching out by learning some Lisp or Haskell but at the same time I feel like I barely scratched the surface of C#.  Should I stick with C# and just keep learning as I make programs to do various things using the libraries/.NET stuff, or should I try a completely different language now that I have a novice-level experience with simple objected-oriented programming?


Any input is appreciated, thanks for reading!"

I have heard both sides of the coin Seattle has more people and things to do, but the east side can be cheaper, commute shorter and you can just go to Seattle anyways.

For me it will be cheaper because I might be living with some friends, which makes the decision much more difficult, because I don't know if I should live with friends, for cheap then go to Seattle on special occasions or live in Seattle meet new people and travel to their place (leaning more towards the friends thing, its a house in Samammish near the lake, no idea on rent yet). but I am looking mostly for a straight up answer to the question, not to my specific one (this way others can use it)"
e8mtd,28,2010-11-19,My experience obtaining Italian citizenship through jure sanguinis.,mindtehgap,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/e8mtd/my_experience_obtaining_italian_citizenship/,"I just discovered this subreddit, and posted a response to a [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/dg5w0/dual_italian_citizenship_anyone_got_it_any/) that was several months old about Italian citizenship via jure sanguinis.  The OP of that thread asked me to post it in a new thread so more people would see it, so here it is.

My qualifications for Italian citizenship were:

* Great Grandfather, born in Italy in 1896.
* Grandmother, born in US in 1925.
* Mother, born in US in 1957.
* Me, born in US in 1977.

If you can trace your lineage unbroken back to your Italian ancestor, there are 2 main things that could disqualify you. First, understand that the Italian ancestor renounces Italian citizenship when he gets US citizenship. So only his children born before then have inherited his Italian citizenship. I was lucky, because my grandmother was the oldest of 5 children and was the only one born before my g-grandfather became a US citizen. A poster in the other thread said that they renounce their Italian citizenship when they apply for US citizenship, but this is not the case. Over a period of several years my g-grandfather applied, then had my grandmother, and then actually was granted US citizenship. His declaration of intent to become a US citizen says that he intends to renounce his Italian citizenship, but it is not actually done and official until US citizenship is granted. This makes sense, because otherwise a person would become stateless in the meantime, and possibly forever if US citizenship was denied.

The other possible problem is that women were not able to pass their Italian citizenship to their children until 1948. Again, this did not affect me because my mother ""inherited"" the right to citizenship from my grandmother due to being born in 1957.

The cost to gather the documents will depend on your specific situation. I paid nowhere near the $1000 cost mentioned by the OP of the previous thread. If you don't know your family's complete history and have to pay a researcher to dig it up, then of course that will increase the costs. The only costs I paid were for the official copies of documents, apostilles (more on that below), and then the final fee for my passport. How much this costs you will depend mainly on where your family documents are located, since every courthouse/government agency has different fees. I think the most expensive document for me was the apostilled copy of my marriage certificate from the US Virgin Islands, which was $25.

How long it takes for you to gather these documents will also depend on your situation. I live in Harrisburg PA, which is the state capital, so that made a lot of documents easy for me to get. And my great grandparents lived in a little town less than 100 miles away, so documents from there were not difficult either. Here is the list of what I had to track down, and where I got them from:

* Great grandfather's birth certificate: I wrote to the commune in Italy where he was born (Isca Sullo Ionio) and requested this. Surprisingly I received it in only a month or so. I used a form letter on the web that was already written in Italian to request this.
**EDIT**: here is the link to the form letter: [http://www.circolocalabrese.org/resources/letters/index.asp](http://www.circolocalabrese.org/resources/letters/index.asp)
* Great grandparent's marriage certificate: Northumberland Pennsylvania county courthouse. This was only an hour drive for me.
* Great grandfather's US citizenship/naturalization record: This was also in the Northumberland county courthouse, although from everything I have read, these are usually found through the former US Immigration and Naturalization Services which has now been absorbed into Homeland Security. I don't know if the location of these records has to do with when it was filed, or what.
* Birth certificates for me, my wife, my mother, and my grandmother, as well as death certificates for my great-grandfather and grandmother: All of these came from the PA Department of Health. Since I live in Harrisburg, I could just walk into the office and request them.
* Marriage certificate for my grandparents and parents: These were in the Dauphin county courthouse, also in Harrisburg.
* My marriage certificate: Via snail-mail from the USVI.

OK, once I had all these documents, I had to get apostilles for them. The best description I can give you for an apostille is that it is a certification from a head of state that guarantees to a foreign country that a document is authentic. Documents from Italy do not need an apostille. I requested that my marriage certificate from the USVI be sent with an apostille. And since all the other documents were from Pennsylvania, they were apostilled by the PA Department of State. Again, this was very easy for me since I live in the capital.

Now that I had everything needed, I had to present them at the Italian consulate for my location. For me, this is Philadelphia.  For some people, this presents a huge delay because I have read that some of them are backed up so much that appointments are not available for a year or two. For Philadelphia, they did not even take appointments - you just show up during their public opening hours and present the docs at a window. BTW, the hours that the Philadelphia consulate was open to the public: 9am until noon, Monday, Wednesday and Friday - The European work-ethic stereotypes hold true ;) Another hassle for some people is that the consulate they need to use is very far away. Philadelphia, for instance, has jurisdiction for as far south as North Carolina. Thankfully I can take the train to Philadelphia in less than 2 hours.  You are required to use the consulate that has jurisdiction for your location.  Even if you are willing to go to a different consulate that has a shorter wait time, you are not allowed. 

The man at the consulate went through all my paperwork, and once he decided it was all in order I filled out an AIRE - Anagrafe degli Italiani Residenti all'Estero. It's a registry of Italian citizens that are living abroad, and I chose to have it filed in the commune that my great-grandfather is from. I guess you could choose to have it filed anywhere in Italy, but I'm not sure. You are supposed to update this whenever you move, get married, divorced, have a child, etc.  A few months later I got a letter telling me that they have sent my documents to Italy, and I was now able to vote, etc.  About a year later I paid the fee and got an Italian passport, and successfully used it in the EU line at Heathrow immigration when I went to England.

Some random thoughts about the whole process:

* Drawbacks? None so far, although I almost certainly would not be able to get security clearance if I wanted to have a job with the federal government. I weighed the likelihood of that, versus the fact that the law could be changed in Italy at some point in the future and I would miss out (IIRC, this offer of citizenship was only made into law in 1992). I decided that it would be better to get it now. My sister had an internship with the NSA in college that required clearance, and they did ask a few questions about me. But she did get the clearance in the end, it just took a little longer.

* Most consulates require any documents not from Italy to be translated into Italian, and I believe some require you to use translators from their official list. This will certainly add time/expense to the process. When I applied, Philadelphia was not one of these consulates, although I have read that they do require this now. Which brings me to my next observation:

* The entire process for this seemed to be very inconsistent, depending on the consulate and even who is working when you submit your documents. As I said previously, not all consulates required translations. I have read that some consulates will want birth and death certificates of the non-Italian spouses, and others do not. Also, the man working at the consulate decided right then and there that my documents were acceptable for citizenship. They don't send them to Rome for an ""official"" decision or anything like that. I was just surprised that something like obtaining citizenship in a country could have so many inconsistencies and variations in the process. I would have expected it to be much more rigid and much less dependent on the whims of a particular office or staff member.

If anyone has any questions, I'd be glad to answer them.

What are my future job prospects?,ilikechicken23,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/e8vx4/college_junior_here_what_are_my_future_job/,"So I'm a junior in college now and I'm not really about  my job prospects will be. Let me tell me about myself. I appear to be on track to graduate on time in may 2012. I'll have a ba in economics and a minor in computer science. My gpa isn't the greatest, just short of a 3.0, I'm working harder this semester and hopefully I'll have a 3.1 and try to find an internship for the summer. I don't have much job experience except working as a cashier at a supermarket in the summers and a job at the university's calling center where I asked alumni to donate money. I only worked 1 semester there and wasn't that bad since I managed to raise like 5,000. 

The thing is I don't know crap about economics. I got mostly B +/- in all my economics classes but I really don't feel like I learned anything useful. But I love computers and technology. The reason why I didn't major in cs when I started is because I despise programming and I was under the impression all cs jobs would be outsourced when I graduated. So I decided to minor in cs last semester and I still hate programming. I wished I could double major in cs now but time and money will only let me get the minor. I honestly would love to work with computers but I'm not sure if I could even get a job since I only have a minor. And with my average gpa in economics I feel like I can't get a job in that field either. Is it possible for me to get into the computer science field? I think I have a pretty good set of computer skills. I taught myself the basics of linux and unix troubleshooting and configuring stuff. And a whole bunch of general self taught computer skills. Ideally I would love to be the it/server/network guy or whatever its called. Is that attainable? I know I would have to start at the bottom and hopefully work my way up. But I don't want to be stuck there helping people run an antivirus or something. 

I live in nyc if that helps.

e9fgx,2,2010-11-21,We are really good at feeling powerless and frustrated. We should change this.,ationsong,politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/e9fgx/we_are_really_good_at_feeling_powerless_and/,"In my time browsing the more topical Reddits, I've seen a trend emerge. Redditors are really good at finding injustices, both glaring and obscure, and bringing attention to them. If you browse Reddit frequently, this can actually get rather depressing; In the past few months, we've learned that America's school teachers can't afford things like paper, soap, or even books for their classrooms. Just today we saw a video of a kid being strip searched at an airport. I don't care where you stand on any political spectrum—all citizens of this country can agree that things like this are simply unacceptable.


But Redditors do what they're good at—upvoting. Now don't get me wrong, Reddit can obviously do amazing things; as per above, just look for the section in future Reddit history books reading “Donor's Choice” or “Kathleen's Big Day”. The amazing thing about Reddit is that, when there's something that Redditors have the power to do, they usually do it.


Which brings me to these large, messy political issues that Redditors themselves don't really have any control over. Sure, occasionally an issue will get to the point that a submission such as “Angry about ___? Call your congressman” will boil up. But, having several friends who've interned for congressmen, calls and letters that they receive almost always get read or heard by an intern, never the representative.


Being an intelligent person, you've probably smelled where this post is going, and you're probably right. And you're also probably thinking about this: Around a year ago, a brave group of Redditors, partially in response to the Tea Party which was so vocal at the time, attempted to form a political party based on the views assumed to be held by most tech-savvy youth (end to corporate personhood, Public Option healthcare, etc.). Yes, they were the now infamous American Pirate Party, a concept that was so exciting when first hatched that it received over +4000 karma, and...now? The APP Reddit is averaging about a post a week at best, with only a handful of remaining survivors.


So, does it seem like a hopeless venture for me to propose another attempt to “galvanize” Redditors? Short answer: yes. Long answer: yesssssssssssssssss. (Paraphrased from Strong Bad). But I'm going to take my beliefs and throw them out there, anyway.

Why? Because I'm tired of feeling powerless (cliché alert). I'm tired of feeling like I have to choose between the lesser of two evils in politics. Quite frankly, I'm tired of how politics has become entirely about politicking.


I think (and hope) that these are feelings that a lot of Redditors share. And so, it must be asked, why did the American Pirate Party fail, if the desire for something like it was so great? Redditors were finally given an opportunity where they could have gotten a path to power. As crazy as the idea sounded, people were setting up websites, wikis, forums, and everything else you could imagine left and right. Where did all of that enthusiasm go?


One could say that whenever an exciting idea such as that is proposed, enthusiasm will peak briefly, and then slowly dip off to nothingness afterwards. But that's easily contradicted by the continued and even growing enthusiasm for the Rallies that we just experienced. I believe that this loss of enthusiasm for the APP was instead caused by two things: First, growth was made, but in the wrong dimension. Second, progress was made, but only linearly.


Of course, now I must explain what these arcane phrasings mean. In terms of growth, consider how the discussion regarding the Rally grew. First, it was simply an idea: wouldn't it be great if Stephen Colbert held a rally in Washington? Then its scope grew, and added a new dimension: How do we get his attention? And thus, a whole new crop of enthusiasm was born around Donors Choice. Then, as the Rally approached, more and more dimensions were added to it: We need to organize meet-ups! Now it's a game to find other Redditors! Check out this great sign I made! Etc. 


The American Pirate Party, on the other hand, started out with already a fairly confined proposal: Start a political party with some decided tenets. Then, instead of adding on new dimensions, I believe the focus on tightening and refining what already existed (deciding on more tenets, a constitution, and a million revotes on the name) stifled the enthusiasm, instead of finding more and more things to get excited about. Thus, the enthusiasm got caught in that one dimension, and slowly withered away. This also relates to the progress: Sure, things happened, websites got made, but it never got to the next level, so to speak. It was only discussions on a subreddit, never able to breakout and be anything more.


And so now, I have set this up for my [seemingly doomed] proposal. Hopefully, you can now understand where I am about to come from, and the mistakes that I think have been learned from the past, similar attempt to do this (being an avid fan of Braid, I firmly believe in the power of learning from mistakes to do things better the second time around).


As I collected my thoughts to write this, the first thing that came into my mind was this: as a community, we just came off of a tremendous success with our contributions to the Stewart/Colbert Rallies. Now is the time for us to catalyze this success and enthusiasm into something of lasting benefit. I know that the focus of Stewart's message at the end was largely about the lack of reason in the news, but I think it's not that far a leap to also be decrying the lack of reason in politics.


And so to make a long post continue to be endless, I now propose to you:

**The Stewards of Reason**

A political movement, or party, or what have you, for Redditors, or whoever else, who are frustrated and angered with what's happening in politics, and feel powerless to do anything about it.


How this is not the American Pirate Party:


The Stewards of Reason is not based on a constitution of positions on issues, or political goals, or any such restrictive documents. Instead, it is based off of a Pledge of Reason.


Simple put, the Stewards of Reason stand for nothing but the following:

**Politics should be grounded in fact, logic, and reason, and should be about the people, not the politicians.**


Do you remember two years ago how the word on Obama's and McCain's lips was “change?” Yep, that didn't seem to happen. You can blame whoever you want for this, but I think we need to stop deluding ourselves, **the issue with politics is that we're leaving it up to the politicians.** Democracy is supposed to be about the people (hence demos), but I think that most of us really feel powerless. I don't know what I want this to be exactly or why I'm writing this (and learning form the APP, I don't want to define it too narrowly), besides a way to try to get back some sort of power (and not in a Tea-Party-take-back-our-government-way, either). All I really want to know right now is if anybody else has feelings similar to me, and wishes they could do something about it.


This has been an exhausting post to write, and there's so much more I want to say, but I just don't have it in me right now, except for a tl;dr


**TL;DR**

1) Reddit is really good at finding things that should be better in government, politics, and society.

2) Reddit was really bad at organizing a political movement.

3) BUT Reddit was really good at organizing all kinds of activities related to the Rally.

4) I think Reddit could totally use the enthusiasm from the Rally to catalyze the start of a political movement, or something like that, solely grounded in bringing reason back to politics.


**TLDRwasTL;DR:** Does anybody else wish we could take the politics out of politics and replace it with reason?

A little backstory:

I'm a 21 year old biological male, and I've always felt 'off' about my body. I was a chubby kid, so I always figured it was my weight. Then I slimmed down (growing and all that) and I looked at myself in the mirror again, still didn't feel right. And then I discovered cross-dressing, and that was lovely. Now, at this point, you figure I'm a cross-dresser right? Problem solved? Not so much. Once I realized that I liked the skirt (tangent: when I was in fourth grade, I remember trying to convince some random kid that I was a girl, when I was in fact, very clearly not and that somehow the world would just feel 'right' if I could convince him of that) but I started to study female mannerism, the voice, even found myself a name. 

Of course, once I figured all of this out, I was scared. Hell, I'm still scared, I've been going through the cycle of necessity, doubt, rejection for years and years. In fact, in the middle of my senior year of college, when I've taken the public subway in drag, and attended non-LGBT events dressed up, I still go through rejection cycles. I just came out of one yesterday, want to know what did it? Fucking Rock Band.

My roommates and I just bought it, and yesterday morning I sat in my room, in the dark, and made a female character. Punked out green hair, plaid mini skirt and corset. The only thing I thought at the time was ""goddamn,  I wish I looked liked that"" and that the world might be okay, despite the Tea Party. Despite the doomsayers and crazies out there, if I could be that girl, I could deal with anything.

And now I'm in the office, at work (internship for 6 months, before semester of classes, then graduation) starting to cry a little because I don't know what I'm going to do. I have to graduate soon, and I don't know if that stress is pulling this back out to the forefront, or what it is, but every time I come to these boards I always feel like such a sham. Like I'm trying to impersonate something, like I have no fucking idea who I am.

So yeah... that's me in a nutshell. Thanks for listening. Any ideas from any of you lovely men, ladies and everyone who I missed in that classic bigender model, please give me a hand, okay?

TL;DR- I don't really have anything to put here...I'd appreciate it if you read the post, actually."

I think out of about 20 resumes we collected, 3 are actually interesting enough to warrant a second look.

So, while I was standing there, I started thinking it would be cool to have monthly informal events for netsec types, which would just be for networking, and maybe a little bit of training and mentorship.  I'm imagining maybe a monthly pub visit with a guest speaker who can talk about stuff going on in the industry.

Aside from trading business cards, one goal would be for undergrads and junior people to ask more senior folks questions about the biz--what kind of training or internships they could shoot for, for example.  The events would be open to recruiters and bizdev types as well as technical analysts.

So, does this sound like something anyone would attend?  And has anyone got advice for going forward with this (especially picking a venue and advertising)?"

None of my friends/family have any corporate/professional experience and I don't want to ask any advisors/professors incase even considering this is some sort of ethical outrage equal to genocide or dog fighting or something. I thought I'd screen it by you fine gentlemen first.

eaiz8,2,2010-11-23,Am losing my ability to speak intelligently and I need to give tv &amp; radio interviews &amp; public talks.  Any help?,isthismicon,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/eaiz8/am_losing_my_ability_to_speak_intelligently_and_i/,"I used to be able to think on my feet and speak very intelligently with wit and emotion during college and even during my jobs out of college.  Since then and many jobs, I've gone off on my own to start a non-profit organization that helps kids.  I'm about four years into it and it's going well across the board, we're experiencing dramatic and sustainable growth and have a wonderful Board of Directors, generally.  

There are two downsides to the role.  The first is that I work alone during the day, almost every day.  We can't afford help at this size, nor an office so I work out of my home and we utilize many volunteers within the organization.  I'll meet with them every couple of weeks, but I've been able to structure such that certain volunteer project leads work with them.  This was all part of our growth plan as I was buried in everything that was going on and we couldn't grow as we needed in order to expand our programs.  But I'm alone every day and while I miss working with people, sharing in the energy of folks working together towards building something, it's still alone and I verbally do not communicate often.  My girlfriend travels often and we see each other and spend time in the evenings, but the amount I spend talking is limited.  The amount of time I spend having engaging conversation, thinking on my feet, answering difficult questions, speaking in an inspiring manner is very limited.  Because of such, my speaking ability as it relates to group and public conversation has dwindled.  It's more difficult to think on my feet as I don't have the experience of honing the message, the story, etc. and actually give it. I do it, and it comes out okay but could be so much better.

The second downside to this role is I have my hands in everything within the organization, I rotate through budgeting and strategic planning, marketing, the service model and all of the operations, distribution of items, running the volunteer program, running aspects of the website, preparing all of the technology for events, and on and on.  I would be very good at any of these things if I could only do several of them.  Included in this is also public speaking, especially as the founder of a nonprofit; if I could focus on this and only a couple other things, then I could excel to where I need to be and represent the organization well.  We're working to hire some part time folks in 12-18 months, get an office and secure some interns.  While that may help with the socializing aspect of what I do, it won't help with the ability to do TV or radio interviews or do public talks.  And I have a TV interview next week.  I'm not so worried about how I will look but more about how beneficial this will or won't be for the organization.  If I gave talks all of the time, then this would be easy-er.  It's not just practice for a public talk, which I do and things work out well.  These interviews require you to think on your feet, answering screwball questions, and I don't do that so often.  These opportunities come around once every 6 months so now it's time to be the PR guy and I'm finding it difficult to feel prepared for this role, this round.  

Any advice?  Thought about Toastmasters, but I don't have any issues public speaking and most of those folks are pretty young.  How do I get this back?  How do I sound intelligent again?  How can I test myself?  As is normal, there's no one around here, so I ask my other community, Reddit!"

I'd always - since I was four or five, anyway - been enamored with computers and programming, and was very introspective and logic-oriented by nature. I couldn't see myself doing anything else in life. For the first three semesters I had decent grades (averaging 7.5/10), loved the subject and soon enough got a good internship working with a teacher I liked.

Come this semester. I've been learning to talk to people, have been going out more, drinking and occasionally smoking weed, trying out lots of new hobbies. And the last thing I want to do now is sit in front of a computer and code every single day. I can't stand learning about processor architectures and data structures. I've unsubscribed from all of the many CS blogs and forums I used to follow religiously, and often get annoyed at my friends' talk of this or that programming language or library or whatever it is. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy coding every now and then and wouldn't easily let go of my Linux box, but I'm becoming more and more certain that this is not what I want to do every day of my life.

I'm not sure what I'm going to do if not this. I enjoy writing and sometimes think that'd be an ideal career, but our Languages course (what's equivalent to English) places heavy emphasis on local literature, which I generally loathe, and it's hard to make a living as a writer. Other Humanities seem either dull (History) or unprofitable (Philosophy). I dislike hard maths and EE. Plus, there are several advantages to graduating in Computer Science, the most notorious being, for me, the ability to get a job quickly anywhere in the world (I'm considering emigrating after college).

I'm confused and unsure about what to do. My school doesn't have minors, though we can with a bit of luck get a spot in a class from another course. Furthermore, even if I decide to change my course, I wouldn't be able to do that until 2012. Has anyone been through something similar? My dad changed majors twice and ended up graduating in a course he didn't like and working on a job he hated until he died. I'm afraid of ending up like that.

I recently applied for an internship and have my interview on December 1st with a pr/marketing firm. It's only 10-15 hours a week but it's unpaid and I already work 35-40 hours a week.

ec05e,14,2010-11-26,I've made a huge mistake... ,mindfield,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ec05e/ive_made_a_huge_mistake/,"About 6 months ago, I broke up with my live-in girlfriend (let's call her Maria), ending an almost 5 year old relationship. We were each other's first love. We had been there for each other's high and low moments, gone together for a great trip in Europe, and gave each other a shoulder to lean on when things were rough. And things did occasionally get difficult for both of us, as we were both studying; I was studying for an English major (groan), and she was studying to become a physician. Obviously I had to make some sacrifices for her, as she did not always have time to spend on couple's stuff (read: intimacy). As some of you might know, studying becomes a huge part of your life when you want to be a doctor, and as exams came closer, some things had to be increasingly de-prioritized. Intimacy didn't use to be a problem, but it definitely became one for me in the last year of her doctorate.

Where things changed was around last October, where I met a younger girl (I'm 26, Maria is 23, and ""Evelyn"" is 21) at the call center where I work. Evelyn, who also had a boyfriend at the time, stirred something in me that had gone dormant for a while; call it passion, lust or whatever (mid-life crisis?). Something clicked between us, and we went from just friends to... well, I did some things with Evelyn that I'm not proud of today. Yes, I cheated on Maria. I rationalized it by telling myself I was getting something from Evelyn that I couldn't get from Maria, namely an escape from the tediousness of getting home from work and doing house chores while Maria studied intently. I kept all of this safely hidden from Maria, justifying everything by convincing myself Maria had enough stress to deal with (Trichotillomania, exam stress, psoriasis) without my needs getting in the way. And while I'm typing this, I fully realize how selfish, uncommunicative and twisted I must sound. If I could go back, I would have done things differently... but there's more.

Evelyn wanted to give her own relationship a shot, even after what we'd done, and left out of state to live with her boyfriend last December. We lost contact for several months, and during this time, I struggled with the decision to break up or not with Maria. On the one hand, Maria had motivation, intelligence, great chemistry with me and a long-established comfort level. On the other hand, I had cheated on her. Maria could feel me slowly withdrawing away from her, and when she had to make the decision of choosing where she would do her internship, I admitted I wouldn't come with her for the ride. This broke her heart, and I felt like shit, which is obviously fully justified. We both moved out when the lease ended, and kept in touch (first once a week, then once every two weeks, and now it's been more than a month since we spoke).

Fast forward to July. Evelyn came back to town, and after we became friends again, she broke up with her boyfriend. Now that we were both single, we decided to try dating seriously. However, I had the feeling from the very start of the relationship that it just wasn't going to work. Thoughts of regret returned again and again, while I was doing the dishes, taking a shower, walking to work... I wasn't happy. About two weeks ago, while surfing on Facebook, I glanced at Maria's photo. She had told me previously over the phone that she was dating someone, but it didn't really sink in until I saw her Facebook status updated (silly, I know). Coupled with seeing her beautiful smile in her Halloween costume, everything I felt bubbled to the surface and I sobbed for a while... that night, I squabbled with Evelyn over some petty crap, and broke up with her a few days later.

Now, I can't get Maria out of my head. We were great together, and I would *never* have imagined me doing anything like cheating on her before the last year of our relationship. I loved her, and I'm sure I still do, despite the fact that I betrayed her trust. I obviously don't deserve her (she's a **doctor**, I'm a *""/$%""?* supervisor in a call center with no clear career path), and I've taken her for granted. I've even considered writing a letter to gauge how well she would take the suggestion of trying to renew our relationship.

Be honest with me: am I a sick and twisted individual? And what the hell do I do now?

tl;dr: I thought the grass was greener on the other side, cheated and broke up with my first long-term girlfriend. 6 months later, I realize I fucked up the only **real** thing I had going in my entire life.

EDIT:  Thanks for your feedback everyone. I'll give it a single shot in person; we've been talking about me going to see her new place a few months ago, so I may take her up on that offer. At least I'll have closure if she doesn't want me back.

I know this is not the place for career advice but I thought I'd give it a try knowing that folks here are probably million times better than the career advisers at my school anyway..

The short story here is that I wasn't really committed to graduate studies until very recently. I have just took the GRE and got 1480/1600. I know this isn't a perfect score but I think I might try my luck to chase after some dream schools (MIT, Princeton, CalTech) to pursue something that I am actually interested in.

Here's where the problem comes in, the engineering curriculum in Canada (University of Alberta) really didn't expose me to much research. It was mostly a lot of course-work, and my summer breaks have been occupied by internships at companies rather than helping out with research with professors. I really don't have a good grasp of what would be a good engineering topic/field to pursue for graduate school. All I know currently is that I am fairly interested in chemical engineering fields that have industrial application possibilities rather than biochemical fields of the discipline.

I am just wondering if anyone have any recommendations on school, programs, or professors, I would greatly appreciate any advice! Thanks Reddit!!"

I'm not really looking for a relationship right now; I'd much rather focus on my schooling/getting an internship, so I want to keep things between us at a friends level. However, after I made that joke, she has seemingly become enraged over what I can only guess is a disregard for her feelings, and has stopped responding to my texts/phone calls. I sent her some apologies via text, which I can only assume she has received. 
So, how do I make her calm down? I admitted the fault was on my end, so do I just wait it out? 

EDIT: So we had a talk again, where I told her I wanted us as just friends. She took it fairly well this time, didn't cry or anything- just disappointed.

As much as I love my current job and the challenges I deal with right now, the things that are getting to me are the pay and the area I live in.

Experience wise, I'm pretty much fresh out of college; I graduated last December with a B.S. in Computer Science. I got my current job in April, so I've been there about 8 months. My friend left to move to another country to teach English, and he recommended me to take his position. Although I've felt like I haven't contributed a lot, I've heard that I picked it up much quicker than they thought I would and I'm a permanent employee now (I was originally on a 3 month probationary period, after which you would either become a permanent employee or let go depending on performance).

The pay, well...it's well below the starting average salary of a typical programmer, I guess. It's still double per hour what I was making before, but bills are starting to add up and it's getting harder and harder to pay things off.

The commute is alright. It's 30 minutes each way, and I don't mind driving. I live in a town of about 14000 in Ohio, though, and my job is in a smaller town of about 9000. It's an hour from a major city, so having a decent social life is shot to hell. My town is so bad that my girlfriend doesn't want to visit me. Probably one of the worst decisions I've made, but eh, hindsight is 20/20 and I needed to move fast.

**What's keeping me here**

One is the lack of experience that I have. I think I want to stick around for a while longer, if only to say on my resume ""Hey, I have two years of experience here!"" I do think I have what it takes to survive out there, but I'm not sure how to articulate it without that time period of experience to back it up.

Another is that I kind of feel obligated to stick around for a while. I don't think they expect me to stay there forever, as I've expressed quite a bit how crappy the area is. I would feel like *that guy* that hops from job to job every month with no regard towards people. I don't feel like I'm like that, and this job is certainly keeping me well-challenged that I feel it's worth sticking around just to overcome those, but it's getting harder for me to justify staying here.

One other is that my skill set is still fairly narrow. We primarily do a lot of C# work, with some C++/CLI and SQL mixed in there (our software deals primarily with data management). So I would say I'm comfortable working in C# or CLI. I've done Java and Perl before, but the last time I touched them for real work was about 4 years ago at an internship. I feel that I should stay around and work in it longer to get a better grasp of things and learn new tricks that I haven't figured before.

**Things I think I should do/I am doing right now**

I'm in the middle of designing a side project of mine to teach myself some TDD principles and unit testing in C#, as well as working with SQLite and NSIS. Right now, I have some UIs drawn up...need to flesh out some classes before I make up some tests for them. Hopefully I can put this on my resume or something once I get a few releases out.

I think I should also determine if I can get a pay raise just yet. That might keep me a bit happier for a bit (and help with my bills while I'm there), but it doesn't change the area that I live in. I'm not very finicky with money, though, so this isn't something that comes to mind very often, and when it does, I usually try to put it in perspective compared to what it was before I got this job.

My lease is up in June, so I've been making a few glances at Dice and such looking for jobs postings with my current skill set and experience. I've been tempted to apply to a few to see what happens, but I can't help thinking what happens if they ask the question ""When do you want to start?"". I can't really start till sometime after mid-June, because that's when my lease ends here, so that might really screw me out of a job offering if I do it now. On the other hand, the market might be much different in March, for better or worse, when I really start looking again.

tl;dr: Job is great, but the pay and the area I live in suck. I want to move on to a bigger city with better pay, but I'm not sure when it's a good time. Lease is up in June...need guidance on what to do and when to apply for jobs."

Around 2005, I was on an international student visa doing my masters in CS in the US. It was all going smooth for the first one and a half semester until I decided to get lazy, cheat and majorly mess up my GPA. I got an F for cheating. My GPA dropped drastically to the point where I couldnt graduate if I didnt get my GPA above 3.0. Since it was internship time, there was no way anyone would hire me without looking at my Academics and noticing the drop in GPA.

Since GPA is weighted average and I needed to graduate as I couldnt afford tutition for an extra semester(private college), 
I decided to man up...took a few risks by taking subjects with held more credits. Ensured that I bagged an A- atleast in the next two semesters for every course taken. Did an internship simultanesouly for the next two semesters. 
Started applying for jobs like a maniac because I had to recover the money invested in my education. I calculated that I had spent alomst 54 hours interviewing (i.e face to face or onsite interviews AND not including phone interviews) 
Ended graduating in time(did well academically thereafter), also had three job offers. Ended up taking the most money making job(obviously). Recovered the money for my education in about 2 yrs.

MY point being I never knew I could actually work so hard and succeed, until I fucked up.

Ask away any questions,if you are in a similar situation and need the motivation to do better. Just thought Id share my experience.

TLDR: international student studying in the US. Fucked up and got an F on a subject. GPA dropped and had a good chance of not graduating. Ended up graduating and bagging a good job.

I've never made a resume before and I'm having a terrible time.  I started as an intern at a large company during my senior year of school, a position I got without a resume.  Now it's ~3.5 years later, two promotions later, intern to staff &amp; staff to senior accountant, and I think it's time to look for something else.  I have a couple positions in mind, but both are out of state, so I'm looking for something that will pop and possibly get me relocation.

I'm close to going to one of the websites that make a resume for you, but I thought I'd start here and see if I can pay someone who needs it more than one of those companies.  Most of the resume help I've seen on here is for IT positions and not really accounting/business.  I'm looking for someone with some accounting experience that can put it into resume form.  The experience I have is extensive for only being out of school 3 years, I'm just having trouble expressing it.  Both companies are looking for someone with Oracle experience, and without directly saying 'I know my shit' (or should I? lol), I'm not sure how to explain in a resume I know more than most.  

Probably what I need is someone to take a data dump/novel I write about what I do/have done and make it understandable.

Eventually he confided in me that after he dropped acid mid August, he started experiencing super powers, and he believed he had achieved Nirvana and become a prophet. He had a period of 4 weeks where he lived a perfect life and used his super powers (mainly ability to make the ""correct"" decision in daily scenarios) to live the happiest part of his life thus far. 

His visions or sixth sense would communicate to him through objects or paths in life that would ""shimmer"" or ""glow"" brighter than other objects, for example one path of a fork would shimmer and therefore would be the right one to take, or he would think about saying two things and one thought would ""shimmer"" in his head, and it would be the appropriate thing to say in that social situation. 

Anyway, after this 4 week period of nirvana, my friend was ""tested"" by his powers: there were two ATMs (in prague, now). One with a long line, and one with no line. The ATM with the long line was shimmering, but my friend chose the one with no line out of impatience. From this point on, he claims his powers abandoned him and changed/not to be trusted. He says that his powers changed from telling the future into being able to tell when people were being dishonest to him. He then began obsessed with the idea that his landlord was ripping him off (being dishonest). His investigations for proof to back up his hunch led to him and his roommates all being evicted, and losing a lot of money. 

At this point, he was in Prague, more or less broke, and everybody he knew was mad at him (landlords, roommates). He felt he had abused his powers and taken them for granted, failed at his purpose. This is when he jumped off a bridge. He survived and a woman took him to a mental hospital, his parents went to Prague to bring him back. 

He's been seeing a psychiatrist and says he's being forced to take a lot of medication (didn't say what type), but that he still believes he can fix his situation, by following the last true vision he had, which was to be in Barcelona two nights ago to find this girl he barely knew (""the love of his life"") and then everything would be okay again. 

Hanging out with him two nights ago, trying to tell him things would be okay and that he could live without super powers, and he freaks out, begs me to borrow a grand, and drives off. My friend and I follow him home, see his parents throw him into the car and drive him somewhere very fast.

Found out today from his mom he's in a voluntary mental facility where they can monitor his medication. 

Pretty worried about him, he's my best friend, been so for like 13 years now (we're 20). Is there any coming back from an incident like this? I know that there hasn't been a lot of research on acid, but some internet research shows that similar stories are not unheard of. 

My friend was super charismatic, extremely intelligent, and shaping up to be a really successful person in general (was making a lot of money at a banking internship up in Boston, doing well at school, varsity athlete at his university, etc). Anybody have any advice? 

Also relevant, I saw him before school started (before he left for Prague) but after he dropped acid. He told me he dropped and that it was an amazing experience during which he ""philosophized about life intensely"" and helped him figure out how to live a better life. This past week he admitted that he already believed he had powers at that point, and was just too afraid to tell anybody because they would think he was crazy. Also this was during the period of time where he was listening to his powers and everything was going perfectly. 

**TL;DR Best friend dropped acid and believed he was a prophet with superpowers. Went abroad, attempted suicide and is now diagnosed with schizophrenia in voluntary a mental institution.**"

 I'm a college student on my last year and something has been bothering me. I've been working at my current job for about 2 years and 3 months now and now that I'm updating my resume, I believe my title doesn't accurately reflect what my job actually entails. My title is IT Support Intern, but I'm told to call myself an IT Specialist (because who listens to interns).

I am the only IT person at this local branch of the company so almost all IT related tasks fall to me. I do basic computer work like troubleshooting hardware, software, and networking problems. I am in charge of all the purchasing and set up of new equipment. We have 3 local servers, used mostly as file servers that I built and maintain. We also have a physical firewall which I update, and configure. We also make use of about 12 different machines with embedded windows xp computers in them which I am in charge of maintaining. The kicker is that I'm very loosely managed. I am submitted a list of problems and their perceived severity levels and I'm let loose to fix them in any way I deem pragmatic.

Does this all apply as Support or do my duties go beyond that? I'm trying to create the best resume I can for future jobs when I graduate and I would greatly appreciate any help on how to best represent the job I currently do in this format. Thank you for your time."

EDIT: I'm having a lot of fun doing this and I'll keep it us as long as the questions keep coming! The most commonly asked question seems to be: where/how do I get a job? Hollywood is not open or closed: Hollywood is competitive. This means beyond knowing a craft you MUST market yourself. The best ways to do that are to network at events (www.lafcpug.org for example) and to create and advertise a demo reel or other samples of your work.  Film is a people industry. You don't have to come with contacts but you have to TRY and make new ones all the time. A film school's biggest contribution to your career is a social network (and bunch of debt).  You are a billion times more likely to get work from fellow students, people you meet at meetings, people you intern for, than you are from craigslist, mandy, or reality staff.  Once you've got a network, you rarely even need to 'apply' for work.  Instead, you make calls to see what work is available among your network. Since everyone has to do this, it gets less awkward to ask for work from your friends as you become more comfortable with the life style. "

I’ve seen you guys help a lot of people and bring a ton more through some tough times.  This is a throwaway account but I was hoping you guys might hear me out and possibly have some leads in the right direction for me.  Here’s my sob story:

I started out as a pre-med student in college but by Junior year I decided that it wasn’t for me (too much time for schooling and a lot more money than I could ever afford).  I have been a long time animal lover and decided that it was my calling to help animals and teach everyone about their conservation and care.  I have done some AMAZING work in internships from hand feeding sharks to helping rehabilitate boat-strike sea turtles.  Sounds great right? Here’s the problem: I can’t find a job.  I went to a pretty respectable school and got a still respectable degree.  However, my parents continuously hound me that I’ll never find work in exotic animal care and that I’ve essentially screwed my life up by not going to med school.  I hear it on an almost daily basis.  Now I have some intense student loans breathing down my neck as well as my parents saying “I told you so”.  

I live in the Toledo, OH area and am looking (hoping) to relocate to the Chicago area.  I have applied to almost all of the veterinary clinics I could think of, applied to zoos in both areas, I’ve even checked out animal shelters.  I know that I’m fresh into the real world (23 years old) but I need some glimpse of hope that I won’t be working a minimum wage job at a bakery for the rest of my life.  The anxiety of upcoming crazy payments on student loans, the berating my parents give me every day, and the thoughts of regretting my college decision are sending me down a pretty bad path.  

I know that the economy is terrible right now and the unemployment rate in Ohio is awful, but I am determined to do what I love and to make it through this transition.  I’m in need of some advice, Reddit.  Anyone in this line of work?  Anyone know anyone or have any connections  in/around Toledo or Chicago who works with animals who might be able to help a fellow redditor out?  Advice on the college/real-world transition?  I could really use some positivity in my life.  Thanks, Reddit.

tl;dr: I’m a college graduate who dropped out of a pre-med program and having a difficult time finding a decent job working with animals (preferably exotic animals).  In need of advice on job searching in this field and life transitions.

I was wondering if anyone could recommend a good place online/course, book, or software where/with which I could learn basic HTML with the ability to maybe progress as my comfort level continues.  I have tried registering for it at my University but unfortunately it doesn't fit into my schedule at all there are only two classes :( .  Would Reddit University help or is their anything Akin to Reddit's own [Carl Harold programming course](http://www.highercomputingforeveryone.com/) ?  Why do I want to learn you ask? 
 &gt; * First I am just plain curious.  I think it would just be cool to learn and to know.
 &gt; * Second, My internships with various companies have me on social media sites but recently I have also been doing basic web analytics for our site and e-mails.  In order for me to better grasp what is going on I feel like an HTML foundation would be key.
 &gt; *Third, while our site was designed in Wordpress (which I also need to learn so any tips would be awesome)  I want to better understand what I perceive to be the fundamentals a la HTML.  
 &gt; * I'm also interested in Search Engine Optimization and again I think HTML knowledge is probably a must. (Or am I wrong? please help)
 &gt; * Our mass e-mails will be written and designed in MailChimp, and even though, from what I have read at least, coding for HTML sites is different than coding for e-mails.  I'd still like to learn the language so to speak. Please help, Thanks!

P.S.  I'm actually a Nutrition and Food Science Major hoping to get my Master's in Biochemical and Molecular Nutrition BUT I've been doing basic marketing for Microsoft, Fuel TV, a Nutrition Diet company and now recently a Sports Nutrition company founded by my professor.  Essentially, I've found it really fun and want to see how far I could go with this.  While I'm not a marketing major I feel like my experience especially with this most recent startup could really make me a decent candidate for some type of Web Marketer, analyst, or maybe even SEO writer if I ever get there."

We are both in our early twenties and she has already expressed the desire to get married and have kids together. 


I guess my question is this.. How do I gently end a relationship with someone who is so attached? Should I wait until she is about to leave? (she's not leaving for another 4 months) Should I go along with the pen pal relationship for a while in order to allow her to get situated and feel secure in her new peace corp country before breaking up by letter?  


EDIT: I have already mentioned that a long term + long distance relationship doesn't appeal to me. She just disagrees, saying that her brother (who is doing 2 year internship in another state) and his wife are doing fine. Before I man up and put my foot down, should I suggest an open relationship?

Sorry for seeming so clueless. I just don't have a whole lot of experience with dumping girls that I still like a whole lot.  Thanks for everyone's advice. "
